as a retired truck driver of 40 years i never though i would end up playing a game about truck driving but i find it a pleasing experiance when i can travel the european roads which i traveled daily the experiance is so realistic i would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a european trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job congratulations scs you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal ai

#####

 been playing ets 2 for 2years now im a 67 year old retired now  bus and lorry driver so for me its getting back behind the wheel doing something i love  done 944 hours so far this game has kept me sane would certainly recomend

#####

this game is meditation the thoughtcleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated occasionally poor ai choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ets2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day and if thats not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine

an alternate title for this game could be zen and the art of logistics

#####

you know it honestly feels like a joke at first theres thousands of games out there  some offer compelling storylines others offer nonstop thrills and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life and then theres euro truck simulator 2 which unsurprisingly is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of europe okaaaay 

to emphasise the absurdity of things you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop thats taking place here you pick a job from a list of options in your area you go and hitch up your cargo then you slowly trundle towards your destination taking into account every road law and speed limit and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and neverending strips of asphalt after dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 realtime minutes you drop off the cargo  and do the whole thing again

suffice to say then that this isnt for everyone theres a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph if you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off youre instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your xaxis sensitivity for well something the tutorial then doesnt help matters basically stemming down to telling you just drive the truck and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place 

yet give it a chance to get things rolling and  amazingly and most crucially  it really works theres a bunch of reasons why this is the case that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig for one theres an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background with the satnav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination its surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing 

secondly theres the option to turn on your own music while driving or even tune in to actual radio stations across europe set one of these up and hit the perfect moment where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees and it all just feels right heck take my word for it when i say that having acdcs highway to hell blasting out your speakers as youre racing down the road at max speed is something thats hard to beat if youre daring you can even pop a video or tv show up in another window and zone out but just like real life the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this still its fun to try in the game that is 

theres also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel while it takes way too long if youre not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt so much so it actually gets a little frustrating you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause suddenly youre busy plotting out an empire trucks roaming across all of europe and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account you can even make the core game more complicated if youre that way inclined an automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice but theres nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy the choice as they say is yours

its also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up  from the big changes to the little tweaks theres a lot you can bolt on to the base experience whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles theres a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck  because theres something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant bb8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space while not offered in the game or mods themselves and i cant say i tried this myself theres also means out there to take things online hitting the road with truckers all over the world chances are youll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere but hey whatever floats your boat 

in the end whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take whats on offer euro truck simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road its the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesnt appeal and thats what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at

i accidentally hit a truck of a turkish player and he started to scream at me in turkish he then started to chase me from calais to duisburg and eventually made me crash my truck and get 100 damage overall id rate this game a solid 810

#####

wish i wrote this review years ago but being the hardcore gamer i am i decided to play the game instead xd

i was just like any other person why should i buy a truck game its neither exciting nor does it have any story but as it was on sale i decided to buy the game and see for myself 

i played the singleplayer got used to the physics made myself some nice money and built a trucking empire then i found out there were mods

and that was the end of my life outside i just installed everything that was 5 star rated and used by many people there was just something satisfying about this game i used to spend hours playing and listening to the internet radios in the game 

and it just went further downhill as i discovered a multiplayer mod i made so many friends to this day im greatful that i played this game

if you are reading my review please leave a comment like it so people know that this game is worth buying all the dlcs for yes i bought every dlc they had

#####

upon a winters night quite cold
i loaded up a game steam sold
the trucking sim of much acclaim
while thinking what a stupid game

at first i tried to play my way
by squishing peds and bringing pain
where are the cops i asked myself
trying to earn my place in hell

but time went on i grew bored
id do one run and then ignore
this game that theyd called comfy truck
and then move on without a

but wait im almost out of time
just have some faith ill cross that line
but time was past and pay was docked
my world was shattered faith was rocked

well just one more i grumbled low
i loaded up and hit the road
ive got it now as off i went
soon to delete local content

passed peaceful pastures in the night
i saw a sunrise blinding bright
i guess this games not all that bad
though not the best ive ever had

pop playing on the radio
in harmony with my volvo
this siren sought to bring me sleep
while consciousness i fought to keep

i showed up docked and dropped my charge
at a nondescriptive harbor yard
just one more time said my girlfriend
tomorrow you can play again

but no i knew i couldnt stop
the needs of commerce never drop
if it be chemicals or steel
i had to keep turning those wheels

so down the road i charged once more
through france poland and luxembourg
and soon a thought occurred to me
could this be what they call comfy

if slow and peaceful is your aim
youll not do better than this game
now just real quick heres a rundown
so youre running when you hit the ground

you move cargo from a to b
id recommend quite hastily
if you do well and earn your pay
then manage other drivers days

and so with that ends my review
i hope maybe youll try it too
in here youll find no gun or knife
but i enjoy the trucking life

#####

turns out driving a truck through the night under light rain while listening to local radio stations was my dream job

#####

much like my sentiments of farming simulator 2013 i fell in love with euro truck simulator 2 and i have no idea why mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage but a select few including ets2 are surprisingly compelling
there is no way i can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab youre a truck driver and are starting your own shipping company you have to drive according to the law take rest breaks buy fuel pay for upkeep there is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game yet for what it is euro truck simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable i recommend everyone to give it a try

#####

i was going 60 in a 30 and got a fine then shortly after flew over a roundabout and atomised a innocent family who were in my way dont worry the cargo was delivered on time

#####

topnotch truck driving simulator  with support for trackir wheels and pedals this game has become a gem of the simulation genre

before having tried it its hard to see why this game will be so addicting  i suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multicountry logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers

you level up various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo

driving the trucks is a pleasure  its surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman  that said if you disable the speedlimiter in options 90kph you can get a bit crazy getting as high as 150kph on some routes a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow  speed cameras will become your enemy though

unfortunately the ai of the other traffic can at times frustrate  in some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly  dont get me started on the kamikaze ai at roundabouts either

in any case this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game  having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended and if you have headtracking equipment its icing on the cake

#####

man ill keep this short

started a job a small one from plymouth england to rennes france

put on my favourite radio station through the games radio streaming option  hotmix radio french station that plays 80s music nonstop with no talking other than the odd jingle

get cutting crew  i just died in your arms blasting out

driving down the country lanes of france at night with died in your arms playing in the background you know this game is good

i feel like you need music on when playing this game unless you like engine noises similar to those that enjoy that whale noise thing

its not a complicated game you pick a job drive form a to b get paid you can run a trucker business as well its relaxing as fk not going to lie

just just find hotmix radio favourite it and youre set
you get all the greats like queen bee gees dead or alive erasure culture club human leauge pet shop boys kate bush you know all the greats the list goes on im only 21 but fk i feel like im 4555 no offence to any 4555 year olds

got a cup of tea playing euro truck 2 with a 80s station on at the age of 21 
its just nice to play a game after a long day in the evening for a couple of hours every few nights

euro truck 2 is worth it honestly it might look sht i said that when i saw it but now look i fking love it

so much for keeping it short

#####

it helps me cope with my depression

h1what is euro truck simulator 2h1

well basically you drive a truck and deliver trailers to your destinations across europe this game is from the people of scs who made other truck simulator games as referring to i18 wheels of steel series and euro truck simulatori

h1seems boring to play if you do the same thing over and overh1

it sure seems like it does i honestly thought when i first saw this game it seemed boring when i saw this i gave the first euro truck simulator a try and loved it this game soul purpose is meant for people who want to kill the time thats worth it and love driving 

h1is it really all about drivingh1

actually yes it is it may seem like an easy task to do but its actually a challenge
you start off small as you drive for other companies and build your way up you start with the very small tasks that you can get done within the first 20 minutes of your gameplay with the short trips eventually you gain skills and level up as you go you can use those skills to help you for traveling the longer distance and get higher payment as you complete the tasks eventually when you get that steady income you can own your own truck and make even more money you start off with a small garage and youll be able to upgrade it and hire drivers as you go even yet take the shortcut way taking out a loan you pick on what to do

h1is it realistich1

yes and no

its really how you look at it the physics on this game isnt top notch but it gets the job done for example you hit a vehicle youll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision if anything youll just get a fine speaking of fines there are laws you have to follow such as speeding red lights and green lights and so on the weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as youre on the road gas and time is a big factor too its important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your fuel up at times sleep is also needed 

inote some of these features can be disabled in the future ingame but will get rid of that simulation feeli

h1is there multiplayerh1

the game alone is more focused on the single player aspects although there is a mod where you can download and be able to drive with your friends and other people

h1is there mod supporth1

heck yes
you can find a lot of mods such as custom trucks map mods graphic mods and more
although alot of these mods arent off the steam workshop you would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ets2 mod page

h1is there steering wheel and vr supporth1

oh yes definitely i have the g29 steering wheelpedalh shifter included its so much better and very more immersive

i also have the oculus rift combining it with the wheel is awesome i would very recommend pairing it up if you have vr or want to invest into it if your pc meets the requirements

h1 is the dlc even worth ith1

yes and no

theres a lot of dlcs shown off this game off the page but half of them to me arent worth getting most of them are for paintjobs for your trucks ieven though the steam workshop supplies free paintjobs without even payingi

the important dlcs are the map expansions these are the map expansions you would likely want in the future

 going east
 scandanavia
 vive la france
 italia
 beyond the baltic sea
 road to the black sea
 iberia
 russia soon to be released

all of these expansions alone will give you hours of fun for every single dlc i have over 500 hours on this game and only explored 6732 of the map ithats because i took my time and didnt rushi

h1the issues i had in the pasth1

there hasnt been that many issues in the past for me i had rare crashes that happen here and there and stuttering problems but thats likely my cpu bottlenecking my performance the ai traffic can be brutal at times making sudden stops ahead of you or cutting you off simply but this is a rare occurrence although take care as you put mods into your game some mods will crash your game at times but thats often rare in that case

bupdate as of 2019b

i upgraded my fx 8320 8core to a ryzen 7 1700x performance has been flawless ever since

performance has also increased with the new dx11 system the game did chug overall with higher end pcs due to dx9 limitations 

h1my final verdicth1

if you love driving this is a musthave i never had interest in trucks until i played this the scenery all around you while driving is justbreathtaking enough where you just want to stop and admire the scenery around you theres a wonderful daynight transition weather effects going 90kmh in the uk is just great

promods is very recommended also if you have all the map expansions

for a trucking simulator i highly recommend this game even if you have no desires about trucks

you know when you play gta and in between killing people and picking up hookers you decide hey i think ill try obeying all the traffic signs and signals and what not well its that mentality that makes you play this game 

this is a game made for germany germans come home after work and find they hadnt had enough yet so they log onto these work simulators to itch that scratch

i picked it up on a steam sale after mocking it mercilessly yeah suure i want to pay 3 for some game where all you do is drive around the open roads of europe delivering freight on surprisingly realistic looking roads wait

you ever just wanted to get away from it all say fck it and travel

euro truck simulator 2 is an amazingly intricate game everything from planning routes and properly using your turn signals to listening to the radio to watching the scenery pass by and there are dozens of switches and dials in the machine you have to manage and just keeping it in the proper gear is a challenge

deliveries can take hours in real time as you drive across a fully realized world and when you get there there are challenges successfully parking the trailer etc which through completion earn you money to upgrade your truck and your interior

 you get to choose the jobs you want and where  you have achievements to explore the entire map  you have to manage your own truck and your crew and their truckroutesjobs

its pure escapist entertainment a driving game thats less about competition and top times though those are certainly a factor especially on multiplayer but instead focuses on the journey its taking a road trip without well the road trip

its not something i can spend hours and hours on but just chilling while i drive through germany hauling a digger with some music and cruise control on is pretty relaxing and fun

im genuinely afraid of driving in real life yet i love traveling long distances and im always so happy when i sit as the codriver seat when i travel with my family

playing ets makes me experience something that to me feels as extreme as bungeejumping in a safe enviroment and the unintentional roleplay makes the game way more fun

still dont understand why not just take a real drive in a real car because if i drive 120kph down the wrong side of the road in real life i die you also have to leave the couch

anti toxic games for mental healing  i quit warzone because of this game

#####

euro truck simulator 2  the smash hit no one saw coming buy and customise your own fully licenced and detailed truck from any of the seven truck manufacturers scania volvo mercedesbenz man daf iveco and renault then haul good around europes cities earn money level up buy garages and more trucks then hire workers to drive them build a trucking empire whilst traveling across beautiful scenery with realisticlooking sunrises sunsets fog and rain works with keyboard mouse game controllers and steering wheels not to mention trackir and oculus rift with great mod support and regular dlc this game remains fun and enjoyable almost three years after release just buy it then youll understand

#####

this is easily one of the best games ive got in 2013 and will probably remain in my steam favorites list for a long time i never played a game like this before and now it has me hooked it keeps getting better

at first i was just enjoying the scenery the gameplay of driving the trucks taking different jobs and leveling up my xp so i could make more money and buy my own truck volvo fh16 globetrotter now im working to upgrade my truck and my business the business part is pretty addictive too you can take a loan expand your first garage start buying more trucks and hire drivers to work for you im anxious to get enough money to buy another garage somewhere else and start another fleet

you can not only use your skill points from xp to strategically improve your abilities and rewards one step at a time to make more money you can do the same with your drivers or choose to have their skills autobalanced

the scenery is gorgeous and there are some nice little touches of different things to see on the road and in different cities

the changing weather and daynight transformations are great rain storms are awesome

driving in europe is really not that different than driving in north america although for some reason driving in the uk made me a little nervousmaybe its the little extra traffic maybe its just driving on the other side of the road or maybe i was expecting the stig to cross my path

i play with a  driving force gt wheel and even though as a fan of racing games i at first had doubts about this game i gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game everything about the game is pure pleasure but the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well things like parking your trailer traveling swiftly but balancing your trailers loads around all kinds of bends inclines and declines driving at night dealing with other drivers watch out for the evil empire of busses and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games ive ever played oh yeah dont blow those red lightsall the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one trip

it actually is becoming a racing game as im travelling longer distances right now in order to not interrupt my delivery with rest stops and not be late which costs money or get fined for driving while tired happened to me four times at the end of one trip im trying to make my trips even faster so im balancing my loads at top speeds taking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possible putting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in town and trying to overtake just like in a racing gamebut its more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highways

its also a great music game hit the road and use your ingame radio to tune into different internet stations or play your favorite music on a media player in the background i recommend aimp3 which has a great interface and features but is very low resource

i highly recommend ets2 i hope they make more expansions and i am looking forward to american truck simulator

#####

its very hard to hype this game up you get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of europe over time you gain experience for things like longer distances more valuable cargo etc you can eventually buy your own trucks hire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuff

but basically its about driving heavy sluggish trucks i am having difficulties putting into words iwhyi any of this is fun perhaps fun isnt the right word at all

its relaxing most of the time satisfying and sometimes tense

theres something in there about small moments the moment where you pull out of the loading dock with your frozen peas or whatnot and find the highway the moment where the countryside changes and you cross borders the moment where the signs change and the language is different the moment where you know youre almost there and are about to arrive the moment where somewhere in the middle it rained for a while or got really dark or both the moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium the moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truck from a station that matches the country youre gently passing through

this is probably not something youll want to sit at for multiple hours but if youre anything like me youll keep coming back to it running a delivery once in a while because its relaxing and the moments are tantalizing 

oh also theres a multiplayer mod its all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction youll both cheerfully honk your horns in greeting then continue on your respective ways i guess thats also another moment

i am actually fairly excited about all things vr and the occulus rift for a multitude of reasons and games id like to experience with it but my deepest secret about it is that i am ireally looking forward to playing ets2 when the consumer version landsi seriously thats how much i enjoy this game

update 20180611
i have now realized this life long dream of playing it in vr with a wheel and pedals
it is everything i hoped it would be

#####

i hate my job atm  so i come home and im my own boss  i own my truck and trailer i even employ some crazy looking geezer who barely makes a profit but i respect him and treat him better than im treated irl  

might sound a bit depressing but this game is amazing i love it  highly recommend you to at least try it

#####

i went to england and immediately caused multiple traffic accidents 10  10 immersion dont go to england

#####

we recently had our first child and i was looking for a relaxing game to play during my limited downtime well i found it cruising around europe soaking in the scenery while listening to some random french jazz radio station playing in my truck literally puts a smile on my face its also very effective as an excuse for more playing time im just 25 km from finishing my tomato delivery to venice is a lot harder to argue with than i just need to kill these last few guys 

go finish your stupid delivery is the usual response

and i will

#####

my dad is a very skilled truck driver hes been driving the truck for more than 30 years so truck driving runs in the blood he drives to greece and back home please add greece to the game so i can roleplay as my dad

#####

i was involved in more than 20 car crashes in england

#####

this is the best driving simulator that i have come across the details are great the driving 
is excellent and the choice of trucks makes it hard to pick a favourite i have 1000hrs and am
still not getting tired of pointing the nose of my volvo down the road and hauling that cargo

the developers are always on the ball   upgrading ironing out the little bugs that come up
integrating new routes and cities and making the trucks work and drive as authentic as possible

not to forget the multiplayer mode which is a change from the single player version so if anyone
gets bored its their own fault

to summon it up this is just a great simulator


#####

i am a retired truck driver euro truck simulator 2 brings back great memories of my road travels the reality is awesome

#####

i like the game as it is although one thing irritates me and that is the fact that you cannot buy usedolder trucks so it would be nice to see a secondhand shop where you could buy older and used trucks from like early 2000s or maybe even older onesthis would affect the price and condition so it could make driving less easy and by doing so it would add more content to the game thus you wouldnt have to buy a brand new truck every time if you want it to be your own

#####

look at the game and question yourself why will i ever drive trucks lol
buy the game and invest 1000s of hours

#####

driving around in virtual europe while listening to the radio or a good podcast is a surprisingly enjoyable and relaxing experience an acquired taste perhaps but still a good game

#####

no other game will give you that ramming another vehicle on the highway which causes a major accident involving the 24 vehicles behind you making all traffic stop entirely as the road is physically blocked and you realize you also killed about 20 ppl as well and all simply because you wanted to look at the notification you just got on your phone for a second feeling

#####

do you suffer from anxiety relax open up ets2 choose a route put on some music  maybe lofi  and calm downbreatheenjoy the travel 80 of the hours ive clocked in this game are back from when i suffered from panic attacks this game is a legit medicine

#####

one of the most relaxing games ive ever played
when i was down depressed this game brought me peace
i also started streaming from this game and i am happy to see that there are people like me who find peace watching me driving a truck around

#####

pros
lots of trucks
multiplayer
cabin customisation
relaxing

cons
france

#####

this is the ultimate zen game
i cant get my finger on it i do not have any connection with trucks in real life neither with cars highways driving or anything related to the theme of this game but still its great fun

i almost strictly play rogue games and turn based strategy games

the gameplay is very rewarding since you can unlock all kind of new parts on your way its realistic but not so much that the gameplay suffers from it its diverse since you can explore almost whole europe i really want to see romania in it and you have access to hundreds of ingame or via internet radio stations that you normally wont listen to
france hiphop stations polish folklore etc

its just very streamlined looks very beautiful runs on almost every pc cost only 5 euro with steam sales now won multiple rewards and all is perfectly fine for me

this is the ultimate relaxing experience for those moments you want to try something else

most of my friends would look at me playing euro truck simulator and say why would you play that boring game the thing about this game is that it is so relaxing but at the same time very enjoyable 

think about coming home from a tough day at work or school just depressed or tired just hop in your truck turn on the radio and diseapear into the land of the calm 

i definately recommend this game but as every game its not for everyone if you want a relaxing game buy it straight away

excellent game for my typically violent wrathful autistic son my son is on the autism spectrum and is easily aroused by movement especially in his peripheral vision my wife and i had him fitted for glasses that block his side vision to keep him calm my son hit a growth spurt this summer and now stands several inches taller than me and as i am not a man of large stature this has proved to be a challenge my marriage and career have been suffering because on multiple occasions i have been forced to leave critical meetings with clients to drive home and force diazepam down my sons throat by the grace of god i just happened to find euro truck simulator 2 my son is enamored by it it captivates him and calms him he has only spent a few hours immersed in this simulation but we can already see a difference in him when he is making a delivery down the autobahn he seems to be at peace

h1bthe best relaxing gamebh1
iscs software is my most favourite gaming company on 18 oct 2012 they release this game euro truck simulator 2 now you probably said whaaat yes in 2012 and the game still looks awesome but most important thing is the game is still alive and getting new big updates during the year scs didnt make the third version and dont plan to do it in near future they want to keep updated their simulators ets2 and younger brother american truck simulator scs is not like other big aaa studios or some indie studios which every year or every two years release a new version of their games thats why scs is my most favourite gaming company they just keep updated both games and every update makes both games better and better they made big steps from 2012 to 2020 and they have plans for the next yearsi 

ok maybe if you check store page you will say they have too many dlcs yes you are right but let me explain it for new players i recommend to buy not the only basic game but choose from one of the bundles for example the essentials bundle you will get a lot of content for a very good price new heavy cargos new parts of europe to explore scandinavia poland slovakia and a small part of hungary wheel tuning pack and cabin accessories you can individually buy basic game plus one of the map expansions and choose dlcs packs which you want but like i said for new players is better to buy a bundle everyone can build their own version of the game ets2 has many sales during the year so dont be afraid of the price scs need to make money from something so thats why they have many dlcs for the game and then they can keep the game updated and improve it by every new update

now i should say something about gameplay its very simple at the start you cant have your own truck first you need to make money by driving for other companies choose a job from quick jobs later when you make some money you can buy your first truck now you can take cargos with your lorry and make more money from deliveries you can borrow money from a bank if you need it when your capital will be big enough you can buy more trucks and employ drivers to drive for you and they will help you make you even more bucks there is a levelling system too after every delivery you get experiences the amount depends on how good you drove from a to b cargo category how long was your trip and from your level every new level you get one point which you can spend on one of the skills for example if you want to take adr dangerous cargos you will need use point to unlock this a new level will unlock new customizations and trucks too if you afraid of grinding dont worry when you start driving you will see it isnt annoying you can take a shortcut by using mods or cheats  

did i say mods yeah you can download cars trucks graphics mods maps etc from steam workshop or various modding websites i prefer to play with stock version but during christmas i like urlhttpsgrimesmodswordpresscomfrosty winter weather modurl 

ok back to gameplay maybe it sounds quite boring just driving around a map but trust me its really relaxing you dont have any table with a score where you compare your stats with friends or other players turn on your favourite radio station or listen to your favourite music playlist just sit back and relax you can clear your mind and feel more positive if you are a hardcore simulator player like me you can set many things to be more realistic you can have realistic air brakes sequential or manual gearbox more realistic physics and so on 

i play the game with xbox one gamepad i made urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1827794866guideurl how to set it up do you need gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game no you dont you can play only on a keyboard but i recommend you use mouse for steering and maybe for acceleration and braking too depends what you prefer steam community tab offers many guides about how to set up things if you will need help with it

scs makes during the year some giveaways where you can get free dlcs dont forget to make an account on urlhttpswwwworldoftruckscomworld of trucksurl it isnt necessary to have it but i recommend it because you will be able to take external contracts external contracts are jobs which you must finish in time not ingame time but realtime so if you have 24 hours to finish the job you have 1 day to finish it in real life external contracts offer more jobs to choose from if you didnt find cargo which you want in normal jobs you can find it in external contracts the best part of the world of trucks is events during the year scs makes a few events for example at christmas you will deliver a special christmas trailer with gifts after completion you get some items to your steam inventory which you can sell on the steam market or use it in the game to customize your lorry

graphics look very good and you can enjoy the game on lowend and highend pcs too everyone can play this awesome game 

bok thats all now a few end words i definitely recommend euro truck simulator 2 for everyone who likes driving and want the best relaxing game community is nice friendly and devs keep the game updated if you want to drive in the usa try american truck simulatorb

h1tldr see conclusionh1

h1introductionh1
euro truck simulator 2 ets2 is a 2012 vehicle simulation game developed and selfpublished by scs software it features a massive game world spanning most of mainland europe the british isles and scandinavia with each of the cities being connected by the beautifully recreated road systems such as the german autobahn roads  the game also offers detailed simulation mechanics for hardcore sim players while also offering an alternative automatic mode for the more casual players or beginners such as myself

although the games primary and obvious gameplay mechanic consist of driving across europe it does feature additional mechanics to give the game a little more spice such as a progression level up system where each level unlocks new cargos trucks upgrades and delivery conditions truck company management system where you manage a trucking company by purchasing  upgrading garages trucks and hiring drivers to use them  

start the game as a driver for hire and earn enough money to build your own trucking empire that will span the entirety of europe

h1prosh1
 beautiful graphics with detailed truck interiors world environment and road systems

 good selection of trucks with a good upgrade and customization system
 various cargo and delivery conditions
 surprisingly contains a relevant progression levelup system
 garage and truck company management system

 very fast load times even on a mechanical hard drive
 live european radio streaming or custom music playlist using the ingame radio feature
 has a demo in the store page for anyone whos not sure if this genre is to their liking

h1consh1
 some microstuttering despite the fps being above 60
 low number of pedestrians makes some parts of the cities a bit empty
 poor reward for manually parking a trailer they could have at least given 100xp for it
 antialiasing is limited to only mlaa

h1neutralh1
 the games overall concept is for a narrowniche audience
 the ai needs to attend a road courtesy and discipline class although this does add to the immersion since the player will have to exercise due diligence while driving

h1conclusionh1
bgreat simulation gameb playing this game is surprisingly stress relieving and gives off a zenlike feeling while also offering a lot of other contents within the game world 


h1worth ith1
i can brecommendb this game at full price if youre a hardcore simulation fan but if not i suggest you purchase this game on a sale either way however i bhighly recommendb purchasing the urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomsub64904delux bundleurl which includes all available dlcs and expansion packs as well as scs other games such as bus simulator trucks  trailers and euro truck simulator 1

h1final notesh1
to be completely honest i didnt think much of this game when i first bought it because i did not see the appeal in driving trucks around in a game without a plot or a story i was however pleasantly surprised on how much i enjoyed the experience because what the game lacks in story being a simulation game and all it makes up for in solid gameplay excellent presentation and playerfriendly game mechanics 

the game carries with it a relatively high system requirement so be sure to check that out before making a purchase

this simulator is one of the most relaxing games ever but can also be very intense when carrying fragile cargo the scenery is beautiful when it rains ingame i get the same warm feeling inside as when it rains in real life i give it a perfect score because i just cant find anything wrong with it 

get this game

#####

its just one of those games you can turn on the radio game has an interface for internet radio and just space out as youre driving through europes highways great game would recommend to every single person out there

#####

i dont like simulations i dont like open world games and i dont like driving
i shouldnt like this game but i love it

        试问一款只能开车拉货然后壮大公司的枯燥的经营游戏在今日还有什么吸引力
        这是一款慢节奏的游戏几百一千多的路程往往需要动辄半小时或者一小时以上的游戏时间在游戏高度快餐化的背景下这款12年的老游戏在中国注定热度不高我们喜欢十几分钟一把的超神喜欢几十分钟一局的白给但是谁又愿意花几个小时重复地在景色相似的城市和道路上开着龟速的卡车做着看似一样的运输任务并且随时可能超速肇事损坏货物导致一趟几小时的货运任务血本无归在拖着半挂货车倒车入库的时候大费周折
       说欧卡模拟是硬核游戏有些牵强因为现实生活中的卡车司机尤其是我国的卡车司机的生活远比游戏里要艰难没有一趟几万块的报酬却有着数目差不多的罚款一次几千公里的高速费路费修车费和运输报酬相抵所剩无几但是这种慢节奏的游戏最吸引我的就正在于它获得成就的途径是曲折的而不是轻而易举这种成就感远远比快餐游戏的成就感要长久深刻并且人人都可以通过这段曲折的进阶成为游戏里的佼佼者建立自己的跨国运输公司这段历程也许需要几十几百个小时的游戏时长但是在欧洲大陆上开着心爱的卡车穿越阿尔卑斯的高山隧道驰骋东欧茂密的常绿树林畅行荷兰美丽的向日葵花海游走在那不勒斯金色的海岸这种不为目的的驾驶心境不正是最大的收获么
       我刻意将首发城市选在斯特拉斯堡一个很德国的法国城市著名超跑布加迪的故乡这是西欧的中心从这里出发前往德国法国南部荷兰比利时瑞士和奥地利都十分方便这也为我前期累计资本打下了基础虽然我还是倒车都不会的萌新但是里面丰富的地理知识和难得的游戏细节让我沉迷其中
       近几年快节奏游戏玩的太多了偶尔慢下来也是挺好的

i went real life trucking because of this game
010

#####

a surprising truly welldone simulation that puts you behind a truck letting you enjoy discovering and exploring europe

#####

this game is not for those who want action
this is for the people who want to sit down and relax

you are a truck driver starting your own business 
you start off without a truck using trucks supplied to you
eventually you buy a truck from here you start to really make money
buy more garages hire employees to drive for you create a million dollar company

the base game is great but i highly recommend the world expansion dlcs
going east viva la france scandinavia italia

there are some amazing mods on the steam workshop yes steam workshop
these are the ones i use

gameplay
dps realistic traffic
realistic headlight range v11 

graphics place in mod list in this order
fael environment v30
darker graphics  mod addon for realistic graphics
realistic graphics mod v201

other
google maps navigation night version
sisls trailer pack
real european gas stations reloaded

i use mods and have some of the dlc but none of it is necessary the base game is great
also most of the mods i use require a good pc but the base game greatly optimized

i play on all high settings with all those graphics mods in 1080p
it sometimes lags in cities but its not that bad

pc specs
gpu amd rx 580 4gb

#####

it makes you wanna go trucking in real life too

#####

i bought this 9 days ago and ive done 63 hours on it since and im a grownup with a job and a wife

i saw it reduced to about 350 having joked about this game quite a lot over the last year or so what you drive trucks on the motorway and thats it when i saw it on sale for almost nothing i felt like ok ive got to see what its actually like after ive taking the mickey out of it for months i ended buying a package that included some dlc for about 11 i think the next day i went back and bought all the map expansions except the recent more expensive baltic one the day after that i bought a 100 greatest hits of country music to put in the stereo yeah i know its euro truck sim but what do european truckers listen to classic rock not as funny today ive just bought the baltic dlc because yeah actually its well worth it this whole set for only just more than one eu4 expansion

that really is it though driving trucks on the motorwayautoroutehighway for hours on end its astonishing but somehow it makes a really great game very calm yet somehow also very addictive you can do it with one hand while youre drinking a beer unlike in real life also unlike in real life if you crash you can just load an autosave

the driving fines are a bit annoying especially for traffic lights that change when youre too close to stop or cars that decide to pull onto a roundabout and ram you when youre halfway round and in default settings its much more pleasurable driving in britain or france where the speed limit is higher than the 56mph limiter on the truck than in everywhere else where you have to constantly keep your eye on staying under 50 but you can switch all that off so then hammering down the autobahn at 85mph in a 45 ton juggernaut is quite something or even better flat out through town centres ignoring the traffic lights although you do tend to get crashed into if you do that and all of it in the company of dolly and tammy and the gang

i really like this game i totally recommend it the only complaint i have is that my truck ive only bought one so far has a whine in the engine noise that sounds a lot like a dentists drill younger readers may not have experienced this delight irl im gonna buy another truck soon and see if thats got it too

one thing ive learned from all this reversing these beasts requires such an innate understanding of physics that my respect for real truckers has grown enormously anyone who can handle one of these things confidently in the knowledge that anyone you hit is probably dead deserves a lot of admiration

#####

ets2 is a great game   stream does a great job with updates and keeping everything running smoothly  i would definitely recommend this game  it is very realistic  with a decent graphic card the scenery is  fantastic  being an old retired truck driver it sure helps to pass the time and keeps your mind off the world problems  i drove the famous alaska highway for 18 years seven of which i drove bus for greyhound while it was being rebuilt  it also provides camaraderie with those who i play with online  have fun  geordy21

#####

euro truck simulator 2 isnt a game you play its a game that consumes you its a drug you dont buy this game knowing that you will loose your social life but ets2 takes what it wants my entire family has abandoned me all thats left is my fleet of 50 trucks my girlfriend crys from our bed turn off the game its time to go to sleep she dosnt understand its not a game i run a multimillion doller international trucking empire sleeping is for the noobs this game recieves a perfect 1010 from me i have lost everything i have ever loved but i do have 20 volvo trucks now

#####

i like how the devs keep working and improving the product instead of releasing a new version every year

#####

after 7 hours playing this game i was about ready to give up my career as a european truck simulator 2

but then something magical happened 
i inadvertently pressed the r key whilst driving and discovered radio 

radio gothic from the czech republic saved me 
blaring songs about god knows what in some bork bork language reinvigorated my will to drive trucks in europe 

thank you based radio gothic10

#####

tldr trucks go vrooooom

i wont pretend to know anything about trucks retarders air brakes or trailer stability and ive never been in an actual truck but i felt drawn by this game i bought it on a whim in a bundle with a few dlcs at the beginning of 2021 when my mind was elsewhere in a space between nowhere and anywhere else map expansions were beyond the baltic sea going east and scandinavia along with heavy cargo pack high power cargo pack and cabin accessories

h2an ets 2 storyh2

what i thought would be a curious and sporadic dive into trucking and highways turned into many hours of taking the longest possible hauls chilling and meditating as the kilometers zoomed by accompanied by my favorite radio or a postrock soundtrack it turned into a window to another reality a life never lived it turned into driving into the unknown charting all the roads and seeing all the sights in this wonderful diorama of europe where you dont need vaccine certificates to travel

when i started i was confounded by all the options on offer theres an ocean of things you can adjust from gameplay options where you can turn a casual sim into a hardcore driving simulation to many button or key assignments and game preferences audio setup deserves a special mention with 16 options to fiddle with you can adjust sound levels of individual truck and ambient sounds finetuning until your ears are satisfied with all the noise reaching them and your brain hums along with the engine ive played this in the most plebeian way possible mouse keyboard controller occasionally and a single monitor but the control settings allow for using wheels pedals multiple monitors and even tobii eye tracking visual settings also offer numerous options for tinkering

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2457181810

the game starts you in a country of your choice with no truck of your own and you must work and drive for others until you can afford one that means only quick jobs from the market with rented equipment or you could get a bank loan i drove toiled and sweated for companies in norway until i got some experience under my belt and saved enough for a shiny new truck there are seven truck manufacturers and plenty of truck variations that can be further customized with many options and parts but i settled for a yellow volvo fh classic sleeper there was no reasoning behind it other than that i liked the way it looked and with the real adventure started it became my chill out zone and my retreat into the diorama for over 200 hours

ive plumbed the depths of the cargo market and external contracts that you can use if you link an optional free world of trucks account to the game broke many laws and violated many red lights and wrong ways while scouring every inch of the map hauling cargo the longest possible route i could find careful with the cargo one way for a safe delivery free spirited the other way just driving around enjoying the roads looking for sights and discovering miniature versions of cities that consist of a few houses or buildings landmarks if the city has any and a lot of company lots garages and resting spots neon hotel lights became my best friends

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2457181291

countryside always fared much better offering among other things balloons monuments strange statues fighter jets on pedestals old castles and forts windmills and verdant fields the game is capable of producing some seriously stunning and breathtaking moments of sightseeing in all my travels one constant companion was the games mostly pedestrian traffic with moments of profound cosmic loss of self leading to weird occurrences ive witnessed freak highway accidents cluttered roundabouts like some tangled caterpillars and some questionable driving ethics that led to crashes the only penalty for any violation is an instant fine and a percentage increase in damage for your truck which stays visually in pristine condition the game features no visible damage on vehicles

i cant remember when i hired my first company driver and started dabbling in logistics truck and trailer customizations her name is ella and shes now probably a more skilled driver than me with maximized points in multiple of the games six trucking skills shes definitely the highest earner i stopped hauling cargo and just drive around searching for sights unseen sporadically glancing at a blue news ticker telling me what the rest of my 29 drivers are doing and how much money they made  or lost due to a bad trip my company keeps growing 17 garages for now some stand empty until i find the drivers satisfying my standards most are dotted with various truck and trailer combinations hauling cargo all over europe and parts of russia the one in oslo holds my first yellow volvo truck resting peacefully he deserves it ive bought a new beefier larger volvo truck i liked the sound the engine made with my current audio settings

on one of the recent trips i stopped at a resting stop in the middle of germany to get some sleep and had the weirdest dream even a nightmare of breaking free from the diorama and soaring over the map buildings and forests turned into cardboard cutouts gaping black voids opened between cities traffic disappeared into nowhere water floated in midair and my mind kept thinking how easily shattered the illusion of the world is i awoke with a start right before two identical humanlike dolls on bicycles almost ran me over on the bank of a levitating river if this is all an illusion a scam it is still a splendidly crafted scam i ascribed my chaotic thoughts to lack of sleep not enough food and never looked back

all my wanderings and sleepless nights run on an i77700 rtx2070 32gb of ram an ssd and in 1080p60 in spite of occasionally weird traffic ive encountered no serious issues no falling through the void symptoms no slowdowns and the simulation never crashed the loading times are fast and there arent many of them ive noticed some slight visual glitches but nothing really immersion breaking i was running the realistic graphics mods v52 by frkn64 but i removed it when scs pushed a lighting overhaul the only mods i use now are fael environment v31 for improved foliage and sisls mega pack for cabin accesories and less lonely nights

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2457182009 

i still havent seen and heard all the sights and sounds of the current map and scs software keeps adding more and improving and reworking older parts visuals included yes each part is a dlc but a dlc that adds huge chunks of europe and new things to haul transport see and explore and new achievements to earn i dont think they intend to stop any time soon its incredibly impressive whats on offer in this game or dare i say way of life and its often on sale with bundles to get your road not taken started eventually we must all find our quietest place in the loudest ones ets2 was and still is mine perhaps it can become yours as well

ps i still dont know what a retarder is

im a 35 year old female who doesnt drive in real life somehow im addicted to this game
i bought this after christmas in the winter sale also bought the dlc scandinavia and going east and already have nearly 200hours of playtime on it and im ranked 33 ingame with 10 garages and a bunch of drivers working on achievements now

so why do i love this game erm well even on the simpliest driving settings i play using keyboard and mouse ive come a long way and  learned so much about driving a truck and actually getting an education about city names in europe lol 
in my first few days i wasnt using lights half the time cruise control indicating looking left and right at junctions moving lanes in time on the motorways and hitting barriersother vehicles i was getting fined for everythingincluding falling asleep at the wheel keep your fuel tank topped up too or find out the hard way when you run out and need a tow lol 
i can now do the harder reverse parking and yesterday i finally got the achievement for no finesdamage and intime urgent delivery for 1000km lol a real achievement for me 
this game is fun in many ways i like recruiting new drivers and training them in certain areas kind of in my head give them a backstory like ethan who i recruited and is based at my cambridge branch is most skilled at delivering expensive cargo he comes from a rich family that think hes at uni but hes dropped out to travel europe literally
i also love seeing real landmarks in cities like the fortress in salzburg along with the beautiful mountains

anyway so even if youre not usually into driving games  this might surprise you definately value for money 

#####

because of age and health issues i was stopped from driving unless i drove a hand adapted vehicle which i declined this game puts me again behind the wheel of a vehicle and i have spent in excess of 230 hours playing this simulator i love this game and hope further expansion dlcs are soon forthcoming the mods take this game even further i have included american trucks military mods and more paint jobs than i thought possible immersed in the game you actually do feel as though you are on the road the detail in trucks cities and countryside and yes the aholes that should never be allowed a license to drive are in the game i let the ai know that if you do things to me i will do unto you and i did costing me 100s of pounds in repair bills and fines but the satisfaction you get when you shove that car or truck into a river if one is close by is to much to resist this game is for all ages and i think it teaches all how to drive correctly the young once familiar with driving a simulator like this will have no trouble obtaining a license and keeping it clean take your frustrations out on the traffic ai and drive squeaky clean in the real world i highly recommend this game

#####

even though no one understands why am i playing this game it is selftherapy im playing this since 2013 and i got it from a friend somewhere in 2015 but i gotta thank scs for making this game ets2 is a big relief to me almost every day im taking a long route and clean my mind and get over everyday problems 

im strongly recommending this game to people who are angry everytime or those who are covered by problems everytime even though this game seems to be boring it is but it also helps you reflecting and clean your mind at least this works for me

#####

3 years ago when i bought this game i never new how life changing it would be ive made new friends ive lost friends i was unable to go out the house on my own and about 6 months after getting the game i took my 1st steps out if you use this game correctly and how you want to use it it can help you in so many ways my anxiety is cut in half im able to go out the house my anger has dropped loads and if i am angry i put it on and this game helps me calm down so if your thinking of getting the game just buy everything for it make the game best as possible you wont regret it im a new person because of this game but it will make you spend lots of money creating your favourite truck set up

#####

considering how much ive played this game i could say it is a nice game
i like the game  and like the dlcs that come with them 

#####

i only played it a few hours and i think its worth it

#####

great game sit back connect your driving wheel  open spotify and drive


910

#####

are you fucking kidding me this game puts any other simulator to shame  youre talking 24 hour long transportation of the finest fucking ikea furniture running them what seem to be green lights but in euro theyre yellow or some shit like that who knows not you youre too busy driving 60 tons of soviet russias finest vodka and prostitutes who cares what a light means

when youre all alone on the highway is the best time turn off the heallights and let the magic happen some of that crocodil cocaine will keep you pumping through the fear as you barrel down the autobahn in reverse with kilos of petroleum and wooden dutch shoes in tow

when you make it to that destination though and you back up that fat trailer ass and just dump your load all over the parking lot of some walmart in norway the satisfation you get when at least 10 of your cargo is still intact makes you a god amongst other mobile mortals  a king of the transportation ring  europeans finest

#####

so this is the first time ive done a review in a long time but wanted to leave one for this game
i took the plunge on this mainly as i got the oculus and saw people saying fun it was at first i was like how fun can it bethen i found out
ok the graphics arent of the likes of modern days but it holds up well for it ages and has slot of charm
ive only played a few hours but cant wait to go back for another blast
slap on a custom playlist out on your trucker hat and hit the roadjust be careful as you will be fined for not following the road rulesso far in 2300 and topple my tesco wagonbut still having a blast
give it a shot and youll understand why people like the game so much the physics of the trucks the feel of it allwell put together as said it not my normal go to type of game but its hellafun and glad i got itspecially for the sale price you got nothing really much to lose
if you have the vive or oculus then give this a try its excellent  especially if you have a steering wheel
to use it for vr when you download it got to preferences then betas and select oculus 14 option
when you do that go to general then set launch option put oculus in there and off you go
heres a link to a video that gives a guide

this game will never get boring to metotally recommended

hey all

ive played ets2 for over a thousand hours now and i feel like its time to write a review on the game that has been my favorite game to play for around 4 years now i play a lot of games but this one is surely my favorite although it might seem like the most boring driving game out there for some people its really not and ill explain why 

in euro truck simulator two you drive around with your truck and trailer pick up some freight and deliver it easy as that right well no its not easy really theres ai drivers that screw you over and theres laws to follow unless you dont want that you can turn that feature off the most important part of driving around is the world around you the scenery in ets is great the map is big really big and has a lot of beautiful spots you can drive to 
this game is even more fun when installing mods some make the map bigger some make you have different trucks or cars or more trailers to choose from its overall just a lot of fun 

its relaxing as well you dont have to keep paying attention i personally drive with a logitech g29 and a shifter which makes the game even more fun to play if you ask me i love ets 

i highly recommend you to play this 
thanks for reading

euro truck simulator 2 puts you in the shoes of a truck driver you start out as any regular bloke being a hired driver and delivering various things with a given truck

after a few jobs you have the option to get a loan from the bank to buy your very own truck this is where the game truly opens with your own truck you can drive around anywhere in the map and explore it as you please jobs give a higher pay so you can profit something while also paying off your debt after some jobs the bank will offer you another loan so you can start your very own trucking company you use that money to buy a few trucks and hire drivers to work for you 

there is no objective in the game youre free to do anything but you could say the objective is to have the biggest trucking empire

the game does a very good job at keeping you driving if you dont pay off your debts its game over but thats not all you need more experience levels to be able to customize your truck to the max and also acquire better trucks 

there many trucks in this game iveco scania volvo mercedesbenz man and renault all with different models and configurations 

the world extends from aberdeen to budapest but there are mods that expands the map even more such as tsm which will open up parts of italy france spain and northern africa or the scandinavia promod it opens up denmark sweden and norway

this game will probably never die all thanks to the modding community who make mods and the players who play them and the developers who never stop developing

#####

great game if youre bored

#####

the amount of injuries that were caused to families and children when i missed a turn on a highway are to be unspoken ofingame

#####

been driving since 2014 still driving   chill vibes and great places to visit

#####

it still haunts me to this day i was barrelling into a roundabout as i had a delivery to complete and ill be damned if it doesnt get there on time this lovely family was coming out of the roundabout and i sent them into orbit i guess theyll never forget that vacation i hope they are okay

#####

as a trucker myself  i drive a jungheinrich ere220 delivering goods all over europe  i just fell in love with this game the realism is great mixed in with the opportunity to start your trucking empire and to deliver goods as far as polandit will no doubt keep you occupied  creates the best trucking experience any keen petrol and 16 wheeler enthusiast will find its like im in my cabin driving my ere220 in real life it is a must buy 

after a long shift at work its so rewarding playing your actual route on a game me and my mates gavin pete especially enjoy it after a couple of beers at the local pub watching the footy and coming home wasted and mucking around on euro truck d

the memories we have made all down to are love of trucks driving and videogames no doubt u will have the same passion as us

enough said buy the game

#####

the simulator you expect to never like but somehow fall in love with euro truck simulator 2 lets you experience the world of cargo haulage right at your pc and it does it very well for the most part you start with nothing just taking low paying jobs in the quick job menu but gradually you will expand your company until you have your very own fleet of trucks and truckers all across europe

great graphics the trucks and trailers in particular are very high quality
large map made even larger by the going east dlc and the scandinavia expansion
the system of building up your company works well and as you improve as a driver it becomes easier to improve your company
its a very relaxing game and is a perfect excuse to listen to music podcasts or the radio
you can play your music or a radio station through the games menu
trucks have lots of customisation options
lots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargo
the paint job packs are very high quality and in my opinion are worth their price especially on sale
plenty of great mods and its very easy to install mods
controls are fully customisable
plenty of different cargo types especially with the high power pack and some of the skills you can unlock
several truck manufacturers with several truck designs each 
seat heights lights used etc are all customisable
has a photo mode with lots of different options allowing you to take plenty of nice shots of your truck
the devs run events which give you the opportunity to unlock exclusive content through the world of trucks website
its easy to progress through the game without taking loans from the bank which is good for players who want to maximise their rewards ingame

pretty hard to play with a mouse and keyboard but this is more than made up for with the controller and wheel support if you dont have a controller or a wheel you might find this significantly more challenging to play

the ai can be pretty poor sometimes ai vehicles almost always travel faster than the speed limit trucks in particular have acceleration faster than makes sense cars will sometimes accelerate into you while you are turning rather than stop
major cities do not resemble cities in anyway they are very small and all cities have a similar layout a repair shop two distributors somewhere to sleep and a garage
major cities do not have gaspetrol stations so you have to rely on service stations on major highways for fuel 
doesnt have different seasons which seems odd considering they run seasonal events such as the winter holiday event seeing as you had to deliver presents it would seem logical to have snow

verdict
85

despite the games flaws i find myself absolutely addicted to it and would recommend this to anyone theres nothing quite like the open road especially when youre building a business empire

time to hop into your fancy truck and make various type of deliveries all over europe a game thats still going strong after its initial release 8 years ago this is my take on euro truck simulator 2

h1the goodh1istrong community and continuous updates added since releasei

euro truck simulator 2 is still going strong considering that the game was released back in october 2012 the developers have expanded the game as separate dlcs while making multiple updates to improve the experience in fact theyre now giving some of the cities they had on the original release a major face lift like updating the roads changing the landscape and making the cities look bigger

it should also go without saying that the community for this game is quite strong i only started playing this game late last year but i have noticed a lot of positive feedback to the game especially when its through the steam awards at the end of the year and this game makes it to one of the featured categories

h1the badh1ino options to manage rest timei

something that eventually started to bother me was that you dont have a proper option to manage how long you want to rest yourself the driver whenever you want to make a pitstop hotel garage gas station etc and rest you sleep for 8 or 9 hours and you dont have any ways of adjusting the time

i understand that resting especially for a profession such as truck drivers can require a lot of needed breaks and rests but if there was a way to give yourself a chance to rest for maybe 4 hours instead especially in the middle of a job it can prove to be helpful the only unintended alternative that could be used to get some short rest would be to take a ferry but besides that no other options are currently available

h1the uglyh1iso many police vehicles feels easy to get finedi

whether youre on a job or not something bothersome that i noticed late was the abundance of police vehicles not in terms of roadblock or accidents rather in terms of standard patrol as a result i find myself getting hit with speeding tickets quite a bit even at times when im above the limit by 3 kmh at times

i cant recall if there was an option to lower the frequency of police patrol or not but if there is considering that this was on the default setting this gets annoying after a while especially when the fine for speeding is an easy loss of 1000


while the negatives are profound it doesnt take away the simplicity and easily addicting nature of this game as noted before in the intro the fact that the game is 8 years old and still going strong in the community and development side theres absolutely no reason to not give this game a go whether you play it for a few hours or it becomes your next year long time waster pick this game up and go for a drive

so beuro truck simulator 2b was a sleeper hit for me having got it from a recent humble bundle im not normally into sims and driving for me is simply to get where i need to be and not a source of joy in itself but due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews and having seen the game all over the place i felt like i should at least try it

having played for several hours at this point i can say that i find this game extremely relaxing and interesting without being demanding theres a slight learning curve for manipulating a very large vehicle around turns and backing up to load and unload trailers  ive never driven a freight truck in my life  but at no point did i find it frustrating since i dont own a racing wheel and have no plans to buy one i chose the simplest steering setup with wasd  mouse and it was very intuitive to pick up other driving actions like turn signals headlights cruise control wipers and so on arent shown in the tutorial but you can find their keyboard commands easily enough in the menu

the game allows you to turn on the radio and listen to any number of online european radio stations or add your own music files or streams to the game files if you prefer the games sat nav screen works like just about any other gps youve probably used in real driving

after doing a few jobs for trucking agencies youll get points to level up skills in things like hazardous cargo and the option to take out a loan from the bank opens so you can buy your first truck and garage youll be able to hire other drivers and buy your own fleet of trucks in time so there is an element of economics at play but nothing overly complicated

the best part of the game is just cruising through some beautiful peaceful landscapes and sunsets while out on the open road nothing like driving by fields of sunflowers and wind turbines while chillin to a french rock station just you your truck and the trailer full of yoghurt that needs to get to düsseldorf stat im not european so the novelty of touring places ive never seen is also enjoyable with an enormous amount of paid dlc available and steam workshop support youre pretty much guaranteed to be able to customize your game to the way you like it

i did a review before back then i had 18 hours playtime now i gained a lot more hours on it d
back then my review was not very detailed and  since then ieuro truck simulator 2i got updated constantly and has much more to offer by now i decided to redo my review so lets begin shall we 3
for those who dont want to read a book and expect a review in form of an ign joke  1010 would relax again

h1the general idea of the gamewhats it abouth1
the easiest answer would obviously be driving trucks bbut wait thats not all there is to know silly this game is in all reality a relax and listen to a podcastmusic while you drive simulator this game is about you your truck and an open europe to travel across how you do it what trucks you will drive what cargo you will haul or the places you will see is all up to you 

h1gameplayh1

bgame start and quick jobsb
the game starts you off as a hired driver you have no money no truck and only a rusty empty garage to work with so what do you do you work your butt off with quick jobs in these jobs you will get put inside a truck and just drive to the destination in this starting phase of the game your goal should be to make as much money as possible and of course to level up more to the level system below 

bfreight market and your own truckb
after you are level 6 or 7 which is about 2 hours in the game you finally have enough money to buy your first truck
you could also take a bank loan and do it faster this is where the game starts to become fun and somewhat addicting there you sit in your own little truck in your rusty garage what now now you can start making the big money instead of getting hired for an apple and a hug you will now be paid directly by the companies all that freight money goes into your pocket so you select a freight from the freight market unlike quick jobs you will not just spawn in place you have to physically drive to the loading spot so dont choose something on the other side of the country because you will have to drive there this will be your life from now on you pick a job you drive to the loading dock pick it up and deliver it to the destination then you will get paid and based on how you did you will get rated with xp to level up 

bthe level systemb
as mentioned many many times above the game has a level system you earn xp to spend in the following categories to unlock freight and boost income

        thskillth
        thdescriptionth

        tdmakes your trucks consume lesser fueltd
    tr
table

in addition to your own skillset your hired drivers will also level up in these which makes a level 30 driver far more productive than a rookie hired drivers brings us to the next aspect management 

bthe management aspectb
after you made some money leveled up bought more trucks and upgraded  bought new garages you should start hiring drivers on your own they will deliver cargo for you just like you do you equip them with a truck and they will bring in money at first very little up to 1000 but soon you will have lots of drivers and the higher their level the more money they will make you in the late game you will have so much money that you dont know what to do with it which is one of my biggest concern about the game once you reach a certain point you will just never run out of money you will have millions and millions which makes it so the late game is literally only about the driving aspect which is not a major problem for me but it might be for you so please keep that in mind

btuningb
as your level grows you will unlock more trucks and more parts for you to customize your truck with you can even install mods that add more tuning parts like you can install mods for basically everything in this game you can also upgrade the trucks of your hired drivers though that doesnt really do much since you wont see them on the road d

h1graphics audio and performanceh1

bgraphicsb
dont expect crysis but the game looks beautiful enough in my opinion the weather effects just got overhauled and i catch myself sitting there thinking what an amazing view lets take a screenshot of that far more often than in a lot of other games the truck models look beautiful and they are all fully licensed the dashboards all are functional and you really feel the love scs the developer has put into them i had some odd shadow bugs earlier on but it seems they have been fixed since then

baudiob
this is one of the strongest aspects of this game to be fair scs improved quite a lot here as well compared to when the game was first released from the sound of rain dripping on your cabin to the rumbling of a thunderstorm the sounds are just beautiful the trucks themselves sound amazing and not just the engine sounds also the little levers in the truck itself has sound and it just helps to immerse you in this game so much only the beeping sound when you reverse from inside the cabin is way too loud in my personal opinion i have never used a sound mod since playing this game i know they exist and of course i use them for modded trucks but i never used one that changes the original sounds but i just never felt the need to do so

bperformanceb
now i have to say my pc is one of the weakest im still using an old ati hd4650 and a dual core processor but i can get the game to a steady 3035 fps 20 in cities on medium settings if you use mods especially big ones such as the promods map or the tsm map that number will obviously decrease but im very happy with that aspect of the game

h1pros and cons  verdicth1

bprosb
 fun and relaxing driving
 fully licensed trucks
 customization
 big and active modding community incl a mp mod
 decent ai
 amazing audio
 great performance
 good looking
 full steering wheel and controller support

bconsb
 late game far too easy

bverdictb
its one of my favorite driving games and the fact that i can only find 2 flaws with it makes me give it a strong 95 if you are into trucks or just want a relaxing open world driving game get it

h1ba quick introductionbh1

i will start by adressing the elephant in the room byes the game has 2 steam awards and yes they are welldeserverd by the game for being the amazing simulator that it isb euro truck simulator 2 is not only a great experience that everyone can enjoy but also a masterpiece in its own right with such a large and active fanbase the game grew with the help of its community mods multiplayer new skins trucks etc besides the huge amount of content it has been given from the developers official content is still being added to the game to the current day be it in the form of patches expansions or bug fixes this makes my first point buying ets2 is a smart investment since the developers truly care about the game and continue to update it and listen to their fanbase i can make a quick prediction and say that ets2 will still have updates or expansions coming out for at least a year or two more after the writing of this review 

h1bwhat exactly is euro truck simulator 2 gameplaybh1

ets2 is a truck driving simulator but not only that it places you into the position of the manager of an entire international delivery company the goal of the game even though most players will just say its to relax or to have fun which is also true is actually to expand your company hire more drivers buy more trucks more garages and obtain the monopoly for deliveries in europe the game takes this simple concept and manages to add an astonishing complexity to it at first sight only because after the first 20 hours or less ingame youll realize that the gameplay is actually simple and enjoyable as the manager you can also make deliveries yourself which is how you will get your company up and running before you have the money to hire drivers to do that for you you will start by doing quick jobs for various employers with a truck given by them for the specific delivery and your first objective is to buy your own truck so you can start taking jobs from the freight market which get you more income once you get your own truck its all yours you need to take good care of it repairing it refuelling it being careful not to get fined for your actions on the road and so on from that point onward it is your job to build a strong and succesful business as you do more deliveries and manage to get more experience both literally for leveling up and figuratively because you will learn the mechanics of the game better and better you will earn skill points with each level up there are a variety of skills to choose from including getting better pay for different types of jobs fragile cargo urgent deliveries adr deliveries valuable cargo less consumption of fuel or being able to deliver cargo across longer distances your employees also have skills a feature that on its own opens lots of possibilities for company management 
if the information here or on the store page doesnt quite answer all of your questions ill tell you that there is also a demo for this game available to download on steam so you can try the game out 

h1bbut is it accurate driving mechanicsbh1

before i start explaining the mechanics of the game please take note that im not a truck driver and have never driven a truck before so excuse me if i dont have all of my facts straight from my 90 hours of playing the game at the time of writing this review id say that the driving in this game is absolutely beautiful first of all the complexity of the mechanics is fully customizable so everyone from the newest player to the veteran trucker are able to enjoy the game the driving is relaxing be it day or night rain or sun highway or forest road because it doesnt require that much focusing but only as much as to not pass the speed limit to avoid other people in traffic and to not come tumbling off the road that gives you time to enjoy the wonderful scenes youll pass by which ill be talking about in the next section onboard the truck you have every switch you need meaning headlights wipers the horns air regular light the handbrake the toggle for high beams for the beacon and the turning signals it has everything you would want and need from a proper simulator of real life driving so dont expect a truck racing game the only thing that is a tiny bit more difficult is the parking but theres also a solution for that the parking is skippable in every delivery while denying you a small amount of experience but as you gather more knowledge and start learning whats what parking should immediately become a breeze after a few hours of gameplay
also going a little offtopic you also have a radio you can upload your own playlist of music into the game and listen to it while on the road genius bgeniusb i say 

h1bthats all well and good but how does it look graphicsbh1

do not go into the game expecting it to look like it was made with unreal engine 32 the game came out a good amount of time ago id even go as far as to call it a classic now heh and i can say it still looks decent to this day the ingame world still is wonderful if youre willing to sit for a bit and think about how old the game is even if it doesnt have the latest graphics ets2 doesnt fail to impress making up for raw graphical power in great world design the landscapes in the game are beautiful and the vehicle models still manage to look good and blend into the environment perfectly giving the game a really special ambiance and relaxing potential it is easy to get immersed into the massive world and if youre not careful you can lose hours driving your virtual truck around as it happens to me quite often
but if i were honest the question here is how good you bcanb make it look as i have said before the game has such an active community and modders are no exception there are a variety of graphic mods to choose from both in the steam workshop and outside of it that do a wonderful job at enhancing your visual experience making the game not only graphically impressing but also making you want to get into the photo mode and snap some shots of your journey through ets2s europe 

h1bsodid you enjoy it my personal experiencebh1

the short answer would be yes absolutely but the answer worthy of this review is that i just spent so many hours into this game in which everything you basically do if we were to dumb it down to an extreme level is drive around and turn left or right at some points and i cant even explain why exactly ets2 just has a mesmerizing atmosphere to it making the game beautiful in its own way and being one of the most relaxing games i have and will ever play other simulators cant even get near its level except american truck simulator made by the same developers and based on the same concept because for me ets2 will always have that ije ne sais quoisi that something which always makes me come back to it and do yet another delivery over and over again in other words everything about the game is enjoyable from the relaxing driving to the sweet feeling of getting another truck or further customzing your current one to the trance induced by the exquisite feeling of being alone with the road and for that euro truck simulator 2 wil always and forever have a special place in my heart

h1bconclusionbh1

if you are looking for a relaxing driving experience with various customization options a variety of trucks perfect world design mesmerizing atmosphere and most of all a detailed company management gameplay component then i am sure you will not regret buying this game if you need further convincing please do download the demo which is available on steam

this game should be called zen and the art of logistics

this game is meditation the thoughtcleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometers along the highway cannot be understated occasionally poor ai choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ets2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day and if thats not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine

#####

the ultimate in european ground logistics simulators no other game out there comes even remotely close to matching the sheer enjoyment of driving around an extremely scaleddown version of europe that this game provides ever wanted to listen to bbc radio 4 for 6 hours at a time without getting bored fire it up and drive around germany

the mystical addictive nature of this game defies explanation you cannot describe it you can only experience it

#####

quality of the game put all other simulation games to shame because of its realistic approach euro truck simulator 2 is a awesome simulator thanks to the prism3d engine the driving looks a lot better than before anyway eu2 is not for everyone but if you enjoyed trucking simulators than youve come to the right place

never in a million years would i have thought that i would purchase a driving simulator i gave this game a try and it is one of the best games i own that overwhelmingly positive is no lie scs is one of the best developers out there just think of the trash developers littering steam with their garbage scs is a developer that is constantly improving ets2 most importantly though this game actually has utility for real life if you treat it like the simulator it is it can improve your driving which is always a positive use your mirrors properly stay in your lane watch your speed learn how to turn with a large vehicle make you aware of your large blindspots as a trucker would have to be etc the rest of the games you own and play are mostly just for fun and have no usefulness for the real worldin fact they are in all honestly wasting your time not this game though if it improves your awareness on the road as it has mine then it is worth more than all the other games on steam give it a try you will not be disappointed

best trucking simulator ever made with developers that still push new content 7 years after release

h1cant drive 55h1

ive had euro truck sim 2 for awhile now but i remember watching the game notifications pop up all the time when my friends were playing back before i took the plunge and tried the game myself i wondered what could be so fun about driving trucks as opposed to racing games when i finally got the game on sale i realized of course 

1 trucks will be driven yeah definitely that 
2 the euro map is incredibly fun to explore with several expansion countries  
3 the paint jobs are cool to paint and paint over and repaint so many designs 
4  building your own trucks upgrading to better parts choosing models and makes that
5  hiring employees to make you money so you can  paint more trucks for your own fleet of trucks you wont let anyone else drive 
6 the engineering marvels bridges etc around the maps 
7 the ai drivers you can shove them around and wreck in hilarious ways accidentally andor on purpose 

theres more but i need to go repaint my truck its a great game though and i highly recommend it and im looking forward to the beyond the baltic expansion but there is a learning curve be prepared to wrap your truck around the highway guardrails many times as you are learning to drive a rig unless you are an ace game driver unlike some of us who are prone to see the highway upside down every now and again

#####

the ai are brilliant they cut me off and brake check me just like real life

#####

my driving skills in real life are questionable but in the game i can now park better than ever before ive become an expert at transporting virtual cheese across europe and im sure my mother would be proud 1010 would gladly ignore traffic laws again for the fun of it

#####

its difficult to describe this game i like it a lot but if you watch someone play you might think it looks boring its a simulator that you have to play yourself to really get the feel of it while its certainly not actionpacked there is something enjoyable and even relaxing about this game

h1prosh1

i have so much to say about this game
i started out with a poor performing laptop and did not have any extra accessories like a steering wheel
i enjoyed the game alot and quickly racked up hundreds of hours this game is definitely not for everyone its very relaxing and can be enjoyed on lowend devices
ets2 is priced cheap and has a huge selection of dlcs for both map expansions cargo  customizing
theres also a huge modding community in ets2 with easy access to the steam community workshop or for  example the forum  forumscssoftcom
if youve got an interest in big machines or a passion for trucking defietely pick up this game and some dlcs to go along with it

all in all this game played a part in my inspiration to becoming a truck driver in real life

in a world dominated by firstperson shooters actionadventure rpgs and the like its nice to just come home from work and relax with a slowerpaced game thats still lots of fun what is it about jumping on here and delivering load after load or that one 4000 km load thats just so satisfying is it unlocking new perks as you level up is it exploring the new countries that continue to be added or is it trying to get that roads explored section up to 100 the achievements perhaps its all of this and more if youre in a simple mood you can just drive around on or off the job take detours shortcuts new routes see new sights theres something in here for everyone and though not everyone will get 225 hours of enjoyment out of it there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who do just like me i definitely recommend this game for anyone who isnt bored at the thought of getting behind the wheel of a big rig just so its out there i have just about as many hours in american truck simulator as well both great games

#####

for the last few years i have practically nolifed this game i can honestly say at times it does get annoying at times and  i find myself compleating one delivery a day then quitting due to boredom despite this fact i always come back to the game for more weather its the crazy ai or the thrill of driving a truck this game has inspired me to try and become a truck driver in real life and hope to be soon taking my hgv licence test the game does offer online contracts to complete if you want a sense of community it is unofficial but there also is truckersmp but i do not recommend going on tmp due to too many trolls and rammers

#####

you turn on the game turn on the background music sit comfortably in the chair and spend good time listening to music or talking with friends great game i recommend it d 3

#####

contemplating to become a truck driver in real life because of this game truck goes brrr id be a danger to everyone

#####

i accidentally hit a truck of a turkish player and he started to scream at me in turkish he then started to chase me from calais to duisburg and eventually made me crash my truck and get 100 damage overall id rate this game a solid 810

i drove trucks for a living hated it i buy this game and its fun i buy all the dlcs and its amazing the mods really do make this game even better amazing work by the devs and community  1010

#####

i bought this game and got hooked

1 week later i booked my truck license in real life

now looking for jobs as truck driver

#####

nominated for the we didnt think of everything steam award 2016 for the category best lifetime support by a developer

i think scs software deserves this recognition for the continued support of this game  and american truck sim during its lifetime so far through patching quality nonoverprized dlc and the many news updates in their development process

#####

steam has problems letting me post my long review i will edit the full text later
for now take my word on it that i love this game it has excellent dedicated devs is beautifully made and provides a relaxed yet entertaining experience

#####

i crashed my truck and it flipped over and lost like 25k but still a good game

#####

no matter how far i drive i can still see your face in my dreams

#####

gud game but they should make balkan dlc 

#####

npc crashing into my truck the moment i get out from the repair station

played the game for a few hours and a couple of days
i think the game is fine

highly recommend to play it on vr and a wheel

#####

how long have i been on the road when was the last time i ate no that halfeaten sandwich on the dashboard does not count it is not real it icanti be if it were it would surely be covered in mold by now there is a cat sleeping on the passenger seat next to me is it alive its not moving it has not moved in weeks meanwhile i have never stopped moving what would happen if i did im not in a hurry to find out

i do not dream anymore i close my eyes now and then and everything goes black sometimes when i open them everything is still black i turn on the lights but they only seem to make the surrounding darkness even more pronounced i think about closing my eyes again and sinking back into my dreamless slumber but then i feel it deaths cold breath making each hair on the back of my neck stand up as if it was getting ready to pluck them one by one with a pair of contaminated tweezers i resume my journey out of sheer terror

voices speaking in an incomprehensible tongue keep me company for a few hours the radio begins to crackle then it dies a barely legible sign tells me i am approaching knjazalovac i do not know where knjazalovac is but its safe to say it was never the center of a high civilization the ruritanian peasants living here at the height of the austrohungarian empire were probably not even aware that they belonged to one

for some reason the denizens of this godforsaken country demand fish at least that is what my trailer smells like i once stopped to have a closer look at what i was transporting i vowed never to look again

some hundred meters ahead my headlights reveal a silhouette of roughly humanoid shape i slow down to a crawl who is this furtive creature a fellow stranger to society no doubt i check the dashboard clock 0333 nary a healthy soul awake at this ungodly hour as i get closer to our mysterious nightwalker i notice hes not wearing a jacket for an instant our eyes meet his loathsome stare betrays a mixture of savage animosity and utter disappointment i am going far too slow for his purposes a moment later i have forgotten everything about this cursed insomniaceverything except his face i have seen that face many times before too many times

i see it every time i look myself in the mirror but then practical considerations inevitably get in the way who would drive the truck the cat it is useless even thinking about it maybe one of these nights one of you could stop my truck for me in the meantime i have no choice but to stay on the move i must keep moving

it seems like vehicles on the road actually try to collide with you  in this game all the other drivers are complete idiots

in other words its just like real life  1010

its like skyrim with trucks

except well not but its a lot of fun and it definitely gives the feeling of a completely open world thats just ready for you to explore hop right in a truck and start hauling freight for others and earn enough money to buy your own fleet of vehicles and keep more of the profits to yourself

its really two games in one because in addition to the fairly robust truck driving simulation theres a pretty great business management simulation as well where you can play some kind of trucking tycoon and grow a small business into a profitable little empire of trucks and drivers all across europe

i have to admit euro truck simulator 2 really surprised me with just how fun it is to play its pretty challenging to get the hang of at first but once you do its a pretty enjoyable and even relaxing experience the thrill of discovery  and the desire for a little more cash to pay off loans hire drivers buy new trucks expand garages and customize rigs  keeps me taking just one more job again and again

spotify  ets 2  a good way to coop with your crippling depression and suicidal tendencies it kept me from killing myself at least

#####

i i have never had this much fun in months 
i got this game today and i just had to write a review
day 1 mom said go find a job
found an ad for a truck driver job
called got the job got paid 3000 euros the first day

day 2 woke up thinking why should i get paid half and work using a companys truck
went to work as usual and got paid 3000 commited lots of driving law infringements ended up getting a call from the bank that i am in debt and that i have negative funds in my accounts they were nice enough to give me funds to sort things out

day 3 said screw it im buying my own truck
went to the bank got a 100000 euros loan thanks merkel and bought a volvo should change license plate to diretide soon
now i make 8000 euros a day i still sleep inside a truck tho dont worry its warm

whats next well i will probably save 180000 euros to buy a garage and hire some employees and hit the road daily as usual life on the road never ends 

thank for everyone at scs software who worked on this 
1010 game totally recommended

#####

im having fun in this game why am i having fun in this game

there is a trucker in all of us

#####

over the course of my attempt to establish a humble latvian trucking company i have
been rammed by at least a dozen brazilians on a random road in belgium
accidentally violated current eu sanctions on the export of ammunition to russia
developed an emotional attachment to my spanishspeaking gps
gotten brexit done
singlehandedly funded the polish motorway system through speed camera fines
learned how to swear in foreign languages
and listened to my friends come up with every possible explanation as to how it wasnt their fault that they got their drivers licence from a cereal box and dont understand the concept of breaking

tldr this game is a meme but i also once chose to play it after spending 10 hours getting the jersey slide on i95 so i clearly think it is pretty good if you want a more interesting experience download the truckersmp community multiplayer mod and use the job dispatcher tool

i didnt see the train  my friend shortly after causing an east palestine moment

results may vary side effects may include the obvious consequences of hardened borders on a highly integrated common market severe political turmoil that one time asda didnt have my favorite spread and a critical shortage of lorry drivers cause they were all eastern europeans with eu permits

#####

there isnt a better driving sim

sure there are great racing sims with bleeding edge realism and laser scanned tracks but none have ever captured the experience of driving on the open road quite like this 

this isnt setting track times or breaking speed records this is navigating traffic construction and getting there safely this is a real road experience and its hard to compare it to anything else

i just saw a tesla leaving the gas station

#####

euro truck simulator 2 by scs software  who knew that simulating the life of a longhaul trucker could be so oddly mesmerizing initially i thought why would anyone spend hours virtually driving a truck across europe but here i am hundreds of hours later completely hooked on this strangely therapeutic and intricate simulation

the games concept is simple drive a truck deliver cargo earn money and build your trucking empire it sounds mundane but the devil is in the details the level of realism in euro truck simulator 2 is absurdly high from obeying traffic laws to managing fuel consumption the game turns the banal tasks of trucking into an art form

exploring the beautifully rendered landscapes of europe behind the wheel of my meticulously customized truck was unexpectedly relaxing the attention to detail in the scenery is impressive and the daynight cycle adds to the immersive experience plus theres something oddly satisfying about perfectly parking a 40foot trailer

the games progression system is where it really shines starting from a humble beginning to eventually owning a fleet of trucks and hiring drivers gave me a sense of achievement that i never thought a trucking game could provide

however lets be real  euro truck simulator 2 isnt for the adrenaline junkies if youre looking for highspeed chases or explosions youll be sorely disappointed this game is about the zen of the open road the quiet satisfaction of a job well done and of course an inexplicable fascination with traffic regulations

multiplayer mode adds a social element where you can convoy with friends or strangers its like social media on wheels but with less drama and more discussions about fuel efficiency

in summary euro truck simulator 2 is a game that against all odds manages to make the life of a truck driver engaging and surprisingly fun its a perfect blend of relaxation strategy and virtual tourism for anyone whos ever dreamed of conquering the highways of europe or just wants a change from the usual gaming fare this game is a bizarrely satisfying choice

#####

i havent written a review for this game because ive been too busy playing it just look at my playtime the reason this game is so popular is because it simulates driving a truck really nicely euro truck simulator 2 is one of the few simulators that actually simulate well this isnt any of the farming simulator nonsense

now lets actually start the review here

the physics are great the graphics still look good in 2018 even though the game came out in 2012 there really isnt any music in the sense of a soundtrack but you can actually listen to your favorite radio stations while trucking down the highway using the nicely designed radio menu you can save favorite stations and map buttons to changing the station and adjusting the volume without opening a single menu 

the game is not amazingly well optimized but it runs pretty good on a highmedium spec pc i get a solid 60 fps using a gtx 1080 and i7 6700 playing at 4000x1080 dual monitors at ultra settings

the gameplay is divided into 3 parts part 1be a company driver where you drive a truck you dont own part 2 buy your own rig and start making more money part 3 upgrade current garages or buy new ones hire drivers and give them trucks so they make money for you the game dosent really have a end game you just drive a truck for hours and hours the system for managing drivers isnt that detailed but it allows you to micro manage your drivers and train them any way you like

there is a leveling system in the game you start at level 0 and can progress into an absurd amount of levels i tested with cheat engine and there is atleast 1500 levels each time you level up you unlock a skill point which you can put into skills like long distance urgent delivery and adr stuff like gasoline and dynamite at level 36 you have maxed out your character

now euro truck simulator 2 is a cheap game that is amazing but can it be even better you might ask we get free updates for a game that is 6 years old those are completly free and adds stuff like new trucks and trailers to reworks of the current map but if you want the real good stuff you gotta buy some dlc there is alot of dlc for this game but i recommend start out with getting all the map expansions they are highly detailed and adds alot the the game map dlcs adds the area of scandinaviaitaly france and mutch more then afterwards get some of the cargo dlc this just adds new trailers for you to haul around nothing more but atleast its fun hauling a helicopter or a huge bulldozer after you have gotten the map and cargo dlcs get some tuning dlc for the trucks add everything from new tires to paintjobs i own every single dlc for this game and i can honestly say yes it is totally worth it

now you might think i cant afford all this dlc is there no sweet content for me d well the game has steam workshop support that adds stuff that ranging from physics and graphics to make your truck retarder sound like spongebob yes im actually serious about this you can download all kinds of mods and the game just handles it really well at most i had about 120130 active mods and the game worked perfectly fne

the game have support for steering wheels and other extra controllers if your gonna spend alot of time in this game get a steering wheel the game just becomes so mutch easier with a wheel or controller

now this review has gotten long so lets do a summary this game is amazing in pretty mutch every way i have played for 1215 hours as i write this and i could easily double that during 2019 this game is not the game you want if you want to kill zombies or drive a car at 200 mph but if you want a fun relaxing game to have a good time with you should get it 

ets2 has been on the trending list for simulators on steam for years and i know why the reason is this game isnt a 1010 it deserves more its more of a 1510 just buy it its amazing

#####

whats the appeal of euro truck simulator 2 
honestly i cant explain maybe it is the tranquil nature of the game you drive around deliver freight you drive around more freight no enemies to shoot nothing to fight its just driving through europe visiting the cities looking at the landscapes even if you had seen all the countries yourself theres something about watching them in a game like for example i was in luxor and then serious sam came out out and it started there with the tempel of hatchepsut and the feeling off ive been there was around 

the game only has a very rundimentary management sim you can buy garagestrucks and hire drivers who do the trucking and make you money which enables you to get better and better trucks tralers and equipment while you also truck around 

i guess what makes the game fun is the slow paces driving gameplay along with the radio system you can listen to radio from all around the world if you update the list and thus go to belgium and listen to belgian radio or go to the uk get freaked out because they drive on the wrong side and you surely crash but bbc radio at least keeps you entertained while you crash the truck and fuck up the cargo 

i started out with a controller and it was ok it was llke a slow paced racing game then i bought a steering wheel thrustmaster tmx pro and  that was a whole different dimension force feedback and a wheel adds so much to this its like a total different game the tmx by now also got expanded with th th8a shifter because the f1 style gear switches arent fun  driving a truck around europe with various laws regulations and speed limits is fun while visiting the landmarks 
the missions also range from small cargo to vehicles to oversized massive machines that slow you down 

the game also gives you the option to customize your truck wheels interios and thanks to the workshop you get a ton of items additionally you can turn your truck in a massive kindergarten or just add a coffe mug everything is allowed 

the dlc seem plenty but the only requirements are the land expansions those are massive and add several countries per pack  the other dlcs arent mandatory but more cosmetical for your truck 

a lot of the fun also comes from the workshop wether its new vehicles for the traffic new truck skins better graphics or weather effects 

the graphics are ok the sound is good you definitely want to add radio stations because they work great personally i really drive with nights with alice cooper or antenne rock
another important mod is promods it adds more cities more of everything 

in any case if you dont want constant action this is a great game my definitive reccommendation is a steering wheel  the game is lame with keyboard  mouse not satisfying with a controller but get a good wheel and pedals with force feedback thats really mandatory and its just so much fun to drive around

#####

i dont even know how to say it
i like this game very much
it really gives you the feeling of driving outside
thats why we encourage players who like driving to play euro truck simulator 2

#####

simulation game but newbie friendly this game will please both starters and more advanced players although some will notice some lack of realism like no visual damage game physics sometimes not so good and the lack of random events such as traffic accidents road conditions road works and random failure






portuguese translation

o jogo é de simulação mas não é necessário estar acostumado com esse gênero de jogo vai agradar desde os iniciantes aos mais experientes embora os mais exigentes possam ficar um pouco insatisfeitos com a falta de alguns elementos de realismo como falta de dano visual física às vezes um pouco falha e uma certa falta de variabilidade do tráfego como acidentes condições da estrada falhas aleatórias etc

#####

better than my real job

#####

thought i was signing up for a thrilling racing game ended up respecting truck drivers more than ever 1010 would miss my delivery deadline because of a wrong turn again

#####

lots of fun for a driving sim  you start off with nothing and must take contract jobs to earn enough money to buy your first truck then a garage then build a fleet and finally dominate the trucking industry

theres a lot to see it is a driving sim after all with a variety of items available to upgrade and customize your vehicles

although released in 2012 the developers are very active and constantly release updates new maps and items to customise your trucks

in short
lots of roads with great visuals
variety of loads to haul
great customization so your truck never feels stale
listen to internet radio stations or play our own music
remap keys and adjust realism settings to your liking
new content released frequently paid and free
great mod support community

the downsides
the traffic ai could be improved as they can do the stupidest things but that could be considered realism too 

#####

drive


#####

its good for when youre really bored or you wanna relax

#####

i personally do not care for driving games i do not own driving games they bore me i am more into fps games and a very few simulation games only if they crossed into work i use to do for real and this feild of work happends to be one of them

i am impressed on the work that was done by scs and expected more child play and less detail of how the game would function but to my suprise they really put this togeather there is no slop work at all or child like functions you can almost feel your in a real truck from the physics in the game to how the tractor and trailer respond and handle it was not what i expected i was expecting something more like the wheels of the truck go round and round type of game and ets2 is not that kind of game

this game has a large fan base and many dlcs scs tries to stay on top of errors and bugs to get them resolve i personaly found one in the game and once i brought it to their attention it was fixed this alone speaks volumes to me

it is a single player game the basics is you run a trucking company in europe and you make money by delivering loads to their locations and can increase the size of your company by buying more truck shops and getting employees to drive for you as you level up you will be able to increase your abilities for what kind of loads and how far to go with them you can also customize the truck and trailers yeah i said trailers you will be able to buy your own trailers to use and if you get them for other shops the ais willl also choose to use them or not

how ever one tip i wish to point out that i noticed when you are lost in upgrading your own truck do not forget to also upgrade your trucks that the ais use when they are upgraded they tend to work better bringing in more money

so if you love semitrucks and the ability to run your own buisness for what ever the reason is this maybe the ideal game for you i recommended

#####

when i drove id listen to the radio

waitin for my favorite songs

when they played id sing along it made me smile

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on this game and it gets 1888 likes and 888 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 2 kilos of canned ham so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

great time sink for depressed boi

#####

i got my class a license because of this

#####

my wife was attempting to park the truck she only needed to reverse a straight line for about 60 feet i watched this spectacle for 20 minutes and laughed so hard that she threatened to divorce me

1010 would risk 17year marriage again

#####

personally i never play these kinds of games however a while ago i bought this on sale for roughly 4 i dont know why but this game was screaming for me to purchase it so i did then i pretty much forgot about it for a couple of months however the other day i decided to play it and wow am i impressed to my surprise i really enjoy playing this game its so relaxing and i can easily spend a good few hours a time playing it 

you start off as a truck driver for different companies you get many different routes and destinations to choose from you have a wonderful little mini map called route advisor to guide you to your destination
you also get to see the start and end destination before you accept the job as well as the amount of money you will get for completing the job

im fairly new at this game so i apologise if i may be slightly incorrect 

the further you get into the game the more money and destinations become available you can start saving up to buy your own truck and trailer to deliver goods which i think allows you to make more money you can also get more xp for parking the truck manually at set destination 

the ranges of jobs are amazing you can deliver many different kinds of cargo and drive many different kinds of trucks what i also like is that in the uk our drivers side is the right and outside of the uk it is the left the game takes this into account and its a wonderful challenge to learn to drive both sides

another thing to take into account is speed limits most roads areas you drive in have different speed limits such as 50mph60pmh30mph etc you can also damage the truck i think you can turn this particular setting off you can get fined for not using your headlights it can rain be sunny and have thunderstorms you can turn your wind screen wipers on too all buttons are customizable so you can set out the best way for you to play oh did i mention theres a chance for some roadside incidents

there is much more to cover 

overall this game is great i love it youll love it too

#####

you drive you drive and you drive thats all i like this game it relaxes me calms me down when you have all the dlcs promods is a whole different world
i recommend

#####

everything is perfect
until you realize there is no damage model

#####

fantasy trucking game workers get paid a fair wage

#####

driving

#####

i actually bought this game firsthand just for the funny reviews here

but overall i am hooked

theres a certain charm to this game that i just cant figure out

be it the relaxing atmosphere the way you handle your trucking business
or the radio stations man they are diverse

i can just drive endlessly into that virtual sunset




#####

i usually fall asleep on the road
after playing this game i understand how hard a truck drivers job is

#####

the concept and idea of the game actually seems kinda boring you drive trucks from a to b whats so exciting about that
well nothing and thats why i like it after a stressful day i like to just play this while listening to the in game radio and just relax 
plus im unable to drive trucks in real life so this is the next best thing

#####

1010 made me buy a steering wheel controller just for this

#####

guilty pleasure perfect game to escape from everything the game that makes you feel and think about all whats surrounds your thoughts you can chose to listen to music or you can listen to news or podcast while you driving everything works cause its just you and me a 40 tonnes of steel and speed that flies in night roads ahead

#####

very good and relaxing game its great to play while listening to music or podcast highly recommended

#####

i got ptsd from driving a double trailer loaded with 23tons of caviar for a distance of 1100km

i played the first 30 hours on keyboard and sure it was fun later in 2016 i got a driving wheel and oh boy has the game changed so much it became so much more fun and it feels like you really are in the truck and now pair it with a vr headset you got one hell of a nice combo



#####

1010 would park my truck in the middle of the highway again

#####

finally hit 1000 hours so i figured id write my review this game is incredible it has improved so much in my 10 years of playing the devs are reworking the original map for free to bring it up to current standards map expansions are high quality and worth the price new trucks are always free so many gameplay improvements like owned trailers enhanced customization sounds graphics and more

i could go on and on but it is often on sale for 5 bucks so try it yourself great game that is relaxing perfect for listening to tunes while driving along and driving a truck can be quite involving if you want shifting the gears yourself using the exhaust brake down a hill great customization as well i love putting different paint jobs on my fleet of trucks just get the game

#####

there is a trucker in all of us

#####

slayyy i hit a bus full of people and didnt face any consequences 3

#####

a game thats incredibly fun for reasons i cant understand it can be pretty soothing to drive hundreds of kilometers while towing a giant box of tomatoes diggers explosives and anything between

and remember all roads lead to ausfahrt

#####

pros

can run on most potatos
is not one of those boring simulators
graphical and part mods are amazing
no truck driver certification is needed
you can start your own trucker business or you can work for other businesses
very realistic
you get the feel of being a real truck driver
fun to play when drunk without the consequences in real life

cons

the ai traffic can be really stupid sometimes and do some weird moves
not entertaining for 10yearold cod players
the addiction may cause sudden loss of girlfriends or career

overall score 1110 would truck again

#####

gosh how had i not reviewed this previously

more than a game its a zenlike way of life  theres nothing quite like delivering tons of potatoes to bratislava on a rainy evening with slovak pop music radio for company

you know what this game is all about by now so if youre yet to play it but it still intrigues you in even some small way i urge you to give it a go  its a lovingly made trip along some beautiful european roads and a gaming experience unlike any other well you know american truck simulator aside of course

to rather shamelessly edit this review at steam awards time a thankful shoutout to scs for their ongoing work on this game  it is indeed a labour of love and very worthy of a nomination for that steam award incidentally  areas of the map that date back to the initial release are still being lovingly revisited and given a polish to bring them more into line with the more recently added content  wonderful stuff

late 2023 addendum this may of course be more a product of the further deterioration of my very old pc but ets2 does seem to ask more of a machine these days as indicated by the recentish revision of the recommended specs  it should look and run very well on anything vaguely modern however and scs continue their terrific work in revisting and retouching some of the more dated areas of the gamemaps  sadly my truck must remain garaged for now unfortunately as my pc just cant keep up  i miss my volvo

#####

its all fun and games until youre asked to deliver ammunition and chlorine from germany to france

1110 would start another world war

#####

9 years on and theyre still adding stuff to it great community and a very realistic simulation

#####

#####

very good game i love it

#####

for every type of person theres the one game out there that really fits for him this game however appeals to various sorts of players id reckon if you like trucks for instance youll probably really like this game unless maybe youre one of those nitpicky types that gets very angry over small details that differ slightly from reality but leave you unable to enjoy a game like this i on the other hand belong to the group of people that like to zone out listening to your favourite music from the early 2000s doing something repetitive and very irrelevant and this game really is perfect for that admittedly it comes without the music but you can somehow bring it in the game via a fancy radio feature or just leave your musicplayer open in the background soon youll find yourself on the road letting your mind wander  i can absolutely recommend this game


on a slightly different note writing a game review for a virtual internet badge should really make one reconsiders ones life priorities

#####

love this game amazing to just sit back put aome music on or audiobook and just drive across europe obviousle it would be amazing if it had more in game options available such as getting out of the truck to refule or to go to get some food or cb radio like it was in older hard truck games where you could ask or inform about weather traffic etc slightly more realistic damages or random faults like flat tire where you have to stop get out and change the tire and so on but knowing this will never happen i just enjoy what is given really great game

#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review on euro truck 2 and it gets 350 likes and 150 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here

#####

i dont recall when this game came out but ive been playing it more or less since that day  for me after 18wos haulin this was the first game with major graphics that i remember playing and as such it will always occupy a special place in my heart  of course it has been updated many times and with those updates have almost always come improvements so i am pleased to say i still own this marvellous game and i still play it  a great addictive game and if you are tempted by driving simulators this one is the original and best of the playable ones  an inspired idea for whosoever thought of it  

a fumbs up

#####

absolutely love this game

the level of detail is amazing and i love going to cities that ive been to in real life and spotting all the similarities the countryside and motorway driving is super relaxing especially with the radio and cruise control on 
the added expansions are great giving a lot more map to discover and find work although currently i only own and have played the scandinavia and going east ones cant wait to get the italia expansion and explore beautiful italy some more

theres lots of ways to customise your vehicle and really make it unique to you plus some great features like the sleep mechanic ie having to calculate how much driving time youll have left if you take a quick nap because your eyes are closing repeatedly or making sure you have enough fuel to complete the job or just get to the next fuel station its all good
i usually end up taking out the biggest loan i can buying my own truck and plunging my company into debt but i still have fun

i racked up a lot of hours on this game outside of steam back when i still used to buy physical copies of games and its one of my favourite games that i keep going back to when i want to chill and just enjoy some stress free gaming plus it reminds me of going trucking with my dad when i was a child

#####

ets2 is a perfect game when you just want to chill out most people just joke about this game without actually trying it which is really bad try the demo on httpeurotrucksimulator2comdownloadphp and see for yourself beautiful environments the best driving controls ever and a deep experience ets2 provides

also oh my god im working here now

#####

honestly the comfiest game on steam put on the radio in game drive down some motorways and forget about life for a little bit

sounds sad as fuck but genuinely a blast truckzen

multiplayer mod is mint too truckersmp

#####

as my lifelong gamer status slowly but surely gives way to old jaded gamer i find myself being drawn more and more towards experiences like euro truck simulator 2  no hack writing no anime designs no tired quests to save the world no twitchy gameplay no cutscenes to pull me out of what little immersion i can still muster  just me my machine and a sprawling network of european highways rendered in careful beautiful detail  if i dont feel like growing my business i can simply cruise from country to country taking in the varied and striking scenery  i can even select from a number of internet radio stations covering several genres of music if the roar of my scania grows tiresome

you neednt be a truck enthusiast to enjoy this game  i couldnt tell you who half the manufacturers are or where they come from  but when youre pulling a pair of trailers through a mountain pass on a stormy night and nailing every treacherous turn like you were made for it none of that actually matters  this is a game you play to unwind and relax after a long day regardless of where your gaming interests typically lie

there is a lot of dlc to consider much of it cosmetic in nature  there have also been four soon to be five major map expansions adding entire new countries industries cities and objectives to an already ambitious base game  i highly recommend you eventually purchase these as you get a lot of content for the price and it very much enriches the experience  like many im wary of being nickel and dimed to death after buying what i expect to be a complete game but you really do get some good stuff for a comparative pittance  wait for a seasonal sale and the entire thing can be had for less than a socalled aaa release

i really cant say enough nice things about this one  nobody is more surprised by that than i am

#####

truck simulation at its finest

#####

im a little late getting to the ets 2 party i started playing ats a little over 2 years ago ive since amassed over 6000 hrs in the game i actually knew about ets before that i was searching you tube for info on head tracking diys when i saw a demo of one using ets i was really interested but ended up going with ats  

then i got in to doing skins in ats and i actually spend far more time in the game testing skins than actually driving now i delayed getting into ets for this very reason ive slowed down on the skin making and am taking time to make you tube videos so i thought good time to try ets its great i wish i had purchased it sooner the game play is very similar to ats and the menus dont look any different what is different is the truck trailers and scenery the trucks are a little strange for a canadian at first but i quickly grew to like them the scenery is fantastic in ats the buildings look the same wherever  you go as it covers one big country in ets you go through many countries all with their own style and the game reflects that ill probably never get to europe in real life but i am gaining an appreciation for it through what knowledge i do have plus playing this game 

i highly recommend it

#####

i normally play this late at night just driving listening to my music that i imported through my phone to the game being able to import your own music to the game is what keeps me playing very relaxing game if you like driving games in general

#####

just drive and relax 
its cool game but i think its more interesting with friends but if u dont have any one is still good game to have fun with in

#####

enjoyable especially with recently added multiplayer including the already existing trucking community multiplayer credit goes also to the developers still keeping the game enjoyable by adding new content and still developing and introducing new features to further improve the overall gaming experience

great game to relax and unwind in be advised this is not the game for you if youre impatient

#####

if you love want to learn more about trucks i recommend you try this game with or without mods as there some mods which make the game more realistic like evr sounds and one mod i want to mention which makes the game very enjoyable is the multiplayer mod you can drive with your friends make convoys meet people as i met 90 of my friends i play it since 2012 nonsteam and bought it on 2014 on steam

this will be my favorite trucking game forever

#####

the only game anyone should be playing

#####

very realistic game but there is no dust every things is clean if dust and car wash centers contain these game will be more realistic

#####

to make the game more realistic i am renting a hoe every 1000km

#####

without any doubt this is one of my favourite games to chill  relax  a masterpiece in terms of simulator games

#####

my experience so far

 first day joining mp got stuck in a gateway with cargo started panicking as other players were waiting on me 

 communication between players spaming horns and flashing the crap out of ya 

 first speeding ticket ooh no rest of em meh 

 my first earning bank u wunt sum munniez 

 parking  rage 

this game is ridiculous i love it

#####

drove to duisburg doing the speed limit and got rearended and cut up by a turkish player 
ended up hitting the guard railing and spinning into oncoming lanes

1010 would drive to duisburg again 

words of advise invest into recording software will help with your insurance

#####

this is not goat simulator or grass simulator or bread simulator or another stupid simulator this is truck simulator so your job is driving a truck delivering stuff across europe so far as a casual gamer i didnt find it hard to drive these trucks though the ai can be ridiculuos stupid

so you started to get a job using companys truck get some money to buy your own truck so you can start building your own empire ehh i mean company and then buy a garage buy trucks and hire drivers buy garages in every town upgrade your garages manage your trucks your drivers and your garages because youre the boss

also i love how the developer works on this game not like ahem unity stuff

you will feel bored cause of its repetitiveness but sometimes you will back to drive your trucks again and then bored and then drive it again and feel bored again and again overall 910 recommended for fans of driving games sorry for bad english  my grammar 3

#####

i made a cardboard gaming wheel

#####

its like driving in real life but in a truck in europe and not in real life

#####

best game ever for relaxing

#####

this game saved my life

i am 69

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

#####

life as a trucker aint easy you have to build your company from the ground up buy new garages hire drivers buy and customize trucks build your repetition and learn everything on the job when you start the game your options are limited but the world  or at least parts of central europe  is your oyster after a few successful deliveries  where its likely youll spend most of the time trying to back up the trailer  you have enough money to hire other drivers buy them trucks purchase another garage and then upgrade your own truck

what the game might lack in visual realism it certainly it makes up for in trucking realism everything youd expect to have to handle when driving an actual truck is simulated engine brakes trailer brakes manual gears retarder axle controls diff lock indicators light horn air horn normal horn high beam headlights parking lights beacons wipers cruise control just to name a few tings
thankfully most of this can also be handled automatically so if you dont want to bother with all the details and just drive a truck you can do that too

despite a few shortcomings bieuro truck simulator 2ib is a great piece of work if youre looking for a trucking simulator you should drop everything and buy the game and much as the dlc as you can afford right now

whenever i feel bored or sad i just hit up ets2 get a job with like 2000km distance tune to 80s hotmix radioor put on some superior eurobeat and play for the rest of the afternoon never expected it to be so enjoyable to be honest but its great at taking stuff off my mind its also very comfy to drive on a rainy night with nobody else on the road and just cruising with high beams also the multiplayers pretty good though it nearly killed my save so im taking a break from it

#####

its all fun and games until youre asked to deliver ammunition and chlorine from germany to france

#####

tldr yes you should buy it

if youre like me and you read as many reviews as possible before buying a game congrats you get to read another one

euro truck simulator 2 is a truck simulator set in europe simple enough you drive a truck with different cargo each time starting out using trucks that your employer provides until you manage to buy your own truck you can expand your garage hire drivers build multiple garages and create a trucking empire

but for now focus on the driving dont get too ahead of yourself

pros

 map is quite detailed most cities are pretty close to their real life counterparts just scaled down did i mention the whole game is scaled down driving across europe in real time wouldnt be as easy on the brain nor the hard drive space

 incredibly detailed trucks trucks are all brand name licensed trucks with the interior and exterior recreated in painstaking detail even minute things that you probably would never see are added door bins little switches to the left of the steering wheel floor mats etc

 when you finally get around to buying your own truck you can customize it and make it fully your own paint spoilers body kits interior bits and bobs everything can be changed

 the game is relatively relaxing if you get your kicks from getting your blood pumping while running around spraying bullets this game is not for you thats not to say theres not intensity there is especially when youre running late and youve still got 20 kilometers to your destination and youre hitting every red light in town


cons

 graphics theyre not bad but theyre not knock your socks off photorealistic you can tell youre looking at a game not real life its to be expected though since the entirety of europe is scaled down into this game the graphics arent that bad and sometimes a landmark catches your eye or the sunrise glistens through your window and you get entranced by it and cause a crash

 highways which are the majority of the roads youll be driving on can sometimes be not that realistic especially in small rural exits they can be a bit janky or sudden sometimes in the big cities however the highways are very detailed

 this game makes you have a burning hatred for highway police and speed cameras i hate speed cameras


odds and ends

this game is worth full price 100 however if you get it on a sale like i did youre going to be very happy with the bargain you got especially if it included map dlc which brings me on to the next point

map dlc get it its worth it the base game map is good but with the dlc you just have so much more map if you cant afford them all ill reccomend getting the scandinavia dlc and the going east dlc france you can do without mainly because i hate their toll booths i hate you france stop charging me 88 euro for 100km on a toll road

this game has a very active modding community this includes visual mods so if you fancy your game to be a bit more spruced up you can do that be warned graphic enhancers destroy your fps like nothing in this world seen before so take caution and dont pile on all of them at once

in my opinion you dont need the truck customization packs yes theyre nice and if youre a big fan of personalization you can get them but in my opinion the game is more about the journey not if you have a dancing hula girl on your dashboard though its nice


glorious duck best way to play

this is the best way to play the game though i may be biased because this is my method the key aspect though is that this game should be enjoyed and savored like a fine wine not gulped down like a shotgun beer

1 get yourself a meat pie with a thick flaky crumbly crust
2 get some iced tea
3 bake pie pour tea
4 turn on ets2
5 turn on smooth jazz
6 drive along the highway eating your pie and drinking your iced tea feel your truck hug the curve of the highway bask in the glow of the virtual sunset and soak up the smooth jazz as you cruise down the road

pure bliss

the second best game i have ever played i love how i can just sit here and reminisce about the good times i had with debruh before she left me for that idiot with a bigger rig than me

#####

its an awesome chill game thats over 10 years old and still recieves regular updates and dlcs plus a quite active modding scene it is without a doubt the game out there that has the simulator in the title
its one of those games that can be called a podcast game in the sense of putting on some sort of podcast audiobook asmr literally anything on and you just listen to it and drive on or heck put on an actual irl radio on ingame
its kinda similar to something like viscera cleanup where you just do something that on the surface might seem mundane but is a quite chill and fun activity

#####

truck

#####

tldr its an amazing game to chill and appreciate the different european citieslandscapes specially with the dlcs

i have to admit that way before i had played this game i used to think why do some people like a driving simulator so much if they probably drive daily irl whats the point

well thats the catch there is way more to it than a simple simulator to drive from point a to b despite this being the core of the game this game has deeper roleplaying factors and rewarding features that will take you from being a simple unskilled worker up to a full skilled driver and owner of a multinational truck delivery services company there is leveling up and skill points besides the cash rewards for the jobs

the more the player dedicates himself to certain jobs and ways to do them bigger and better jobs in the same characteristics will be offered to him  offering in return greater rewards

one of the strengths of euro truck simulator 2 is certainly the visuals which varies depending on the weather and the time of the day dusk rain storms and dawns are just beautiful and the fact that there are several camera angles to view only contributes to the player feeling these moments in an introspective way  or share them on the world of trucks page officially created by the developer so that players share such moments with each other

ive recently found out that ets2 has a really friendly online community as im over 50 hours into the game but only now started exploring some mods for it and there are thousands of them i stumpled upon a lot of weatherclimate mods when i was looking for new radio stations for the game yes ets2 has lots of really nice radio stations for the player to listen to while driving

its also interesting to point out that euro truck simulator 2 is a nice example of how not all games need to offer epic stories violence or sex nothing against those games btw to be an amazing experience and to attract thousands of players worldwide it is a rewarding experience to feel like a driver who little by little progresses in his career and becomes head of a fleet of trucks managing his own business while choosing to continue on the road

by the end of the day this is still just a game still just a simulation but it does a great job in helping the player relax and reminding the player of a pretty good life advice  dont forget to appreciate the view along the way to your destination 

#####

add damage models

#####

promods aproves the game excellent dev team who are still updating the game with regular new content

1010 

also during sale the game can be bought for less than 5 so if you wait for the steam sale its an absolute bargain

#####

try and play this without a steering wheel and get into more trouble crossing europe than the nazis ever did

#####

a blotb more fun than it should be

1 find job 2 gather trailer 3 deliver trailer  get paid i guess that can be fun

maybe its the idea of creating and expanding a business maybe its that wierd infatuation people have with locomotives  maybe its just a cool job that works perfect for an easy going simulator

its just good fun jump in and out no hassle simple and relaxing

your only objective is to create a successful business and ultimately earn money money buys accesssories and upgrades for your trucks along with recruiting drivers and buying garages naturally your truck is the whole game so customizing and improving it is your primary motivation working towards unlocks is a major incentive to keep you engaged  

there is a also a huge community with tons of fantastic mods to try out theyre easy to use and the content is full of good work there are enough mods to improve upon nearly every aspect of the game 
there are a lot of sites with a ulotu of reuploads and outofdate crap so it took me a while to sift through to find the ones i wanted but it was totally worth it i have an awesome menagerie of mods

its an otherwise pretty dull scenario for a game there isnt a whole lot more underneath than whats delivered at face value 
there isnt anything truly unique or special about it a european truck driving simulator you shouldnt think much of it

ubut even if you have a remote interest it might be enough to get some real enjoyment out of thisu

#####

best truck driving experience game in steam market
its really good you wont stop plying it controller support makes it so much better

just go for it

#####

i mainly play euro truck simulator when ive got nothing to do just throw in some of your own music and drive its got graphics that have aged pretty well and realistic sounds but if they dont satisfy you the community has it backed up with graphics mods and sound mods all of which can be downloaded off of the workshop 

the multiplayer mod which i assume anyone who got this game has installed does make you feel less lonely since you do have actual people driving around but it does result in massive traffic jams 

still i do recommend this game as a time passer

#####

i understand why so many people play this game for 500 hours now

#####

what u do is

drive trucks  get bucks

its the chillest experience ever

also props to scs for frequently updating this game and providing more and more content ever since its release in 2012 they care about their game and the community surrounding it and it really shows

1010 for the experience itself and the community

#####

hands down
chillest
game
on
steam

#####

i have always been wondering why people like this game so much i mean who likes to sit for hours in front of a pc and drive a slow clumsy truck well just after a few hours of playing this game i realised that the scenery is breathtaking on maximum graphics during the day and there are virtually no cops during the night just dont tell them that i always break the limit when its dark i will most probably write a more detailed review later

#####

please add sex

#####

euro truck simulator 2 has exceeded my expectations many times over my expectations were never high to begin with though i thought id be reviewing one of those shovelware titles but i was wrong euro truck simulator 2 is an extremely high quality title that has been built by people who understand their market 
it is a deep fun and immensely relaxing game to spend hours of your time in while the experience of driving a truck isnt 100 of where id want it to be it is damn close of just being an enjoyable experience the empire building the employee management and the leveling up mechanic of your own driver all extend the games replay value and gives you goals to work for its one of the best simulation games ive ever played
whod have guessed id be humbled by a game about trucking
note my nominee for labor of love award during the 2020 and 2021 steam awards

#####

life is a highway and im gonna ride it all night long

#####

i play this in vr when i just want to chill and listen to music this game is beautiful on the quest 3 and its much easier to see all the sites when you can turn your head to look

#####

you know it honestly feels like a joke at first theres thousands of games out there  some offer compelling storylines others offer nonstop thrills and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life and then theres euro truck simulator 2 which unsurprisingly is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of europe okaaaay 

to emphasise the absurdity of things you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop thats taking place here you pick a job from a list of options in your area you go and hitch up your cargo then you slowly trundle towards your destination taking into account every road law and speed limit and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and neverending strips of asphalt after dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 realtime minutes you drop off the cargo  and do the whole thing again

suffice to say then that this isnt for everyone theres a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph if you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off youre instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your xaxis sensitivity for well something the tutorial then doesnt help matters basically stemming down to telling you just drive the truck and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place 

yet give it a chance to get things rolling and  amazingly and most crucially  it really works theres a bunch of reasons why this is the case that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig for one theres an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background with the satnav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination its surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing 

secondly theres the option to turn on your own music while driving or even tune in to actual radio stations across europe set one of these up and hit the perfect moment where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees and it all just feels right heck take my word for it when i say that having acdcs highway to hell blasting out your speakers as youre racing down the road at max speed is something thats hard to beat if youre daring you can even pop a video or tv show up in another window and zone out but just like real life the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this still its fun to try in the game that is 

theres also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel while it takes way too long if youre not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt so much so it actually gets a little frustrating you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause suddenly youre busy plotting out an empire trucks roaming across all of europe and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account you can even make the core game more complicated if youre that way inclined an automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice but theres nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy the choice as they say is yours

its also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up  from the big changes to the little tweaks theres a lot you can bolt on to the base experience whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles theres a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck  because theres something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant bb8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space while not offered in the game or mods themselves and i cant say i tried this myself theres also means out there to take things online hitting the road with truckers all over the world chances are youll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere but hey whatever floats your boat 

in the end whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take whats on offer euro truck simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road its the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesnt appeal and thats what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at

#####

like skyrim with trucks

#####

very good game with little bugs i play on a logitech g29 steering wheel and it is one of the best games after fh4 i have played

#####

chilling with spotify playing in the background is the best

get the steering wheel and you get the double fun

get an hshifter and you get another layer of fun

vr would be even one step further

together with awesome modding community youre getting plenty of fun yes it has many paid dlcs but devs really deserve your money for their work with each and every one of them there is so much stuff there even for the full price

h1 euro truck simulator 2 review h1

iwell where to start with this gamei

ive played this game since day one even before it hit the steam release with over 1000 hours the game itself unmodded provides great entertainment if you enjoy to just relax at your computer and just drive if youre wanting a great simulation aspect this game can deliver on many levels and provide simulation like the real thing

speaking of modding this game provides a massive range of modding features to improve and drastically extend your gameplay i personally play a modded game most of the time as ive expereince most of the game and what it offers in the unmodded version but to this day mods still make the game very fresh and new to play

overall i would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys driving games with a very open aspect to modding the graphics are beautiful and are very eye appealing but another good thing is that the specs arent too high to play the game


#####

at i laughed i mocked the virtual truckers i mean who wants to sit around and drive a virtual truck spoilermespoiler
now however i laugh and mock those who idonti sit around and drive a virtual truck get it and be sucked into a never ending obsession of delivering cargo all over europe

#####

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

i bought this game for like 2 euros and omfg this game is fascinating imo this is the best simulator game you can easily relax after school or work just drivin the truck while listening some good music
i would recommend this game even for 20 euros

#####

pros of being a truck driver
 you own a truck
 you enjoy driving it on the open roads
 you experience beautiful scenery
 at any given moment youre at least 500 km away from your wife

#####

so where do we start gameplay is is simple and fun doesnt require much skill to get into graphics are good enough for me the game has beautiful sceneries the vanilla game is ok but where the game really shines is with mods a lot of them there is a multiplayer mod for ets2 which is ok has its faults but can be good with friends but sp is just so good always with rigid mods its really fun and easy 

base game 610
multiplayer mod 710
modded singleplayer 1010

quotethis review is entirely my own opinion game played on i5 9th gen gtx 1660ti 8gb ramquote

h1introductionh1
euro truck simulator 2 is an easy recommendation it is by far the best game at what it does providing endless hours of content in a believable world welldesigned hours feel like minutes and relaxation turns to stress was i supposed to say that as you try to navigate a variety of scenery with a cumbersome load in tow without tipping it over getting caught by the police or ploughing into traffic oncoming traffic 

h1summaryh1
bpositivesb
 excellent gameplay
 good graphics
 good sounds
 good location variety with more being reworkedadded
 mod and workshop support
 massive replayability value

bnegativesb
 new achievements added when dlc come out forcing you to buy all expansions to 100
 graphics are not brilliant all over the world but theyre working on this
 no damage models on trucks they cant for licencinglegal reasons but still

h1graphicsh1
its a pretty game that much cant be denied but it is in no way next generation its come on a long way since the days the early screenshots and trailers were made with improvements to textures lighting and props in the world as times gone by a lot of these improvements are noticeable as you explore the dlc map expansions but to mitigate the disparity between the newer dlc and the areas in the base game the developers have worked hard to redesign and modernise the original areas bringing them closer to the standard of the new dlc 

the trucks all look really good as do trailers realistically designed with highresolution textures and pleasing effects like shining on the paintwork and windscreens make them believable and authentic roads and signs are all pleasing to look at too and over time variety in different types of roads has led to a nice variety of surfaces to drive on surrounding buildings look okay and vegetation too none of these are truly stunning but they fit the style of the games graphics and make the world feel immersive enough to enjoy 

the only thing that is a disappointment is the complete lack of damage simulation this is because they use real truck designs and have to adhere to laws which dont allow them to simulate them in disrepair which is a shame given how much most of us crash 

h1gameplayh1
this game is pretty much open world as far as simulators are concerned as long as you stay on the road or relatively close to it you can drive anywhere in most of europe at this point though itll set you back a bit of money for the luxury the base game gives you a decent expanse to get started with though 

the point of the game is to earn money as a starting truck driver by taking contracts for various deliveries by ingame companies and driving them from a to b it couldnt sound more tedious but something about this game is inexplicably engrossing the challenge keeping about 30 tonnes of utter rubbish upright and undamaged as you control this huge conveyance through the busy roads of europe is addictive 

driving feels amazing especially with a wheel or with a controller if youre poor like me trucks feel heavy and almost groan pulling the load from a standing position more so up a hill and when they finally reach speed momentum pushes them on as you weave in and out of traffic to try and make back the time you lost when you ran into the tollgate ithat didnt breaki 

trucks handle realistically with physics simulating them bouncing over lumps in the road they lean as you make a hard turn and sometimes flip and then so will you youll slam on the brakes when you see a speed camera to avoid a fine youll fly down country roads with harsh turns and youll take the thing offroad  no extreme feels like too much to get that delivery on time 

eventually somehow avoiding getting your licence taken off you youll get enough money to buy your own truck and now youll learn to drive more carefully repairs are expensive and you care about this one you worked for it and so you slam into the first car you see taking it off the forecourt eventually you might get good enough to buy a garage and get a fleet of trucks going where you hire drivers who are incapable of getting a job if their lives depended on it 

h1audioh1
audio in the game is good most of the time you will probably play it and listen to podcasts or music in the background so it wont really stand out to you anyway but truck sounds are simulated well from gear changes engines revving horns etc in the cabin sounds from other vehicles are realistically muffled and become louder when viewing from outside of the truck tyre noises are audible when hitting curbs or going over speed bumps 

audio is also used to draw your attention to how much of a fool you are in the game you will hear a heartbreaking noise letting you know authorities have stolen some of your earnings because you put the pedal to the metal in a residential zone and sirens will go off as police cars remind you of their presence even if they cant be bothered to give chase lazy 

h1conclusionh1
this is a relaxing game that you can take your time with with casual levelling and xp systems to motivate progress which unlock trucks and upgrades you will have free reign to explore most of europe mod the game to your hearts content and grow a successful if hardearned trucking business the game is constantly getting support even now years after launch and will provide endless hours of fun and frustration to those who dare to play it 910 its a brilliant game

#####

really dont know what is it with this game i dont play simulators and dont like driving games but something about how peaceful everything feels makes play this game at night like i can be driving and lose myself in my own thoughts

ive been playing for a while and have discovered about 20 of the maps i own scs keeps releasing maps for this game after 6 years and will probably continue doing so which i will continue buying and playing

the game also has lots and lots of mods people that continue updating their mods after all this time are heroes you can improve the graphics ambience sounds trucks physics you name it not that is necessary but its a big plus

update still loving this game

#####

good game to chill out on or mess around trying to complete jobs as fast as possible without flipping your truck

#####

journal entry 1 

its my first day running my new company marauder trucking i took out a huge loan from the bank scored myself a sick looking volvo truck im ready for action 

journal entry 2 

im new to driving a vehicle with this many gears and new to shifting manually with a clutch but i think i got it under control then i back up straight into the side of a small van so no im not under control ive now damaged my truck to 8 and cost myself a pretty penny for the accident but hey we all gotta learn sometime right 

journal entry 3 

after driving around my small property parking lot and learning my gears i decide to venture to the populated streets i backup this time checking my mirrors and carefully pull onto the street im now happily driving among the traffic of europe the drivers a slow and waiting at lights is a pain in the rearbut alas this is my life now  

journal entry 4 

i have picked a mission to haul a load of heavy machinery across the countryside i drive to my location which happens to be a nice little farm with very tight corners and fences i see my load waiting between two other loaded trailers this looks like a tight fit i attempted backing up several times not getting it right im sure the farmer and his wife were either giggling inside their house or regretting not hiring a better driver i finally get latched on and give a sigh of relief i pull out of the space and very gently make my turns while trying not to stall out although its tight maneuvering i am able to escape vincents smoked meats 

journal entry 5 

now on the road i get to enjoy the beautiful countryside and shake my fist at the slow and dangerous drivers around me it begins to get a bit darker and a light rain starts i almost drive my truck off the road twice trying to turn on my headlights and windshield wipers but were all good im now cruising down the road at a gentle 70 and things are gooduh ohi can see a line of cars piling up behind me so i better pick up the pace this was a poor decision on my part 

journal entry 6 

now thinking back in the best interest of other drivers i should have just stayed the speed i was going but i did not i got far to generous with the gas pedal and shifting ended up pumping my truck up to around 120 this speed was great i was making good time i didnt have a line of cars behind me but i didnt account for sharp corners in my equation i came whipping up to a corner thinking ok ill just tap the brakes and slow down a bit well its wet on the road its a sharp corner i got it down to about 98 when i hit the corner and suddenly my world started to become slightly off center 

journal entry 7 

now that my truck is laying on its side ive learned a key element about gear reduction to control speed as well as when to and when not to apply the brakes i had missed my corner by lotsi had not taken into account the grade  of the road and i rolled it and slid for a long distance it was quite scaryafter my truck is up righted from the long skid on its side im now looking at 72 damage the truck sounds like a blender full of ball bearings and the lights flicker thats totally normal right  

journal entry 8 

ok the truck sounds terrible but it still drives its got horrible turning now and 3 of my gears are non existent im still about 2 game hours away from my destination i am able to drive for about 45 mins before the truck really starts to haveissues i was driving along at my new cautious speed of 50 and suddenly my truck turns off great no power steering so my wheel locks up and its like trying to steer a dead whale with a pool cuenot working well but im able to get it to the side of the road safely 

journal entry 9 

i am able to start the truck again and drive another while before it turns off again im now only 20 mins away from my destination and im not giving up if its the last thing i do im getting this load to its destination ive now cranked this thing over enough times that i could probably forge a blade on the starter but luck has it that the final stretch into town is all down hillyay throw it in neutral and coast into the city i blast my horn and coast powerlessly through red lights dodging traffic and jumping curves i look like a boat without a crew heading directly for the shore 

journal entry 10 

i can see the building im almost there  im coasting much much slower now that the terrain has leveled out the truck wont even start now its toast im about 30 feet from the buildings entrance and moving at a speed of about 57 old ladies with walkers are getting better torque ratios then my truck i finally land right next to the door unable to start the truck im not going to be able to back it in manually so we will take a gimme on this load this may be bad for my business but i can personally suggest you dont hire anyone from marauder trucking

#####

this is one of those games that surprise you  i thought that i would never be interested in a game about truck driving  and here i am after several years and over 200 hours ingame and almost the same in american truck simulator 

this is a great relaxing game and if you invest in a good steering wheel  its even more revarding over the years scs software added a lot of new contenct both a free updates and also as paid dlcs and the game is still in development 

a wide range of countries cities and trucks makes it a great game for truck fans and gamers searching for a relaxing title i usualy listen to podcasts or audiobooks while driving and it works really well

#####

monke drive
monke listen to music
monke happy

#####

traffic ai is kinda dumb but oh well

#####

to clear my mind i turned on my song and drove my truck on the roads and then some idiot rolled me across the road

#####

bmy favourite simulator game so farb
list
 great and realistic gameplay
 works great with keyboardmousegamepad but id recommend getting a wheel
 good graphics not the best though
 a huuuuuge lifetime basically endless
 a huuuuuge map but you will need to buy the dlcs to unlock the whole map worth it imo
 besides being huge the map is quite detailled and each region feels different and unique
 a lot of fun with the multiplayer mod
 great soundtracks
list

but please add b d a m a g e   m o d e l sb 

#####

many games attempt this genre and fail
euro truck simulator 2 succeeds in capturing that one essential thing which makes or breaks a good delivery sim a living breathing world

although technically not fully open world ets 2 manages to deliver the bestingenre type of open world to drive in combine that with an enjoyable delivery management system great driving mechanics and an awesome coop experience 

it is simply the best and most addicting fun ive had yet for a game of this kind

#####

in the real life 
i took 2 hours a day driving to my office get payment every month and im going mad

in ets2 
i delivered tomatoes and took 16 hours in the road hitting a lot of cars paying fare for my speed and get minus payment because i need to pay for my failure machine  im happy


1010
would like to sleep in the gas station again

ets2  worth every penny

#####

when my friend first told me about this game ill be honest i thought it looked like a niche game for middleaged men still living in their mothers basement however i was encouraged to buy it and as it was on sale for the incredible price of about 4 i agreed 

the very next day i bought the map booster bundle including many map expansions for places like italy scandinavia and a large chunk of france that isnt included in the base game on a separate note i highly recommend this bundle as it adds a lot of flavour to the map

as you can tell from my irresponsible spending habits i loved the game from the first hour bear in mind that i am not a truck fanatic nor am i a driving game enthusiast theres just something bewitching about obeying the speed limits and stopping at red lights that makes my brain release the happy chemical its the perfect game to play in a voice call with friends or even alone with some music on in the background its the perfect balance of challenging and relaxing that it can be played late at night if you so desire 

if like me you are terrible at all driving games youve ever played and the thought of paying for repairs whenever you crash is terrifying fear not the game isnt that punishing some things that ease the pain are that you are usually going 60 mph unless you are breaking the speed limits you criminal which makes crashing less likely than if you were driving a ferrari 150mph down a motorway nevertheless crashing and toppling your lorry are a core part of the game it does happen even so you start on quick jobs which involve driving somebody elses truck so you dont have to pay for repairs these quick jobs quickly become obsolete within the game economy because as soon as you own a truck you can make far more by taking those jobs unlocked to return to my original point if you feel like youd crash too often this option is a noobfriendly way for people to experience the game 

talking about the experience of the game it is greatly enhanced by the support for steam workshop the modding community is greatly helpful in smoothing over some of the issues that come with a game made 8 years ago  there are mods for everything from improved lighting systems to improved weather systems to improved textures to a mod that adds real life brands to the trucks additionally i believe theres an online modding website that has even more diverse and useful mods but to be honest i really cant be bothered to figure out how it works and the game is already good enough already that im satisfied with simple graphics enhancements 

whilst all of this makes for a fantastic game i highly recommend by far the best aspect of this game is that you can pretend its actually educational for instance you might say it teaches you about road laws ive learnt a lot from this game such as
speeding is fine as long as there are no speed cameras or police cars
speeding through a green light to avoid it turning red is often worth it
taking out loans to pay off your other loans leads to accumulating debt but its fine because you can take out more loans
but the golden rule is as follows
if your engine cuts out dont worry if it doesnt start again worry

#####

i played a bit its pretty good

#####

this is a wonderful game the graphics are fantastic the camera views are amazing the fact you can just drive trucks is so nice and you can choose different trailer loads the best relaxing game

#####

you drive truck life is beautiful
