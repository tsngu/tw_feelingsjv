no control options horrible camera views non existant physics equipment that should weigh tons bounces around like a go kart dont waste your time ive been in construction my whole life so when i see something like this it makes me think my son would get to see a glimpse what its likenope pass on this junk

#####

poorly optimized graphics arent too good and are covred up with intense lighting i couldnt play the game because it was so laggy i was sporting a hard 60 fps sitting in the tractor literally as soon as the bucket hit the bricks my fps dropped to 5 fps awful just awful i would get a refund but it came with 3 other games for 99 cent and one of them is actually fun

#####

poor gfx bad camera angles  i couldnt see where i was going bad controls 
do no buy

#####

controls cannot be reconfigured
machinery has selfcentering steering even when stationary which makes it almost impossible to drive
machinery has no suspension and the 4wd works intermittently making your machine remain stationary with wheel spin and then launch forward
i gave up in the 2nd mission when youre meant to pickup bricks but the bricks magically bounce back out of your loader bucket when you stop



#####

well i have played 4 hours of it upon writing this review i am not quite sure where the complaints are coming from but here is my personal experience brace yourself it is not exactly short this will more be a review for people who want a bit more detail of the game instead of just a it sucks type of review

camera
press c and get into outside view use left mouse button and can move camera any angle you like
i could post the suggestion to maybe in the future put more camera control in all the views


graphics
i have not seen an issue there either when launching game it gives you options to change settings and so far am getting basically what i see in the trailer if you experience lag just lower your settings it has its bumps and jolts here and there but nothing to make it unplayable for me

will also add i am not sure how peoples cpus and gpus are overheating mine are all within normal temperature while running this game

gameplay
challenging at times but i enjoy a challenge the game will require you to take your time and go slow at times you are not a racecar driver but if you do you can complete your challenges i have been able to complete all them first try so far

you can flip your vehicles over so be careful to me this just gets you to be careful while playing and adds to the challenge

yes some things will bounce around but i only seemed to have that problem if i went at it like a bat out of hell it just convinced me to take my time doing it which honestly allowed me to enjoy the game more

i find it to be a decent simulation you are doing just as it describes if the game made it too easy on you and were able to rush whole thing would not be any playablitity

this game i think is suitable for people into this genre of games you must be willing to accept this genre before enjoying it it will not be for everyone

tips
as for anyone having crashes or not starting here is some things i personally found that helped if i ever get an error 
1 do windows updates
2restart computer
3 launch settings instead of game click save and play i have had this fix errors even if i didnt change the settings is this gamebreaking not really as it is a 2 second solution if this is your problem not saying it will solve everyones but solved mine

conclusion
is the game perfect no i am not saying it is it has its flaws but what game doesnt
the developer has also been quite active with the community to take in feedback which is a plus just give him your feedback if you see something at least this game has an active one

as for the price range it is only 15 it is not like it is a 4060 aaa simulator game i think the price range for this and how the game plays out is quite worth it for that range for people interested in the genre

if i encouter any game breaking problems i will post it as well but so far my game is still running fine with the exception of the couple things i mentioned all minor to me

#####

un bias review 20 ok first off i would like to say i am sorry for my first review it was mostly because i was in a bad mood after buying the game there are a few things that i missed on my first playthrough 1 there is a settings menu which is great unfortuatly messing around with the resolution a bit broke the game my second screen and my steam some how it inverted the colors and filled the screen with dots even then the menu screens still were in the wrong resolution and had big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen in game it fit the screen fine the second problem i ran into was to do with the physics i had alot of very bad clipping problems with a few of them resulting in my loader or what ever i was picking up flying into the wall the third problem was that nothing had any weight or feel to it it felt as if i was driving a hover loader picking up things with a anti gravity device or something because they all just slid around on the floor the fourth thing was the default music was way too loud while looking in the settings tab i found you could import your own music holy shit more games need to do that i can see they were aiming for a realistic feel to the game but it was a bit off when you are in the first person view you cant see very much so i use the free cam the only problem with the free cam is most of the sounds are missing when you go into free cam engine sounds debris hitting the floor ect the physics just freeze sometimes the game is still running rain falling and such but the loader doesnt move at all the game runs pretty choppy with fps drops about every 50 seconds i will list my full pc specs aswell 16gb of ripjaw z series ddr3 ram msi 970a g46 amd fx 8350 black edition running at 40ghz radeon 7870 ghz editio yes i know its bottlenecking right now i am saving up for another one but money is tight right now and a 750w power suply there we go i hope this review is less bias 

#####

horrible game bad graphics could even get past the sign in part kept getting some kind error and i meet all of the requirements  dont buy this game

#####

8 out of 42 players like this game

graphics are okay assuming you have high end slid gpus

controls arent good enough to be considered arcade  this game should not even be under the category of simulation

40 pound rocks can make the bulldozer flip over no exaggeration

no speed range  there are only 2 speeds fast and out of control

running over 40 pound rocks can cause you to loose what you just scooped up from the ground no physics at all


i am seriously thinking about reporting this game to the better business bureau it should be banned from america

#####

horrible game im a heavy equipment operator and its nothing like this you cant see nothing with the extremely limited view not even worth the time for a free to play and im disappointed i wasted money on it

#####

it came with a bundle that cost me 79 cents
it was cheap but i still  think i was robbed

#####

loads of busywork before the good parts and the good parts arent that good nor is the physic engine or the graphics or the collision model well you get the idea

#####

dont buy there are soo many things that is not right and i have a really low standard for odd games for example i own most of the german indie titles for construction building towing transporting etc

graphics not all to chabby but stutters even on low settings
physics lets not go there at all
camera well uhm its just bad
gameplay you cant move the camera and drive at the same time as soon as you move the camera your veichle stops
there is problems scooping up stuff in general with loader and buckets debris just bounce around and out

soo in conclusion save your money i bought it as i can tolerate most odd games even bad ones this is just worse

playway great developers they try hard and then they try even harder despite what people think they stick to it and keep going forwards

well i have a soft spot for most sim games this game is a bunch of fun im enjoying it and every one is entitled to there own opinion and you will always have negative people but i just tune them out

the game play is great alot to do if you want to do it right the graphics are good with every thing set to max under launch option not shore how people are over heating but with everything set to max cpu runs at 37c and gpu runs at 42c 

the textures could use little touching up some are little fuzzy not shore if its he type of texture used or the way they are rendered or just me playing with options

controls can be a little frustrating at times they can be rather sensitive but if you take your time and be gentle you can overcome this

the game has good gameplay with contracts mode freeplay mode and challenge mode they are all fun nice range of vehicles but i believe shared vehicle psychics is the only down side but considering the price i can live with that

best of all the developers are active taking suggestions and then fixing the game which seems to be the playway way of doing things which is great and for small price of 1499 its great value for money

#####

wouldnt recommend this game  the only settings available to change from the ui are sound graphical quality vsync and softshadows  it hard locks the resolution  640x480 which on a 1080p monitor looks horrible  in addition the vehicles are way to touchy and no where near realistic

a bit on the vehicles they move too fast  when trying to do something that requires percision that is not an ability  most controls are centered to the left side of the keyboard  wsad for movement rftg for bucket controls  it just feels unnatural  you should be able to select your speed when operating the machine  in addition to the machines running way to fast they bounce all over the place  or when you pick up an item in your bucket it bounces right out of said bucket  it makes it hard to finish any of the missions

id rate it a 2 out of 10  and that is only for the concept of the game  if it was better implemented it would be a better game overall  i would recommend passing on this game

#####

i really wish i didnt play this game for 2 hours

#####

how playway managed to survive let alone thrive after this abysmal release is beyond me cm14 is amazingly bad it ticks off all the boxes of how not to do a simulator controls are horrid and hard locked vehicle handling is very jerky and tied to fps fluctuations and camera viewpoints are so bad the machines feel like ungainly tanks

cm14 is loaded full of bugs i was able to complete 3 of the 11 included contracts the fourth unlocks but is missing the excavator needed to unload crates from the cargo truck while you can technically unload the truck by reversing into a cement fountain and knocking them out of the cargo bay this does not count towards level completion game audio does not function due to the game randomly flipping through included tracks so fast they dont have time to play profiles can delete themselves once created as well as after finishing a couple contracts

i highly recommend skipping cm14 theres a reason playway is still offering a free similarly aged game as an apology for this thing if you email them proof of purchase

#####

bad physics  and chunky controllers not a good game

#####

this game threw texture errors at me right from the very start was laggy and i couldnt get past the character name screen i had difficulty loading this for the five minutes required to be able to review such a subpar game

although it seems like it could be a good game with some more work from the developer

#####

absolutely terrible game gives a sense of vertigo and nausea while playing graphics are horrid and controls are too sensative

#####

got this game for my boyfriend and he said it was too cheesy they do not give any jobs out and you cannot build on as a career not worth the money

#####

just like construction totally felt like i was on a jog site
easy to tip over machines terrible controlls and everything has the same weight as if it was made out of paper mache 
played 3 hrs including talkint to someone for 10 of those 15 min
probably wont play again

#####

1010 fucking awful its gameplay is very captivating

#####

bad controls and rubbish all round really i have played better games on a chalk board

#####

game wont launch and a bunch of other people are reporting the same problem ill revise this if the developers send out a patch since you have to run a game 5 min to post a review i opened the settings menue for 5 min which apears before the game launchs or doesnt launch in my case

#####

i put up with a lot of crap in a game this game just simply did not get finished its a total hack job and i cant help but feel that the game has tremendous potential but you have only one speed when controlling the loader and the mouse is totally unutilized should control bucket and boom a massive update or overhaul is required or heavy modding to ever get this gamne to a playable stateand i wish it was playableit actually looks goodenough

#####

the game literally wont launch i just spent like 20 minutes messing around with it doing every possible thing i could think of from verifying the integrity of the files to reinstalling to messing around with dozens of launch options and nothing 

i cant even launch the game to find out how bad everybody says it is pathetic 

apparently if you have more than 4 cores the game freaks out and wont launch well im not going to screw around with some ini file trying to fix it 

this game is the devs problem poorly optimized so heres a bad review from me

#####

game doesnt work at all

i trouble shot it for a long time couldnt get it to run past the start menu i wish i could get my money back

#####

never has a game made me feel so sick the first person camera is fixed when driving to look at the steering wheel and the external cameras continually drift about there are physics but they could have been better there are errors in the text boxes these could have been overlooked had i not felt the need to vomit after the first contract

#####

shoud be taken out from steam total lie about advanced physics physics not existing camera controls not existing even you use c key to change view it zooms in to bucket or cabin quickly gave up on 3rd mission camera angles makes your spine get into weird shapes to be able to understand the perspective all machinery feels like you have 6 v16 engines with nitro put in slow movement is not possible so you ram into your other machinery and tumble it down so easily got this game for under 1 dollars pn sale but worths less than that which non of these is a limitation for the year it has been released there was a lot of good physics in any game in around 2014 its purely a bad game

#####

when a game compares the weight of a boulder to a packing peanut  you just might get frustrated when trying to scoop them up with a bucket when on a flat stretch of ground that plus the completely horrid cameraviews makes for a monitor smashing fourletterwordinfrontofmytwoyearold inducing time



#####

the game is not bad but cameras make it terrible
it would be much better if there was a free rotation 360º  zoom camera so you could see all the map

i dont recommend it

#####

i thought i have played some bad games in my life but this is certainly unlike anything ive seen before id rather eat horse shit than even look at this game

#####

bad game

#####

poor physics makes the game impossible to play especially when not using an analog controller
i truly regret spending 12 euro on this game 

joints on the machines act like theyve been attached with rubber bands like when u put stress on them theyll actually come apart and get drawn back together by an invisible force

the game seems to combine the worst of reality and arcade into a big mess which boils down to a truly crappy game

even older construction sims are way better than this one its so disappointing and thats prolly why theres no trial download either because they know that no one would buy it once theyve tried it

i pretty much feel scammed by buying this game all i can hope for is that the mnoney i and others spent here will go into supporting development of a descent new version of this game

#####

runs in windows 7 64bit just need to set windows xp service pack 3 compatibility mode if only i could make helicopter simulator 2014 search and rescue to work as well that would be a charm

httpwwwdailymotioncomvideox4llsgi_constructionmachines2014howtorunitinwindows764bit_videogames

httpsyoutubecbmxfi4qlpw

its quite fun i would probably play more of this despite its fun factor one has a better appreciation of the people who are in this profession they make it look too easy

frame rate is ok just need to adjust settings in the launcher to suit your system capability i can get more than 60 fps if various options are set to very low on my potato pc notebook keyboard is used for avatar and vehicle movement while mouse is for camera camera views are rotatable and zoomable for external view but the cockpit view is tied to steering motion so its a bit inconvenient to use

1st job
httpwwwdailymotioncomvideox4lm6ox_constructionmachines2014job1movedebris_videogames

bupdate  2nd jobb

while the first job is easy depending on how you want to play it coz you can just push everything into the pit no need to carry them in the bucket the 2nd job is needlessly difficult for one thing youre supposed to load bricks onto the truck that is fine and good but the bricks are scattered all over the place not in piles as you may expect but in single pieces 

usimulation detail levelu
to exacerbate the task the boom arm motion is jerky and the vehicle motion is also jerky in that it has ridiculously quick acceleration initially the quick acceleration was fun in the first job but not in the this one as it makes moving the bricks frustrating coz it tends to bounce and fall off incidentally its very difficult to scoop and carry more than one brick at a time as said before the bricks tend to fall off even though some bouncy motion is probably normal for wheel loaders it seems excessive in this simulator there isnt enough damping imo but this may be due to my choice of physics realism i will try again with the most realistic option and update this review if there is improvement

watch a real wheel loader at work and see if you agree httpsyoutubebkxio4hmdm

uflawed mission designu
so if we are going to struggle to load one brick at a time whats the point of using a heavy lifter a human being could do a far better and quicker job just throw the bricks onto the truck anyway im gonna try to finish this job coz i hate myself no really i just want to see whats up next and next and so on

ugraphicsu
the 2nd job shows the range of atmospheric and time effects it takes place in dark rainy conditions the ground is wet shiny and slippery so it isnt just eye candy there are physical effects on vehicle handling

ucareer progressionu
theres continuity and a persistent world in that the construction yard is in the same mess as you left it before in the previous job so thats an interesting twist of small strategic element your previous vehicle remain the same color and you can choose a different color for your next vehicle i presume that in advanced stages you could either have color coded fleet or uniformity for your fleet 

uavatar functionu
the avatar doesnt seem to have any useful function to manipulate objects so that the mess you made can be rectified and rearranged neatly or to kick objects into the pit even if you could kick or bump objects around its awkward movement and control makes it impractical its only purpose seem to be to personalise the career mode perhaps it can be used to corral the bricks into sizable heaps so that the wheel loader can pick it up more easily 

incidentally the avatars jumping motion isnt smooth nor believable but its funny and it has some semblance of mj style of moonwalking when walking backwards no sidestepping in 3rd person view

uthird update regarding the flawed missionu
my bad the bricks are larger than the common red bricks found on nonloadbearing brickwalls its too heavy for a man to lift i tried kicking it wouldnt budge so we are back to scouring the ground for scattered bricks therefore its still a flawed mission imo

u 4th update flawed mission  not reallyu
ok so i was a bit hasty with preconceived notions that it would be too difficult or tedious reason is twofold first it wasnt so hard once realistic physics is applied and you take advantage of a bit forward momentum when scooping bricks 2nd reason is that you neednt collect all the bricks lying on the ground and enough bricks are around to practice scooping techniques
end of 4th update

bend of update about 2nd jobb


bsummationb
bought this in playway sim bundle so its a good deal havent seen any game breaking bug of course its a little too early to tell as i have not completed the game yet most of the time was spent trying to find the right settings for my notebook pc

only 1 minor bug encountered in the beginning during the short tutorial the mouselook was inverted when on foot in first person perspective external vehicle view has no problem rotating the right way had to delete profile and recreate a new one for the problem to disappear i hope it doesnt recur later in the career

so far no regrets buying at this low price worth it i think you can even customize your own music playlist but it has to be in ogg format so if you want to squeeze a bit more performance you can use a lower bit rate for the music files

despite its quirkiness its a fun game with refreshing and upbeat music the likes of which was heard in capitalism plus its clunky handling can be mitigated somewhat by careful use of movement keys and bucket loads of patience

score hmm maybe 6510 revised to 7510 after completing job #2

baddendumb
here is a recently updated video of what was mentioned about the 2nd job

c 1 je dmerd  1 poin c tou

#####

this game seems very fun but it has alot of problems i would not recomend it unless you know what you are doing with the advanced setings

#####

plz stop baying the is game it bad riley bad

#####

i dont feel like wasting my time reviewing this game so to keep it simple dont buy it the controls are awful the mechanics within the game dont work at all and when they do are pitiful at best the graphics especially on the character model are just awful and are seemingly done straight out of the ps1 era and lastly for 7 dollars you could actually nab up a good game just keep the money in your pocket and leave this one on the shelf 210 certainly not a game i would soon play again if ever if you would like to see some gameplay where i cant even beat the level because the game is so awfully put together here is a link

tldr broken will not even launch

#####

ze controllerinos area fuked up in so mannnny waaz

#####

so now i have given the game half a chance and played it for a while i do have to say that giving the game further time didnt help it at all just frustrate me further the controls are poor at best they have not even used common controls the camera angles that you operate from are far from anything decent so the number of times i have had to remote camera just to see how close to an object is rediculous having a camera anglethat can be chase view with the ability to pan and tilt etc would have made it better the game is really buggy and it feels unfinished or unpolished so to speak but i would have to say vehicle control camera views and gameplay really needs some work

#####

dont worry everyone i played this game so you dont have too 
and trust me when i say you dont have too matter of fact you shouldnt

#####

this is shite

#####

traash

#####

vomit in the mouth

#####

game does not even run properly and has lots of textures missing do not buy this game or any game from this developer as they seem to be using it as a cash cow without proper support behind the game

at least with osmi 2 they trying to fix the game so be it slowly this issue with this game been reported for 2 months and no fixes in sight

#####

yhis game looked verry good but when i got this game i loaded the game but then it said texture error and i was not happy
tell me how to fix this

#####

pile of shit wont even load

#####

in short a polished turd the control system is horrible with touchy wasd control and no option to use controller input combine that with an awful camera system which doesnt even let you pan or zoom  pretty frustrating as the camera is always in an inconvenient location even demolition company allows these basic things

despite its appearance this game does no better job handling physics than other similar titles bulldozers bounce around the map and drive like go karts

i think the developers spent more time on the glossy ui than they did on the core of the game

#####

i tried to give this game a chance i really did but after my digger turned to jelly for the fifth time in a row while trying to drive the 12 feet towards the awaiting dumper truck launching my ever so hard to fill bucket of bricks around the map for the fifth time i punched my dog in anger and now i feel bad so i cant recommend this game to anyone

#####

this game is shit fucks up your desktop and the 15 would have been better spent burning for heat

#####

basically everything that everyone else has said is perfectly accurate clunky controlls bad physics terrible camera angles their idea of 3rd person is maybe if you move in that direction the camera will catch up eventuallyjust dont get it

#####

shit 

#####

this game is crap

#####

this game has sucky graphics and control scheme do not buy it

#####

horrible horrible game

#####

nice but looks like unfinished i really miss the physics of all objects vehicles stones bricks etc  


#####

if this game had a female sex organ i would fuck it to create the antichrist

#####

i love this type of games but unfortunately this games controls and physics is to bad and unrealistic

#####

i paid for this ghame and it didnt wotk it kept coming up with graphic errors and when it started there was no rendering of the mach8ine or the game area i want my money back as all my other downloaded steam games work fine


#####

fucking garbage

#####

yhis game sucks the camera set up sucks the pysics sucks all in all this game sucks bad dont waste your money

#####

110


#####

so badno control optionsbad graphics

#####

better than train simulator worse than every game over 5

#####

i would like to recommend this game  equipment simulators are often sincere dedicated to their simple premise and deliver on a lowball promise to replicate the experience of using these machines  its not flashy or dramatic but much like model railways theres an enduring interest in simulation

certainly all the stuff you expect is in this game  a variety of machines even a first person view as you run around your machine check it out and jump in your vehicle steer drive operate the bucket with simulated levers   doing jobs earns you money which you spend to buy better equipment so it has a nice progressioncareer system

in the case of this game however  the technical settings let everything down  no support for 4k means the game is now effectively dead for all machines of the future  ill be happy to review my review if they ever fix it but until then gaming moves on and the developers have chosen through inaction to let construction machines 2014 stay behind

#####

doesnt even    work cant really post review




im using windows 7 os

#####

i downloaded this game and it doesnt work on my computer to many crashes and error mmg i want my money back

#####

whoever shit this game out needs to be thrown in jail

#####

bad physics bad controls no graphics options terrible everything

#####

best

#####

the main menu doesnt work

good game

#####

this game is great if you like to push rocks around with double physics speed
you will only need to push about 20 rocks into a pit to pass to the next level allowing you to buy a new construction machine

buy demolish and build company instead  thats what i did 

#####

was looking foward to this but looks like anolther game that is unplayable real bad physics and camera menus are all messed up devs have you even played this game yet 

fix menus and feal for driving to make it more real are even playable and update your physics as this is no good

still no key binding ability
what the hell is going on
i may have to uninstall this game and scrape it into my never finished folder and therfore becoming obsolete

sort it out guys

#####

fun game to play be aware this game glitches a lot

#####

i cant pick up the fukcing bricks

#####

functionality of this game is horrible as soon as the game opens the controls stick and you always run forward you cannot go backwards its a ripoff do not buy this consider this your warning

#####

literally has crysis3 graphics semi sarcasm but also kind of serious its hard to describe

#####

this is by far the worst game i have ever played  gameplay is terrible and the graphics suck

#####

played the game for a solid 1000hrs of gametime now and i really enjoyed every second of it would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great camera angles drivingracing games or beyblades i r8 out of 8 m8 is fkin g8

#####

poop the game

#####

stage 4 cancer wrapped up in a construction game avoid this put your money in an actual game and not this garbage

#####

yet another mediocre attempt at capitalizing on the regular job simulator market the game is buggy as hell the graphics are terrible the controls fight you every step of the way and it is extremely suboptimized

not even worth it in a bundle

#####

one of the worst games ever the controls suck pick up these bricks put them in the truck easy enough eh nope you just fight against the controls until you finally give up the steering is rather twitchy and movments are as well 
ive tried to play it twice and i totally give up now if you could switch to mouse controls or something it might be half decent but i have playe dos games with better responce dont ever get this even if it is 60 cents save yourself the heaache

#####

lol very negative review for this game and not without a legit reason this game screams cheap and full of bugs save yourself time and money  there are much better driving simulator for sale search and thy shall find

#####

this is shit

#####

absolutely the worst game ever  controls and physics are shit  total rubbish

#####

you will like it you will play it then you will uninstall it all within the space of 5 minutes

#####

played this game for a solid 5 minutes had a headacke and instantly regretet it your your camera is stuck with looking at the stearing wheel whilest driving and the lighting is god awful would not recomend not even for a single dollar

#####

i hate this game please stay away you will be dissapionted and mostly angry steame needs to weed out some of these bombs at least offer more of a warning i would ask for a refund however i cannot hold steam accountable for shit ass games

#####

ugliest game i had played in my life dont purchase it you will lose your money

#####

why are germans so good at everything aside from making simulator games

it seems like every shit simulator game comes out of germany

#####

wish i could get my money back

#####

disclosure  this game was purchased as a gift during steam summer sale as a bet  the bet was to find a horrible game for someone and they have to play and review it  

wow  okay  discounting the graphics which probably means this is an older game that has been ported  lets just start with some basic design patterns
1  set either an icon or the escape button to back out of menus  i ended up creating 3 avatarscompanies because i thought that create means youre all set with your settings and you wanted to create the company not create or new characters
2  stop wiggling the menus when the mouse moves over them  so much rage
3 while the concept of sifting between 1 person and 3rd person is good the fixed z axis camera point while in third person means the player spends more time messing with camera angles than actually doing the mission
4 why would you ever start a player off with a hinged axis machine is beyond me

#####

i think i paid like 100 for this game when it was on sale this game is horrid its not even worth being paid that 100 back to own it

#####

blood of old meets bob the builder

the result is pure cancer

#####

lags very bad  trying to view where to go is so hard to do
i just get mad at it because can not do what the career mode want me to do because game not allowing me to or i can not see it


#####

boring and unrealistic physics engine

#####

cons 
  inexplicitly bad camera angles
  inability to change screen resolution to fit the specifications of your current monitor resolution
  horendous controls accompanied by not so good explaination of said controls

pros 
  musical masterpeice by unknown virtuoso
  graphics were scrumdiddlyumpshous

if you wanted to work in construction your entire life buy it #dreambig

#trashorbooty #trashortreasure



#####

probably my most waste of money on steam why i cant even get the program to run at all

#####

it stinks 010 would not not recoment terrible interface do not buy

#####

the controls are choppy everytime you make a turn with the loader all of the boulders fall out the missions are boating and repetive just all arround a terrible game

#####

sucks poor camera control and physiscs dont wate your money

#####

stupid game will not load properly totaly unplayable

#####

this is really bad aside of the bad controls its impossible to make a machine exactly what you want also the physics is really broken heavy rocks look like theyre made of paper or rubber when they bounce all around the place avoid this game

#####

keep away

#####

210

#####

absolute waste of time and money do not buy

#####

this wont play on my manchine could you  please remove it thank you vidieo is set to low l have higher video crad it wont work probley

#####

doesnt work  it is a waste of money  and it also proves that steam isnt all its made out to be i give it and steam minus 50 stars i would like a refund at some stage when i can get my head around steams refund policy

#####

this game is sooooo bad the camera is the worst ive seen and hard to control i got this game in a bundle for 1599 and it was a big waste of money

#####

cant even get to the menu it just goes all black

#####

i thought it will be fun bu it wasnt

even if i left my truck in the hole and moved rocks with my body in character mode
it is just too buggy also if you set the graphics to maximum it is like wearing a wrong dioptrie glasses and you see literally nothing from lights and blur

#####

#####

errorloadingburn my pcwasto of money simulator

#####

does not work broken game and cannot get through to anyone

#####

i was only able to play a short time as the graphics gave me vertigo if you easily get car sick dont buy this game same feeling in just a short time i tried it twice a few days apart with the same result sickening

#####

very poor graphics and sound topped up with extremely poor controlls and camera function i got this on a special but i wouldnt recommend it even if it was free to play needs considerable work before it can be named a functioning game

#####

not what i had expected controls are cumbersome all around bad game dont waste your money

#####

bad phisics bad picture bad camrah angles just bad  1010

#####

how can i swap this game i got the wrong one

#####

one question why no controller support or the option to customize controls its clear that the developers of this game know nothing about construction machines nor the physics of them glad i only paid 2 for this pos

#####

when i purchased construction machines 2014 i tried my best to ignore the mostly negative reviews in hopes that it would be a really cool game i could enjoy ive gotta say i should have listened to the reviews i love the premise of the game youre a construction business owner and you have to perform contracts in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks to earn more money buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business the prospect of the new tasks are fun but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated 

the controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time for example if youre attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you dont hit it just tapping the turning keys lightly doesnt turn the vehicle at all however if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way one would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game wont allow for it oh its worth mentioning if you actually do run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit the engines sound like a lawn tractor and they dont change noises based on your engine rpms or activity it just sounds like its a constant idle the music is so bad and repetitive i actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantlyidling engine which then became annoying in itself the graphics on the high setting also resemble that of a bad nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway 

all in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form i give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction pun intended save your hardearned money and purchase something else gamers

#####

would not work on windows7 64

#####

very limited option customization cannot change controls it seems the designers had no understanding of the equipment in the game frustrating gameplay 310 only for the graphics

#####

could be better physics and controls are not good the graphics on high level looks like the player is drunk

#####

this game did not meet my expectations

#####

wow now i am told my puter is too good to run this bucket of s h  i t with out crashing lolol
do not buy thi game you have been warned
i should have check the forums 1st normaly do but  fuck up this time round

#####

terrible tutorial and controls difficult to the extreme that it was unplayable

#####

absolutely aweful game horrendous control system and the camera options made me feel sick

#####

all i have to say is horrible even if you can get it cheap its not worth 1 cent

#####

i am going to list bad things and good things in this game
bad
  physics
  controls
  camera controls
  graphics
  gameplay
  sound
good
  i managed to quit and uninstall this shit

#####

i like the consturction games but this one is good to play i just do not care for the contorls controls suck bad keyboard and mouse only no controller support i had to download xpadder to use xbox 360 controller to work grahpic are pretty good but sound affects are not all that great the games timig is to fast at times and skips from time to time i means is that it langs if your  into gamepads for this game then its not for youi think they need a good patch to fix these issue soon cause right now i think the game is worth 10 no more

#####

it could be good but i fail to understand how it is efficiant to gather up a dozen of bricks around the place with a hard to control construction machine which physics behave pretty oddly faster than picking them up one by one mostly when you cant tell if the bricks are in the shovel they should stop putting years on the titles they often feels older than 2k games

#####

bad controls horrible camera angles that make the game almost impossible to know what you are doing and zero physics it took a ver long time to pick up a brick becuase it glitched around and phased through things advanced physics and realistic contols bullcrap brutal do not buy

#####

bad game dont waste your money on it

#####

this game got the worst physics

#####

this game suck

#####

theres really nothing good i can say about this game the graphics the controls the camera its all bad this game is crap

#####

this game was a complete waste of money it came with a bundle so i never paid full price thank god the camera angles are terrible and controls are wacky the graphics look like their for an old xp game dont buy this game

#####

abi grafikler berbat ekran çözünürlük ayarları kara şeklinde 800x600 hissi verdi bi an 

kamera görüntüsü berbat 75 bile etmez indirimdeytken aldım ama keşke almasaydım 

tavsiye etmiyoru çöpe atacak paranız varsa bile bunu almayın

#####

incredibly difficult to control almost to the point of being abnoxious  cant believe someone would charge for this

#####

having walked past a construction site once when i was a kid i can say that this is one of the poorest representations of a butterfly simulator 
graphics are low grade and fuzzy settings are limited hitboxes etc are poorly laid out cameras however are not laid out at all switching between views has added more functionality to pong than it has to this

can i has a refund

#####

i am really disapointed for a game thats is called construction machines there is really very little constructing going on ive come half way through the game and all i have been doing so far is loading and unloading and pouring some concrete that took  less than 60 sec to complete the missions are really short however this is a good thing the machines in the game are so bad it would be torture to have longer missions the title is great everything else isnt the gameplay feels akward and like an early beta controls are akward and not acurate at all even driving around feels strange 

shame with a little more work this game could maybe even work

#####

for the love of god do not buy this worse camera angles and physics ever the controls are very bad just trying to get things into your bucket is a massive challenge with the camera glitching your every move and the debris with its weird physics just doesnt seem to want to go into said bucket
