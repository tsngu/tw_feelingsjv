got the game because it sounded like fun just building a raft while adrift in the ocean then you realize there are objectives and adventures then you realize its 3am and you have stuff to do in the morning then you play one more hour to get to a good stopping point cool game

#####

its a very fun game to play even by yourself if you have 0 friends like me

#####

just finished the game

bthe goodb
as with most survival games the early game is where much of the excitement lies while discovering everything for the first time

the shark  love ithate it  its a great mechanic to keep the pressure on  although the pressure lessens greatly as you move towards end game more on this later   some people in the forums have complained that the shark is to tropey and furthers a harmful stereotype about sharks  i can see this easily being remedied with other nemesis creatures stopping by giant squid anyone

building the raft is fun  it sort of reminds me of the old school minecraft skyblock variant  


bthe not so goodb
inventory management is a chore

getting to the end game is gratifying but after that the both the reason for continuing on and the replay value tanks  im assuming the devs are planning for content beyond the current endgame stage to remedy this

the shark returns too quickly after death  i think it should also be more difficult to kill the shark so the reward a longer break from shark harrassment should increase with the risk

it bothered me that i couldnt build on islands  it also bothered me that i couldnt create a skiff second raft for excursions  everything in this game must be attached to the starting raft

its odd that all the sea life except the shark and the odd clam is not visible in the water  im catching fish left and right never see one in the water

there are some game mechanicbalance issue that once discovered make the game trivially easy  these need to be addressed

the conclusion
solid early access game  has a lot of potential and room to grow  hope the devs keep moving along that path

#####

very chill game youll start slow but then once you get collection nets youll get resources pretty quickly i only wish i had friends to play it with cuz it seems like it would be even better with friends 

edit i am very flattered that so many people tried to send me friend requests but i just have to say the above was a joke im too socially awkward to actually try and make new friends but i appreciate the attempt xd

#####

would i reccommend this game  yeah you know i would  if you can play it with a person  and maybe on easy  definitely on easy on your own

listen listen i know  youre a proud gamer you dont play crap on easy  i get it  my save game is called easy mode offends me  and yet there it is thats what i did

basically theres not a lot of dangerous foes for the most part not until much much later in the game anyway  i mean theres a shark yeah so you stay on the raft and stab him in his sharky face when he tries to nibble on your raft  and then lure him into shallow water throw bait and repeatedly poke him with sharp sticks until he expires from deathpoke

so really the challenge is mostly in managing your hunger and thirst  on normal especially early in the game it feels like all youre doing is boiling little thimblesful of water and cooking the tiniest sardines while your character is on the cusp of dying from gothic faminethirst  its kinda tedious frankly  so on easy that gets turned down  the shark will still shark you as hard as ever the sardines are just as tiny and the thimbles of water still fail to slake your thirst but the thirst and hunger meters deplete less quickly so you actually have time to go do other things

its a pretty good coop implementation  my bestest gaming buddy who is also my wife and reads these thingshello and i sort of appreciate the slow wafting across the ocean scavenging flotsam building up a bigger raft and inventing sharper pokesticks to fend off things  playing this with somebody is nice because the game is stupendously lonely otherwise its just you the ocean tiny atolls and occasionally the detritus of somebody who was there years ago and is no longer

rventually when you have enough technology and youre not purely at the whims of the ocean a plot starts to reveal itself with places to explore  we love exploring

so in the end or if you were looking for one of those fashionable tldrs this is a slowpaced game but can be kind of relaxing for the most part appreciating the ocean fishing up the tiniest sardines and slowly wafting to the next adventure

#####

the gameplay is beautiful creative and i enjoyed it but now after 3 years on that raft im a bit tired i am 53 years old can you finish this game before i die

#####

raft is a relaxing occasionally zenlike experience as you bob on the open ocean collecting resources crafting goodies both practical and cosmetic and expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining ship occasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear he deserved it or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird you deserved it the survival elements are fairly simple and i find them welltuned and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed theres even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it theres an excellent balance between the peaceful seafaring and island exploring and occasionally battling with the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded although its still unfinished and development seems very slow 

h1bring a friend as shark baith1

the biggest benefit of raft to me is the seamless coop hosted on a local machine your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you if you should want to let them progress without you which i have done a few times you can easily send them the file to load its not quite as good as it being persistently online but its easy enough i played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together assigning jobs and positions working as a team to explore the ocean and the land baiting the shark away from the others tucking unconscious bodies into bed you know all the sorts of things friends do for each other

h1chest warsh1

however i will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage i cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories painstakingly labelled with signs and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box or scuba gear into my food box in the end i told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it it staved off divorce i also got yelled at a few times for rearranging the rooms but really these guys have no interior design skills look im type a okay i need order on my boat even in the apocalypse

h1whats badh1

the main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on its getting there but no one knows when itll pass the finish line and youre just hoping it doesnt have a heart attack en route im patiently waiting but i do wish the full experience was ready its come a long way from release but i cant help but feel theres still a ways to go

despite the snaillike development ive really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patch so it gets a thumbs up from me

this game captures a lot of great parts for what its trying to be and its an early access done right they had a vision for what they wanted the game to become we got content  a story and best of all a fun experience there is both chill building and tense diving moments with exploration inbetween my only negative factor would be a single small glitch and an annoying enemy but otherwise a really great game

def a recommended for friends and solo 8510

#####

left my friend on an island because he did not want to let me have 50 sheep chickens and llamas and raft covered in plants would desert him again 1010

#####

mixed review so i will list the good and bad

good
fun to play with friends
you have stuff to do for 20 hours
exploring and survival is done well
in creative you can build a pirate ship

bad
sometimes lag
sometimes trouble locating islands
alone this is boring sorry shark you are not enough company
my alpaca named marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat fixed now but rip 4 marcels

edit
new engine and rudder added much control
new islands are easily explored by one person
lore added
finally you can charge your empty batteries
finally you can too farm honey on your raft
character models to find
biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me
if you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup

#####

if this shark breaks my raft one more time im going to commit a war crime

this game got me a girl

#####

right off the bat you can try an early verion of this title for free over at urlhttpsraftitchioraftitchurl this will give you a strong idea of what you are in for

birafti is a neat idea that falls apart a bit due to big ambitions crashing with what feels like a very small projectb this really is an itchsized game and if you go into it with that understanding  you will have a fun enough time with that being said the pricepoint here on steam is certainly not itchsized particularly considering that you are going to have to have friends that play it too

bthe best part of this game is that it forces true cooperation in a survival gameb we all have that one friend that just runs off in iminecrafti to do their own thing and not really interact well that wont happen here the worst part of this game is that it feels like the developers took notes about how early survival crafting games worked but could not innovate any further its all a giant grind that is all too in your face for this pricepoint i expect a bit more nuance and elegance

bprosb
this title truly forces cooperation in a survival sandbox and for the most part its quite fun

bconsb
the grind is very real and there is little done to try to hide it
considering the actual quality of the game idea content optimization and replay value  id say its overpriced by about half 

bwhat you see is what you get hereb just know what you are getting into

h1raft reviewh1
dont feel like reading the whole thing 
down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game 

h1introductionh1
if being chased by a shark named bruce while hoarding all the trash in the ocean sounds fun it is because it is at least once you go over the initial tedious hours raft is a survival game in which rather than fight zombies or demons you have to deal witha lot of water aka the ocean discover the story left behind as you explore uncharted seas

h1control and map designh1
raft plays out in a way that can be praised and criticized simultaneously it gives freedom in approaching base creation and exploring the islands it features resulting in a good experience in the long run however it has some design choices that can leave it feeling rather tedious and damage the games pace

for example exploring an island is always thrilling players must move around the land while keeping tabs on their raft otherwise they could lose it animals on land can be dangerous but offer a good amount of food for the long term making them an attractive highrisk highreward hunt likewise expanding the raft is rewarding too as the player can grow crops upgrade their items and most importantly have a comfortable space to move around

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2987956821

conversely the fact that certain materials can only be obtained by specific tools or that they can get monotonous in the long run hampers some of the possibilities raft looks to offer islands start to look and feel the same while the progression of the raft can be determined by how many players are playing one to two players can result in dull slow growth in contrast to four to eight players which makes the grinding of materials more bearable

h1 strong pointsh1
the strong point of raft is that the game visuals are mesmerizing while the gameplay can be engaging if done right it is a game that is both challenging and fun where most troubles have a temporal solution rather than a permanent one until you reach a certain point the ocean looks beautiful and comes alive as waves threaten to swallow your raft or put you in reach of the shark to bite

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2987957250

fighting the shark on itself offers some degree of ingenuity regarding gameplay one player can distract it while other attacks or timing attacks correctly on certain sections can stop the shark midattack if confrontation is not your forte you can use shark bait to get rid of the shark for a while these options in dealing with problems allow a good amount of freedom for the player to consider their approach to situations

h1 art design and visuals h1
the visuals of raft are excellent with the ocean looking vibrant both from the outside and the inside the islands offer ecosystems on land and sea as numerous animals live in both areas you can find giant birds throwing rocks at you or a group of fish to collect it is not the most pretty game out there but it indeed commits to making the aspect of being stranded in a raft appealing visually

h1sound replayability and performanceh1
there is no voice acting nor does the narrative demand lengthy sessions raft is all about making your own story of survival and the sound effects are solid rain waves and water movement all have a noise that immerses you more and i found my experience at best during solid tides in the deepest part of the ocean 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2987957514

replayabilitywise the game is as infinite as you want to play it rather than being a game you replay after beating it however this title seems more in line with having a long run on a server if the player desires there is a narrative to follow but there is enough room to make gigantic constructions on the water so that the raft looks more like a city

 my specs are rtx 2060 36 gb of ram intel core i711700k  core i7 11th gen rocket lake 8core 36 ghz lga 1200 on high settings the fps was between 60 to 90 at all times

h1 conclusionh1
raft is a beautiful survival game that while at times can feel like an unfinished beta of sorts adds something unique to the survival genre fight the ocean as you look to survive being stranded lack of food or water or being eaten by sharks i recommend the game if you enjoy survival games and have at least three other friends to play with

810  great

ahoy there mateys welcome to raft a survival crafting exploring adventure game here you will test your mettle against the elements wild animals and your own personal shark stalker yo ho ho lets get down to business now

h1 the good h1
 shiver me timbers this game has amazing music
 intriguing story and exploring
 catch and collect materials to build your raft
 find blueprints and recipes to cook and craft

h1 the neutral h1
 still in ea so needs some optimizations
 some qol improvements neededexample an autosort would be lovely
 fps is not always that great
 could use more animalson land and in sea

h1 the uglyneeds improvement h1
 hitboxes feel off and need some work
 ocean life is very sparse and could use a lot moreunder water feels barren and lifeless
 could use more ambianceocean sounds wind blowing weather effects thunderlightning
  after a while islands feel the sameneeds more island variety and sizes

that said i really do like this game the music is truly amazing and the game is fun i love that i can craft and build my own boat explore and go island to island 

i really hope the developers realize they have a gem it just need some polishing and refining to make it even more amazing please devs never give up never surrender savvy 

good luck out there and have fun kg

2023 update finished the game with two friends all the earlier points still apply maybe not the grim story bit  the later chapters are more easygoing than the first few the playthrough was lots of fun and quite literally a journey id say this is what makes raft different from the other build  survive games  your base camp is mobile so you get to build permanent stuff and explore places at the same time thumbs up

the start can be very misleading for the impatient among us it might seem like your only goal is to throw the hook around and gather junk it isnt once you expand your raft and get the basic needs water and food somewhat covered the game will slowly start expanding before you and it usually manages to offer some nice surprises as it does

it also has the best firstperson basebuilding system ive ever seen so far coming from a person scarred for life by vanilla fallout 4 basebuilding if you want to place something somewhere you usually can or there is a clever way of doing so

the story at the time im typing this only the first chapter was released is okay considering its revealed to you by means of notes static objects and locations oh and its quite a lot more grim than the colourful visuals suggest

and its not a very easy game if youre not planning ahead and paying attention youll get eaten youll drown youll get stomped mauled or die of dehydration id say difficultywise this is somewhat similar to the long dark but quite a lot more forgiving

definitely looking forward to chapter 2

#####

im deathly afraid of the ocean but i love this game 
it gives me a heart attack every now and then but its worth it

#####

one of my friends is scared of the ocean and stays on the boat while we force the other to fish and its slowly driving them insane great game 1010 recommend

raft is a great twist on the survival game instead of running around on land gathering materials to build a base and defend it your entire world is your raft lose it and youre dead you cant just run away from danger and start in a new area i bought two copies so i could play with my teenager and that was some of the best gaming weve done together very family friendly but she wouldnt go into the water for the first ten hours so i had to do all the harvesting with bruce around little shy on content right now but solid core game play

#####

 review written in version 102 

 ithis is a really calm game that will give you cozy and heartwarming vibes except the shark which will snack on you if you decide to swim for a biti 
 bto sum it up these are my pros and cons about the gameb

bprosb
 the game itself is really immersive and entertaining no minutes are spent wasting your time
 you always have to keep yourself alive by managing food and water also repairing your raft and that adds to the survival genre of the game
 biggest pro about it is the feel and look of the game it has a cartoony art style which fits everything really well
 the game is fun while playing alone and its even more fun while playing with a friendfriends
 you can build your raft however you want to with the blocks and items provided

bconsb
 although the game keeps you immersed it has a brutal end which i reached in about 6 hours while playing with my friend
 you can keep playing after the ending and buildexpand your raft into a huge ship but as the game is now there is not enough content and replay value 
there are some bugs and glitches but its nothing unexpected from a game thats in early development

 iall in all i recommend the game even in its early stages because i truly believe that with the right support the developers can shape this game into a beautiful story with enough content to keep you playing for longer than a few hoursi

#####

prettyyyy epic game
the crafting in this game is just so realistic 
for example i found an old pringles can and combined it with two sponges a rubber glove and a rubberband

#####

outstanding 
very interesting and challenging storyline makes you a bit sad when its ends because you want more i need more please most probably will be hard to play it solo i suggest suggest to play as 2 players this game is cool no joke


#####

bit of a gem in the rough im very glad i gave it a try

its a sort of survival base building  on a raft with a mean ol grumpy shark chasing you down nonstop so far developers are active too

quite a steep learning curve and you will most likely become shark bait on your first try or starve to death on the first island you hop onto while that scary ass shark tears your raft into pieces but soon the soothing sea and its calming waves becomes your ally and you begin to learn its secrets and grow your puny piece of wood and torn plastic into a mighty seaworthy settlement capable of sustaining life

fighting especially with bowarrows is a part i least enjoy it is very clumsy ive seen vids of people mastering it but personally i didnt have the patience nor will to keep on throwing away resources to learn to time it and aim it right so i just stick to stabbing things

the game world reminds me strongly of the movie waterworld with a cross to riverworld since the sea behaves more like a river going huge circles instead of a square map all and all very unique and pleasant atmosphere

btw while it is a great coop game it is totally doable as a single player too

#####

the game is absolutely great that said you shouldnt play it
the developer seems to have ignored a major vulnerability for several months that exposes anyone playing online to the most severe attacks imaginable0 click remote code execution by outside attackersnot the host or another player but anyone as soon as you are connected to any session this can compromise your whole pc without you noticing anything and lead to someone else controlling your online banking shops credit cards or private conversations

thats not acceptable 

update the vulnerability was fixed after the developers were forced to do so by a third party releasing the information about the vulnerability to the public since everyone was at risk for so long with their knowledge i will not remove this negative review

its a fun game when u have friends

usually i dont write reviews but the raft game is really worth it
raft is a survival game which puts us in the middle of the ocean youll immediately notice the smallsized raft youre on we have to start collecting materials from the sea immediately planks palm tree leaves plastic etc to be able to expand our boat otherwise well perish thanks to the shark swimming the closest

things are getting interesting when our raft is big enough for us to sleep on a bed build a grill for preparing food or a purifier for cleaning salt water and even have a research table close by to come up with new plans once a new material is found eg ore or copper from the depths of the sea it can be added to all plans requiring it as a prerequisite later on we can start growing our own vegetables plant our own flowers or trees and can start building our own pieces of furniture to make accommodation feel more comfortable

anchoring will be important in case we wish to explore the islands we find vegetation on these masses of land can be quite lush but we should also pay attention to the precious ore or junk found underwater spear and bow will be at our disposal to fight the shark that is lurking close to us at all times those with a more strategic approach can use fish as bait to lure the creature away

crafting and exploring with a friend is a joy in this game there are some glitches here and there and there are many more things to be added  but raft still offers many hours of playtime in its current state it isnt a very pretty game but it has acceptable graphics  daynight cycle happens quite often and looks nice after all theres an achievement that makes it a must to be ashore for over a year

if you liked the forest and you are not seasick pick this one up when on sale

while its just another generic survival game this one has a great twist to it instead of constantly moving back to your static base the concept of having a floating base makes the exploration experience a lot better
id suggest playing this with atleast one friend its a relaxing game and its easy to assign tasks to keep everyone busy
the main story is intriguing but rather shortso far aside of the main story theres plenty of stuff to do though that can feel a bit grindy at times
hrhr
bprosb
 you are constantly doing something
wether it be trying to stay alive foodwater management exploring or raft upgradingdefendingrepairing
 satisfying progression in the story exploration crafting  ship building
 relaxing music
 lots of freedom on how to build your raft

bconsb
 can feel grindy at times

 ocean life is sparsehrhr
ithat being said if youre thinking about giving this game a try go for it
i just hope they add a bit more variety new islands to discover more life in the sea etc
it could also use a bit more ambience soundsi
hrhr
btldr worth the money even though its still in its early stagesb

i started this game with a friend thinking it would need some polishing as it was early access but hey were quarantined so lets give it a shot

8 hours later we were hunting sharks for meat building a fortress of a raft and we had just arrived at the beginning of the story line this game is so well crafted and such a fun and unique style of game i wish i had a better comparison but its the minecraft of the sea my friends and i kept discovering new ways to explore and craft in the game and were hounding our other friends to join us

seriously hats off to the devs this is a really great fresh fun game

#####

fun game but you need friends

#####

this is a very unique survival game you are stranded in the middle of the ocean trying to survive a castaway lifestyle even though its early access raft is a really enjoyable game that being said raft does focus on being strongly mutiplayer rather than a casual independent game solo playing is not impossible but the game is more fun in a group 

some of the things i would love if they could add 

1 being able to reach the highest islands without a very very tall raft maybe implement the plastic hook to grab the the land and propell upwards

2 add more miscellaneous decorations and objects so that creative mode can be more fun to create in 

3 loading your friends world when they are offline especially if your playing together its sucks having to wait for them to decide to come online 

4 add more weather changes and biomes and possible a land map and treasure hunts 

5 more sea life and sea creatures adding fish underwater with vast reefs would make the game more appealing 

6 be able to access storage if someone else is using it aswell it sucks waiting in line 

7 add character customize hair color facial features and clothes

8 be able to make mutiple different rafts so that mutiplayers can split off into different teams

9 add some more weapons to kill sharks and seagulls with

10 fishing net to collect fish instead of live fishing

b jarrizards pros and cons review b

iwhile the game is decent enough to be played with friends on a night out i wouldnt recommend it at full price it shows promise the game as it is now is just lacking and unpolished theres not much to do youll find yourself always focused on food and water crafting more stuff to make it easier to get food and water etc maybe itll change overtime when more updates are rolled in i

h1prosh1
 overall look and atmosphere of the game is nice relaxing too
 constantly updated by the developers
 better with friends multiplayer support
 enough freedom on how you choose to build your raft

h1consh1
 unrealistic thirst and hunger it felt like a chore catering to your characters needs than actually surviving
 unimmersive environments islands are random gen and sometimes theres no way to reach the top where you can get most of the resources from
 bad creature ai the shark attacks at fixed interval and rate too predictable and not fun usually theyre just there to hinder your progress on whatever youre building
 no physics if a foundation breaks everything above that breaks along with it 
 lack of content depending on how fast you progress you can see what the game is trying to offer in 510 hours 
 while the soundtrack is good it becomes repetitive because the loop is too short and it gets boring as you spend most of your time ingame without music even the sound effects are recycled over and over

b end of review b

#####

friends forced me to get this game i was skeptical because i typically dont enjoy survival games and later realized i had mistaken this game for stranded deep which is a farce of a game

starting off was confusing i struggled to even figure out how to purify water but fast forward one day and im having a blast i naturally donned the coat of master architect in our group and was in charge of designing our raft layout took us a while to even realize theres a story in the game and thats when things really took off

i dont think its your typical survival game and thats likely why i loved it the combat is limited and usually initiated by choice and the healthhungerthirst management is fairly forgiving and straightforward unlike my previous experiences with survival games

i really like how the game has a relaxing sailing phase where you can chat with friends and kick back and then eventually you reach an island and go all christopher columbus on it

it was hard to choose between easy to learnhard to master and actual brain usage just because the learning curve in the beginning is a bit steep theres no tutorial or guidance so figuring out what you need to do in the beginning can be a bit intensive and you will die a lot unless you get into the community and ask questionslook for tips once i got into the community and figured out how the game worked it was like oh im dumb how did i not notice this cause its actually really simple but not necessarily intuitive oh and build a spear and extra hook as soon as you can like earlier than you think youll need one thank me later

 youll need a second life for grinding
ok so theres literally no grind to complete the story if you just go story island to story island and make the minimum pit stops in between you can complete the whole story without a drop of real grind however if you want to take your time and build a really cool raft and really get into the crafting and building aspects of the game which is my favorite part then you will need to grind for resources the minimum is there to survive and complete the story but any extras youre gonna need to grind for that said the grind is actually pretty enjoyable gathering resources can actually be pretty relaxing so even though its grind its enjoyable grind

great story and the story islands are super interesting and fun to explore being able to go back to story islands and they respawn resources so you get to explore again is also a nice little feature granted the stuff is in the same place but what the stuff is changes

if you just wanna rush through the story speed runners do it in about 23 hours but if you like to just build and build and explore the time is limitless im close to 500 hours and the bulk is on a single save even when the story is over you can keep on playing as long as you want which is great then theres creative mode which lets you just build  no supplies or grind needed if you like building its really limitless

some bugs can be annoying like on occasion you might get stuck on a charging hog  thats probably the most annoying but there arent any major major bugs and the dev team does a great job when a bug comes up at trying to fix it and address it then there are some bugs like the floating floor trick that started as bugs but now its become so widely used that people dont even want it fixed for the most recent update people literally said please dont fix this bug so yes some annoying ones but they dont really take away from the game so dont let those couple of glitches scare you off

overall i give this game an 810 just because of the few glitches that can be annoying and because of the learning curve with no tutorial or instructions the community has been great at stepping in and trying to guide new players though so if you buy be sure and check out the community page andor the raft discord if you have any trouble once you get the hang of it the fun is pretty limitless between just working on a main save and creative mode and then even speed running if youre into that theres also a very active mod community so youll find a lot of stuff to do absolutely a worthwhile buy

we want raft v2

#####

i did not think that this would be the survival game i was always looking for

#####

amazing game with friends especially if you like base building  open world games 910

#####

the shark is kinda thicc ngl

#####

i like the game its one i always come back to a sea twist on survival building games its just leaving early access now and whilst i feel theres a lot more that can be added to the game its amazing to see how much its grown over the years i love that its actively updated and maintained the graphics though not terrible arent the best i cant wait to see how pretty this game could be in a few more years the price is worth the game its really worth getting if you like survival building games with optional difficulty settings from creative  peaceful  to hard  impossible

#####

a very good way to ignore online lessons

#####

raft multiplayer and online has a very critical security breach
that can be used to execute arbitraty code on your computer
the developers did not fix this breach so far even thoug they were informed months ago
this breach was found by the french security firm synacktiv

this breach is so critical that i will not start the game until it is fixed
and i would recommend you to do so

edit 030123 on 221222 the developers published a patch with the patchnote
we just wanted to let you know that we have just now pushed a small update containing a rework of the multiplayer network code to increase security for hosts and clients

they do not reference directly to this vulnerability according to a reddit user this patch
fixes the vulnerability

even if this fixes the vulnerability ignoring and closing bug reports for months and only fixing critical security bugs after a security firm publicly informs the players about it is very bad practice obviously the developer does not have the security of their players in mind but the bad press

#####

for months i ignored this game misjudging it as a cheap copy of subnautica but boy i was wrong while subnautica makes you go underwater this on keeps you on surface raft duh but the game keeps the surface survival as challenging as any other game in the genre no thanks to that fg shark its a very fun game takes sometime in getting used to once you get the mechanics its easy sailing there after another thing i like about this game is that it runs well on almost all system my potato gt 1030 keep this at 80 fps at normal setting since the game is still evolving no complaints here

its 2022 and the game is still awesome 

#####

i got mauled by a bear and my booty ate by a shark also i guess pollution is good cause in this game its your best resource the junk humanity left behind

i dont usually write reviews for early access titles but with raft i am making an exception i actually did the same with ithe foresti several years ago there i simply forgot to replay the game when version 10 came out my review is based on version 008

raft is a survival game which puts us in the middle of the ocean youll immediately notice the smallsized raft youre on we have to start collecting materials from the sea immediately planks palm tree leaves plastic etc to be able to expand our boat otherwise well perish thanks to the shark swimming the closest

things are getting interesting when our raft is big enough for us to sleep on a bed build a grill for preparing food or a purifier for cleaning salt water and even have a research table close by to come up with new plans once a new material is found eg ore or copper from the depths of the sea it can be added to all plans requiring it as a prerequisite later on we can start growing our own vegetables plant our own flowers or trees and can start building our own pieces of furniture to make accommodation feel more comfortable

anchoring will be important in case we wish to explore the islands we find vegetation on these masses of land can be quite lush but we should also pay attention to the precious ore or junk found underwater spear and bow will be at our disposal to fight the shark that is lurking close to us at all times those with a more strategic approach can use fish as bait to lure the creature away

crafting and exploring with a friend is a joy in this game there are some glitches here and there and there are many more things to be added most notably an endgame content or even a story explaining who we are and how come were drifting on sea but raft still offers many hours of playtime in its current state it isnt a very pretty game but it has acceptable graphics  daynight cycle happens quite often and looks nice after all theres an achievement that makes it a must to be ashore for over a year

if you liked ithe foresti and you are not seasick pick this one up when on sale

#####

a delightful twist on the survival crafting genre  the catch is that the initial learning curve is brutal

pointers to survive the early game
1  watch bruce  swimming near your raft is not safe but you can swim elsewhere
2  fear land  large islands are death  go explore but plan to die
3  stockpile  build lots of storage  at the start half your raft will be storage  keep reserves of palm planks plastic and food outside of your inventory  only carry the tools youre using  if you need space you can dump blueprints and seeds in the ocean you monster

#####

played this game so hard that i got paralyzed literally ive got this genetic problem with my calcium channels where if i dont eat right and if i sit around for too long my muscles stop working i played this game almost nonstop until i woke up having to go to the icu in a state of semiquadriplegia unfortunately this has turned me off from playing the game since but if you dont have my 1 in 60000 person illness then i think youll really enjoy it

h1brust building mechanics  the forest storytelling  raftbh1

originally when i played raft upon its first early access release i dont recall there being much of a story if at all it was more a proof of concept fast forward almost 3 years and 2 chapters later and weve got a pretty solid survival game

graphically its nothing visually stunning but it looks good working within the boundaries of the unity engine this may also be the reason for its biggest downside being i generally only get around 3040 frames per second max at any given time and as low as 14 frames per second at the later stages in the game having such a large raft and visiting large islands im hopeful this is something that will be rectified once the game leaves early access though

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2462090262

gameplay wise its what youd expect from a survivalsandbox game base building hunting fishing looting as well as its own story based missions all of which it does rather well so much so that im excited for the next chapter

itldr a great sandboxbase building game hindered only by its poor optimisationi

#####

raft is a good beginner style survivor open world game the story graphics and game play is child friendly and easy to master i have had no issues on the default difficulty in thriving and building my raft into a boat i even have a grand piano on the top deck 

the story is difficult to follow this is due to audio issues where the game seems to have trouble knowing what sounds take priority and it is not consistent which choice is made i fiddled with the audio having to turn most things down by over fifty percent to better hear the voices while sometimes having to turn the audio down because the voice audio becomes abruptly loud in all this is not a make or break and only impacts the story aspects all but the voice audio was fine the music is relaxing and well chosen

the game play feels a little dated having to rely heavily on a micromanaging method of having items in the specific interaction overall the game played nice and controlling the raft and using the equipment is fantastic it is the crafting or combined tools being used that the rules become inconsistent what might have worked for most things will not always work for all things even if the process is exactly the same

the graphics are great but require frequent reloading after prolonged play the water levels seem to overcome the raft in a time played equals higher water levels not sure what causes this but it becomes quite comically bad i left the game on overnight to see how it would turn out and i was not disappointed the bottom deck was nearly completely submerged with waves starting to show on the deck above it this is fixed with a reloading of the game the game is pleasant to view up to that point 

overall raft is a fantastic game with issues that are present but do not overtake the experience the game is kid friendly and an excellent introduction into open world survival gaming

#####

definitely a good game with friends recommended highly just that i dont have friends to play with

#####

actually a very good survival game at first it seems difficult to get anything going and food seems to be on a shortage but once you get established the game is actually really well made the latest update as well added so many things to the game which it needed and there is so much to do and more to learn about the game i highly recommend this game the shark isnt really that much of a problem i feel they should make it a little better

one of the best survival games out right now
you build a raft over time from floating debris and looting and exploring islands

gets huge updates altough they take a while
has coop which i imagine should be awesome i only played solo
similar to subnautica another amazing survival game

can absolutely recommend and if youre looking for a coop game this is the one

h1a little game with a big hookh1

raft is a simple game that is simply fun i cant describe this one for you if you havent played it then youre missing something i finished it some while back and am still drawn to it because of the peaceful gameplay when youre not playing hardcore the music is lovely but the concept of floating at sea on a raft is really immersive 

though the story finishes when youve beat the game the creative mode and hardcore survival mode give it replay value if you can pick this up sometime on sale even better i highly recommend this jewel for gamers of all ages

this game has mostly replaced minecraft for me as the game to play to just zone out and relax granted you cant completely stop paying attentionyou have to keep an eye on your hunger and thirst and that damn shark thinks rafts taste delicious for some reasonbut its about as chill a game as you could ask for without going completely mindnumbing like bejeweled or something the graphics arent particularly aweinspiring but this isnt meant to be a aaa graphics kind of game its a fun cartoony style that works well

fair warning the games storyline is not as cheerful as the graphics style i just started a new playthrough to unlock all the characters which have no mechanical benefit as far as i can tell just for aesthetics and finding all the notes and scraps left behind families and friends separated or more likely killed it can get pretty heavy for an otherwise chill game kudos to the writers

end of the day this game is phenomenal i received it as a gift and its maybe the best gifted game i own even if id paid for it id have happily spent it knowing what i know now worth every penny

raft is a survival crafting game and like so many in the genre has a fun early game stumbles in the midgame and falls flat by the end

rafts central premise is that you are a person stranded on a raft in the middle of the ocean and the early game sells this perfectly theres nothing around you but blue sea and the garbage floating in it you have nothing to help you except for a hook made of trash and the four pontoons youre standing on and you have the constant threat of death both from lack of food and water and from the everpresent shark circling below your raft

so you start hooking garbage you learn how to make things you protect and expand your raft you fix damage you navigate you learn to survive you have fun in short eventually you bump into islands find new components and crafting materials and the complexity of what you can make expands soon you can sail to the islands you choose to and thats when you enter the midgame

the midgame of raft consists of travelling between story islands rather than randomly encountered ones exploring them and collecting the tier 2 materials and recipes found there this is where the cracks start to show both in story and gameplay the setting  that the entire world is flooded to the point where only a few skyscrapers and islands show above the water  is already ridiculous and the characters and behaviors that exist within that setting are frankly silly but well get to that in the endgame

its the gameplay that begins to be a problem in almost all survival crafting games there is a rule as complexity increases so to does automation this means that as it takes more complex and rare items and materials to craft the next thing the previously made things become easier to make often via automation this stops the player from feeling overwhelmed its very easy to lose track of what you need to be collecting and when especially when equipment degrades with use so automating lowtier items helps prevent that

raft has zero automation and everything you equip degrades constantly this is bexhaustingb you can set up automatic collection of tier 1 materials but no there is no automatic crafting to replace broken equipment and neither tier 2 or 3 materials can be collected any way but manually moving into the endgame and tier 3 recipes and materials is where this issue really shows

tier 3 ore can only be found with a metal detector islands have either 1 or 23 metal detector areas within them you only have a 50 chance of even finding an item that can be tier 3 ore with each dig you need dozens of ore to craft the tier 3 equipment youll need obviously this takes an absurd amount of time but the truly painful part is that while youre searching for it all your other equipment is actively breaking meaning you still need to manually collect all the tier 2 materials iandi manually craft every single thing you need

it is literally not worth your time to bother

thankfully you dont need tier 3 equipment to finish the game but sadly the game ends with a wet fart the climax the story is building to the culmination of years of development is a villain who is angry that people turned luxury apartments into living quarters and farms byes you read that rightb the final boss of the game takes over the last human settlement and jails everyone because he is mad that luxury apartments are being used to keep humanity alive

this is of course meant to be a commentary one greed and shortsightedness etc but its so pathetically blunt that the message simply doesnt land not helping is the fact that this final boss has a northern european accent that is so ridiculous to hear as an english speaker that all his threats just sound hilarious he literally sounds as if goldmember from the austin powers movies was threatening you with death thatd be fine in a comedy but raft takes its setting seriously 

its just a really truly pathetic end to the game

all told raft is very much a mixed bag it absolutely nails its ridiculous setting especially in the early game which is very fun but the mid and endgame gameplay failures make it a chore to finish and the story being completely unimpactful doesnt help 

i still recommend it but not unreservedly

ps raft has an active modding community that has worked hard to counteract some of the criticisms in this review if you do pick up the game make sure to check out the great work the community is doing

#####

overall quite a fun game to play with friends however it can get a little bit repetitive at times if i could give the game developers one suggestion it would be to add the ability for players to be able to customise their character eg clothing accessories visual appearance et cetera

i tried many games looking for the perfect one for my open world survival craft itch i found it in irafti

you start on a 2x2 square raft about the size of four wood pallets roped together in the middle of an endless ocean hungry thirsty and harassed by a shark who is determined to eat what little of a raft you have out from under you then eat you too

the first half hour is brutal i spend my first three hours restarting a halfdozen times as i struggled and failed to survive or made stupid mistakes once i built a water purifier a little cooking pot and a sail and had gotten past that initial period of panicked survival the game became a glorious time gathering resources researching crafting and eventually building my beautiful little yacht where my maya lives out her days with tala sailing the tropical seas and occasionally plundering islands for their riches

past that first panicsurvival period this game becomes a delightfully chill experience the sea is full of refuse and fishing it out of the water is your primary source of resources there are over a dozen handcrafted islands most of which are small that are procedurally placed around you as you travel  they have an abundance of resources both on land and in the reefs below that you will need to gather to flourish i got more than my moneys worth in hours of enjoyment before i even started the story 

while you get the blueprints early it takes a while before you are ready to build the receiver and associated antennas once you do and you start following the signals the story really begins the coordinates you get will lead you to unique locations each with its own challenges and lore the notes you find are voiceacted and i loved them especially detto

your raft is your mobile base you can expand upgrade and customize it in many ways but be warned you cannot build a new one from scratch so dont die the same way i did on my first try by getting overly excited when i saw my first island and jumping on it without anchoring my raft if you lose it you cannot just build a new one

the environments are beautiful the enemy types are limited but most are an enjoyable challenge combat while simple feels good in this game but the biggest standout has to be the music the music is iso goodi so chill and relaxing and it just makes me feel happy i could easily listen to it all day

the game has a lot of qol features i give an especially hearty bthank youb to the devs for including a motion sickness mode that drastically reduces the rocking of the raft especially during rain 

any negatives are scarce and minor it is silly that you have to cut down trees to get their fruit all plants grown from seeds should produce at least one seed when harvested i wish certain things stacked in inventory which do not like shark bait after over a hundred hours i added in a few mods to my game nothing gamechanging save perhaps for a mod that makes sure seeds drop but a small number of little improvements such as being able to mirrorbuild engines that i think were overlooked in the design

i have played long after having completed the story and i continue to come back to the game and play it more even after starting other games it is just such a calm and enjoyable way to spend a weekend or evening i absolutely recommend this game

raft is practically perfect


spoilertala is one of the alternate playable characters you unlock during the game while these characters dont actually appear on your raft with you their introduction is phrased as if they are joining you on your raftspoiler

ubquick reviewbu
raft is a survival game where you think the scariest thing youre going to fight is a shark but after a few hours of gameplay you quickly discover youre more worried about everything else and the shark feels like your friend

ubdetailed breakdown reviewbu
bstoryb i purchased this game to play with my brothers so i waited for a steam sale and grabbed it for both siblings and myself
oh im supposed to talk about the games story here

youre on a raft in a post apocalyptic world you uncover more about why youre in the ocean or why the world is flooded by picking up various scrapped pieces of paper from key islands of interest

the story is interesting iall read through extra tidbitsi but i am a fan of the classic minecraftdont startsurvival theme of toss you into the nonsense good luck figure out how to swim on your own iunrelated side note i am grateful i didnt learn to swim from this method i would have drown at age 6i

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2146440508

bgameplayb heres the repeating gameloop in text format toss hook pull in debris x15 craft a thing for water
resume tossing hook and pulling debris x15 craft a thing for food
toss hook pull in debris craft gather craft gather craft

you can frame it two ways man thats boring or man thats cathartic depending on how you respond you should already know if youre interested in playing

that being said teaming up with friends makes the process a thousand times more entertaining

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2153076589

youre mostly fighting against the shark and the seagulls while you try to build your raft occasionally the teethy jerk will attack one of your rafts platforms its your job to give him a good poke in the face to make him go away and other then being chased out of the water the shark is kind of forgettable until he attacks you while youre harvesting underwater and for a split second you remember youre actually terrified of sharks irl

theres a lot of ways you can build your raft but youll starve for resources iand maybe even literally for food or dehydrationi for awhile before you kind of stabilize and then set sail on an ocean sweeping expedition where you explore the vast blue expanse

we didnt get any bonus points for creativity in our raft design i dubbed it the ss aircraft carrier but the raft is kind of always in flux as we add new rooms and get new items to place down in it

bconclusionb at 22 hours in raft at the time of this review i think its safe to say iwe have thoroughly enjoyed what raft has to offer
there is something to be said about teamwork and having good zen with the people on your raft or ya know threaten to take the raft and leave your friends on a desert island

theres still a few achievements for me to track down and we have yet to encounter a few of the animals in the game so were not done yet and looking forward to more content being added to the game soon

thanks for reading if youd like a bit more of a visual example of the game iand want to hear the dulcet tones of my obnoxious voicei feel free to check out my youtube video on my thoughts on raft thanks again

super fun and easy to learn wish it was longer or they came out with a second one with a different quest line

#####

note this game is early access hint why i rated it positively my concerns are listed for people who want a better idea of where the game is at in development

this is a really fun game to play especially with friends you are on a 2x2 raft and able to expand it using the trash in the ocean as you build your raft you can research different things and learn more crafting recipes you can also explore different tiny islands and once you have antennas and a computer you can find other interesting areas  the progression of the game is also nice as you have nothing but a hook and your 2x2 raft and need to figure out how to feed and hydrate yourself and not completely lose your raft to the shark and as time progresses you have the time and materials to perfect your raft i was able to get a solid 12 hours out of the game before it felt redundant 

there is no variety in the areas that you can explore and there is nothing particularly interesting that you can find the only animals you will ever encounter are the sharks and seagulls and whatever fish that you catch with your fishing pole but those dont count the crafting is kind of limited and there are some items that you can get and are literally only used for one thing like clam shells and copper thus they stack up really quick once you build your raft the way you desire startfrowing food and have researched everything there is literally nothing new or interesting to do these are things i am sure the development team are working on making more craftable items more interesting areas to explore etc 

lastly i have some thoughts on what i would like to see in the game and i know some of these are things the devs are working on

hunting on islands it would be really cool to have bigger islands with diverse wildlife and ways to hunt them
possibly simple potion creation for things like the health or extended underwater breathing if not armorclothes to increase health
more dangerous areas like when you enter a certain part of the ocean you actually have two sharks until you leave the area or that the water is fierce enough to cause some minor damage to the raft things like that 
character creation because i am a weeb 
if other animals are added being able to tame one as a pet could you imagine having like a pet bear that can catch fish for you or even a pet shark to fend off others i just think it would be cool to tame animals and each one has their own perks
island diversity such as ones that are lush and green and others that are volcanic each with their own benefits and disadvantages

#####

i would never have the patience to play this game in single player mode this game is meant to be played with friends and has been very well improved and polished even if its still in early access 
a perfect mix between crafting building exploration lethal enemies coworking together and beautiful views
graphics are fun and colourful 
the game is a fun and a relaxing adventure and is worth the full price so even better when its on sale

#####

relaxing game
more fun to play with friends
interesting places to discover and really good adventure game


#tips for new players
1 dont make useless stuff on raft go for purifier and grill as fast as you can so you can survive try to make sail so you can change your raft directions to stay on island and discover more stuff
2  play creativity mode first to learn and check out the items first and what are their needs
3 try to make a basic raft first and survive this will improve your gameplay and you will learn more about basic things

also you can add me and play with me anytime d
i will help you in your rafts and teach you about items

good luck with the game d

raft ea review
 

my fellow survival enthusiasts you are in for one grand adventure


some key points that this game offers

1	creative mode
2	peaceful mode
3	standard mode with three different difficulties
4	complete sandbox experience
5	complete freedom to do build and go wherever you want
6	indie gem 55

gameplay  controls

the game is played with your keyboard  mouse the mouse being used for looking and completing action such as building and placing items the keyboard is used for movement picking up items along with a variety of other actions raft has to offer
 the controls are pretty smooth and handles well on the open ocean whether you are walking or running on your raft or exploring the deep the game handles the motion and controlling pretty well

now for the fun bits you start your game on four squares of wood and that is the size of your raft with that you start with your trusty hook from there you need to start gathering every piece of debris that floats within arms reach or your hook throws reach
you can venture into the ocean to nab those barrels that are packed with goodies but you risk getting caught by that man eater that is never far away as you drift through the ocean luck might shine on you and grant you with a small island or reef which can be scavenged for some resources above and below water

raft offers this and so much more even though the game is still in early access it handles and plays beautifully the moment bugs and other issues arise the developers quickly tackle and resolve it making this a true indie gem in all its forms

mgrza 910

graphics

the game looks absolutely beautiful it supports a wide range of features for current gen systems as well so you can push it to its max and be happy with the results lower end machines will handle it just as well if you adjust the settings accordingly
but everything the game has to offer is absolutely gorgeous whether it is that shark thats constantly trying to munch on you or the reefs underwater that your exploring every little aspect has been beautifully created and implemented in the game 

the character design is gorgeously done adding to that survival realism we have come to crave the wide variety of decor we can add to our raft truly makes it a work of art there is so much effort that went into this game and it truly shows it really is the little things that come together to create something beautiful

that is what we have here regular updates are released to fix items not handling or displaying properly to ensure we have that the look remains gorgeous

mgrza 910

sounds

another beautiful add on to this gem from the rain falling to the massive waves that sweep over your raft the in game sounds ads a beautiful and unique surreal effect to it all every action you do has its own unique sound swimming fishing and rowing they all add to the game in one way or another adding to it and increasing the overall quality of the game

the music adds to the tranquillity that the game creates spending some time to build up your food stores by fishing with that soothing ocean sound and the background music really sets the pace for the game making it all the more relaxing and enjoyable 

mgrza 910

replayability

the game offers three different game modes and multiplayer to play with friends there is plenty to do the game only stops when you decide to stop

mgrza 910

mgrza conclusions
spoilers ahead

when it comes down to the numbers raft is a brilliant game beautifully created and well received it is something everyone from the genre will love and enjoy the game can be enjoyed solo or with friends you have complete freedom to whatever you want
if you want a causal experience you can start up creative mode with access to everything and everything from the research table already researched as well with that you can build and play to your hearts content

if you prefer a challenge you can start a standard game on easy normal or hard and go at it solo or with a mate the choice is yours i mentioned above you start with a very small raft but as you scavenge the parts you can turn that little piece of driftwood into a multifloor palace that houses its own garden and animals you have complete freedom to do as you please
the games regular updates and fixes truly make for an amazing early access game there is no worries or bad vibes if the game has issues they are dealt with in game balances and improvements are constantly performed to ensure smooth sailing for your leisure

this truly is a must have for every survival fan

13 hours in i have built everything  explored every major island  done everything there is to do in the game

the mechanics graphics atmosphere crafting etc are all pretty good but the game is just barebones at this point

this is obviously to be expected in ea  just want to make potential purchasers aware that you are buying a game with less than 20 hours of content and no end game content in sight

edit revisited this in chapter 2 and a lot more content has been added  i will say that playing solo is very tedious and not nearly as enjoyable as playing multiplayer  highly recommended multiplayer

im currently 19 hours of game play in and its been a great time all the while sorry for the long review i have a hard time getting a point across in few words

i originally got the game when it first released simply because it was a survival game with a premise i hadnt seen before and back then i played it for 20 minutes and then un installed at the time it was really buggy but i am glad that i came back to it to see that a lot of what i had issues with are either completely gone or mitigated to a point that i dont notice them

overall the gameplay is great with it being challenging enough to keep me interested while still rewarding me for my efforts you progress slowly at first but after reaching your first couple islands the speed ramps up quite a bit making the pace acceptable though it does slow down a bit shortly after but it sets the pace making land fall at each new island gives you a pretty big break which personally made me really excited each time i spotted a new place to check out i could sit down and play for 5 hours a time which is amazing as most games these days cant manage my attention for more than an hour or two at a time 

that being said there are quite a few things that could be fixed such as materials as a whole getting even the most basic of materials is a massive undertaking taking up a lot of your time while you can use nets that automatically pick up materials it feels like the spawn rate of some of the most important stuff is far too low because of this progression at the very beginning is practically a snails crawl though it does pick up later stack limit is far too low considering the tiny inventory space you are given and with only one way to expand inventorywhich isnt possible until late game or you are lucky i found my raft over run with storage boxes

building is another thing i would love to see get a bit more of an overhaul there just arent enough options in the building process in my opinion with one corner piece not working at all and at their bid for more realism in the game certain building physics leave ugly and hilarious results there are very few furniture and decoration options

thirst and hunger even in normal mode go down really fast barely a minute had passed and i went from full to only a quarter of either bar i spent more time struggling for food and water than anything else even in late game 

and the shark the damn shark his attack frequency on the raft itself is insane maybe a little more than a minute between attacks fighting it off is pointless i found it easier to just let it eat the one piece and replace it even when fighting it off you only get a minute of breathing room before he is back beating the shark back will be your main focus for the grand majority of the game leaving very little time for anything else especially early game its almost too frantic you can lure the shark away with bait which thankfully is extremely easy to make but that doesnt last very long either so when you go diving around islands for materialswhich is the only way to get certain ones you have maybe a minute to gather then get back fighting it off underwater is possible but its difficult and it only goes away for a brief amount of time i know the shark is really the only threat but making the raft usable at all takes so much time and effort that its ridiculous the early to mid game is frantic that until you get certain materials you wont be progressing at all oh and for some reason he can attack the very middle of the raft even though he is only supposed to be able to go for the outer layer bastard ate my melons that way

overhaul building by adding more options and making itjust slightly less realistic and adding a few more decor options

 a bit more of a item progressionexample wood  bronze  iron  steel since there is really only 1 upgrade of most things making your progression leap ahead

tweak the decline of starvation and thirst slightly

and tweak the shark especially the attack and respawn frequency make bait last longer or make it to wear you can ward him off a bit better in the late game 

the things that bothered me were all little things that honestly didnt take away much and can be managed even the damn shark if you are careful about time and material management it can be frustrating and is often insultingly unfairthis is somewhat rare but once you get the hang of it gets a bit easier i can see quite a few people getting so irked by these they drop the game for a while like i did

that being said 810 game would play a lot more of if they keep updating with more things to do if you made it this far into my long winded and opinionated review than you are my favorite kind of person



#####

lets start off with a big fat like
dont expect too much just yet though
the reason you should buy this game is because  it has potential  and buying it will help the developers reach its potential
i am 13 hours in and i can say that i reached what is probably the end so farand i will put the game asside untill it has had a few more patches and the like

gameplay is good albeit combat falls outside of that catagory and can be improved upon greatly
building system works brilliantly eventhough destruction is a little too punishing at only halve the cost back
the game is intuitive and kind of fun

i honestly am looking forward to where this game will go playing it i get so many ideas of what would be possible  underwater cities lost slands  the explorer in me is going to have a blast
i really hope they are going to upgrade the radar too for me having a goal to sail too made the game so much more fun add more spots

is it worth 20 euro that depends content wise probably not yet for 20 euro i expect to be entertained a bit longer than 13 hours
but if you are looking to support a team of creators thats onto something unique filled with possibilities 
hell yes

#####

i have 300ish hours in the game and can tell you its a fun game but not exactly replayable achievements are the only reason youd kind of ever want to play it again but some are just straight up grindy like the kill 50 screechers or the godforsaken 50 anglerfish the main issue with wanting to play the game again is because your motivation to beat the game is to find out where the story goes and find all the new islands and once youve already done that once theres no reason to do it again besides with friends still got 2 achievements left with the game but dont know if ill ever get around to 100ing it so its a fun story game but not replayable least in my opinion cheers 

#####

my friend and i bought raft after she watched someone play it on stream and it is  safe to say me and her are enjoying every single second of it we both bought it last night and we ended up playing for 7 hours straight i am yet to play alone but i think this is one of those games where you get the most out of it with a party of 2 or 3 people lest it get mundane 

it is surprising how fun it can be to be on a raft in the middle of nowhere jumping from island to island gathering resources for your raft that is slowly but surely starting to resemble a viable home diving into the beautiful blue ocean and seeing the corals resources fishes and animals like dolphins the game ran really well and i am yet to encounter any sort of glitch bug or performance issues 

my favourite thing about this game must be the research table and how you can learn all these wacky inventions to help improve your life on the raft  this can be addicting the only annoying thing i found about raft are the damn sharks whilst i do enjoy the danger of the shark roaming around the raft and having to be extremely cautious when you jump off or dive in the ocean i hate the fact that it comes and bites you within seconds most times after jumping off into the sea the shark starts to get really annoying after a while  and yes i do know you can build shark bait etc but i just found this annoying other than that this game is genuinely a diamond amongst rocks i only paid about 1515 for this game which is a bargain especially considering the game is still receiving updates and literally just got one last week that changed decorations etc 

tldr fun adventurous crafting is great exploration is amazing enhanced with friends worth the money without a doubt punishing survival game on the hardest difficulty

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on this game and it gets 2000 likes and 500 awards that he will buy me a rtx 4060 ti and 5 kilos of canned ham so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

thats how folks live without internet

#####

sharkie noms the raft

#####

a fun game solo or with friends story is average imo but it feels that you dont really play raft only for the story i enjoyed building and expanding my raft exploring the various islands and doing dumb things it is nice that unlike other games what you build is actually useful to you and always used because the raft is everything so any time you spend building and decorating your raft does not feel wasteful or redundant one thing to keep in mind that over a certain number of friends early gameplay is hard i recommend giving it a shot if you like survival and building games

#####

raft unexpected great game

i got this game as a lame time game but thats not what i got

raft is a fun and immersive survival experience 

skill level makes a huge game diffrence

easy  walk in the park very relaxed game
normal  intresting and sometimes a bit punishing
hard  shark fodder and crazy bubblefish magnet and omg you eat like a maniac just to stay alive

h1whatever floats your boath1

raft is an early access survival game developed by redbeet interactive you begin with a tiny raft and over the course of the game youll collect flotsam for resources to help you expand your raft and make surviving just a little easier along the way youll run into islands to stop at as well as stave off an incredibly obsessive shark

one thing i will say is this game can feel a little bit monotonous i strangely enjoy monotony at times but if you dont then this game might not offer enough to keep you interested

h1positives h1
listraft has fairly good visuals nothing groundbreaking but its certainly nice to look at i particularly like the sunrises and sunsets

the core gameplay is fairly simple but surprisingly well done the meat of the game is really just using a grappling hook to pull in floating resources which you then use to make different tools and equipment to help you survive such as water purifiers and wooden spears it can feel a little slow at times but for the most part it felt like there was a decent level of progression in the game

as well as fishing for resources and fish there are also islands that you sometimes come across each island has something unique about it but they all contain some of the rarer resources required for more advanced crafting the islands help break things up a bit and add some nice variety to the game though they can be a little bit too challenging to get on you also come across abandoned rafts every one in a while that also add some nice variety

the difficulty level you choose makes a surprisingly significant impact on how the game feels the easy mode is very relaxing little pressure from the survival elements and you can take the game at your own pace normal mode requires more attention to be paid to how hungry and thirsty you are and things can pretty quickly get away from you the hardest mode obviously offers the most challenge but honestly it also has the least realism since youre constantly needing to top up your survival bars theres also a creative mode thats pretty selfexplanatory 

playing singleplayer and multiplayer also offer two very different experiences singleplayer makes you feel lonely and isolated its also more relaxing and i actually found it quite meditative too multiplayer depending on who youre playing with of course is a bit more involved and energetic progression is a bit faster too ive enjoyed playing both but i think i prefer singleplayer for this one 

in a sea ha get it of survival games raft actually manages to have a pretty unique list

listfor the main antagonist of a game the shark is a little underwhelming i actually ended up turning off shark attacks while i was playing because i enjoyed it more the shark really just attacks you when youre in the water and every so often itll attack your raft and try to break some off it definitely adds some extra challenge i just didnt particularly enjoy that challenge this really comes down to personal preference though 

the survival requirements can be a little intense but changing the difficulty level really makes a difference i figure some people will probably be annoyed that the main challenge comes from how quickly your hunger and thirst bars decrease but i personally didnt mind just making the game easier overall to enjoy the game morelist

listi really wish there was more music in the game there were long stretches of time where the game was pretty much completely quiet im sure there are plenty of people who play with their own music or podcasts but i found the ingame music added to the immersion when it was actually playing 

while i do enjoy some of the monotony i do still feel like the game can be a little too repetitive i often went long periods between seeing an island and it can get pretty uninteresting if youre an hour or two into just floating around looking at nothing but ocean 

i dont think theres enough wood to go around planks are the main resource used in construction and crafting and if youre trying to build a decent sized raft then you need a lot of planks i got kind of fed up of building one new piece of my raft going back and spending a few minutes getting more planks and then repeating that again and again until i had built up what i wantedlist

h1verdict h1

raft ends up being a little too repetitive even for someone who enjoys monotony but its a fairly unique survival game and you can customize your experience with it fairly well id certainly recommend it for fans of the survival genre

you should add more stuff to do and see underwater like crashed planes caves fishes swimming around 
add a rain collector to collect drinking water when it rains
flags pirate flag
be able to collor the anchor sail collection nets chest
be able to repair your tools instead of just using them till they break
add fishing netts to collect fish
add wild animals on islands
maybe do it so you can get a pet
more cosmetics like the shark head
add triangle and rounded foundations so you can make roundtriangle raft instead of just squares
different bait for different sized fish on the fishing rod
be able to go into 3rd person or just add a selfie cam so you can see yourself
add a camera for selfies

i have fun with raft and even though i completed the story i find myself going back to that awe so satisfying desire to get as many achievements that i can when i first started raft i found myself getting annoyed with the inability to find rocks that by the end i had a whole chest full of them raft defiantly has some work and grind you have to put into it but its worth it to me the best games are just that that something that appears difficult at first becomes easier in the end beside that 50 kill on the angler fish achievement that i am more than determined to get i more than recommend raft for people who like survival building games to wonderful art  this is for you

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on this game and it gets 700 likes and 70 awards that he will buy me a rtx 4060 and 2 kilos of canned ham so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

it took me a long time to find a game that my friends and i could play together we are a huge group and its always dfficult to find a mp that can take up to 10 players 

another thing is that when we were able to find a game for all of us usually the mp was not that good they were always not that much fun after a while

luckly raft have all those things an awesome mp  the game keeps getting better and better as you go i cant stop playing it

very fun game but may get a bit repetitive when sailing to different destinations

#####

this game made me wanna kill my friends very good

#####

laughed untill i cried with my idiot friend def recommend to play with idiots

#####

so i guess i should review this game now xd
had it for almost 2 years and been an absolute blast

it is incredibly relaxing and overall simple with a pretty engaging story  not lore wise i tend to ignore that bit 
you start off just wondering the ocean and collecting trash to build and expand and float from island to island 
the story has you constantly going from one point to another using a mapradar and you come across some fun places for sure 

it isnt over the top and i think for 20 youll easily get 20 or more hours out of it coop is a real blast too and few bugs
moderators on the forums are friendly and helpful and the developers are adding even more to the story when i started they had just added one new big island now there was 2 additional ones and more to come when i say big i mean the islandslocations easily take up to 30 mins to fully explore some even an hour or more 

worth the price for sure if you are into survival games

edit oh before i forgoet important info your starting raft is the center point and original 4 foundations of your raft should be remembered if you are going to build an incredibly large raft by center point i mean it is what determines the spawn inspawn out radius if you stop on an island and dont anchor your raft your raft will eventually float away far enough for the island to despawn though the distance is incredibly far for that to happen just know that those original 4 points is what determines spawn inspawn out radius

raft
this is the game i go to when i want to just relax zone out and enjoy a game without feeling any pressure or anxiety in any way between the pacing the graphical design and the music the feel of this entry is very zen its almost akin to a sort of cognitive therapy in its own right 

the game concept in and of itself is elegant simplicity you are on a raft in the middle of a vast seemingly endless ocean and must collect flotsam to expand craft tools and workstations and scavenge for resources on the few islands and derelict vessels you come across in your journey onward
there is a storyline and while there are some mildly disturbing elements you discover in uncovering the story the pace is so relaxed and easy going that such a plotline seems almost a background consideration while you focus on your own survival and comfort 
and thats not meant in a negative way 
in feels very natural in the story of our own lives we find out the background of things around us in an almost haphazard way gleaning what information we can and where we can sometimes it makes a difference in our lives but most of it does not even if its interesting or insightful 
such as it is with this game 
youll find things out and maybe itll have a point maybe it wont 
in the grand scheme of the game it has little consequence beyond finding new blueprints or items to use for your own survival 

yes the game was in a long development dont let that fool you the developers value quality over quantity and thus didnt crank out updates just to satisfy the impatient gamers out there they waited until they were satisfied it was as bug free as possible and worth the effort before putting it out into the game
thats not to say there arent bugs there are but ive not encountered any bugs that are game breaking in any way and ive been playing since raft first launched on steam years ago 

this game is not for people who like fastpaced in any way from gameplay to development 

if youre a laidback easy going sort who is willing to be patient has common sense and the common courtesy to understand the hurdles and obstacles life can place before all humans gamers and developers alike then i highly recommend this game

it is among my most favorite of games and is one i now feel has more than paid for itself alone or with friends its a rewarding and relaxing experience every time that encourages creativity innovation and exploration at a pace you set this game is a prime example of the idea that life is a journey not a destination enjoy the journey and dont be in a hurry to reach that destination

#####

moral of the story littering helps people who are stranded at sea

#####

i was stranded on a raft with my friends for 174 hours i think you can only image how that went

#####

raft literally saved my life thank you

better with friends  p

pros
 amazing gameplay 
 decent graphics
 fun and addictive
 easy to play
 lots of options
overall it is an amazing game with without friends and you can easily spend hours on it i personally dont think as an early access it should be priced 1500 but on the flip side of the coin i think i have had 1500 worth of fun out of it

cons
some cons of the game is that there is now official end for some players this would be ideal but for some other players this would be a pain as you have no main goal to complete
 after a while the game kinda starts to feel like the same thing always having to watch your hydration and hunger which can get a little boring and tedious
 loading time it might just be my pc but sometimes when joining someones raft i get a bit of lag and a long loading wait which is annoying


requests
 shark variety that every time you kill the shark it didnt respawn back the exact same one and we could have maybe have 3 different variants of shark eg different colours textures shape and size also maybe the different sharks could do different amounts of damage to the player

do i think you should get the game
if you are into survival and basebuilding games i think you will like this if you enjoy games like rust ark survival evovled and possibly even minecraft you will also like this game because the are very similar

 multiple rafts you could have a mini port or docking station on your raft and then there could be an option to craft a much smaller raft so you could anchor up your main base and then go exploring islands with the one you crafted also you would not be able to carry the raft once you placed it and once destroyed you would only be able to recover a few materials back i also think it  would be good if the shark could also bite the craftable one too

 shark trap you could craft toxic shark decoy that would be quite difficult to make as it would be very powerful the reason for this would be to throw it in and the shark biting it thinking it was the usual bait and getting a nasty surprise and dying so you could dive down near an island and have lots of time to gather resources to make it more difficult you would not be able to get shark mean or a shark head from the body

 dogs to possibly have dogs to act as guards where they would be found on an island as a puppy you help it grow until it becomes a dog and then you can let it out and when the shark attacks your boat the dog will proceed to attack the shark back and on your command sit when dogs hp is low

 character customisation when you first download raft you should be able to make your own character ie skin tones hair style and basic clothing  because at the moment customisation is very limited

 copper tool set wood  stone  copper quicker  stronger
copper spear would do much more damage to the shark and a copper axe would gather more resources 

compass and map a map that shows you were friends are and when a friend needs reviving the map could pulsate in the location in which your friend is in so you could go rescue them and a compass would be helpful to locate other rafts

new game mode public servers where any raft players can join and you can build your own raft and either team with fellow rafters of attack and steal their items for yourself

steam engine away to travel in raft faster i think it would be good if it wasnt craftable and you had to recover it from a shipwreck and you could place it on your raft and you would have to gather materials to repair it and then finally use it  

carryable ladder climbing gear when exploring islands it would be so handy to be able to scale boulders and cliffs and you could carry the ladder and lean it up against what you want to get to the top and if the rock face is unsuitable for a ladder climbing gear would be ideal 

 inhabited islands when visiting island it would be cool if there were people on there living in shed and tree houses and the could all act differently some could be aggressive and you have to capture them or kill them and then raid their village once captured  you should be able to put them in a crate on your raft for them to stay in and they could help you spearing the shark water plants and much more some islanders could be friendly and they could help you and maybe give you hints on whats on the island

boat

for months i ignored this game misjudging it as a cheap copy of subnautica but boy was i wrong while subnautica makes you go underwater this keeps you on the surface the game keeps its survival aspect very challenging no thanks to that fg shark it is a very fun game takes sometime in getting used to once you get the mechanics its easy sailing there after

#####

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

great game i really recommend it but itd be nice to see 
 pirates not in easy mode and pretty rare in normal
 cannons
 berrys
 swords to fight the pirates also works on sharks but spear is better on sharks
  motor to the raft but really hard to get
  a gamemode where you get to build your own raft in creative timer and fight someone else with cannons
  more plants bushes seacreatures you can kill with spear like octopus or something

shark ate my butthole

#####

ive mastered the waters no longer am i frightened by the great white shark in the ocean i am the great white shark i am the ocean

#####

most excellent mixture of genresvery enjoyablethought i would not get into as i am not really into survival crafters they get boringthis one has not still playing sololove it great depth story is perfectdifficulty is a good variation normal is stressful and fun hard will give you ulcers easy is more chill and peaceful is more relaxing than minecraft in the daytime with great music to boot very highly recommend

#####

sharkie no no
raft yes 

#####

this game lets you kill seagulls and eat them

literally the best game i have ever played

#####

bruce ate me 

#####

raft was small then got bigger islands have things you need but sometimes island doesnt have things you need i really liked my boat then my friend i was playing with made some executive decisions that i didnt necessarily agree with even though i had the captain hat and the mayor hat and all he had was a freaking polar bear hat anyway i digress put more titanium in the game please and also more bees thanks for reading game is fun

#####

raft kevin costner waterworld thats it

a real refreshment in crafting survival game open ocean sounds so awesome
however like all survival games it comes out as early access thats not that bad nor good

let me explain why bim writing this review on curent state of the gameb
features and crafting system is not complex at all so hardcore survival players may find it as childs play too easy
bugs yes there are minor visual bugs but no breaking game one overall it wont ruin game enjoyment

now we can only talk about possible things to be added to game possibilities are endless but one thing bothers me soo0 much it says mutliplayer online multiplayer that would mean that we could come across eachother in game trade raid but no its just single and online coop 
so at this stage of the game you would need around 810 hours to learn and build everything there is in game after that you really have nothing to do in game unless you want to make your raft huge as a building
there are no physics so dont worry about storms or anything that can sink or turn over your raft not gonna happend in this build

should you pay 20 bucks for it yes if you want to support developers in development as i said possibilities and potentional are massive

is game worth that money at curent stage if you expect to have dozens or hundred hours of playtime no dont buy it and wait for more content

single player or coop
definitely coop  it feels like completely diferent game when playing with friends cause im afraid single player may get borring after some time

im not sure if i should write suggestions to devs here but ill definitely keep an eye on updates and progress will changeedit this review with upcoming content

#####

haha if you move the letters around in raft it spells fart

#####

love to just chill in peaceful mode in this game love they have the option to lower the motion for motion sickness too

#####

super fun to play with friends i have yet to play it solo although i think it would be rather relaxing to not have to worry about your friends neglecting the raft for a plastic bag only to be attacked by the shark when they would have been safe on the raft the whole time 910 would recommend even just for a time passer

#####

really makes you feel like youre trailing behind the great pacific garbage patch

#####

raft is a survival crafting game its a game for potentially houndred of hours
you can play in coop up to 8 players
there are different difficulty lvls
theres a story
tons of crafting to do
plus theres a massive building potential you can build a seriously massive raft with a lot of rooms tall and wide and decorate it in creative ways each raft ends up looking unique in one way or another

i initially dropped this game after 4 hrs after buying it but ended up getting rly into it once i found ppl to play with that guided me and explained some stuff to me its a lot more fun with other players although when you play alone you can go crazier with ur builds since there are furniture mods and stuff

end game spoilers since people are whining about content but havent even seen it all
so a lot of people are hating on this 20 game for not having enough content i almost thought so too when i got my raft to be 3 stories tall and explored a ton of islands which takes like 15 hrs at least if your alone people pay 20 for movie tickets that last 2 hrs and are less entertaining then this beautiful relaxing survival game this game is perfect for a nice calm morning when ur trying to relax and has the perfect level of shark stress scenery both scary and beautifully calm above and below water and base building that ive seen 60 survival games unable to match 
people hating on the game because they run out of things to do are just sad that they beat a great game plus half of these haters havent even built a radio relay out of antennas and made it to the oil rig which is the start of actual end game stuff if you feel like 20 dollars is worth about 30hrs of grade a entertainment you will be happy with this game and thats if you dont play it again with friends and make a new raft

#####

raft is a heartwarming and interactive tale about what filipinos go through every day

#####

friends laughed at me when i fell in the water and struggled getting up on the raft 1010 would experience it again

#####

a really fun game to play especially with friends havent had this much fun in a creativesurvivaltype game in a while and this one definitely reignited said spirit it has a good story that is fun to follow along and does a really good job slowly unlocking perks for your raft the game is also fairly relaxing on the whole with its easy although unrealistic sailing mechanics and constant flow of resources allowing you to just kick back when you want to the designingbuilding aspect of the game is somewhat glitchy at a complex level but for most activities is quite fun and very rewarding  allowing you to build a lot of what you can think of and allowing you to place items in virtually any positions finally it seems like although slow with updates the game has not at all been abandoned by the devs and will continue to be worked on in the future if you ever see this game on sale or even not on sale i see no reason for you and some friends to not pick it up

i really like this game i love it in fact 

ive mentioned before i think that survival is a genre i have an on and off appreciation for as it just depends on how its done raft absolutely scratches the itches really well and its one of the very few survival games that i really enjoy playing if theres zero games i feel like for any reason this game is a super easy one to load up 

you start on a very small platform and you need to hook delicious ocean wastes such as wood leaves and plastic in order to expand the raft and craft crude gear that you need to survive the opening at all like holy fuck when i started playing the game a friend warned me of the beginning half hour being brutal this wasnt exaggerated as when i started on normal i quickly gave up after several new worlds the hunger and thirst meters on normal are so aggressive that easy feels like normal in this case i played my current 75 hours of progress on easy because that actually feels fair  hunger and thirst exist but you dont feel like youre constantly babysitting it

the gameplay loop works so surprisingly well and its incredibly addicting to build up your floating fortress im someone that when passionately invested in making something goes to whatever lengths he can to have fun with it injecting my own humor as i make something im proud of im always proud of the raft stuff im developing the building system is simple but works so well with the snappy grid based system and keep in mind i hate first person base building in 9 out of 10 cases but it works really well and still allows for lots of creative looking rafts my friend has one that looks way better personally but it didnt stop me looking at my own and saying yeah im super damn happy with what ive made im gonna add more

i mean you have to contend with fucking bruce in the early game but once you can armour up the perimeter of your raft he just becomes free food 

the world will randomly spawn in islands as you drift across the ocean with special story islands only starting to spawn once you build and place specific items on your base quite a few of the larger ones can have more resources that are less common but also hostile entities so crafting weapons is a good idea and while the story isnt something i actually care for ive found the voiced notes entertaining with each island for them having their own tone and they were quite fun to listen to the variety of creatures i get to deal with are quite fun too is the combat hard no its simple but it works well enough so theres no complaints there

another little shoutout to the lesser things such as the really good soundtrack the solid performance the characters maya is too cute not to play as in my opinion and the graphical design being easy going and pretty

i still have quite a lot more to do  the only reason i havent played much more is because ive been playing alone since i have a lot of difficulty maintaining focus and enthusiasm in games like this when im stuck on my own not being able to bounce off anyone else just means that when i do play raft my play sessions currently are very short because i just cant maintain the concentration its why my raft is called the sp lonely as fck oh this is not a negative about the game by the way its just a me problem and i do need to try multiplayer if anybody i can find is ok to do it with me

bottom line is this game is extremely good a wonderful survival game that despite my terrible issue with prolonged focus i do intend on continuing to play be it alone or with a friend that i can drag into doing it please support these guys theyve made a lovely casualfriendly survival game

#####

raft is one of my favorite games i like to play in peaceful mode for a relaxing time collect build advance

as a survival game raft strikes a reasonable balance between survival chores and fun its fun to figure out a sustainable path forward that eventually gets tedious then the next story location unlocks better technology to alleviate that the game doesnt let you achieve full automation but eventually the survival chores become somewhat infrequent

if anything makes the game lean toward the tedious side its probably the games inventory system things like having to move items from your backpack to action bar then select it as the active item just to put the item in a device even when it might be the only place that item can go fairly obvious things are also missing like a sort button grouping stacks of the same items together pickups fill the action bar first then have to be moved to backpack by hand subitem crafting tedium and generally the game recipes outsizing storage density requiring lots of containers with similarly tedious management

there are some other rough edges edges for example are very easy to fall from there appears to be no grace area or hint of being close the edge also seems inconsistent based on the rotation and position of the object so its hard to develop a feel for it i fall off the raft and other objects somewhat frequently but i dont in other games progression is also stretched out too far several blueprints are found in the last area of the game one after the story is all but finished also a crafting material required for the last tier items is found in undersized quantities compared to recipe needs so you are blocked from some of the most useful items in the game until the game is already over

much of this is acceptable from a reasonablypriced game and an initial release from a new indie studio but i recently discovered something that was unacceptable i was in a situation where my internet was out and i put steam in offline mode to not use hotspot data periodically the game would pop up an error and open a game menu ok minor inconvenience click ignore and keep playing then i encountered a bug when i had a container or inventory open when the error came up the game would no longer take my inputs i had to kill the game each time losing progress i reported the bug and tried to work around it but then i ran into the worst part which is not a bug being offline blocked me from progressing the story because some game objects could not be interacted with when i questioned support about this they said i had to be online to play even in no one can join mode where theres no functional reason to be online or block story so it didnt sound like that bug would be fixed they pled ignorance as to why it was designed this way

the games privacy policy makes the reason obvious collecting your data among the ways they use your data many of them are to weaponize your data against you for profit aka marketing use the policy also ensures redbeet can collect your data by blocking access to the game you paid for unless you make an account provide personal info and stay online if you exercise your right to object or stop the data collection under the gdpr redbeet will revoke your license to use the game that you paid for

isupport told me i could disable data collection in settings i recall this being a checkbox option at some point during early access but it no longer appears to be now when i click the open data privacy page button as suggested by support nothing happens if i were a gambler id bet this button simply opens their privacy policy which enumerates all the ways users are blocked from having a choice in the matteri

because of this hostile privacy policy i cannot recommend this game nor this studio

iupdate support told me that the open data privacy page is supposed to take me to unitys data collection page they didnt say anything about their own data collectioni

#####

i really enjoyed playing this game with friends the building mechanics are nothing special but they feel rounded and intuitive the whole adventure to the storyislands was really fun especially the moments when big islands appear in the fog at the edge of the map und you get excited the only downside of this game is its lategame and long term motiviation when you achieve the best items in the game there is almost nothing left to do so it lacks content past the story line to keep me engaged in the game

#####

boat

#####

honestly i cant believe i waited this long to review this game i want to open by saying this game is fantastic i wholeheartedly recommend it and thats even as an incomplete game because of the deep love the developers have for it

the games story is found but given which adds an element that makes the story almost completely skippable you only learn what you have the desire to learn and only read what you have the desire to read this element alone will make it a 1010 for some exploration driven people
it also lets you build how youd like the new parts that you learn help you progress to new places while also attempting to reinforce knowledge you already had its a 1010 game and well made

#####

i literally became obsessed with this game over the course of this week 

ive just completed chapter 2 and honestly raft has really exceeded my expectations in everything i would want from a game and more 

im not the biggest gamer but raft is one of the few survivals game that ive actually really enjoyed i have loved everything about the game from the story the quests expect the island where the damn birds threw rocks and the hustle to survive you know i lived for the grind for food theres just so much to do endless something i would have never expected arriving initially on a dinky raft 

raft has definitely made my quarantine a lot more fun this week   i am so excited for ch3 and and all future developments for this game i will be decking out my raft with potted plants in anticipation

the game runs smoothly even on max settings loading screens are quick overall game is fluid except when opening the inventory for the first time ingame which lags out a second or two

h1gameplayh1

the storyline is simply great and the way the game presents it to you is also another great point

h1graphicsh1

even though the graphics look kind of simple it is well finished the lightning shadow and water systems are its strongest points 

h1soundtrackh1

it lacks a soundtrack to comment about

h1ambianceh1
 
as i said previously the weather effects are rather monotonous since youre either under a clear sky or under a complete thunderstorm itd be nice to see some further effects like hailstorms fogs and floods other than that the nice enviroment and outstanding sounds make up for an immersive gameplay

look do not play this game alone raft wields many customization options which may go from simple colored floating foundations to a room full of trophies made from the sharks you killed playing this take you to a void where time flies by and you still did not paint all your boat into pink and black outstanding game in all manners

#####

this game is so much fun you get to cook fish build dive and search for items
while many players rush to get to the end and you can do that if that is how you play but i am taking my time  ever sat on your raft and watched a awesome sun set or the huge moon at night they are some thing to behold just beautiful
there has been new content added so there is still more to do in the game to keep you busy you can play with other players or by yourself i have found the devs to be helpful and active
you can play in many modes creative peaceful normal or hard

there are many more directions this game could take like war with other rafts on the high seas or build your own utopia 

the pricing of this game is well worth the money you will get value for sure
i have also seen the devs improve if anyone has seen a problem it is nice to know you are heard

i recommend this game with high regard i love it

#####

its really an awesome game i played 3 days nonstop when i first played it with my friends until midnight however i noticed some lack of contents since its still an early access but still shows promising updates in the future since its just an early access

i wanna comment some ideas and improvent as a fan
1 more weapons such as harpoons to kill shark or cannons with black powder as a craftable resource
2 more enemies aside from shark such as bandits with a small boat like us players with 1 or 2 enemy bandits and we can either kill them or negotiate for our life if we think we cant win and give what they ask for like 1 scrap and 4 plastic and so on later the bandits can increase in number as the game progress i mean i really wanna shoot these bows and arrows to an enemy asside from the one in the water and make use of the binocular for some pirates incoming
3since this game is about lootings we cant forget about treasure maps i hope there are hidden maps in the loot crates on the island and use that map to find treasure using the satelite
4 boss battles please of course since there might be some other players who doesnt want to fight so there can be a choice to either sail away or look for the map that shows where the boss is hidden such as the legendary kraken or other mythical epic creatures since it is a boss right

i am really not asking much but wanting for a more awesome game from an awesome game thanks

ps i think some people wants this game to be peacful so when making a new game they can either choose to have bandits or not like survival mode or peacful mode etc

raft is a game about juggling a constant stream of mundane and repetitive tasks  you are never really given the freedom to relax think or explore which does help to distract you from just how empty and shallow the game world truly is  indeed i feel like the premise of the game was chosen specifically because it would be so easy to throw something together and have it work  just grab a few models from an asset store and voilasea garbage  no need for complicated landscapes and such  just an endless ocean chock full of trash

your primary challenges include
 cooking and eating a potato every 2 minutes to not fall behind on hunger
 desalinating water every 2 minutes to not fall behind on thirst or watering crops
 planting potatoes every 6 minutes to not run out
 chasing a demented rabid seagul from your crops every time you step away
 chasing a demented rabid shark from your raft every 10 minutes or so like clockwork
 picking enough trash out of the ocean to feed recurring resource costs since literally every action ultimately consumes some amount of wood plastic leaves scrap or stone

if you want to do anything else you must fit it into the above somewhere severely limiting your prospects

primarily progression involves making the game a little less tedious  for example after 45 hoursat times forcing myself to continuei was able to build a water purifier that could purify 5 cups of water at once meaning i no longer had to ensure i was available at 2 minute intervals to start a new cup  around the same time i got access to a grill that could cook 3 potatoes at once with roughly the same effect  you can also build nets that automatically collect trash that passes through them  these things reduce the tedium a little allowing you to juggle a greater number of tedious tasks and no matter which chore you decide to focus on you are always racing the clock to get back to some other chore

the games mechanics are pretty much universally shallow and uninspired  take fishing for example  you drop a line wait about 30 seconds and press a button to claim your random item  it does not matter where or how far you cast  you can even drop your line straight through the floor of your raft  you do not fish up anything interesting  there are no baits and upgrading your rod does not change the experience in any meaningful way  this is representative of every other mechanic in the game  the shovel for example cannot actually dig  there is an animation for it but the shovel is only used for collecting dirt from extremely rare resource gathering points which you use only to grow grass

i understand this is early access but i feel like the games developers are missing a crucial component that should be baked into every game from day 1 fun  there is a question that game developers should ask themselves before adding removing or changing anything at any stage of development does this make my game more fun  if the answer is no abort mission immediately games are about fun and anything that does not improve fun in some way misses the point of the thing  in raft the only mechanic that is even remotely fun is building your raft and the developers have done everything in their power to ensure you rarely get a chance to do that  this tells me they believe like the developers of many disappointing games that having things to do is a respectable goal  its not  having 1 fun thing to do trumps having 100 tedious things to do  all the time every time  though i would love to be proven wrong i do not believe the developers will have an epiphany and reach this conclusion  i made a good effort to find enjoyment in this game but i simply cannot recommend it

#####

raft is a barebones surival game with the niche of being on a raft that is all there is to it there are islands to stop on sharks to kill and a story of sorts but its really a shallow experience dont get me wrong the amount of polish is astounding the music and graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is engaging it just doesnt have much to it i love survival games so i enjoyed it regardless however i cannot recommend it until it gets far more content when it does and believe me the delevopers care enough about their game to keep updating it then ill recommend the game for full price

#####

review for version 101b

rafts a pretty nifty little game the idea of going along and strapping junk you collected to your floating home as you go is neat however as of this version the gameplay is rather simplistic and overall unfun honestly 

h1the goodh1
list
building up my giant multi story wooden fortress was pretty fun and rather satisfying to see it come together
there was always something productive to be done like fishing placing rugs and exploring islands you drift into
playing with friends eases gameplay and makes it somewhat bearable
list

h1the badh1
list
the shark is rather annoying and will keep attacking your raft every few minutes you can kill it but it just respawns after 30 or so seconds
once you make a large enough raft everything becomes trivial since youll have near infinite trash floating into nets placed along your raft
list

h1tldrh1
the games overall playable but lacks any real gameplay meat for now i reconmend waiting out for a sale to drastically lower the price

#####

very fun with friends but wouldnt recomend singleplayer

#####

addictive especially if you play with friends

#####

i used to play this game with my girlfriend and i could never finish it because she got seasick and nauseous whenever we were on the water so i would like to thank the creator of this game and everyone involved in making this game i do not recommend this game to people who are like my exgirlfriend

#####

hi folks

is a bit of fun i have over 600 hours in game i wish steam allowed a  hmm  recommendation rather than just  yes  or  no 
if you are looking to buy it then there are plenty of youtube videos which will show you the game play one thing i would say is look at the number of comments that say it is better  with friends   ive been a gamer for around 40 years and cant really think of any game that is not better without friends 
it is quite fun and challenging to start out but once you pass a certain level it just turns into a grind
the  story  was actually quite interesting once you hit the first structure hinting at a world that global warming had melted the ice causing the sea levels to raise it explained why you were afloat in an ocean
ok it was not exactly accurate about what would happen but was fun for a game
my main problem with this game is that  in my opinion  we will never get to utopia it is going to be one of those games that will just add a bit of content every now and again to keep a bit of interest up  especially to youtubers that will promote the game although it seems to be decreasing
for 15 it is a good game so i have to recommend it  however ill make a prediction that the game will not be out of early access this time next year
personally id prefer they actually finished the game then work on something else or a 2nd session 

just my opinion 
trikky2


#####

this game is overall great however

 the slow points can really drag if resources are unfavorable for you
 the ending of the game provides endgame crafting recipes that has absolutely no use since there are not enough availability of those resources to begin with and since youre already beat the final boss the new recipes offer no gameplay benefits
 replayability is zero once the story is finished the player is allowed to continue but i find no reason to continue playing outside of being an achievement completionist

the gameplay is fun enough so ill recommend the game if you want a mildsandbox with constant resourcewithdrawal syndromes however the ending is something ill warn you about as it is shallow and extremely underwhelming

#####

great relaxing and fun game

really nice simple graphics a bit cartoonish but in a good way

sound effects and music are really nice the sound of the ocean the waves and the music are very relaxing

the gameplay is very challenging at the start like every game of this genre you are fighting hunger thirst and above all the fing shark that if youre not careful will eat your raft and you once you secure food and drinkable water production and protect yourself and the raft against the shark you can begin to explore the different story islands and unlocking blueprints to progress from this point on it gets easier

the story is not that good or interesting just an excuse to visit the different story islands and get the blueprints but its ok not the point of the game

the enemies are varied some are more challenging to fight than others particularly the shark and stone bird

if you dont like the challenge there is a peaceful mode that allows you to explore without worrying about enemies there is also a creative mode that allows you to build without having to gather materials or worry about surviving just build the raft of your dreams

in short great and relaxing game great addition to the survivalcrafting game collection 100 recommended

h1 raft h1

while in real life this would be one of the worse things that can happen the game is actually fun and enjoyable
playing it together with a friendpartner is even better it makes all the farming and scouting easier aswell
strikeunless your partner is a meanie who pushes you in the water when youre not paying attentionstrike
building stuff really does make the days fly by ive build a tower so far up i couldnt even see my own raft below me anymore

the game could easily put in more features items and building options but so far the devs did an amazing job
love the graphics designs and visuals all were to my taste
was fun to spend my time on this game

bdo noteb ithis game has a lot of repetitive gameplay so for yall do your homework on this game first before buying and giving it an bad review just for thati

#####

great with friends

#####

finally killed shark

got killed by a bird


#####

i pooped my pants when i saw the big birb

#####

at the moment besides my actual job which is already very time consuming im taking classes and paying good money for those in order that i can apply for a higher salary job
the whole course is 414 hours long and represents a good opportunity to get a better life

very well instead of using every second of my free time to study and made a better use of the knowledge i paid to have i decided to buy this game
so rather than put another 356 good hours of study i spent most of that time crafting and painting a gigantic regular octahedron with a massive structure around it for the sole purpose of see how my old lap top would render if whole thing colapsed on itself

i also built a very nice sort of a yacht and befriended a goat a clucker and a freaking llama

1010 wasting a better future

#####

very nice game my friend harvests but never plants potatoes back cough dg cough instantly unfriended him play this game to know who is a real friend

#####

shark eat raft i kill shark i eat shark no more shark all alone

#####

kept me busy enough during my depression that i forgot i was depressed

#####

this game makes me think id survive being stranded in the ocean on a raft

#####

the shark is kinda annoying

#####

raft is a fun relaxing game in an open world rather open sea think minecraft  but youre a bobbing speck in a cast ocean you come across deserted islands buoys with supplies  you scoop up mats as they float by

i enjoyed my first few hours with raft tremendously  and then i tried to 100 run thats when the game becomes a chore hooking 5000 items and surviving 365 days isnt for anyone who has a normal attention span i suppose this could be made a little more tolerable by adding in a lot i mean a whole lot of end game content  but i still doubt that anyone would want to go thru the monotony of manually hooking items when your collection nets can do the same thing for you

however my achievement related rant aside overall  its a fun game  well worth your money go sharks

#####

very calm game with heartwarming moments better played with friends really brilliant gameplay idea i just hope it gets a final ending really soon

edit after reaching the ultimate end i felt bit disappointed the progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again
very fun game anyways

#####

raft is tough at the start but once you get your bearings and figure out what to do it becomes really fun especially with some friends

my friends and i are getting excited to find big islands with new items and different animals i highly recommend this game especially if its on sale
play it with a buddy or two and youll get hooked 

the games perfect but my only gripe is the lack of controller support i for one have a disability and my left hand is pretty much useless without a controller in hand i have a hard time pressing wasd keys etc hopefully controller support will be added in the near future

#####

h1 overall score 810 h1

i played 48 hours with my gf we got 62104 achievements and we were able to complete the history this game is really fun entertaining and challenging you have to survive through the sea only with your raft while gathering resources at the same time you can follow the history path or you can just play as you go

i do recommend buying this game since it is a different experience than any other game also i do recommend playing it with friends since there is quite a lot of things to do

u b my score was based on

12  graphics
22  puzzlesdifficulty

#####

a farm game so empty that the first time i saw a whale i had an orgasm

#####

unfortunately no tentacles overall good game makes me wanna die a little less

#####

one of the things i like about raft is the constant need for attention to what you do as a player whether it is easy normal or hard id recommend it as a mental exercise game and a fill in the hours game for solo play raft party for groups is fun and great if you plan to play hard mode though i think hard mode is great if you want a challenge
what i dont like is the lack of interest in keeping current players interested in the game yet wanting to attract new players new players will be interested for the time it takes for them to reach the current soft end of game content there is right now finding the plane the boat and the radio tower are the highlights but the rest is sort of lack luster after a while it is still fun but after a while trying to play is just a matter of gathering materials building up surplus and readying for the next update which at that point will be easy to advance to the new soft end of game content
current lore another good point i like the hints of the world having flooded i like the idea of having a journal in game for finds and advancing the lore as to what had happened

took a while to update the review chapter 1 was a good update adding in a few clue islands where you can collect a pilots helm and a captains hat were good additions took a while but i finally beat the bear on balboa and finished the island recently havent gotten a bee hive yet but have found that petrol can be found in crates occasionally now 

i got to the caravan isle soon after i restocked my raft with wood and plastic i only use leaves to make rope and additional walls or roof portions when needed my raft has gotten big enough to need 5 engines i expect to need more in time as exploration adds more to the game did have a problem of some of my animals being knocked off the second floor of my raft somehow lost a chicken during that not a big deal find more chickens than goats and llamas now anyway i really need to hunt down another goat or two build a bee hive or two as well looking for the zipline and battery charger is interesting i like puzzles drives my husband crazy though when he watches over my shoulder as i slowly go through caravan isle now he wants me to get the zip line but i am going through the isle level by level found the jumper cables for the charger looking everywhere for parts to the zip line tools

i still would recommend this game for those who like time killing survival games once you get self sufficient you can take your time in going through the games chapters and lore areas it doesnt take long to get self sufficient after you get water and food production just remember put your water and food producers between two platform sections less likely to lose them to shark attack in easy normal or hard modes 

peaceful is still survival but is way easier and no worries from animals attacking you nice way to explore the game i suggest younger players to play this so they dont get upset as much you will still die from drowning but again no shark boar bear or anything will actively attack you in peaceful creative good place to plan out your raft prior to playing just remember your domestic animals can and will be washed away from your raft if they go underwater while you are moving or they are walking near a fence check them often water and grass i have 4 3x3 plots for grass and auto waterers squeezing planters into a 3x3 area also maximizes potato and flower production i have learned that trees arent as efficient anymore for self producing wood you will use more seeds than you can get seeds from harvesting trees on your raft good for growing mangos though still use more seeds than you get back from your trees better to find isles and harvest trees from them

will update as i get beehives zip line and battery charger i really need to charge some batteries i have a storage box full of them oh and last thing about buckets you collect milk with you get the buckets back apparently when you use the milk now

totally self sufficient have explored a lot wanted to get the piano but lost interest after a while probably will go back for it at a later date been a few months since i was last in game i checked out the updated building options paint options and a few of the quality of life additions im just in a holding pattern until the next chapter is released or some new stuff is added beehives make oil production easier make sure to collect flowers from islands you stop at for the seeds i stopped keeping the blooms themselves i ran out of room for paint and flowers for paint production ran out of room for wood a few times struggling with the plastic still cannot seem to collect enough but i make sure i have at least some surplus for crafting i have so many nets now i am dumping leaves and wood as i dont need them i have loads of rope getting to capacity for metal scrap and stone currently i can keep up with the needs of tools and weapons for expeditions onto bigger islands ive sort of stalled out looking for treasure on islands im to a point where if i lose my raft i just go drown myself not worrying about losing stuff on me i have extras and respawn on the raft

good luck rafting my fellow castaways use anchors sucks when you lose a raft when you forget to anchor

last entry in this long journey i started when raft was just a cute little test game one raft one shark and wits to gather and craft the basics then they moved to steam radio tower showed up i have a screenshot of that first radio tower somewhere here then things progressed over the years chapter 1  2 gained the start of a story of why where and how now with chapter 3 and the end of the adventure to find utopia i find myself a little disappointed that there will be no more going forward ill still play revisit a few places given time unlock the rest of the achievements then build the raft for a floating house and farm

enjoy rafting my friends good luck in your journeys and dont forget the next adventure is just over the horizon

i want to kill the rock dropping bird many times

#####

the game has improved so much multiplayer is amazing would 100 recommend this game

#####

finally the full game is here and i played from start to finish
i had such a great time it was really enjoyable but there was some bugs for me the worst bug was at the end
the last bossfight the audio and voice started glitching the game crashed 1 time but even after restarting
the audio and everything was still messed up

#####

i actually havent played this in a while but steam awards are upon us  i nominated raft in the sit back and relax category though one could certainly argue that it fits better in the better with friends one did a quick launch just for the badge and nostalgia hit  so i decided to briefly update my review as well

ive finished the full release story and in all honesty i had mixed feelings the final chapter felt a little rushed for the first time ive encountered pretty bad bugs during a boss fight i felt like they couldve done more in terms of populating the ocean no need to go full subnautica but they mainly just added a few more decorative fish groups in the shallows  it was nice sure just felt a little low effort all that aside i did continue to play mainly to chill on easy mode while listening to music or audiobooks it was a great way to completely distract myself after work sort of like diving into vacation mode and melting that stress away

in terms of recommending the game i absolutely do though i do have some friends who got dreadfully bored within a dozen minutes or so and some who enjoyed it personally i loved raft and ill keep coming back to this game from time to time

oh  if theres a bruce plushie that i can poke with a pencil or something im so buying it 




leaving the entirety of my early access review below


      

ive loaded 2 worlds so far one with a teammate on normal difficulty and later solo easy im so glad i started with a teammate and not on easy the initial poking around wasting time and a bit of survival chaos that ensued from neglecting the foodwater meters resulted in a few hours of incredible fun nothing more priceless than that initial oh shit moment when youre still clueless the shark bites off a bit of the raft for the first time and youre now floating on your measly 3 tiles not gonna lie when the shark started going right through them with the waves that became a little biggish and unruly i got a hit of mild thalassophobia ω 

on easy you dont have to worry too much about your food and water intake so you have more liberty to explore without stressing about supplies however going solo and already familiar with the basics i did notice that a certain repetitiveness can set in mostly due to survival mechanics there is a minimum necessary routine and oh no not this island again moments can happen but id say its not too much of a problem if you just surrender to the experience and relax fish dive have philosophical conversations with the shark poke it with a spear when it disagrees you definitely cant rush this game

solo i can play this for up to an hour with company its much more enjoyable so my advice would be dont venture into the ocean alone grab a buddy or two in case youre wondering no you cant eat them when supplies are low p though you can enable friendly fire so declaring an ffa for the last bit of fish scenario is entirely possible and dont fear the shark too much later you can wear it as a hat 



edit ive now finished the story it took us around 4050 hours in total to complete mind you we were taking our sweet time stopping at every island and stripping it of all its materials from the moment we built the radio receiver and started properly pursuing the objectives id estimate there were some 1520 hours of gameplay once the story was over my trusty teammate mostly lost interest while im still floating about grinding achievements and enjoying the current endgame which is basically furnishing the raft of your dreams

so satisfying so many things to do like that i feel playing with some friends is always better than solo and get ur friend who love cooking and farmingcause it really helps alottttttt  and get the other friend who can help kills bruce annoying shark and other monsters cause it so scary to fight it alone haha 1010

#####

710 years ago when i was like 1014 years old i found a game called minecraft the game was so imersive that you felt you were actually part of the world  could spend hours doing nothing at all but at the same time your doing everything this game is the same i bought it 5 min after release and i just now decided to take a break 7 hours in i legit thought it has been like 3 hours max but this game theres somthing about the graphics and the music that just pulls this game nicely together

#####

spending all you resources to build an ever increasing tower since the player with the top room is the captain

raft is a survival game on the endless waters it starts simple then quickly becomes harder as you cant keep up with the food and water requirments once you have a simple food and water supply going the games becomes more relaxed you spend your time fishing for trash or actual fish and building an ever increasing raft while sharks are breaking it down again the game becomes more of an exploration and building type game

the game is open world and you can go and do whatever there is a storyline in the game that unlocks new characters and blueprints as you progress the story is rather simple but brings you to a variety of different interesting locations

while you have islands to explore you spend most of your time on your raft collecting trash and building a bigger raft as such you spent a lot of time on a small area it can feel a bit boring andor lonely in single player raft is definitely one of those betterwithfriends type of game

the only downside is that besides the shark there is no interaction with the ocean there is some floating trash but no real ocean exploration you can not interact with the aquatic creatures nor is there anything to dive for only close around islands you can find resourches you need to dive for

still the game is very great fetch some friends and set sail for distant shores and remember there is only one captian and it is the player with the highest room

#####

nobody reads reviews for sure so ill say im gay

#####

some spoilery stuff but hopefully enough to prevent you tearing out your hair in frustration if you love figuring it all out yourself and wont just give up and refund the game dont read what is below but i wished id know some things at the start



this game could be frustrating to someone just downloading it going in on the normal difficulty or into some online worlds they join vs creating a world there are things you have but lots of things you dont know exist and dont know what combinations allow you to open up new things you can build meanwhile the animals shark others are dangerous food and water are a crisis and you do things that arent too bright building stuff while you need the resources for more important stuff drinking seawater etc 

i would recommend the following steps
 
1 read some community or internet beginners guides maybe some videos will help

2 understand the order of criticality for items you need to secure clean water production through a working purifier and a plastic cup you need to take water to the purifier and to take water out to drink materials to build a replacement hook when your hook fails a paddle helps steer you into flotsam streams or get yourself to a place where your raft will stay snug to an island until you can find enough rocksetc to build a one use anchor a fishing rod so you can catch fish and you want to get a grill up as soon as you can as it increases the value of food after that a oneuse anchor a reusable one is a long way off planks to replace what the sharks tear off some sun shade would help if you can spare the materials and your research table to you can start analyzing the new finds above and below water so you can learn more things you can build 

3 start a creative island just so you can see all the things you could one day buy in a normal game world and just build stuff and experiment with how to get water purified a grill to work all the way up to figuring out crops and biofuel production you cant go anywhere but you can get the feeling for the stuff you can build how it goes together in systems and what you can produce from some of them 

4 start a peaceful world to begin to play like the game  food and water matter you have to watch yourself diving or swimming away from your raft you need to harvest resources from islands and mostly from flotsam flows etc but the wildlife is not hostile that means the shark wont tear your raft apart and the other various hostile animals will not be beating you down whenever you get close you will have to use the research table a lot with new stuff to get the designs for new items but if you did step 3 you already know whats out there in the game 

only once you can master those two levels then id consider easy or normal level play in survival mode once you know how to manage resources collect them etc and all the systems you can then add on more hostile environment and animal life 

i think the game is great i got it for my daughter and wife to play with me im glad i took the learning curve and fought my way through many deaths to discover what i now know they would have given up on the game thats about the point i figured out a peaceful world would have given us a better environment for them to start with which is what we will do when they join in

theres a few glitches in the middle of some actions you cant do some other stuff that can be annoying but just change whats in your hands and options will come back watch out for opening loot chests or chopping stuff down when your inventory is full you want to have clear space to receive any new types of items that eventually makes storage container construction important 

and dont swim away from your raft get tired and not get back or have to swim uphill against big waves to get back to your raft even if the sharks dont slay you youll still have a problem and make sure your raft is steered to a decent spot where the current will push it up against the island and it wont immediately float away trying to pull a raft back to an island with a paddle is a failure prone operation  even modest current makes that fairly difficult with a plastic paddle

theres something kind of zen about fishing cooking harvesting flotsam purifying seawater etc its kind of relaxing if you are a bit ahead of the surviving point and island exploration is fun until you run into hostile animal life once you master the basics you can start to research better gear visit larger islands dive deeper etc but youve got to get the hang of the basics first and going solo nobody can help respawn you on the harder levels of the game 

it may not be as pretty as some undersea games but the gameplay is half minecraft and half survival and exploration its a good mix

you are on raft

#####

i almost never buy games in early accessnot because im opposed to it on principle but because with a massive backlog of finished games it makes little sense to me to put them aside to play an unfinished one im in no hurry and am happy to wait for full release

but despite the enormous popularity of the survival game genre there are almost no good chill coop ones those that exist tend to involve fighting hostile players or zombies i needed a game to play with some friends who were combataverse and raft was already many years into release so we picked it up

im quite happy with it but what you get out raft will depend pretty much entirely on two things how much you enjoy the core loop and how much youre interested in a slowpaced relaxing game vs one with lots to do or an exciting narrative

the core loop of raft built off of a successful game jam entry is simple and wonderful youre adrift on a seemingly endless ocean broken only by the occasional small island youre able to fashion a grappling hook and can use it to catch drifting debris palm leaves wood plastic from these you can expand your raft both in the sense of making it physically larger and in the sense of adding everything from water purifiers to cooking stations to beds to various cosmetic niceties

in this sense its a fairly typical survival game the big difference is that your base is mobile youre restricted to pretty lowtech stuff and theres a shark that regularly attacks your base the shark adds some tension but pretty quickly becomes more of a background annoyance than a true threat particularly if you play on lower difficulties where dying doesnt result in a loss of inventory as we did

i personally love the grappling mechanic and the varied pacing where you switch between hanging out on your raft and stopping off at islands to explore and gather materials theres a good 2030 hours of gameplay in this core loop though eventually youll have found almost all there is to be found there is definitely a finite number of objects and mechanics in this game and despite achieving financial success the developers have opted to keep their team small so progress towards 10 is quite slow though steady and certain elements are pretty threadbare the combat system is barelythere the rocs that drops rocks really on you are borderlineinvicible and not even worth trying to fight

theres also a narrative mode where you follow radio signals to unique environments exploring these grants you unique technology as well as the unfolding story of how the earth got flooded and what happened to the survivors the environments are fun to explore and significantly different from the procedurally generated islands the story is frankly pretty bad cliched artlessly written too full of characters that barely exist but its the sort of wellmeaning work of enthusiastic amateurs rather than something phoned in and so i dont bear it any ill will and i understand its been improved in the most recent update which i havent had the time to dig into yet

raft is a simple game and i can imagine various ways it would be more fleshed out but on its own terms its a lovely time and well worth the low asking price

#####

i love this game im obsessed

game is alot of fun i am excited to see where it will grow only down side is i did everything to be done in the game in 11 hours looking forward to what will come next

#####

raft

#####

a relaxing survival game the music just relaxes you even though a shark is eating your sail 

#####

great game so far cant wait for more great content

#####

its a good game but after a few hours of playing it you have researched everything and harvested every item you can gets pointless and the shark acts like a robot its like clockwork with that shark very unrealistic and becomes repetitive even when you kill the shark it reappears consistently every single time after 2 minutes the islands are very unrealistic tiny and difficult to access and they are not random gen but the one that gets me the most is when you anchor down the ocean stops moving everything stops moving the ocean is on pause while you are anchored they have a good thing here and with a decent amount of work this could be a very good game but at the moment i feel like they are not working on large content updates so maybe this game will be worth a buy in a couple of years so at the current moment i do not recommend this game

#####

raft has huge amounts of potential i played it back when it was exclusively on itchio and ive spent a good amount of time in both normal and creeative modes compared with the itchio version this is a massive upgrade which give me faith in the continued development of this game in ea heres my verdict for all who are interested 

h1tldrh1 
6 or 710 right now  910 whenif complete youll enjoy the pure survival experience the unique premise of surviving on your raft and the clean aesthetic right now in early access theres isnt quite enough to completely justify the 20 pricetag but i fully expect that when this releases fully it will be lots to build and keep yourself occupied for a few hours and hopefully much much more to come

bthe goodb
list
polished graphics
not many bugs encountered
building up your ship is tha bomb so few limitations here you can build a little dingy or a massive galleon as long as its mostly squareshaped
sails make you feel like a pirate
great foundation to build a survivalcrafting game off of already a good amount to do  craft  see
already integrated multiplayer with friends  you wont encounter random people
its adequately tough could less good depending on who youre talking to
youll contantly be busy the gameplay loop is satisfying and has purpose wake up  attack shark eat food check nets check crops replenish stocks attack shark search for stuff sleep repeat
list

bthe less goodb
 note some of these may be rendered irrelevent with ea updates
list
game can get stressful quickly on harder difficulties energy meters deplte quickly and replenish slowly and can even be a bit annoying on easy not the relaxing expereince i want sometimes
there isnt much variety to the islands and encounters you have in game at least not yet
islands are a bit too tall to get up to easily
decond floors require foundation which is good but it can be frustrating to have your bottom floor filled with support poles
i have used the antenna and reciever and it seems way more trouble than its worth 
in general there needs to be a deeper tech tree great start already though you wont feel this for a couple hours
no story yet
list

bthe not goodb
these are a little longer my apologies
list
the shark is your only real adversary but it never gets stronger there are never more of them and the only way you can distract it for a period of time is with some shark bait which requires you to fish up specific fish i never seem to catch those damn small herring  this dynamic is getting old rather fast its a great issue at the start but by the time you have a massive raft turning the corner to see a missing square is more annoying than anything else you could just ignore the shark after a certain point if you collect stuff quickly definitely needs something to spice it up different mobs laser sharks the kraken idk maybe you even could train the shark after feeding it enough times who knows excited to see dev progress here 
there is much that isnt made clear to you on how to use certain techitems  a small howto book like in scrap mechanic would be a great way to visually dispense some knowledge without an annoying tutorial a good example of this lack of guided direction is the fact that you use seaweed in the smelter to make vine goo  i discovered this by accident when walking past my smelter holding seaweed the option popped up until that point i had been searching the seafloor for vinegoo
the spear breaks after a number of uses that isnt devisible by 4 youll see why this sucks whn youve hit the shark 3 times only for it to break before you can give it the last hit  then it eats your scarecrow and you angrily craft a new spear

bpersonal gripesb

too much plastic seriously i dont know what to do with it all i always end up throwing it back in the water is this a commentary on society because if so i get it
weather doesnt do anything but act as an aesthetic difference right now would love to see more varied and impactful weather whirlpools tidal waves etc
underwater exploration can be so freakin amazing by far my favorite experience thus far has been finding a wrecked ship deep under an island  would love to see more interesting stuff underwater sunken pirate ships atlantis style ruins etc
right now it seems that once you start collecting scrap and metal from underwater the barrels contain less scrap than before this is super annoying since i find myself needing scrap so much midlate game
i really want to use the hook to pull myself towards objects  i noticed that it attaches to hard surfaces but just resets afterwards my first reaction was to jump in the water and try to pull myself to the boat with the hook but no luck
let me rotate tha boat dangit a rudder or something would be a ncie addition i dont like building stairs off all corners of my raft
ive seen many people ask to be able to build on the islands and where i think that would be neat i do think that it goes against the integrity of the games design philosophy of build raft live on raft die on raft  but perhaps a section of buildable items exclusively for building on land would be nice small ladderssteps a rope you could toss to higher levels maybe some climbing gear just a thought
list

bobligatory suggested additionsb
list
submersible of some sort maybe like an old style divers suit thats attached to the raft itself for air uses battery to pump air down etc
grapple hook mechanics for the hook
different biomes on islands winter islands desert islands tropical lava you get the idea
more mobs kraken lazer shark pirannah etc maybe an island could have pools of water in them with pirannahs in that water
a craftable map of sorts  compass  something else to help direct towards loot
feed the shark till friendly  fights the next shark for you
harpoon gun so i can shoot that shark from my perch 23 hit kill would probably be fair then lemme drag the body in like a piece of wood
fishnet you can drag behind the boat to collect fish  just like the collection nets for gear
list

pick this game up if youre a survival buff lots of fun to be had and likely much more to be had in the future

#####

hello rafters 
this game has everything you want for a nice price its first person you can kill sharks birds and slay fish while playing with your friends exploring a nice large world with lots of content and a nice story i love the raft building and overall everything about this game is awesome a must buy for every survival game lover

#####

braftb is one of the better early access releases on steam the good thing about this game is that they continuously update this game bfixing bugs and new contentb is a big plus and another reason to purchase it the other reason is it is great with friends it is also such a good game to chill out on and pass the time with do yourself a favor and buy this game  you wont regret it

#####

i can wear a shark head

i enjoyed this immensely as a solo player alone nothing but bruce the raft and myself i beat it twice in about 80 hours my kids 6 and 8 now 7 and 9 enjoy this game alot and its fun enough on peaceful to get my brain and raft management going while my kids gather kill fish and be noodles to one another

can be very relaxing or a stress fest depending on the difficulty

#####

very fun especially to play with your friends

#####

offline single player needs to be addressed  ive been playing over 300 hours all solo and this is the first ive tried playing away from an internet connection  

sad to say that the devs wont be transparent about why we cant play single offline

it doesnt matter that the artists intended for this to be a coop game saying a game is single player without allowing for offline play is dishonest

#####

be sure to play the game in a group the only problem is that the beginning of the game is really boring
overall its a good game 

#####

as some other commenters have said its not worth nearly 20 in its current state it starts off interesting and then becomes repetitive and boring within a few hours you float expand your raft find an abandoned raft then find a deserted island keep floating find another abandoned raft and then another island do you find two islands in a row nope you always find an abandoned raft and then an island in that order 

the game feels like its well made like if somebody cooked you a solid meal and then did not season or salt it at all you can appreciate that its not a poorly executed dish but it still feels incredibly lacking i understand its in early access if it was cheaper and had just a little bit more content and variety i would give it a thumbs up at this point

i had played an earlier version of this years ago it changed a lot since then in a good way keeping in mind the game costs 20 bucks i think the game is alright not amazing not bad just alright i think 20 bucks is way to much for the current state there is just not a lot of content just yet and it gets repetitive real quick

the game has lots of potential and i love what the developers did so far but its just not worth the 20 bucks i would recommend buying this on a sale i will set the review to recommended because the game itself is alright and i am certain the developer will add more content and it is still in alpha state after all 

however i would like for the developer to go down with the price to maybe about 10 bucks is what i think its worth the way it is right now just increase the price on actual release

#####

honestly this game is a blast ive not had this much fun with a cartoon style game in ages and that says something to be honest it does need a lot of work to become the game i hope it to become but for what it is right now it is super fun the new additions of animals and larger islands really help make it all start to come together the recipes and the intensity of the gameplay really bring out the fun side of survival weather it be a solo play through or a multiplayer playthrough its a very fun game i have watched the storyline for the game come together from the beginning where all we had was a radio tower with nothing really noticeable being in it to a full blown story island filled with honey and bears and large towers with plenty of notes and story to follow i would love to see where they take it from here

#####

raft

#####

survival at its toughest stage be it normal or hard mode
hard is only suitable for playing with friends or considered ironman mode

playing the game alone on normal can be hectic
game for the hardworkers 
agile control and think quick on the sail
act fast when scavaging or in water
time is ticking

wood is never enough
game gradually gets less tedious once the advanced equipments are in place


highly playable
time passes quick while playing
hope there will be more updates and development on the game




#####

my raft is bigger than my real house 1010 seriously a great survival game if you enjoyed the alpha it does that and so much more

#####

fantastic update since i last played with my friends there has been an improvement to the crafting areas you can explore and the lore the new areas really shed some light on a mystery that had baffled me last we played there were so many questions that i had been left with when i last played and i felt more of them were answered with this update

the new crafting recipes were a nice touch and made the game feel like you were working up to something as you explore you uncover notes that give a better idea of what had occurred and those little touches were nice its nice to be able to open my journal and read up on the new notes that i picked up the little adventure of finding a key and trying to locate the door that goes to it and finding another puzzle piece that stumps you momentarily these are fantastic additions

overall a great experience once again this update shows the dedication the devs have to telling a story through their game i cant guarantee youll play it for months on end but i can say that i was driven to come back once i heard there was an update my friends and i dove in headfirst since its a nice game that you can converse over while playing

#####

the game is fun and peaceful but right now there is just nothing to do

in five hours or so you can build everything there is to build probably doable in 2 or 3 if you tried there just isnt any content right now

there is one enemy in the whole game the shark he eats holes in the raft other than that hes not a threat his ai is terrible at hitting the player and with a decent spear you can kill him with very little effort not that it matters he comes back in about two minutes and hes really just there to annoy you

way to many items dont do anything stone is for arrows which you dont need and the starter anchor after you get the metal anchor stone is useless copper is only for electronic stuff once you make the antenna and the radio its useless too glass is for two recipes only clay is only for making bricks way too many things are  only for one item when the game already has very few crafting recipes to begin with all you ever really need is plastic rope planks and scrap

i wish there was a meh option here the game is ok but right now for 15 its just way too bare bones to justify its price

i would recommend this game to other players

pros
 has a little story you can get into that introduces unique islands and moderate challenges
 you can build decorate and paint your raft any way you want make it big or small
 lots of things to grow and cook
 its a fun concept and can keep you busy for hours
 has lots of things to craft and a few nice things to find like a captains hat

cons
 the islands start to look the same after a while not including the story islands which there arent enough of in my opinion not enough variety in islands too much similarity 
 you cant customize your character at all for a game that allows so much freedom to decorate and customize your raft having a premade character seems at odds with the spirit of the game
 story is too short 
 the sea water goes over the raft too much a raft would sink with that much water washing over it good thing you can build it into more a boat if you get creative
 toolsweaponsequipment break too quickly is everything made of marshmallow why do bowls disappear after one use

overall i enjoy the game and am looking forward to updates i just hope the development updates dont take too long

#####

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2022 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

jaws meets castaway

#####

okay so ive been 23 hours on this game and will give an impression 

to be remembered this game is still in development 

easy to understand the gameplay mechanism
fun to play with your friends
could expand your creativity on how making a beautiful raft on sea


lot by i mean a lot of grinding basically this game itself is like grinding simulator
at first itll be boring but when you get grasp of it itll be fun for a while
repetitive coz when youve done big things you just dunno what to do

its a great game but need more content for the start and some kind of things so this game doesnt feel really that grinding simulator



ah also i wish there is a new island where we could find a radio or somewhat so we could listen to songs

#####

the game is a total zen deep lore and packed with unsolved mysteries every day is a new adventure the sea can be unforgiving also bruce the shark is a total ahole 1010 recommended

#####

im on a boat

#####

an enjoyable few hours
raft runs smoothly  has multiplayer and only a few bugs i could find 


i originally gave this a negative review however  after two years i am happy to change that to a positive


the game provides a good few hours of play the developers have been adding content over the past 2 years  although slow progress has been made 

the game has a good starting point and provided progress continues it will become a game well worth 20



overall decision  worth 20 for the amount of enjoyment

bottom line  not fun without friends

i really want to like this game i really do i agonized over or getting this game or letting it go for about a month before finally shrugging and thinking meh its just 20 bucks

a small part of me regrets giving up that 20 because this game is boring as heck

early game is incredibly fun its harrowing standing there on your tiny af raft desperately grappling for supplies to build a spear before the shark starts taking chunks out of the only thing keeping you alive and the night time storms are nice to look at and experience 

but i can tell you exactly when the fun ends once you craft the water purifier for fresh water a grill to cook meat and maybe the plant potter thing to grow potatoes not starving or dying of dehydration are your only real concerns and once you attach net collectors to your raft even more worries evaporate the raft will do the job of collecting trash for you

so what else is there to do not much you can jump into the ocean and pick a fight with the shark but by the time you do everything i listed above the shark stops being a threat and becomes a nuisance even when you kill it it respawns in about 5 minutes to annoy you again  

im not impressed with late game content which is simply bigger islands with some animals on them oh and those terrifying puffer fish screw those things the end game radio tower seems to just be a place to find more scrapmaterials but not much else all in all its way too easy to fall into a rut because there is no story 95 of gameplay is sitting on a raft and hooking stuff towards you or catching it in a net  this game is in desperate need of some kind of quest systemdungeon system and an actual storyline

at best i can say raft has an extended life span if you mess around with friends but in the end ultimately you still get bored and it goes from a survival game to pimp my raft and the shark is just your biggest critic  if you have no friends with this game then mess around with some mods

so no i cant recommend this game in its current state raft was a cool idea in concept that blew up like a balloon but what is inside that balloon is even thinner than air

edit  people in the comment section are making excuses that this game is in early access no duh i know that it has been for nearly 2 years it will be 2 years in may and in 2 years theyve added more empty islands with bears on them animals that only serve 1 purpose and a ship

#####

this game allows me to become immortal by making a warship sized watermelon farm and eating the produce 1010 will consume watermelon again

#####

a wonderful game very well made and its not even fully finished yet there so much to do and learn very relaxing game and relaxing music i look forward to more content hopefully much much more 

1010 all round

the only thing that would be nice to see is a small tutorial on how a few things work and how to best start as a new player would 100 recommend this game

#####

fun nice coop game some beautiful screenshots to do w spent my time painting my boat in every ugliest colors ever
getting motion sickness when on the boat huuu d

 there is an option to remove the effects and such didnt worked as fine for me but give it a shot

#####

good survival with friends

#####

this game is very fun and enjoyable if you play with a friend makes the experience 100 times better i spent 6 hours on this game on the first day the bar was set high for me after playing r6s religiously for 2 years i needed a new game and this did the trick in my opinion i would wait until it goes on sale if was in your shoes great game overall

#####

basically skyblock from minecraft but with an oceanic twist great soundtrack looks nice makes you feel isolated below the ocen surface is scary so it persuades you to not swim under overall great game

#####

beautiful game great to play with my family on peaceful mode highly recommend

#####

i like playing in peaceful and swimming with da shark

#####

i really enjoyed playing raft and it is without a doubt a game i would recommend i would largely say that this game is a blend of minecraft valheim terraria and a few others that come to mind but ultimately it is still its own unique experience and that is why i logged so many hours in it there is just something enjoyable and ominous about being out on a raft with no guidance on what to do but survive and yet i found there was a lot of depth to this game with crafting building surprises and more that kept me coming back

at a 20 pricepoint this game is a no brainer and given how often it is on sale you should be able to find ample opportunities to play this game

#####

raft

#####

it was kinda boring before but since the update it seems more fun you actually have an objective in the game now

#####

thank you for the motion sickness mode 3

#####

raft is a very fun game and its best enjoyed with a handful of friends i would definitely reccomend this to anyone who loves a good survival and building game and likes a little bit of exploration as well its not perfect but for 20 you still get a good amount of gameplay

however there are some things i would like to see fixed or added
the sharks ai
the shark was scary at first but once you let go of your fear and become the aggressor well food becomes a non issue but you also learn the sharks pattern which is to attack retreat repeat
the dissappearing raft glitch
occasionally youll spawn in the middle of the water with no idea where your raft is on creative it becomes more of an issue than survival where you can kill yourself and spawn back on your raft
lack of building ability on islands
the only portion of the game you can build on is the raft and no where else it would be much easier if there was an ability to be able to build ladders and stairs on the islands instead of having to build floating stairs to no where on your raft
small islands
it would be very amazing to see some larger islands that can be explored and discover maybe some stories about the different islands caves and things of that sort while you float on your raft exploring and picking up different legends and treasures just a thought
more enemies 
the puffer fish is is going to be a great add to the mix as well as the bird enemy but if there was an occasional boss type enemy after x amount of progress or time played it would really liven up the game  a cracken or giant squid

all in all this is a very fun game it does have a ways to go but is a game worth playing now to support the dev team and to see where this game can go personally i feel like while it does have some limited content in its current state its still fun and entertaining and sometimes very relaxing with the building and creative mode i live streamed this game for several hours and felt there was enough content for everyone to enjoy it for a couple consecutive streams

would i reccommend this game in short yes

#####

woter is cold and scary

#####

a great game so far recommend that you play with a friend
cant wait to see what the future holds for this

#####

h1 please add more sharks h1

the game is solid like its got dang good survival base building and exploration gameplay and this review is more just an excuse to raise awareness for the fact that the total shark populations have fallen by 70 since 1970 get the game if youre on the fence about it or wait for a potential sale if youre short but also save the sharks they could use the help

b sharks have been hunted to the point of near extinction and threatened populations across so many types of shark since the release of jaws that at this point that can be considered a bit excessive b

i if you are scared of sharks researching some statistics to help comfort your mind may be an option i can promise they are not human hunters they are still an aquatic predator and can still be pretty scary looking but making them a symbol of fear is not going to do them any favours in a day and age where they could really use it i 

bruce the shark has the classic menacing look it doesnt have to be covered in scars and have its jaw slightly open all the time it could just look like a regular great white shark but thats just a minor aesthetic and honestly its more just the lack of anything redeeming for the shark that gives bruce a bad rep

i think the boat eating mechanic is cool a game doesnt have to be realistic and the devs do a great job making it close enough to reality to relate with but creative enough to explore and enjoy this works for a lot of the experience which is so fun theres also some pretty unique things in this game but theyre spoilers and this review is lé spoiler free  

so with that said keep the scary shark or make bruce look friendly make em bigger and scarier if you wish but consider this please

the addition of more sharks i know i said theyre represented poorly but more sharks please

h1the sharks h1

 thresher shark these have long tails that they use to whip at schools of fish and stun them this shark could very easily be a functional threat with a means to stun the player and create a larger threat than bruce

 cookie cutter if you want to make a scary creature you can use the cookie cutter a shark that ended up messing with the radar systems of submarines during the cold war cookie cutters could very easily pose a threat to the player and the boat as a horde style of unit

 megalodon i mean its a pretty obvious choice and im almost certain this has already been explored but as a mega threat to the vessel that roams a certain location you cant accidentally bump into i dunno could make for a great lost city

 whale shark yes its a shark that filter feeds this would not be a threat to the player unless they well decide to make it a problem as these are not going to try eat the boat or player naturally 

 mako shark yeah good luck out swimming this one maybe a bit too op to add to the game while representing their actual speed honestly but they also wouldnt be trying to eat the player naturally so maybe some creative license can be employed on that one

 bonnethead shark these guys are omnivores they have evolved to be able to digest all kinds of things and are the only sharks who eat seagrass they could be passive unless you provoke them and could generate around and large seabeds with enough seagrass

these are just a few ideas and im sure that the development team have probably seen most of if not all of them b but it would be really cool to see smore sharks b if there were even just one or two sharks that arent a threat to the player or their vessel then it would in my opinion surprise a lot of people to see a shark that doesnt want to eat them

h1 love the game but whale shark when h1

early access review 05042021

after spending some time on my raft i can only recomend this game
this is a very relaxing game to play and it feels like any age could play this
there is some dificulty settings available and a free builder mode to try everything you want
at the start you walk or peddle in a very cartoony world in wich you will have to survive if not in free mode
when i played this game i noticed i spent a lt of time in it quickly i like colecting and organising so thats why i guess 
cause as for the story mode available at the time it was pretty short more will come developers sayd game still in development
good thing to know there is a pretty active sea around you people with motion sickness might be afected by but there is a slo a setting to prevent this sea from being this active and you will have a smoother ride on your raft the tech specs requirements are very low game has no gamebreaking bugs and as far as i played i havent encountered any great job

 the renovation update 

awesome a lot of new not survival requirements stuff has been added chairs n sofas rugs art flowersplants a whole lot your raft can now be your floating castle with everything you can think of
dont hessitate to buy this game its good for many hours of fun
the team behind this development is doing a great job for an early access game there are finished products out there that can learn a thing or 2 from this team imo

boat

#####

there is a lot to like about raft but i dont think i would recommend it for players who love survival games or sandbox  open world games unless you like story games and dont mind progression being gated behind story chapters

the good
 fun in multiplayer as it helps to share the grind
 lots of items and blueprints to find build and experiment with allowing for a lot of creativity
 looting is fun and satisfying
 exploration is also fun although the islands do get samey after a while
 decent modding scene to make it more to your liking

the bad
 quite buggy
 light on survival mechanics which have been replaced by basic and overdone mechanics like needing to constantly eat and drink and remake all of your tools as they have terrible durability
 little replay value if you dont enjoy the gameplay loop of following the story which involves solving lots of puzzles parkour and doing a lot of backtracking
 you get some of the best items after the story ends but for a game so driven by story and with little to do but sail around the same similarlooking islands getting the same resources as before there is little incentive to keep playing

this game is not like subnautica where you can mostly ignore much of the story as exploration alone will help you unlock blueprints and find materials for more advanced building improving your raft and finding better materials is locked behind story progression making this feel like less of a sandbox and more of a storydriven adventure that takes place in a very big world without that much happening in it it is still really fun in multiplayer however so recommended for people who have friends

oh and no controller support  there is a way to use bpm on steam and get it working but without native controller support you cant do things like toggle running rip my left thumb and stick

this game was great at showing me id die of hunger while trying to research stupid crap i found on the beach
1010

#####

20 is a bit steep with the amount of content in the game but as long as they keep updating the game fixing bugs and adding more content it will be well worth 20 even the first public release is a lot of fun

#####

1st min damn these graphics are amazing jizzes self
2nd min sees an island
3rd min approaches the island to find that there is a landshark gltiched in the sand
4th min i name the shark johnson
5th min i look along the shores for crabs
6th min i find no crabs and give up
7th min i find a machete
8th min i explore a shipwreck
9th min i open a ship door to find a shark inside and it isnt johnson

13th min i learn that the shark in the ship has left
14th min i exit the ship to find out that johnson and 2 of his friends are circling the ship

18th min my wife walks in the room asking why am i talking about gangbanging
19th min i look at my screen right as johnson kills me
20th min realizes this was the best 20 min of my life

#####

such a fun game my girlfriend and i beat it when the only goal was to find the hidden tower now that its updated again we started over and are having just as much fun it is so relaxing and challenging enough that its enjoyable

#####

 very good funny and chill game to play with friends to explore the whole ocean and build up your own raft 
 to be honest one of the funniest coop game ive ever played i definitely wont recommend you to play this game alone it would be ultra boring so bring some friends and chill with the ocean 3
 only negative thing about the game is lack of content you cant do much things other than searching islands on the ocean its pretty much the same after some time but still its really fun

#####

great game fun to just chill with friends and you can easily play it for hours if you dont chase the story

#####

a nice and enjoyable coop game if you dont mind the bugs that get you killed sometimes there are also some bugged and grindy achievements that make no sense

#####

i enjoy the concept of raft where you get to sit down collect trash and slowly upgrade your little raft the graphics are gorgeous it has a wonderful soundtrack which can occasionally just stop playing for some reason for long periods of time and its just overall fun howeverand this is my only complaintits way too slowly paced if you want to get anywhere you have to sit down for a solid hour or two to farm up enough materials to make the items that you need to really start growing this game really lets you do as you please which i love i just dont like how  you have to farm up so many materials until you can get enough fishing nets

#####

this is by far the most relaxing game i have in my library its impressive in so many ways let me just say the music in game is very well made with pianos and various instruments the music blends very well with the relaxing ocean view and a scene of a giant moon great atmospheric value in this game its alot of fun with friends to just survive the game is not meant to be very challenging unless you specify that you want it to be basically what im trying to say is this game rocks and is super relaxing after a long day at work or dealing with nonsense lol this is a game u can launch and just chill kick back and wait for old sharky to attack the raft if you like laid back survival games with great atmospheric value and a great captivating sound track day and night cycles where u dont have to do much to survive then u will like this game link up with friends for a more enjoyable experience this is my go to game when ive had a long day and i dont wanna think in a game not really meant to be challenging more of a visual captivating atmospheric game that really makes u feel like your on a raft stranded in the ocean i rate this 810 xd

#####

been playing this game since early access and its only gotten better raft has been my goto favorite game for a while now to just chill and survive on my own or with friends theres a lot of room for creativity when designing and decorating your raft and ive seen some pretty amazing ones the graphics arent top tier no but they fit the game so well and theyre not by any means bad and as one would expect or hope from a game based on living on a raft the water effects are done very well sometimes a little too well so if you get motion sickness then you could possibly experience that with the big waves the combat is very basic but it works and i dont think its boring at all its actually very easy to get sucked into the environment and lose track of time which isnt a common thing for me with other games i will say that the game doesnt hold your hand so if youre looking for a clue to tell you what to do it wontat least not at first everything is really up to the player to figure out but once you reach the first story island youll know where to go next to progress the story if youre not playing with someone whos familiar with the game or using a guide the first part of the game might take a whilebut what you see in the beginning isnt what youll see throughout the entire game there are different biomes enemies and interesting places to explore so its definitely worth the time i will also note that coop play while fun can also be a bit jankyfrom my experience anyone that isnt the host will usually experience some lag or my favorite a freshly killed enemy sliding across the ground and into the water like some sort of magnetic pull lost a few seagulls that way but you get better at catching them before they hit the water no this game isnt perfect and to some it might be boring or grindy but if youre looking for a chill survival game then this might be the one for you 

#####

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

update after coming back after 1 year

no i still cannot recommend the game in fact it is worse now

raft started out as a chill survival game with a little bit of challenge you had to have some plan to what you were doing get your priorities in order and then you were good to go


the good

1 performance is now better after 3h of playtime no fps drops whatsoever game runs stable however my gaming pc with way above specs runs ireallyi hot

2 visuals ost and story are nice even though story is minimal and is told through notes from people that came before you in certain points of the game gives it a nice touch of mystery and wants you to stay on for the story

3 islands are now a lot better there is always a bay where you can land without an anchor and you dont need to build a tower to reach the top of islands there is always a way up also spawnrate is good now


the bad

1 the game is ihorrifinglyi grindy 
an example the first fishing rod you can build which needs a lot of resources lasts for 10 fish one fish fills you between 15 the first you can find  means you need half a rod to fill your belly which does not work as you grow hungry quicker than your rod and the bbq works and 23 the bigger fish  they have 3 portions you can eat   you can only cook them on the bigger bbq of your hunger bar the shark steak now only fills about 13 which is ridiculous the only thing that fills up more is the cooking station and it needs a lot of resources you wont be able to obtain for a while
i think this example shows pretty well what i mean in a two player game on normal mode one player is constantly farming for food because recipes which you can find are rare and incredibly expensive to make as you need a specialised tool for them
same goes for building materials or any usables my friend and me found ourselves grinding constantly to keep everything going running from a to b even with gathering nets which autocollect stuff from the water 
usables degrade superfast one dive with an oxygen flask say goodbye to 10 of it shoot the bow 10 times 13 of it gone
so the issue is that all the new and improved stuff you can build does not really feel rewarding only the bigger bbq and the bigger water still really feel like an achievement the rest just feels like extra chore to maintain

2 hence i find that i cant enjoy the game the chill factor of the game is gone it is just one long hustle until you get to the story points and yes again i know it is a survival game hence grind is to be expected but at some point in the game there should be a baseline you establish and not just running after the same chores that need to be done in raft you need everything all the time

3 balancing of the shark this one is complicated in the beginning it is a welcome challenge as soon as you manage to have an indestructible raft it might as well not exist as it does not attack whatsoever it only attacks you when you are in the water 

4 the big islands oh bother the big bird attacks relentlessly and hits you perfectly with stones even if you dodge i found it especially funny when he threw a rock at me from down below hitting with the clunky bow mechanic is tedious at best it takes forever to draw it and the arrows fly too slow and too unpredictable hitting something with them is annoying and unnecessarily hard and if you finally manage to kill the big bird you dont even get interesting loot 
apart from that the big islands seem empty only some animals not many new resources everything is quiet and empty

5 nonexplained resources for example eggs i expected to find them on big islands but nothing after 3 or so i then looked it up  super unintuitive spoiler you need to catch a chicken with a net thrower then tame it and then have a nesting place on your raft oh and dont you forget to put it in a pen and feed it with one specialised thing otherwise it dies after 10 minutes so much time to figure everything out spoiler
llamas are also a good example you kill one you get nothing llamas are edible in real life how about some meat if you missed the wool resource

6 as lifeless as the islands are so is the water no fish or other animals except the shark and one other fish with is extremely rare

7 too little additions in the time the game had to grow there are the big islands yes and some more story yes but it all still seems empty and the mechanics are crude at this point the game has nothing to offer but eternal grind and that is no fun for me

8 distant view bug and completely dark night are still persisting issues

it seems to me that the devs of raft really dont know where to go with the game they are just sprinkling a little bit of everything into it and none of it is done properly farming is grindy the crafting system is meh the combat system is meh and everything is complex enough that the manner of the game to not tell you anything about its mechanics makes it hard to advance 

it breaks my heart to see the game go downhill like that i loved how it started but now all it is is a grindfest

#####

enjoy the view and keep drifting away from reality

#####

one of the better craftsurvival games im normally pretty apathetic towards the genre but since its early days raft has been a welcome staple in the play rotation with my friends and i the balance between surviving scavaging exploring and creation is bang on the game loop directing attention where needed without becoming tedious or overstaying its welcome theres a great sense of progression and accomplishment as you create new equipment and tools to make your survival and exploration more efficient and in my regular circle we never feel overly pressured or stressed to just stay alive the procedural nature of the game is random enough that were keen to check out new islands as they approach to mine resources but also feel comfortable skipping them and moving out without fear of missing out

but i think what i love most of all and what has kept raft in our rotation is the meaty content added with each of the major chapter updates weve genuinely looked forward to each chapter as with each update we know were on a multiisland adventure of discovery theres a real sense of progression as we unravel the narrative through notes and collectables while also unlocking new crafting recipes and gear to enhance the functionality of our raft because of how balanced these updates are these upgrades indeed make our survival easier and more efficient but not enough to break the game so much explore new farming resource and activity options setting ourselves up for the next chapter whenever it comes

we genuinely cant wait for the next chapter huge kudos to the team for nailing the gameplay loop so well with such a clever aesthetic tone and feel that is just the right balance in all the right areas also as a side the three of us adore the artistic attention to detail on all the craftables and new raft equipment you all have done a great job at making them crazy patched together bits and pieces of rubbish and junk that seem like they might just work as intended love it

#####

i finally managed to get through this game to the end

to be honest when i bought it it was 2018 if im not mistaken it was so raw that there was almost nothing to do other than rafting i was just endlessly catching trash building my raft and that was it there were very few recipes in this game and not much to do i played it for about 10 hours and forgot about this game for a few years
next when i came back i was pleasantly surprised large islands had been added a huge number of new recipes animals but still the game lacked any purpose all we had was a small amount of lore in the journal and nothing else and of course this time i abandoned the game again
what happened when i came back to the game a few more years later the game came to life it had already come out of early access and was finally complete the developers had added more recipes wild animals different story islands bosses stores and so on the game became interesting to play and had a purpose and of course an ending 
the story unfortunately was very simple and in some places artificially stretched on some islands we had to spend a few hours to figure out what to do next
i can say that the game really turned out good and is very enjoyable to play especially with friends it doesnt keep you in suspense at all and relaxes you as much as possible its really worth to play and it deserves your attention as well

my final rating is 810 
i wasnt expecting anything fantastic from this game but i had a good time checking it out and im glad i tried to play raft once and waited for its logical conclusion
