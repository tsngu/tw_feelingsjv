this is a gacha game never indulge a gacha game not even to try they exist isolelyi to get you hooked and then steadily raise the bar on your expected efforts and investment until they find the threshold of insufferable just to try and force you to buy exploiting fomo fostering investment fallacy and baiting group mentality its all here

if you were hoping for this to be the definitive ff7 remake experience it is sadly not that the story skips around as it pleases leaving in only chunks of the juiciest dungeons to explore and a fragmented handful of story beats that completely skip all the travel minigames and flavor between locations cutscene decisions have been rendered completely inconsequential and skippable no one cares if you give the flower to marline or tifa it does nothing and only a fragment of the actual story is available to begin with youll have to wait a year or two for the live service to slowly churn out one new chapter at a time chopped into a hundred bitesized pieces of course naturally any parts that werent already seen in ff7 remake will appear exclusively in lowquality ai upscale instead of actually being remastered to a meaningful degree

if you were hoping for an engaging multiplayer experience this is also not that while online coop technically exists and is beneficial the gameplay boils down to hope youve grinded power numbers in the specific attack types you need for this boss and its better played by the auto button rather than actually giving it your time and attention to play manually

if you were hoping for a casual slot machine you can throw a couple dollars into for a quick dopamine rush as you hope for something good this game wants over 15 usd per spin straight up and bombards you constantly with limited time offers regardless its petulant

if you were somehow hoping for a game that will stand the test of time and make you feel good for all your time and effort spent on it im sorry to remind you that this is a live service you do not own your save data and it will be shut down at any time even if they didnt finish the story yet any progress you do make will inevitably be a moot point anyway as the weekly updates perpetually churn out new events to grind new goals to reach and new power to obtain you will never be on top for long because the entire game is fundamentally designed around incrementally making everything you own slowly become outdated and worthless as the power creeps steadily and inevitably nothing in this game will be special or unique every single weapon will immediately already have two different variants upon release just to give the same weapon to multiple characters in case you prefer one over the other

why are you even reading this go ahead and fight four hundred scorpion sentinels in a row if you dont believe me grind to level 50 and watch as the level cap gets raised by 5 every month until they reach their favorite numbers 99 or 120 max out a weapon only for two new gachaonly weapons to appear that outclass it with every event carefully farm synthesis items and generate materia in every sigil every element and in both magic and physical forms while the game cycles through focusing on each in turn until eventually they introduce a new type of materia for you to grind all over again

this is not fun this is just busywork something pretty you can idly poke at while you wait for something real to happen thats all its good for and even then youll want to keep it muted or the same three songs repeating constantly will drive you up a wall

dont be fooled by my playtime on steam i have spent more time than id care to admit on this game via mobile having played since the beta i have also made the mistake of spending around 40 on the game specifically on the season pass for three of i believe five seasons since launch i also played the other shortlived ff7 mobile spinoff the first soldier for a decent chunk of the time it was available also from beta thanks to these poor decisions i feel im qualified to give a fairly informed opinion on the quality of ever crisis

so assuming youre going in blind what is final fantasy vii ever crisis ever crisis is a free to play pay to win gatcha autobattler game originally released on mobile devices that expands upon the story and universe of the original final fantasy vii it retells the stories of the og ff7 moreso than remake and ff7 crisis core through use of story vignettes short cutscene chapters very limited environment exploration sequences and autoplay battle sequences to retell past events more significant however is the use of these mechanics to tell a new story the first soldier this gives a suitable point to start the main content of this review which will not hide spoilers for the rest of the ff7 series on the assumption that if youre here you at least have a vague knowledge of the main ff7 story because if were being real ever crisis is a very poor entry point for anyone new to ff7

ever crisis first soldier narrative is set thirty years before the events of the original ff7 with focus placed on the early soldier programme of the shinra corporation overlapping with the minimal story elements of the shortlived mobile shooter of the same name the first soldier follows a cohort of early soldier candidates prior to use of genetic modification three incredibly generic characters with very little personality sillytype leader glenn lodbrok smarttype matt winsord and girltype lucia lin the three are sent to scout out the site of a potential new mako reactor on the rhadore archipelago a location never before seen in ff7 despite the comprehensive world map of previous games to cut a lacklustre story short the three crash land on the islands befriend a member of the assumedtobehostile locals get helped by said local and make it to another island where they are joined by their new leader a young sephiroth the appearance of the antagonist from the main game in his youth is perhaps a primary appeal of ever crisis yet the addition adds very little he didnt even appear in ever crisis until a significant time after the original release at the time of writing sephiroth hasnt really done a great deal the story hasnt gone anywhere interesting but the four shinra lackeys have now killed some local child soldiers i imagine the juxtaposition of the protagonists canonically exterminating a disenfranchised local population including child soldiers is meant to be morally interesting but really it just feels awkward when contrasted with the entirely unfunny humorous antics of the cast up until this point so the story certainly leaves a lot to be desired but hey the developers are technically still releasing new story elements  albeit at a snails pace  and the trailers for ff7 rebirth have hinted at overlap so i am still interested to see where things go though with incredibly reluctant curiosity

but beyond the very limited gameplay or indeed lack thereof and slow lacklustre story what else does ever crisis offer at present there is so little else to bring up to be honest i guess i kinda like how they have approached seasonal events and the overlap event with ffix but even those were also incredibly gimmicky with very cliché and soulless writing for the halloween and christmas events the ff7 characters had the most bland dialogue to cover offbrand parodies of these holidays for inuniverse context with minimal if any character development or relevance and contrived plot conveniences needed to force the characters into the most bottomofthebarrel scenarios seemingly only to enable further thematic cashgrabs to try and incentivise players to spend more money on the latest weapon and skins

this brings us to both the most core and most egregious element of ever crisis the gatcha mechanics for the blissfully unaware a gatcha game refers to a videogame that implements mechanics reminiscent of arcade vending machines with semirandomchance minigames or elements enabling the potential acquisition of ingame benefits or items it can more succinctly be called gambling for ever crisis the gatcha mechanics are deeply embedded in progression to progress through the game you need characters who are highly levelled and have good equipment to get good equipment you need to play the gatcha elements spending ingame currency for a chance at getting rarer or stronger items or materia to kit out your party if you want this to be even remotely quick youll need to spend realworld money not only to simply run more gatcha draws but also to even play at all thanks to the built in stamina mechanic that prevents you from completing too many battles too quickly if you havent been playing the game basically every day since launch youre at a disadvantage and the developers bet on that if youll excuse the pun in the hopes youll spend money to level up to get cosmetics and to ensure you can enjoy as much content of the game as possible

this brings us to the bottom line being free to play and avoiding spending money or being a casual player is basically a death sentence you will never be able to experience all the game has to offer if you arrived late if youre unwilling to spend money or if you dont want to grind every single day without doing one of these youll never have a chance in hell of experiencing the majority of the timelimited content sure the story will still be available and ready for you to waste your time levelling up so you can see the hackneyed content which may end up tying back into the main story if we give the devs enough time but if were being honest and not giving benefit of the doubt this is just a cynical cash grab taking advantage of loyal fans and making an opportunistic attempt to dig claws into unfortunate fresh blood who are curious about the franchise i know many game devs are doing similar these days especially on mobile but i am still disappointed that those in charge of the ff7 ip have so little pride in their product and story to allow this to happen

to summarise final fantasy vii ever crisis is a mobile gatcha game with a generic story that cannibalises characters and narrative elements of the original ff7 universe in an opportunistic attempt to make a cheap grab at any spare cash ff7 fans and newcomers may have while there are some elements of genuine potential promise in the source components of this work i have no faith they come from ever crisis itself so much as they come from the source ff7 content or from elements perhaps drawn from the development of ff7 rebirth for instance i think there may be music tracks in ever crisis that at present are unique to the game and arent awful but i would not be surprised if these were taken from rebirth and reused but other than that and a very fleeting hope that more interesting story beats may be added i view ever crisis as simply a parasite of the main ff7 series and an unfortunate symptom of its success my only hope is the devs dial back the predatory moneyhungry gambling mechanics and focus more on making genuinely highquality content to enable development upon and tiein back to the main series but i do not have high hopes that this will actually happen

310 would not recommend unless you are a die hard fan of ff7 with either a lot of money or a lot of time to spare

#####

gacha trash  if theyd remade the original games with this art styleupscaling would be a masterclass in how to update a beloved ip instead we got this garbage

#####

a lot of misconceptions about this game

yes this is a mobile gacha you pull for weapons not characters
no this is not a proper remake of the compilation games also its very incomplete
is it pay2win yes and no see below

heres a quick rundown of all the thing you need to know portgraphicsoutfits are good i wont write about them

list
     story mode at the time of writing this game covers the og ff7 story up to junon crisis core story up to banora and there are 5 chapters of the exclusive first soldier sephiroth story and so far its pretty bad not even worth watching on youtube the story is adapted in forms of chapters which are a mix of narrationbattledungeon exploration now all of these are very well done except for the midgar part of of ff7 its so rushed its laughable and it really leaves a bad taste in your mouth so if you only care about seeing the og ff7 story remade with good graphics then this is an easy skip
     gameplay this is definitely the best part of the game that said 90 of content can be done with recommended autoequip and on autobattle but if you try tackling content above your power level thats where this game shines youll need a perfect understanding of team building mechanics in order to make a team that potentially could beat the boss youre facing and then you have to actually beat it on manual by memorizing enemy attack patterns optimizing atb usage of all 3 characters in real time and again having a a very deep understainding of battle mechanics otherwise you wont pull it off dungeons add 1 more layer of difficulty by making you find the optimal route taking the optimal upgrades managing item usage etc basically at that 10 ever crisis becomes a skillbased puzzle game and this is where it really shines finally beating the hardest boss after 10h of retries felt better than beating any boss in any souls game for reference 
     monetization the monetization is good basically this game is design to not let you spend money on it by making everything ridiculously overpriced for reference if you want to do a 10pull on weapons you need to spend like 15 but if you consider all the free gems free pulls free tickets etc in practice you do 2 10pulls per day on average for free and its been like this from the games launch for reference i did 4000 free pulls in total this game is very generous when it comes to free stuff and the odds for gold weapons are very good 75 and you only need 1 copy of some of them to clear most of the content
so whats the point of spending money there are none unless you are a whale who wants to catch up with the power creep within a week of all the content the only whale exclusive things in the game are 3 cosmetic banners icons and 5 cosmetic profile banners also 5 cosmetic wallpapers but those are relatively cheap thats literally it and most of those are from the first 3 months of the games lifetime because now a f2p player can clear all the content assuming he started playing on launch
the only other exception is that you cant get all the gears with the free gems but you can get something like half of them basically pull only on arcanums and crossovers so its more than okay for gameplay purposes since those are the only really good ones
also a lot of reviews are talking about aggressive popups but those will mostly go away after the first few days so they are not an issue at all
     qol mechanics this is the biggest offender this game doesnt value your time stuff that should be done with 1 click like all the daily mission require at least 30m daily also you cant skip fights even if you are 10x stronger than the enemy autoequip is garbage for anything above your power level the companion ai is super annoying remember those manual fight i wrote about where you need to manage atb of all 3 characters thats half the battle fighting against you own ai to prevent it from doing dumb shit also theres other ui issues that still havent been fixed after 4 months even if everybody keeps complaining about them not being able to batchconvert materials autoresetting equip on extra fights no retry button the whole materia ui etc this stuff has no excuse
list

tldr
gacha fan and ff7 fan recommended but youll need to invest a lot of time in order to get good
not gacha fan but an ff7 fan give it a try if youll manage to endure the first week you will probably enjoy the daily grind
gacha fan but not an ff7 fan skip it there are better gachas
not gacha fan and not ff7 fan obvious skip

technically my verdict is mixed but im leaving this review as positive since i assume most people interested in this are already fans of ff7 universe and its kinda sad seeing them missing out because of few popups and blatantly unfair reviews

#####

do not waste your time with this game its a cash grab for whales using ff7 as a skin

if youre interested in the game only for the new sephiroth lore theyre adding like i was then do yourself a favor and just watch the cutscenes on youtube 

theres no substance here go play the original ff7 with mods and crisis core reunion if you want remastered versions of the games

#####

many gacha games offset their predatory gacha with interesting gameplay this is not one of those games

#####

this is probably the worst possible way to experience the stories of ff7 they could have ever made

this game is a mobile gatcha game port  not a bad gatcha since you have to roll for weapons and not characters this is the best gatcha option even though having none is better 
game itself is fine  the story is laid out in an episodic format so you have to wait for a while to play the entire story 
this game covers the original ffvii story  ffviicrisiscore this game doesnt do justice to the original story so i dont think this is the place to start when it comes to the story  fyi just play the original games and a new prequel to the ffvii series as a whole with new main characters and more backstory for sephiroth called the first soldier this story seems to be connected to the ffvii remake project so i think it s worth to play the game just for that and not focus on anything else really if you don t want to 
the graphics are similar to the original ffvii aside from some cg cutscenes here and there  in combat the characters have models akin to ffvii remake
as a spinoff this game is fine  not good  not the worst 

#####

i feel sorry for ff7 fans for a different kind of remake they really put in the bare minimum of what fans want

 wow it runs so smooth wish the ff7 remake port was this smooth
 heavily abridged stories that are incomplete and chapter release is glacially slow might as well wait or just look up a video
 convolutedgrindy leveling system and combat not even the ingame auto equipbattle knows what to do at times
 not so micro microtransactions there are so many options ranging from 2 to 70 that exists to muddy your perception of value and what you are actually getting oh and if you think you can just avoid it entirely the game will take every opportunity to blast your screen with a  limited time deal to turn your gaze towards the cash shop
 what pity system just keep rolling blues and watch all your hard earned x1 stamp progress disappear when the next outfit banner drops theres always a new one each week how fun

even by gacha standards this game is ghoulishly monetized

edit typos and spacing glaze should of just left it

#####

nostalgia bait painted over an autobattle gacha game that is constantly notifying you of the 1000 different items to buy and ways to spend money but hey its free right if you can get past all of that the production quality is pretty good for a mobile game its a shame we get additional ff7 story through this type of content because even if you dont have to pay any money it is very time gated by the ingame energy resources needed to level up having said that and ignoring how predatory mobile games are in general i will play it until i get bored because i really like the characters and story but i definitely wont spend any money on it

#####

if you are looking to experience the entirety of ff7 universe then you come to the wrong place this isnt a bad game at all but if you are looking to throw money might as well throw it by buying the original games it is an entertaining game despite being a mobile gacha game you can make progress without spending money slowly but doable

#####

if youre not a diehard fan of ff7 dont give this game the time of day its pretty to look at on the surface but has a lot of predatory design choices

#####

this is an excellent pc port of a great cellphone game
for the sake of clarity i shall split my review into the pc port and the game itself

pc port
this is an excellent pc port
it accomplishes almost everything i would expect of a good port and is by far the best way to play the game now
i say that having tried the game on a beefy phone and on pc using an emulator
this port easily trounces both
some pros and cons
pros
silky smooth framerate at 4k
looks clearer and crisper than either phone or emulator at 4k
faster loading times running on an ssd faster than either phone or emulator running on an ssd
the interface is far more responsive no more mini pauses it just goes
great controls and customizability of said controls
better sound experience

cons
for some reason my ingame shop is in dollars and not my local currency this wasnt a problem on phone or emulator i have reported this to them

conclusion
all the above leads to a far smoother experience that is hard to quantify i ran a bunch of random fights and it just feels so much better like a load i didnt know was there is now gone
i had no problem with the game on cellphone and emulatoruntil now now it feels hard to go back

original game
now that i am done heaping lavish praise on an excellent port lets talk about the actual game this will be a bit less positive
for those who dont know let us be clear at the start this is a cellphone gacha game with all the negatives that come with that game format this is not final fantasy 7 rebirth we need to wait till feb for that this is also not a second remake of final fantasy 7 this is a final fantasy 7 gacha game
that being said it is actually a great gamefor a gacha game
so lets break it down

gacha element
right out of the gate this game is fairly unique compared to other gacha games
it is a weapon based gacha which is very rare 
this means you get characters for free and pull for the weapons and outfits instead
the way it works is that every character has many weapons and some outfits new ones are released regularly
weapons determine two of your characters five in game abilities generally the most build defining ones they also affect your characters strengths
outfits only affect your characters passive strengths
characters can equip 5 weapons and 1 outfit at a time
of those 2 of the weapons must be for that character the other 3 can be for any character
the outfit must be for that character
the 2 character specific weapons determine the characters 2 defining skills
weapons give stats and passive bonuses
outfits give only passive bonuses
passive bonuses come in two types r abilities and arcanums
arcanums are rare and only appear on some outfits they give a flat bonus and have so far been only elemental
eg 30 increased ice damage
r abilities appear on everything and are common they give a bonus based on a stacking number increment
this encourages collecting weapons
because if i build cloud with a strong water attack weapon and red xiii has a weapon that boosts water damage which i had previously built for him i can still equip that on cloud now
so even when you change builds your previous weapons are not immediately made obsolete
note there is a full and robust skin system so you can look like anything you have unlocked even if that is not what you currently have equipped
that makes the primary motivator in this game looking good and raising your numbers while also creating different builds to handle different situations
how you do this is through pulling on banners
each banner will have 1 or 2 weapons that are new and banner specific
but with the exception of the ffix limited banner all banner weapons are later added to the general pool
outfits so far have not come back
you can wish list up to 5 weapons on any banner to greatly increase your chance of getting that weapon allowing you to focus on specific weapons to build
the chance of pulling a 5 star weapon on a banner is 7
there is also a stamp system whereby you get stamps for each pull these can range from 1 to 12 depending on luck with higher numbers being harder to get
at 6 stamps you are guaranteed a 5 star of your choice from the new banner weapons at 12 stamps you are guaranteed an outfit of your choice form the banner ones
so the game has multiple strong pity and safety systems in place
overall the gacha is one of the fairest i have ever seen

visuals
these are excellent easily the best that i have seen in a cellphone game
it is not just the quality of the assets or even the special effects but all the in between touches
the game uses two art styles a chibi style for out of battle that looks like a very modernised version of the original games in combat it uses the same style as the remake trilogy
not only does it look gorgeous but it iscomplete
something i notice in a lot of cellphone games and even some full console releases is cut corners with animation
this makes sense somethings are harder to animate than others but it can get noticeable
for instance sitting down anything that involves hands etc etc
which is why it impresses me the number of bespoke animations there are in this game 
i swear there are some animations that are only ever used once made specifically for a situation
there is a point where aerith hands cloud a flower and he attaches it to his chest
in a different game the camera angle would change or there would just be nothing there
but no you see her hand him the flower and him attach it to his chest it is fully animated
ff7 has some veryinteresting characters this game brings them to life not just in how they look but how they move how they stand how they interact
several scenes that were fmvs in ff7 og which they could have just copied have been reanimated from scratch to keep the style consistent
they even created a new fmv from scratch not just on youtube like some others do but in the actual game
a fun detail is that different outfits have different stances and animations to match the theme of the outfit
so yes the visuals are amazing not just on the surface level but in the details as well

sound
it is square enix on a game that has the words final and fantasy in its title nuff said
in all seriousness i have long since given up expecting anything but amazing from sqex when it comes to music and this game is no different
i mean they are one of the only game studios with their own inhouse full orchestra they do music performances and everything i would be disappointed if the music wasnt top notch

gamepllay
the combat is fun simple on the surface but has depth to it
there are layers to building a good team and strategy is required on the harder bosses
likewise the game already has a good diversity of mechanics to deal with with new ones being added all the time
fight design is smart and special fights such as event battles feel different from each other and standard fights
there is a nice diversity of enemies with new ones being added all the time
there are multiple different ways to make your characters stronger with not all of them being tied to the gacha
there is also a nice variety of game modes and events with new types of events still being added
so far so rosy but this is where we hit some bumps in the road
firstly this game is grindy keep that in mind you will need to grind more than some may be inclined
it has a robust auto mode that can handle random grind fights though it does fall apart on the harder fights
it also has a fast forward setting
but still there is a lot of grind
the game is still new and the devs are clearly taking in feedback making several changes in direction already based on complaints in fact the latest event specifically has antigrind features built inn so keep that in mind as well the game is still evolving

#####

popup simulator 1010 would pay again not this is not what to do in a gacha game constantly nag the player to buy your premium currency every chance they can get

i wouldve much preferred if it was like ffxv pocket edition with a story and none of this gacha crap

#####

at one point in this game angeal says no story is not worth hearing the way this one is told i have to disagree

ifinal fantasy vii ever crisisi is a grindheavy super repetitive autobattler thats taken the microtransactioncentric gacha formula to new lows whilst shamelessly tugging on fans nostalgia for ifinal fantasy viii

it tells heavily stripped down versions of the stories from ifinal fantasy viii and icrisis corei along with the allnew and thoroughly underwhelming prequel story ithe first soldieri each broken up into small chunks that come with a lot of loading screens despite its flashy menus and battle system its reused content and the stopstart nature of its short missionbased gameplay make it feel cheap and thrown together for the sake of putting out a freetoplay tiein mobile game with an aggressive business model

the new sidestories are pathetic aerith goes for her first picnic and tifa sells steamed buns the events are even worse like the clearly unfinished valentines one where everyone bakes cloud cookies

the battle system for the vast majority consists of setting the game to auto and using limit breaks manually one character is controlled at a time and each has five abilities uncontrolled characters act very badly on their own so micromanaging is necessary a defensive stance must be toggled on before healing and before enemies attack its bad enough characterswitching is clunky but the camera actually abandons view of the enemies to show fancy animations obscuring when to switch stances

certain abilities from weapons and materia are needed to interrupt enemy attacks exploit weaknesses and heal debuffs it differs for each battle so autoequipping should be useful but it makes unbelievably asinine choices as such equipping 24 slots through the formoverfunction menus is frequently necessary worse yet juggling equips for optimal stat bonuses is a chore

theres no controller support and the layout was designed for tapping on phones and tablets theres a lot of menu navigating the materia upgrade and equip interfaces are poorly designed and would literally be better off looking like spreadsheets

each character equips five weapons that need to be upgraded in rarity level tier and levels its a resourceintensive slog to fully upgrade them also materia synthesis is very important for high level content and getting good results from its random stat generation is ridiculously rare and frustrating

the game is about grinding better stats for a higher power level to take on higher power level content its unfriendly to new players who wont reasonably be able to finish the stories of some of the limitedtime events battles are typically easy until theyre impossible then more grinding is required

there are coop battles but players typically only do event coop there are lots of difficulty levels for regular coop battles which fractures active players from each other theres no search board to join games from so players must choose the battle and difficulty and hope two others are searching the same thing at the same time events give bonuses to parties using the newest equips so often players quit out if they feel others arent bringing a high enough bonus waiting for inconsiderate players to click readyretry for the overlylong 180 second timer is frustrating and very commonplace as many play on auto and ignore the game which isnt surprising as events are designed to get players doing the same boring fight ad nauseam for rewards 

its tiresome going through all the menus to do the necessary stuff for daily weekly general campaign and event rewards to play optimally theres a daily checklist of busywork
solo content  daily quests
solo content  enhancement quests  premium quests
shop  special  claim free item
shop  gil  claim free item
enhance  level a weapon
enhance  synthesise materia
enhance  level materia
chocobo  claim expedition rewards
chocobo  start new expeditions
chocobo  missions  claim all
events  solocoop battles
events  missions  claim all for each event
season pass  explore  claim all
season pass  hunt  claim all
home  claim progress rewards
log in after 12am4am7pm pst
missions  claim all on each tab
gifts  claim all
for the sake of progression its also necessary to do story dungeons crisis dungeons the battle tower coop material farming character and summon growth systems exchanging tickets coins and other items for gear materials and so on its overwhelming messy and clearly designed to incentivise purchasing the many microtransaction packs typically there are 6070 options going up to 6999usd each and four paid passes totalling 13387usd a month

regional pricing is atrocious in the uk a 6999usd pack costs 6999gbp which is around 90usd

players are expected to work towards many rewards and claim them from many different spots multiple things are on timers meant to pull players back in several times a day limitedtime content stresses grinding and there are many systems set up to make players feel like theyre constantly making progress the game is designed to frequently trigger dopamine responses and develop unhealthy playing and purchasing behaviours preying in particular on players with poor impulse control compulsive spending issues and addictive tendencies

its a gacha game so a big part of it is farming or purchasing with real money the currency required to play the slots to try to get better gear one draw costs 3000 crystals 18usd draws often disappoint as the game is bloated with a huge number of worthless weapons each draw comes with a weighted die roll the number that comes up gives the player that many stamps on a card and every 12 stamps a highly desirable and only briefly available costume is awarded these are the roll number chances
1 45
2 35
3 1592
4 202
5 15
6 055
12 001
this is where a sunk cost fallacy comes in for some desperate players who keep rolling ones and twos

upon reaching arbitrary progression milestones the game advertises microtransactions only for sale for 12 hours for example getting a weapon to level 90 offers a 3899usd pack of resources for sale exploiting the fear of missing out so brazenly is embarrassing to see in a square enix game but shouldnt be unexpected given the triplea price point microtransactions season pass and lack of support showcased by ibabylons falli which they shut down about a year after release ifinal fantasy vii the first soldieri was also shut down after about a year both games were rendered unplayable when the servers went down how long will square enix support this title before all of the microtransactions players have purchased get flushed down the toilet with the huge crap that is this game surely if square enix wont support their own live service games then players shouldnt be expected to either

iever crisisi exemplifies every cynical tactic to part players with money whilst providing a messy artless rehashing of something wonderful this game is yet another blemish on a franchise thats been repeatedly dragged through the dirt by square enix since series creator hironobu sakaguchi left

speaking of sakaguchi his most recent game ifantasiani is an excellent return to classic jrpg design featuring boss fights that require thought a cool story beautiful visuals fantastic music and stressfree pacing it really makes iever crisisi look horrendous one was made by genuine creatives like sakaguchi and uematsu producing a game as an artistic endeavour the other is basically software that reuses their previous work to try to predatorily gank copious amounts of money from live service customers that square enix has a history of shafting harder than don corneo would a certain exsoldier in a blonde wig

#####

its a gacha no matter how into playing it i am i could never actually recommend it to anyone


#####

its not the storys fault the game is a retelling of the classic ff7 crisis core and some new stories which i want to know more about the issue is related to the grinding needed to advance

i rather had paid money for the game and experience the story i barely made it out of midgard and finished all the content that my power level allows but now i will have to grind with several characters just to be able to continue 

i dont care about the gatcha stuff and considered going through the paid stuff but looking at the bonuses they dont even seem to be too useful to cut the grind so you are pretty much stuck

#####

i would not recommend this its very predatory and advertises packs special deals etc constantly whenever you finish something or try the pullwish system a lot of the items are also only available for 12h from the moment you unlock the ability to buy it 

the story of ff7 is also heavily condensed and you dont get to see almost any of the environmental storytelling and it skips over many areas of the game just play the original game or the remakes rather than this

#####

i hate to give a negative review to a game from my favorite series since i was ten years old but dear god the amount of expensive microtransactions in this game is ridiculous which is expected from a gacha game of course but i blacked out as soon as the game finally launched

#####

this game takes everything you love about ffvii crisis core and some other game i never got a chance to play overmonetizes it and makes it a slog to play
do not recommend this moneytrap of a game to anyone with access to the prior titles if you actually wanna revisit the story

#####

less than 10 seconds into the game the game already teaches you the gacha and upgrade mechanics and throws at least 45 discounted items ads at you  for the low low price of 1499 what a steal i think its quite a shame that rng lootboxes and ingame purchases are so prevalent in todays games but clearly the genre is more lucrative ever before

gameplaywise its pretty much an autobattler with an option for manual control though tbh youll be spending most of your time autobattling through countless waves of npcs it is nice to revisit the ff7 storyline but is it worth slogging through constant autobattles daily login reward ads and gacha mechanics probably not

#####

nothing but a  point and click gotcha game i would rather play the og and remake over this trash

#####

gacha grindfest for nostalgic 90s kids

#####

me gongaga

#####

i hope this doesnt end up like mobius ff did

#####

watered down gotcha crap

#####

dissidia opera omnia shouldnt had died for this

#####

do not get this game on your pc just yet they have some heavy issues
1 sound cut out period it became final fantasy vii ever quiet
2 i went to run a file integrity check just in case just put it in resetting installation files and left it there
3 went to uninstall and reinstall because integrity check wasnt doing anything that wasnt doing anything either its still installed too
4 i went to restart my computer it was preventing me from restarting without prompting me that it was prevent it so i had to force reboot
5 it was causing all my applications to request to be started in safe mode including my obs

square enix what did you install on my computer with this game im going to need to run a virus scan everything was fine until i tried to uninstall the game fix your mess the game has been out since the summer and i get its still new on pc but these are things you should have been prepared for fix your shit this was being made while i was live

update i tried to uninstall it again and it says uninstall failed because of connection timeout what does that even mean just uninstall why does it need a connection to uninstall everything else is running just fine yet you seem to be a persistent issue i still cant uninstall it fix this issue before it becomes a lawsuit

update 2 had to resort to having steam support remove it from my librarybut yet it still remained installed in my library even though it was registering that it was removed i restarted steam in the event it was just steam nope 
still there but it did finally go away after uninstalling it again after rebooting steam this is a problem square enix fix it

update3 filed a ticket with square enix technical support and they literally told me themselves they dont offer technical support for ever crisis why release a game on pc but not offer technical support for it do not get this game it just proves they only care about your money and not you i played this on my phone and its extremely predatory with the shop

#####

i really like the game but it has one big problem you need coop mode for some things and the game seems to be pretty dead because ive spent hours trying to find a team via matchmaking which never worked out of time match failed try again

#####

looks pretty but its boring gacha trash

#####

its a fun time waster tbh though be aware it is a gatcha game you dont need to spend to play game is generous with its currency has some interesting new story about sephiroth and his past and they release new chapters bit by bit 

things to be aware of before playing

story is chibi style other than a few cutscenes 
grind grind grind
autobattle and recommended equipment can be absolute garbage so try and learn the game early and stop using it as quick as possible
free to play f2p means you will not get every equipment or outfit and the game is rng in pulls
fanbase can be super negative some people hate the idea of this game so judge on your own experience not anyone elses

i play this on the bus and in the breakroom at work since i find the game fun cross platforming this game is actually pretty easy so i recommend dont spend much money if you can help it most shop items too expensive if you want to spend the season pass premium hunt and the soldier pass are the way to go buy on steam version though its cheaper

#####

i have been playing this game since day 1 launch on ios  i have not spent more than 50 on this game and it has yielded me daily activities to do in the game  hundreds of hours spent leveling multiple different weaponsmateriasummonscharacters and taking on challenging fights  for any newcomers i suggest following the tips outlined below  this truly is not a bad game at all ive had a blast clearing all of the content save a few tower levels i was waiting for pc release for easier target switching  this is my first gacha game since diablo immoral and i was expecting some pretty grotesque cash shop markets but it was nowhere near the level of diablo immoral  this game has its faults but the strategic game play and different stories kept me looped  and dressing cloud up in different outfits with options to skin over what is equipped is also a huge  p

general tips
weaponoutfit draw smartly with the blue crystals  since release se has been generous with them through system issues with the game but since the game has smoothed out a bit the crystals have been less generous of late
for materia you want to craft materia with  stats over flat stats
the recommended gear option is not the greatest to use for harder fights  you are better off making your own comp  the standard dpsdpshealersupport tends to be the safest  go for aeriths curaga staff
when crafting ruin materias watch the sigil options  there are different sigils to craft and some sigils are more optimal in some fights
some of the fights recommended power level is a bit misleading  you will know when you come across these fights  its more tactics vs brute forceauto battle

hope this review helps someone 

#####

makes you redownload the same 20gb file every time you launch the game and then sit through some assinine seizure inducing slot machine menu for 5 minutes before you can even play anything too frustrating not worth the time this is coming from a huge ffvii fan

#####

waiting room for final fantasy vii rebirth

#####

this is a terrible gacha cashgrab and its actually even significantly less satisfying than other gacha games on the market as well

#####

this is not what you want as a huge fan of the ff7 franchise its a predatory gacha grindfest which tries to suck all your money and your valuable time just stay away from it

#####

terrible combat system tutorial is just recycled cutscenes from ffvii remake and simplified recreation of the bombing mission from the game with simple graphics  then youre forced to download the full game why you couldnt do that initially is beyond me before youre bombarded with all the sleazy gacha mechanics that the game was salivating to bring to you  if you want ffvii play the original play remake play crisis core  this is garbage

#####

this is a perfect example of how to take a beloved classic and make it bad

#####

if youre looking at this game as an introduction to the final fantasy 7 lore this is a great game to start with
you get to experience the lore of final fantasy 7 and crisis core without having to pay for either of those games
thats where the positive stops
most people who have already experienced those games are probably playing this for the young sephiroth lore
unfortunately you have to play through chapter xx of 7 and then crisis core before even unlocking the ever crisis story which introduces 3 forgettable characters that you are forced to play as
glenn matt and lucia lucia didnt get two as in her name like the others because shes a woman
after chapter 4ish of the ever crisis story is when you actually see sephiroth for the first time so its a pretty long time investment
the f2p aspect is incredibly predatory and it constantly forces you p2w packages down your throat 
cloud got to level 2 okay buy this pack to enhance him tifa got to level 5 buy this pack zack got to level 10 buy this pack upgrade this weapon buý this packkkkkkkkkk you get the point
for a free to play game to learn the ff7 lore and story its nicely done but jesus whoever made the game has no idea how a self sustainable gacha game should work
theres a battle pass system that has no instant perks they ask you to buy the pass for which any extras you still have to unlock
bonus pass includes a wallpaper okay get the battlepass premium to level 30 first

#####

overwhelmingly grindy at times its very rng based for what weapons you get fighting the same set of bosses over and over gets kind of boring this game is free but for the amount of time i put in i feel unsatisfied

#####

another unsuccessful hype at the expense of a masterpiece

#####

if this wasnt a ffvii game i wouldnt play it since it is i just cant stop playing i love the characters and the combat gacha games update so fast that you cant get bored of it the auto feature let you do other things like watching youtube videos while you upgrade your characters sadly is just a time sink game yo dont really play the game its only purpose is to kill your time if you dont want to accomplish anything in your life and just want a quick life fix this is the best if you value your life stay away from this game

#####

went in this game with a very open mind and a some experience with this type of mobile game

the more i played ever crisis the dumber i felt

if you wanted the story of ff7crisis core youre waaay better off experiencing it from the actual game games which are usually available at a deep discount if ff7crisis core are both a novel ever crisis is a single page where the story is listed in 10 short bullet points

if you wanted to enjoy the game loop theres significantly more mobile game that does what ever crisis do but better and are very likely going to cost you less

i went into the official ever crisis discord to get some few tips and tricks i just remain idle there for half hour watching the veteran talking with each other and sympathizing newsteam players because of that huge amount of grind that exist the sentiment in the discord is straight up sad

discord peeps are nice they tried to encourage me to play as long as i am enjoying it because theyre not theyre just on rail on rail is that sensation that you get with an online game where you no longer care if its fun or not all you care about is to do your dailies grind as much as you can till you have to go to bed rinse and repeat in anticipation for content that will require that power level

theres a big complaint about how fast gacha is being released veteran talking about how little breathing room they have its a never stopping hamster wheel

you look up a tier list and you see the writer going look well never gonna be able to give you the best uptodate tier list but this is what we know are the safest things to roll for not even the best but the safest you dont use your first 40  50 rolls to get the best tool you use it to get a bunch of jack of all trade because there might be content coming and gacha that release alongside that has the weakness for the content released

all in all by the 8th hour of playing i felt by brain was numbing i called it a day and uninstalled

#####

read the negative reviews they are important i figured regardless because an old time fan and that is how you get suckered in dont be that guy
this is your typical square enix cash grab on top of the very big download for something that appears nothing more than a ported interface of nostalgia it isnt ease of access or comfortable and the graphics are nothing to ride home about 

i am looking forward to the remake but this is just junk 25gb of download just to play a tutorial and wanted me to download another 6gb to play the next chapter i rather play both crisis core and a modded version of ffvii on my psp

a former fan of ffxiv until a point i said no more to se and their greedy ways favourite games will always be there in the past where they belong attempting to revitalise it with more hungry cash grabs and slightly improvement or unimprovement will not bring the game back from those years of fun playing

9  10 literally why bother like the remake of so many other final fantasys they just cannot improve them i am really holding off on the remake 
i would rather play dirge of cerberus on the ps2

#####

played it before it hit steam
game has 3 separate stories that connects to the final fantasy 7 universe
game is very and i mean very grindy
game is somewhat generous with gems to a certain point
but the micro transactions are damn expensive
coop was pretty dead if you wanted to do a low level mission to get the gems for completing it hopefully the steam launch will change that

the errors on banners and compensation given to people who pulled on a banner on the game before the game hit steam was already really bad if your a free2play player at least
long story short if you pulled a banner and it had a bug or it wasnt working properly the devs will refund the full amount of gems you used on the banner that had errors on it along with some extra gems so they kept the rolls they did on the banner that had and error and got a full refund with extra gems

event items are only there for the time the event is there after that you cant get them anymore
so if you missed an outfit or a weapon from a crossover event you wont be able to get them anymore

warning
word of warning if you are going to spend some premium currency on the game
this is a square enix mobile game and from what i have seen a lot of square enix mobile games have gotten shut down after a couple of years so make sure that you know before you spend on this game

game runs really well on pc tho i can at least give them that


#####

its a game that is suppose to bleed you for money but if you play it on the toilet you will have some fun

#####

i you havent played any final fantasy before this i dont think it makes sense to play this feels like a game built to make nostalgia driven consumers to spend entire life savings

#####

positives i mean its a final fantasy game by squareenix what do you think
negatives i mean its a gacha game by squareenix what do you think

#####

hahaha its literally a f2pcasino game with a final fantasy coat of paint its weird that they showcase so much story in the game trailer because my experience was that i had to click through 3 billion tutorial menus with square enix telling me how they want to extract money from me its literally the absolute worst way to experience ffvii universe xd

the graphics in ffvii story mode looks great though and i kind of wished the original was remade with these chibicharacters and gorgeous battles but with dialogue and prerendered backgrounds more true to the original at least for the keyscenes

anyway this game is atrocious avoid it like a plague its a blight on the ffviiuniverse

#####

if you know how gachas work and you can refuse the predatory advertising this is probably the best gacha out there honestly i havent put a penny in and im just enoying the story and retelling and the combat

theres actually a level of strategy and nuance to the combat thats missing from most gachas and the combat isnt piss easy requiring you to actually pay attention and use the right abilities for the job and pay attention to what elements the mission recommends at the bottom and use them accordingly 

the best part is you have all the characters there is no rng for whether you get a character or not the gacha aspect only applies to their weapons outfits and equipment so you will always be able to play the characters you like

most of these games feel like they think i dont have the brainpower to find the power button my phone this one actually assumes youve played a video game before which is nice

obviously its a gacha so ymmv and its a shit business model dont bother if you are the kind of person who suffers from addiction to games like these and spending this game is still using the you have x hours for this bonus thing that all scumbags use but if gachas arent a deal breaker for you this is as good as they get honestly

#####

i will be honest right of the bat i will say this is terrible way to experience the original game at first they claimed this to be another possibility for remake showing 11 scenes with updated graphics but thats all youre going to get in this messy gacha package the story is incredibly stripped down with many scenes being straight up deleted or reduced to form of simple white text on black background all that to keep the player interested and mow down the extremely short missions the combat is also very much dumbed down and all of these issues just keep piling up from now on one of the biggest being taking away the core part of ff  exploration all weapons and else is acquired through gacha this comes with the addition of square enix being greedy and having terrible gacha rates but at least there is something called stamp system for exclusive outfits and weapons that guarantees you the five star drops after certain amount of pulls which will still be a lot its a fun time killer game for people that already played the original or for people that dislike the original for how outdated it is and just want to get little modern tldr recap this comes with the issue of the game not being done though there are some positives however as well such as the original midi soundtrack being faithfully remade in modern sound with almost 11 accuracy theres campaign for sephiroths backstory before crisis which was never available in english let alone on pc and of course for modders and others alike theres various new outfits and weapon models that can be ripped from game files

#####

me gongaga

#####

before i played final fantasy vii ever crisis i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty bad

#####

the fact that square enix created all of these amazing assets that could have been used for a true remake of final fantasy vii and instead created a cynical cash grab gacha game is one of the worst things theyve ever done please dont support this

#####

pretty much a retelling of urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp39140final_fantasy_viifinal fantasy viiurl  urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1608070crisis_core_final_fantasy_vii_reunioncrisis coreurl but in gacha form  1 new story detailing sephiroths early years
 
honestly youre just better off playing the originals  remake
 
well ill give them the soundtrack most of the remade ones sound like pretty good bangers and id even go as far as saying that some of them are better fits than the ones remade for remakeheh
but thats where the good points mostly stop because at the end of the day its a gacha game with all the problems and inherently bad design that comes with it stamina system grind for trinkets fomo pullsits all there although they are generous enough with the expendable consumables 
way too generous evenat least for how they have their item counting systems set up because youll way too easily hit the caps theyve set up and at least midgame the expenditure rate is too low to effectively spend it all its gotten to the point where their seasonal events wont give me the accumulated reward items because ive gone way past the event ticket cap threshold and it takes hours to properly spend that excess
 
 
so yeah originals are the way to play the ffvii series

#####

dont bother with this ff7 entry its just a port of a mobile gacha game

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on this game and it gets 200 likes and 20 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 2 kilos of canned ham so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

as someone who doesnt like the action oriented combat that squares newer final fantasy games focus on this appealed to me early on in the game however as it starts to drag on it starts to become a slog dont assume you can just play the story and dip out you have to grind in the other modes in order to get strong enough to handle many of the story stages

a lot of the holiday events have parts to them that are set at a difficulty that assumes youve been playing since launch and mobile players had 3 months over pc players

and the game is just over monetized it has the usual paid currency that all gacha games have and its primarily to spend one some of the weapon draws but it can be used for other things as well but there are also things in the shop that dont use the currency and require you to spend a set dollar amount the battlepass requires you to pay a set dollar amount and battle passes in most other games allow you to earn back what you spent but the battle pass only gives you the free currency instead of the paid version of the currency

this is on top of the fact that there are too many leveling systems making it both a boring grind and confusing to figure out what you should focus on your characters have actual levels but they also have a character stream that functions like the sphere gridcrystarium from x and xiii but you also have to power up your weapons both by getting duplicates to increase their rarity as well as grinding materials to increase their level you also have to grind to craft and improve materia doing the same missions over and over again with the same damage sponge bosses at the end every time its so tedious to try to get you to spend money to avoid playing the game which at that point why am i playing the game well im not anymore

yuffie is the #1 video game waifu of all time and not even her presence could stave off my boredom

#####

the story is broken up and only shows key snippets and the gatcha element is a joke id be amazed if se kept this running half as long as dissidia opera omnia

#####

gather round kiddies its story time back in the day squaresoft would release highquality numbered final fantasy games no cup noodles dlc no lame sequels just excellent standalone stories every handful of years 

but then came final fantasy x2 where square enix squaresoft and enix merged at this time realized they could fart out loweffort asset flips and sell them as fullpriced products and the suits at square enix thought why dont we milk our most popular final fantasy 

which brings us to ever crisis the latest product in the travesty known as the compilation of final fantasy vii a collection of ffvii cashgrabs that are on the writing and quality level of fanfiction this game is an amalgamation of everything wrong with modern final fantasy and gaming as a whole its a mobile gacha game that does not respect your time and preys on final fantasy fans with weak constitution you want that new tifa outfit dont you cough up the cash because thats all you are to square enix

if youve never played the original final fantasy vii do yourself a favor and just play the excellent and classic original because ever crisis is not a sufficient retelling of the story as it often truncates events to a comical degree all while begging you for money at every turn

#####

so lets start with the good bits 
lots of fun tidbits for fans and lore hounds 
high qaulity graphics love me some  teen seph skins and stuff 
ts pretty good about giving out free draws and free premium currency for draws 
t can be pretty fun if you like planning out your battles before hand and min maxing your builds and attacks yourself or so i suspect 
plenty of chanche for max level weapons even f your a spitefull free to play only fish thanks to lots of events
nostalgic ost for the win a bit loud tho 

 downsides
 its a gacha
 pwr system is confusing and hard to tell what will actually increase your pwr count
 materia crafting is enough to make anyone cry
crashes allot like some of my friends cant get t to work at all and for me it wont work at all on pc limiting acces for me to mobile phone wich has ts own issues just because of how much t drains the battery 
no auto battle options meaning if you want to grind for an event you have to pay attention and click on the mission again and again 

 the premium packages and pushing for currency is no joke ts pushy and  annoying and  very baity for people weak to it
and despite how t seems you dont get much value for your buck so to speak nor are the materials that are rare very cheap or often on sale if you can afford it not to even begin about sqaures regular shady ass money grubbing ways with recent games and skins 
that said i have seen many games with waaaay worse pushyiness so nto the absolute trash tier there

what are we left with a half decent pretty as hell gacha game that has sfw fanservice for women and men and mostly just dangles their moneybag  of a franchise infront of fans that doesnt properly work half the time 
even though this game has won me over with seph  its not something i can reccomend just because of the sheer amount of issues that just  drown the positives that this game does have  or maybe i have just played to many free to play games and am just numb 

#####

update on jan 7 2024
after playing this game for 220 hrs im still enjoying it several hours a day new observations
 i have never run out of stamina simply because i log in 34 times per day
 coop games are now easier to join once i figured out the traffic pattern
 my characters are progressing at a slow but steady pace 
 there is a surprising amount of knowledge required to power up my characters efficiently 
 stamina potions and free draws are given out every day
 new stories and characters are added every few weeks

considering that i havent spent a single cent on ingame purchases this game has to be the greatest entertainment value ever

original review follows
first lets state the obvious ff7ec is a freetoplay gacha game based on final fantasy vii series so if you dislike the business model of gacha genre this game is not  for you

next prior experience with the final fantasy vii game is preferred but not necessary  take myself for example the closest related game i played was ff4 on nintendo ds maybe ten years ago initially it took me a while to figure out the terminology used in this game such as patk  physical attack mdef  magical defense c  combat r  rare etc nevertheless i was able to jump into this game and enjoy it immediately

there are many things to like about this game
 gorgeous graphics and smooth animations
 great background music and sound effects
 long elaborated story lines
 clean and simple user interface almost anything can be controlled with mouse clicks
 lots of seasonal bonus stages with new contents added every few days
 speedy combat scenes while grinding if you turn on fullauto and fast mode
 who doesnt love to see tifa lockhart execute the waterkick

naturally as a freetoplay game expect to be bombarded by popup windows on special limitedtime offers loot boxes monthly passes etc fortunately those only come up in the beginning and whenever you reached a certain milestone the game is quite generous in giving you basic resources such as stamina gold coins and blue crystals but you have to pay if you want the more valuable red crystal so as long as you are patient and accept the slow grinding process you can continue to play this game without paying  at least until your guilty conscience finally kicks in

#####

edit i have continued putting time into it  overall i like it but it still has problems  the further along these games get the tougher it is for new players to catch up but its not impossible  they finally seem to have slowed down a little on the power creep see below but they could do with a few more repeat events to help newer players catch up otherwise theyre just going to bleed existing players until no one is left  its fun and its nostalgic just be aware that if you start as a new player you have a bit of an uphill climb but again its not impossible

i like it because its ff7  if this game werent ff7 theres no way i would play it  the gacha system is pretty predatory but if the player can control their fomo its fine and im not sure the developers really know what power creep is  because the game has barely been out for 3 months and they have already raised the level cap three times it will be 65 very soon and they are pumping out items and banners so fast each one often better than the last that before too long absolutely every item you own is going to be worthless unless you continue to pull in their gacha system  they need to slow down their roll a little bit on the power creep space out their events just a tiny bit and give players a chance to breathe between all of the things theyre asking you to do

some nice things about it is that it runs really smooth its beautiful 60fps or more if you choose the graphics models and animations are really nice  the music is great everything is evocative of ff7 and is a decent trip down nostalgia lane without playing the actual og ff7 game  despite these things its hard to recommend it because the barrier to entry is incredibly steep and players with fomo are completely alienated unless they began at day 1 on mobile like i did  and as mentioned before the power creep is insane and its clear they bait you into drawing on every banner which you do not have to  if this were not ff7 and if i were not waiting to seeplay my favorite characters i would have dropped this game months ago

#####

too predatory and everythings a hassle
i considered giving gacha a try for the first time ever since its yknow final fantasy vii in conclusion the genre and every game of its kind should rot in hell im not spending a dime its never about the money its about sending a message

rip ff7 its end of 2023 and its official you were legendary in your prime but now youve been milked to oblivion and will only be remembered as such by the true fans of old

#####

this game sucks it is super grindy it has that stupid gacha bs this mobile game will very soon go the same way as all the other final fantasy gacha games it just makes me wonder why se keeps doing this i am still gonna play it and get all the achievements because i am a super big fan of ff and especially ffvii but these trash mobile games piss me off and i wish they would stop making them and focus on what made them great to begin with

#####

ffvii gacha

#####

going in i wasnt expecting to fully enjoy this game knowing that it was a gacha but i am determined to get all the achievements knowing that square will have the plug pulled on this within the next couple years

unfortunately even when trying to give this game a fair shot it uses every opportunity to prove to me that its inevitable demise is justified  first of all this is a terrible port of a mobile game  the amount of times it gives a not responding within the client is too high to make any sense

the core gameplay is admittedly enjoyable but i despise how you can only set ai to manualautosemi for the entire party instead of individual characters  i would prefer to have two characters on full auto then one on manual so there is less micromanaging atb but also less ai using atb for weaker skills on the character you are activelyt controlling when you actually wanted to save it for something stronger  with that being said the autobattle isnt as bad as most games

to shed light on some positives the art style can be good at times no not the ugly chibi character models but the actual in battle models  anime aesthetic art  it is jarring that there are three different forms of artstyles being used but with 23 being aesthetically pleasing i cant complain  the costumes and weapons look absolutely fantastic  hopefully they will bring some of these into the ff7 remake triology in the future  i also do think the gameplay is enjoyable and is unique enough to not be something you see in other gacha games  i love that you can build the same character to fulfill different roles in a part composition  if services for this game eventually cease i wouldnt mind paying money for a fully offline version but as a f2p gacha service model it is difficult to support justification to spend money in it

id recommend playing this game for only a few minutes so you can purchase the point shop items before the game eventually shutsdown if you want to get another ff game under your steam profile showcase or if you are just an absolute huge fan of gacha style games  id recommend avoiding this game if you are just a ff7 fan that got intrigued on what this is about  the best part being the new young sephiroth original story content which can easily be found on a video site so you dont have to miss out on that stuff even if you decide to pass on this  also good luck playing it in the background with another game  the poor optimization has it struggling to run fine on its own and is likely to cause crashes to your other applications

#####

title screen simulator

#####

tldr bad gacha not good gacha

this game is only for the most diehard ff7 fans who are suffering while waiting for ff7 remake part 2 its a confusing pay to win poorly designed gacha game even the gacha itself is bad here there is only weapon banner and you unlock costumes by whaling enough on these banners who actually likes weapon banner 

this game should have been a 50 mediumbudget recap of ff7 instead of what we got if you want a good gacha game play honkai star rail or reverse 1999

#####

lasted 61 minutes before a massive wall of gatcha blinded me with 100 different buttons and features that just overwhelm you and give you the max quality gear as fast as they can piles and piles of free rolls in that hey new player your level 999 now go enjoy our game because being over powered to such an extreme is how you enjoy this game

#####

trying to link mobile account is a nightmare forget it im not going through this trouble just for another generic gacha game if im gonna play any final fantasy gacha game at all id rather they just give us ffrk back

#####

im here for the nostalgia otherwise this is just a very boring mobile game

#####

i like that the five star gacha rate is 75 also nice to actually do fighting type stuff in a gacha game

#####

my wife said if this review gets 50 likes and 5 awards she will buy a case of beer guys help me out

#####

a gacha game based entirely around the universe of ff7 might sound like cancer to some but somehow im addicted i havent spent anything on it and i feel like ive made good progress but i started on the first day of the mobile release

the graphics are nice and somehow look even better on the steam client combat is rather simple and more often than not youll likely farm battles using auto battle so not a lot of thought required to enjoy this one my favorite part is account sync between mobile and steam sometimes its nice to enjoy the more interactive parts of the game on a bigger nicer screen

not a bad free to play if you are interested give it a shot

#####

it has a capped stamina system which means you cant play as long as you want you play as long as the devs want you to play and there are so many micro transactions in this game its laughable

#####

cloud gets to wield the buster sword but zack cant

010

#####

infinite loading screen on 2nd day

#####

automatic negative for being a mobile game with predatory intentions 
drips small pieces of the three games featured and locks the rest of the content behaving as if its an event
game gives you almost all of the weapons from draws in the beginning and it becomes clear that your suppose to keep unlocking them for the upgrade parts
training missions offer materials but perks are locked by a memory fragment that is given as a quest reward leading them to be scarse later on
 im sure most people will play this just to see the first soldier missions which are locked behind doing all other content first including a painful campaign with weird new characters you wont care about fighting the same monster 10 missions in a row

#####

im literally just playing it for the first soldier plot i feel ashamed owning it

#####

i dont really hate this game but i could never leave a positive review no matter how good this game is its a very predatory gacha game that does all it can to try and steal your money and the in app purchases are so expensive anyway i dont know whos going to buy it  
the actual game it self is fine if not good honestly everything is very well made and it even has new music instead of just using remake music which is very nice and it all sounds great the models look amazing though when the main models being used are just remake models then yeah they will be but the actual new ones look pretty good as well etc clearly alot of time and effort have gone into this but it all kind of feels wasted because its a gacha they have to skip over lots of stuff and the battle system is boring 
i have no interest in the first solider young sepiroth stuff really though i havent really played that bit so i cant say anything about that but the ogff7 stuff and the crisis core stuff are fine and the new stuff added to it are good but its really just a watered down experience that is just basic plot seen in a quick 12 min cutscene and then battle so lots of the games are just cut out so really not a good way to play for the first time any of these games and as a already existing fan id just rather play the originals i do like some of the stuff like the new costumes but also that doesnt mean i want to either spend 50 hours grinding for them or just paying way too much for a costume i dont care how good the garnet aerith outfit is im not going to spend real money because of fomo 
also the actual battle stuff is fine  i wouldnt say terrible but  its nothing really auto attacks and then occasionaly you press a ability button it really isnt intriguing or fun honestly 

also also did they release this a day before the end of the ffix event on purpose because even if ffix is like my second favourite game ever i am not going to pay real life money for the special outfits like it had to be one day at the end of the event so pc players are going to be forced to pay money unless they get really lucky getting stamps also who wants to spend real money getting weapons anyway most of them blend together and i get that its for the stamps so i guess thats why to spend more money which i mean i could probably explain every strange decision in this game with to get more money so theres no point thinking about it 

overall if youre a really big ff7 fan then play it if not dont touch it if you really want to play ff7 please just play the og games or remake but thats also kind of a sequel and id still recommend playing the og first this is nothing but a very watered down retelling of the games with a very nice artstyle that is filled with ludicrous in app purchases that no one should ever buy i mean ill admit that i more than likely will keep playing and i actually like alot of stuff in here but i cant in good faith recommend this game like i said as a fan this can be enjoyed the new extra scenes between the charhchters are nice but for every new scene in the game theres plenty that are just cut so i guess the real way to experiance this game is find a all cutscenes video on youtube or something or maybe one day someone will make them with just the new stuff either way in a few years itll be the only way to experience the game anyway also for the third or so time im clearly not a good writer but i very much love ff and wanted to try and say my thoughts on this in some way no matter how disjointed and poorly presented this may be because this game does have alot of cool well made stuff but equally something filled with so much monetization is just kinda impossible to recommend because thats all the game is like sure the actual remake  story stuff of the ogff7 and crisis core stuff is really cool despite its issues but all the gems and such are horrible who wants to grind the boring battle system so they can then continue a shame but really ill more than likely experience this game through cutscence compilations in a few years after its shut down

a real shame so much effort went into this game despite the fact its going to shut down in a year or two anyway square could you port missing link instead of this thatd be nicer

edit if youre wondering why i keep playing the game i keep opening it up every day just to get free gems because i mean if they do another ffix crossover or something then well i mean maybe id play a little you know or like a ffx crossover those outfits would be pretty cool so i mean i hate this game but like im all up for being baited by nostalgia and such from games that square cares much less about so maybe one day there will be a event i care about but also with square being square i doubt it the game will probabbly die before next year anyway because whos playing this who is this game aimed at i just dont get it i like seeing the new outfits and music arrangements i guess so keep on exisiting for a little bit but  i need this game to die so square can just not do this again

#####

the game is unplayable goes to a black screen after the title screen and never progresses

#####

h1 fine for what it is h1
h2 if you like these types of games youll probably like this one  if you dont this wont change your mind h2

yes its a gacha game no its not a remakeremaster of the og

if you expect a gacha game with iap going in youll notice all the usual stuff  limitedtime events that want you to spend more to get everything dealsbundles etc etc  ive played a number of these and rarely spend any money on them but know its almost always going to be a grind if you choose to play that way

if you like or dont mind these types of games the graphics are nice the battle system is decent and the stories are there though highly condensed so it may be worth your time  

if you dont like these types of games this one isnt going to change your mind

#####

the game literally doesnt even start 90 of the time trash i cant even tell you how bad the actual game is considering ive got past menu screen about 5 times

#####

its a gacha game so be aware of what you could get yourself into by playing it

#####

waiting for final fantasy vii rebirth amd final fantasy xvi pc version 3


#####

its square enix what else would you expect of course theyd rather invest resources into a predatory rehash of a mobile game than develop more side content to further the saga and its characters

#####

there really isnt anything to recommend here
its a mobile gacha game by the numbers youve played this before a hundred times

what stings here is the amount of genuinely great assets that could have made for a fantastic remaster of the actual game
great chibi overworld models that capture the charm of the originals a lightweight battle scene with the highly detailed models of the remakes and some really nice renditions of the old background renders
all lost to generic gacha garbage that will be lost forever in a year or two 



#####

yeah this game gets a lot of hate just because its a gacha game
but you really dont need to pay to win they give out alot of free materials for draws and although they do push spending money for timed packs once you clear something itll only pop up the once and you can simply just ignore it
it is a big grind so if you dont like grinding as a f2p player then its probably not for you
personally i find this a nice throw back to the old atb systems although its alot more simplistic you can still create builds to overcome bosss that are significantly stronger than you if you enjoy that then give it a go


#####

a textbook example of some of the most egregious freetoplaypaytowin monetization schemes

everythings here everything youd expect from a mobile f2p game that would and will do anything to get money from you its hardly even a case where you can choose between a long and tedious grind or spending real money not really youll hit a wall sooner or later and assuming youve got some senses left you should ask yourself  why why would you play this game not to mention spend tons of hard earned money on it

one of the rules of games as a service is to hook you in early on ever crisis had it easy because it uses final fantasy vii franchise as its main appeal not only that but the game does indeed look good sounds good and has some flashy visuals to please the right parts of the brain honestly if this wasnt a f2p gacha game then i would say there is indeed a decent idea for a proper game here at least for a final fantasy vii fanservice game

sad truth is though this is hardly a game because once you deal with the story chapters youre left with an idle farming simulator because 90 of your playtime is going to be launching random battles set on auto with a sole purpose of grinding one of dozens if not hundreds of itemsmaterials what for to upgrade your characters why so that you could engage in more difficult idleafk autobattle grinding farms a vicious cycle well thoughtout by the greedy minds at squareenix minds that didnt want to create a fun and engaging game but a moneymaking platform instead

normally i stay far away from these mobile gacha f2pp2w games as a service but i admit i gave ever crisis a chance i was interested in the original first soldier sidestory set in ffvii universe as well as a promise of recapping some other ffvii works such as before crisis or advent children in a game form

but no its not worth it the story that is already here is incomplete and some of the advertised titles such as before crisis or dirge of cerberus are nowhere to be seen they may or may not be added later on but knowing square they will probably shut the game servers down before finishing any of the promised stories and even if they do add them they will still most probably require lots of grind andor lots of money spent to progress through

and its no mere change the game bombards you with limitedtimespecialbundles season passes and such constantly on every occasion to the point the ingame shop seems almost as overwhelming as all the other mechanics honestly it would probably cost you less to buy the original ffvii ffvii remake intergrade ffvii rebirth crisis core reunion and advent children movie than to fully upgrade just one character and their weapons in this mobile garbage and the first soldier story you could probably watch on youtube or something itll take you less time to do so than to work your way in ever crisis

yes there are some fanservice elements and decent original sidestories here this is basically the only reason i gave this game a chance but what there is is not really worth neither time nor money spent on leveling up characters weapons materias summons and such again ever crisis is your textbook greedy monetization scheme and not a real game if you spend any money on this then youre part of a much bigger problem

there are tons of way better games out there that will cost you less and will satisfy you with actual proper gameplay so do yourself a favor and just stay away from ever crisis its really not worth the effort its like any other addiction  it may be fun and harmless at first but will prove difficult to drop once you start even when you know its bad for you so its better simply not to start

#####

its another mobile port expect micro transactions battle passes and all other predatory monetization that is standard in big publisher releases

#####

as an old school final fantasy 7 storyline lover there is never such a thing like too much ff7 stories to enjoy 
and free omg this made my day a lot better thx man w 

#####

i hate ever crisis it would be fun if it werent a predatory freemium game which is just an endless series of missions and punishes you for not spending hours playing it every single day and at specific times lest you miss out on exclusive items i wish i never started playing it but now i have to finish because i poured too much time in it not to get all of the achievements now this needs to get turned into an offline game that you can put down and pick up whenever you want without negative consequences or having to pay money for ingame currency and items packs then itd be fun but it wont its just going to go offline forever one day like mobius and countless other square enix freemium games did my one consolation is that i never poured any realworld money into any of them just way too much of my time

#####

ever crisis was a fun way for square enix to preserve the ff7 universe without releasing 2000 books that somehow keep changing minute details

the game is a gacha game they didnt try to hide it and they will not try to hide it in fact they like to throw new campaign in your face with a bunch of microtransaction packs available to buy however i dont believe games like these should be judged because of the business direction of the company but rather on the quality of the game itself if its a free game how do you expect the company to gain revenue that being said ff7ec is really fun if you want to relive ff7

the main hub is entirely menu based where you select what you want to do story missions solo content which is unrelated to the story multiplayer content and event content

all characters are given gacha pulls are for weapons

story content will allow you depending on the mission selected to roam around the given map at that story point its like playing the og ff7 there are chests scattered around some hidden that you can collect while you tap or drag your way through the map some of these chests are crystals you can use for your pulls
there are 3 stories you can play the original final fantasy 7 crisis core and a brandnew prequel story the first soldier

solo content allows you to farm for materials for your characters this might be a little overwhelming because a lot of them are redundant

multiplayer content lets you and 2 other people fight against a selected boss for materials you also gain some crystals for fighting alongside strangers for the first time

whats a gacha game without events they add in noncanon content here whether its a beach episode collaboration content or something original to the ff7 universe its a neat twist with some fun rewards there are free things that you can grind for and also things you can pull for a limited time

the battle system heavily reminds me of what would be a watered down version of ff13s battle system normal attacks are auto attacks but the atb system is still real time and lets you pick which skills and abilities you want to use these skillsabilities are set in your party screen where you can finetune your character to your liking red xiii support that exists offensive aerith that ironically also exists

i was playing ec on my mobile phone since launch but it eats my battery so having it on pc with a higher resolution is well its what was asked for

thanks square enix

#####

the story stuff is kinda neat a shame about the rest of it just watch a lets play or something

#####

so yeah this game is a gacha game and if that is a hard pass that is completely understandable it is true that the game puts pay for this resource up at an annoying frequency but the truth of the matter is this might be one of the most free 2 play friendly gacha i have ever played the rate at which events drop with free weapons the amount of times they give out free 10 pulls on the gacha is absurd seriously they had 2 events running simulationsly a 100 day celebration that gave out a free 10 pull per day for 15 days and a second boss rush event with every time you beat a boss you would get a token once per day that gives you a character specific free 10 pull

for about a week i was pulling 20 pulls on the gacha for free

onto the rates of the gacha it is by far one of the more generous with their 5 weaponsbut it comes with the catch that you would need to get 11 copies of that weapon in 5 to get the most powerful version of it

as for story content right now its just up until leaving midgar in ff7 the 3rd misson of crisis core and a couple of chapters of the wholly unique first soldier story the story feel like spark notes version of all familiar stories which is fineuntil you get to first soldier the cast of first soldier is well to be bluntly underdeveloped glen matt and lucia are pretty one note characters even though first soldier has more chapters dedicated to it then ff7 and crisis core combined

that being said in regards to characters there are some fun little side stories that allow you to explore little stories about specific characters things like how tifa eventually got involved with avalance a story about barrett trying to take care of an infant marlene after he was chased out of mt corel and drifted from town to town

overall this is a very take it or leave it kind of game play a little and if you dont enjoy it but want to know what happens in first soldier in case it is involved in remake storyline somehow just go to youtube


#####

game is not suitable for weakminded individuals who fomo
im giving it a thumbsdown rating but i also want to give it a thumbs up

theres a lot to like about this game
1 the game is admittedly very addictive you get a constant sense of progression where you are constantly upgrading your characters equipment attributes abilities and skins
2 the gacha rates are lenient at 75 drop rate for 5star items
3 cutscenes for the story and seasonal events are pretty good graphics and animations are very good
4 story mode is very solid and serves as a gateway into the ff7 expanded universe for the uninitiated

however the game is moreorless an autobattler youll spend 90 of your time sifting through menus and watching the fight play out the gameplay loop revolves around optimising your characters to be able to do higherdifficulty missions for better rewards there is a very low amount of skillexpression in general

as well this game can easily suck up all your free time by feeding off the fomo aspect of our psyche the grind is almost infinite and they often run timelimited events that encourages you to farm as much upgrade materials as possible want to farm upgrades for your characters at a rapid pace or get exclusive items then you better level up your characters fast and do the highdifficulty missions before theyre gone youve heard of the sunkencost fallacy yes this is nothing new for gacha games but is a major demerit nonetheless

if you have low selfcontrol or free time then stay away from this game otherwise its pretty nice eyecandy

#####

lots of potential in the game but its the closest experience you could get to a remake of ff7 original the battle system is really fun and if you are craving more moments with your favourite ff7 characters  this is a good opportunity

you can also clear 99 of all game content fully f2p  it will just be taking a bit more timegrinding vs investing in some conveniences  up to you

time will tell if se will get their act together and shape this into a something truly memorable for now it is just a good game and fantastic thing to play while we wait for rebirth to hit steam

#####

since i dont own a ps5  cant play rebirth and im having fomo here i am havent spent any money but have plenty to do grind new story line young sephypoo fun recaps enough events and dailies to grind for gears without spending money to advance

theres no real point for me to p2w since i just want to just relax a replay some old stuff and watch some new
combats pretty decent for mobile port  auto is welcomed for grinding

if youre like me and just need more ff7 content why the  not

#####

first impressions
 downloaded the game then was asked to download the game
 immediately got presented to at least 4 different currencies
 got asked to upgrade my weapon without even knowing i had one
 watched cloud talking in a small cutscene then watched him fight a couple mobs
 uninstalled

#####

most playtime was on mobile for someone that loves final fantasy vii to the point i eat up all the spinoffs i just think this game is painful by all means this game looks amazing but it cannot offer the experience of playing vii viir or cc first soldier is uhh even remotely despite it being the initial premise the amount of story content is barren considering its already created story and its been a whole 2 years since announcement the gacha game style here is not fit for pc at all and works better as a phone game considering this game has terrible stamina economy and no auto rerunskip feature you just have to leave the game open for hours to make even decent proper progress this is just a gacha game with a vii skin and its carried by that alone play it if you wanna experience the neat visuals and the honeymoon phase its free after all but it isnt a good game

first soldier was literally 5x the game this is and im not even kidding

#####

twink sephiroth

#####

this was developed by shinra

#####

a great free way to relive the original ff7 story and the story of some of the sidegames this is a live service game so not all content is available at the time of writing this is also a gacha game so be aware however this has been the absolute most generous gacha game i have ever played with constant free pulls and free gem giveaways still these type of games are meant to be played slowly over a long period of time dont expect to get your characters super powerful super quickly without spending money beautiful graphics however i wish squareenix provided an english dub

#####

square dont bother remaking dirge of cerberus in this slop remaster the original dirge instead
this game is just press gamble button to roll weapon spend ingame currency to improve weapon and then win

#####

game is fun but on steam there are multiple issues such as
1 abandoned factory cannot load the fight
2 multiplayer cannot create room required power 7k and i am at 17k
3 multiplayer sometimes cannot start and keep failing
4 network error on steam come on no issue on phone
i am playing for 3 days and already so much problem not sure if its worth playing in a few months time if there are so much errors and problems

#####

cant even start game its stuck in the title screen and keeps giving me an error message whenever i try to start the game

#####

be careful this game is predatory as hell it wants your money and it will seize any opportunity to take it from you being a ftp player can sometimes be smashing against a brick wall on certain optional fights and the temptation to throw a few bucks in the hope of having a slight boost in power is always near ive been weak and i spent more than 200 and it gained me almost nothing of value stay clear from the store and just do the daily and weekly tasks to gain some crystals and boost a weapon now and then spending money in this game is not worth it if you dont have the means i spent way too much money and time in this game and i wont spend any more cent in it

#####

never not once the game started properly on the first try and whats more every day you have to download new data sometimes 30mb sometimes 23gb wtf not even wow does thatand trust me they have more content gacha gacha gacha i will never leave a positive review for a gacha game

#####

i would have preferred an actual ff game to tell sepiroths story but this is okay i do dislike gachas but if this wasnt the only way to play through sepiroths past story i wouldnt play it i would recommend this if you want that extra ff7 lore

#####

gacha game only the first mission even gives you barely any real movement literally an autobattler

#####

110 the store page makes it looks like your getting an actual game
mobile game ported to pc with the god awful mobile payment system

#####

i honestly just wanted to give this a go and ignore the reviews as im buying the remake next week finally and wanted to get into it

now i started yesterday its vpn locked which means criware still wont accept them and and after the errors i started the game not to bad cool weapons and stuff lots of cash grab attempts but its a weaponoutfit gacha ok

was kinda fun but apart from one starting fight its auto all the way its a sub par look at the storys here with flashy graphics and videos

today i go to log in and im just loading

for 20 minutes i waited then tried flushing my data etc waited for the download and still loading for another 20 minutes

do i recommend this game nope because i cant even play it lol

1010 for criware being a greedy bunch of devs

#####

i dont consider myself as a huge gacha player but i think i have some experience on this field i have played the followings so far
 genshin impact
 honkai star rail
 princess connect both global and jp
 fate grand order
 octopath traveler cotc a bit
 tower of fantasy a bit

i have shared this information so you know that this is not my first time playing these kind of games with all this settled let me give my view on this game

steam may say that i have 11 hours with this game but actually i started playing this back in september and i have been playing this game everyday at least 23 hours the main reason was that it is a final fantasy game and i really love it actually there was no other reason the game at least compared with my previous experiences gameplay wise is pretty low mid

let me put my points into conspros

cons
 gameplay loop is way too dry and repetitive do you want to farm exp just fight these group of enemies do you want more try the higher difficulty which is the same group with higher numbers you want more just increase the difficulty again for the same enemies with higher numbers every grind is like this you fight one enemy 50100 times until the quest is done literally a quest is there to defeat a boss 50 times
 progression seems fine at the beginning but the ceiling can be very quickly reached as a f2p player due to the spongy enemies you quickly feel like you are hitting wet noodles
 the gacha is horrible in other games you may roll for a character once or some times to unlock additional passives here you unlock weapons and if you want to maximise a weapon you have to pull it at least 10 times and for additional whale bait 20 times more it is horrible because even the game is pretty young there are way too many weapons in the game for you to max out a weapon it is so bad that even for the current event the boss is weak to frost i hit it with a frost weapon i reduce the enemys magic resistance so i hit more i put a debuff on the boss to increase the frost damage taken i have the gear which increases my frost damage output with a passive and i deal like 10k damage into the boss and i had pretty good gear with maximum level aerith with 60k power then the whale comes in and without the bebuff deals 43k damage edit forgot to mention that every fight has a hard time limit every boss so far had a mechanic that increased their damage output after a certain time which made them 1 hit kill your party so every fight is actually a dps race which the previous example showed you will lack
 i know it sounds silly but there is barely any way to increase your grind speed you can only treat a single fight as 3 fights you pay 3 times of the stamina to do 1 fight for 3 rewards and make the fight twice as fast but that is all other games offer skips if you have already defeated that group of enemies or costs so much staminaenergy that you only have to do that fight max 34 timesday you have to sit there and click on that repeat button you have to watch your phone every 23 minutes while you are grinding the same stuff
 coop is a cool feature but it just doesnt work it has the same grind issue you want to do like 50 fightsweek to maximise your coop medal intake but you have to wait other players to join other players to accept the lobby do the fight with 1x speed then click on repeat wait for everyone to accept it drops back you to the lobby why then hit accept and wait for everyone to accept then you can do it again while anyone loses connection it stops and you are done with your round
 it is way too predatory like it asks for 20 price may be incorrect but it is expensive af to do 2x10 roll that is  insane money for such a low reward it has bundles which offers you materials which are huge baits since you get lot of those rewards pretty easily they are just there to bump up the price of those bundles
 the balance is there to maximise profit you have to accept it events will be hardimpossible for you to do fully because you dont get a number which was carefully calculated for you to beat while the banner offers a weapon as a solution where even if you roll 30x10 around 1000 price may be incorrect  you may still only get one weapon

the pros
 the graphics are actually really good
 the optimisation is good as well with this good look my potato phone could run this game
 there are some cool features like choosing 5 weapons to have more chance to be rolled when you roll a 5 star weapon
 brings back the nostalgia with the music weapons etc

overall i just cant recommend it it forces itself being your main game playing nonstop but it just feels like i am converting my lifetime into numbers which are fighting against a way too big number it is not a game just a cock tease temptation you to spend money for for what actually to beat an artificial difficulty which was made not to be beaten without money every passing day it feels more that this is just a huge money eating machine which skinned our beloved characters skin wearing them to entice you into spending money

edit typo and additional point

while admittedly a bit rough to get into at first this game has surprising depth once youve gotten into it ive been playing it on and off now for roughly half a year without paying anything at all and my enjoyment so far has only steadily increased im at a point right now where im actually considering spending some money in the mtx store not because i particularly want or need anything in there but because i feel like the game has actually given me a lot of entertainment and i want to show some support i think this is about the highest praise you can give to a freetoplay gacha title like this one i dearly hope the game will keep on turning until they get around to adding some of the more esoteric chapters of the compilation of ff7 such as before crisis

#####

i just wanna enjoy a story and a deeper understanding of this ff7 universe i know this is a free game and of course microtransaction is may i say a must these days so for me this game is just another common free game with a same formula as others nope not for me i just wanna play without any interruption from pushed microtransaction ads gacha system daily grinding system and power limitation man its just not for me

#####

what do you do in this game

you auto battle your way through the game

or

se is milking you out of nostalgia

bonus not worth it even for free

#####

ok so ive been playing this game since mobile release via a vpn and i never could give a review for the game until now so dont mind my 22hrs on record as i have at least over more than 200 hrs in this game and theres no way of telling hence its time to give a review of what i really think about it 

for those who dont want to read my personal average rating for this game is 5510 and thats coming from a die hard fan with almost every game in the franchise in their library i repeat almost every game in the franchise i even have a collection for the ps45 

so ever crisis what do i really think about it a game with high potential of being a reimagining of the original ffvii and crisis core with the classical way of playing the game but is time consuming and frustrating 

allow me to explain unlike previous ff mobile games such as mobius and dissidia oo both now gone ever crisis is a not a cash grab at best its a time grab game yes there is gacha but thats not the worst part of the game most of its main content basically the story is power locked and it forces you to do the side content to gain more power which is ridiculous cause the amount of time you spend on the grind per day is at a 8020 ratio at worse and that is if you spend about 10 hours a day at the game after a few points in the story mode youre power locked and have no choice but to play side content just to get through the story and the progression is slow you may think at first that leveling is easy but once you get to 45 it gets very slow it took me about 40 hours of grind just to get through 1 part of the story section and thats just 13 story sections 

opera omnia was better you only needed one character maxed out to take on the entire story mode in normal ever crisis forces you to grind just to relive a story that youve already seen since 1997 and the amount of time you spend on the grind is enough to finish the original story itself ugh

the only reason to really play this game is for the first soldier storyline which is completely new to the compilation and their one hook in for those who have played rebirth theyve already included characters in first soldier in ffvii rebirth 

so pros and cons i think this needs a pros and cons as a summary 

pros
 good graphics for a mobile game it tops mobius ff which is the last mobile game to hit steam 
 good gameplay it really has a decent design and really makes you engage in every fight especially with those close to your power level 
 new story content not just first soldier there are some added chapters not present in the compilation of vii
 friendly gacha system kinda rare to hear this but the gacha isnt the worst part of the game and it does allow more than it gives compared to other gacha systems
 multiplayer content this is actually a good thing that it has multiplayer thats similar to dffoo but its heavily power locked for some newbies and its more likely going to favor those whove been playing since day 1 
 new characters there are new characters playable here that are not present in the original set im talking about glenn and his party 
 friendly weapon enhancement system you can actually enhance any weapon in the game to its full star potential you dont have to rely on the gacha system but yeah you still need the gacha system to go full overboost however this kinda removes the purpose of the best gear as not all weapons have 100 usefulness 

cons
 the gacha system despite what i say about it its still present and its makes this game 100 still expensive 
 power locking content content like story chapters cant be cleared if you dont have the proper power level for the party 
 horrendous grinding theres a lot of grind in this game and its not just player leveling theres weapon enhancement materia synthesis character boards summons etc all that to get through one power locked stage  
 side content focused theres a ton of side contents that is more likely going to be the content youll play on your day to day login  
 not a standalone game given the gameplay and its purpose this wouldve been better as a standalone game like ffxv pocket edition sadly its not
 unnecessary randomness stuff like the materia systhesis have a random factor of getting the materia you want which sucks since it takes hours just to synthesize one materia
 time spent on side content is enough to finish ffvii og alone 

in conclusion this is a game that forces you play the game to get to the parts you want in the game rather than spending money to progress you gotta grind to progress and it aint friendly to do that i dont know why but thats the case of it grind is the key

#####

biggest issue is if you tab out of the game it crashes

tried to uninstall via steam  doesnt work after about 30 minutes it told me that the uninstall failed
went to files theres an uninstallbat it opened ran for a moment said access denied wouldnt let me run it again tried to run it as admin wouldnt work tried to manually delete the files gives me an error saying the game is running

this 100 feels more like a virus now than a game i would just fully recommend to avoid this game unless you want to dedicate a part of your storage to a rather shit money grab game

#####

the story is a summary of ff7 crisis core and another spin off game set before crisis core or ff7 where you meet young sephiroth aerisaerith is aerith if you want to remember the gist of those games or are considering playing them this is a free intro to them 

the graphics are music are good the battle system is interesting and setting the game to play the fights for you gives you a pretty clever ai although magic or physical immunity is completely ignored 

new ways to play are constantly being unlocked for the first few hours so it keeps things dynamic until you come to some realisation that you are basically grinding for the sake of grinding since you know the story of ff7 and crisis core the new  content isnt that long either

if you like something you can semi idle and grind this could be a good choice for you

i want to like this but every time i start the game up i am bombarded with currencies weapon draws limit break draws whoever is in charge of the mobile division is a money grubber feel disrespected that i get thrown all this before i can even try to progress in this game skip this and play the original

#####

obviously they gonna milk ff7 to the ground
ff7 is my favorite game of all timebut not falling for this practices
this game is another attempt to steal your wallet

stay away from anything ff7 besides the original game and the remakes

#####

if you are going down this route please bring back mobius final fantasy

i can no recommend this game at all the moment you start it up you are assaulted with buy these

#####

mobius was better

#####

game just will not load for me past the loading screen it just says connecting for 5 seconds and then im just stuck on a black screen well at least this game was free because i wouldve been really pissed off lmao

update 40124 tried starting it up again and it still gives me a frickin black screen its frustrating because ive tried looking for solutions and people seem to have inconsistent and oftentimes specific ways to fix this and i dont really feel like doing any of that this game is also on android and id play it on there instead if the game was supported on my damn phone a samsung galaxy a13 5g btw

#####

edited review

now that ive managed to open the game its good and smooth the draws are still pretty rushed but the anniversary event makes up for it thank you

#####

justtrash squareenix is soulless

#####

had gone into it with an open mind gacha cringe and all i still gave it a fair chance

but i was already dead when i got flashed in the eyes over and over for what seemed like an hour about gacha things and was forced through a tutorial on how to gacha and about a hundred more unecessary things before i got to do my first mission if i can even call it that 

some story is thrown at you and then you are put into a battle if you are lucky  some missions are just a scene of text before you are thrown back to the menu with more gacha crap rewards and you have to load up the next

i remember being excited for ever crisis the og game with updated graphics nah its less than a visual novel who actually wants this  worse part is my nongamer wife who would be happy to see a story got turned off after seeing me have to return to the menu every 2 seconds

i didnt even bother to install it on her phone i mean how could i when i dont even want it on my own  uninstalled

i always feel bad for those who get paid to push out these turds i mean sure money is nice but honestly do you feel happy nobody wants these   id need to be able to stand the game for longer than 2 minutes if i were ever to feel inclined to purchase anything  why would i want a skin for a character in a game i dont want to play 

at least x dive i could play

#####

fight menus instead of fighting enemies 

typical gacha nonsense lots of popups and attempts to get you to spend  to progress quicker and easier

#####

nice assets not worth your time most of your time goes to navigating menus and clicking claim buttons

#####

in some recent update they changed path to the mako reactor mission insted of 3 ppl party its now 1 person story mission and that means about 2 more days of grind to have enough power to finish it thanks now i dont want to play anymore

#####

honestly this game isnt good enough to warrant my playtime but i love ff7 so i cant stop myself

#####

crazy how the pc port is somehow less stable and slower than the mobile version up to 60 seconds for missions to load even on low graphics with a full download no thank you

#####

grind grind game asks you for money grind grind grind se is greedy gimme money grind grind i like idle games but even this is boorrriiinnnggg you think you gacha me with this nope ill give you my money for an enjoyable game youre not getting a penny for this

#####

all we wanted was a ff7 true remake instead we got a gaucha

#####

i played a bit on mobile but it wont let me migrate my save data and is making me start over huge l on this one square really does have a 30 win rate on their mobile releases i still think first soldier should have been a pc and console title not a mobile one this should have just been a remake of classic ff7 with all the other story parts added in oh well

#####

update after 5 months playing

not bad these days truly terrible grind the first month or two then becomes similar to most modern gachas not requiring much time daily

theyre still very generous for f2p players equally or moreso than at launch surprisingly quality gear customisationplanning type game with pretty good end game combat top tier music and visuals for the little new content provided

still held back by the terribly tedious and poorly thought out menus why is there still no retry button for the daily premium quests or a 3x clear option as everything else has why is there no curehealing filter for materia why is there no confirm button for best equip button that will instantly destroy your entire preset of gear why does it show new available indicator on your weapons in enhance screen if you can upgrade their level with mithril ore instead of only showing when you have 200 weapon parts to upgrade the star rank making it so you cant tell which weapons you can upgrade star rank without going off memory or one by one

no way the devs play their game daily or this stupid to not fix any of these qol issues after all this time or even acknowledge them 

then theres the fact that they keep raising the level cap and their bandaid fix is having 12 week events with 500 xp boost for new characters released and such what happens if you miss that week or are a new player lmao cant even imagine how bad the level grind would be now on top of grinding the summons for 20 hours each to max them out



been playing since launch on emulator and now steam

tldr dont attempt to play this game seriously without installing on an emulator to use recorded macros or an auto clicker program with steam version you will be burnt out after a few weeks otherwise and quit this game requires you to grind the same stage hundreds of times in a loop for many hours with auto battle on and gives you nearly infinite stamina potions to keep going

this game belongs in 2016 everything is so outdated easily the worst gacha game ive played for more than a week in the modern gacha era cant believe im still playing it here and there

pros
very generous in crystal rewards and free drawsrolls in the gacha this is what suckers most people into continuing to play outside of just the story releases 
top tier 2d prerendered graphics for the little story available and in some events
fairly good combat system set back by very poor character ai and not utilised that well in current fights
well done ff7 themes music and graphics literally nobody would touch this game if this was stripped away

cons
cant play this game without an auto clicker unless insane with no standardslimited gaming experience
basically no gameplay once you finish the short story other than endlessly grinding the same bosses forever
no sweep skip or any mainstream gacha options 3x manual at most and doesnt even apply to the 3x dailies you will have to waste your time grinding in an endless loop the same fight hundreds of times the game gives you countless amount of stamina pots requiring you to grind for countless hours as a result and by grind i mean afk auto battles that you have to keep coming back to click redo every 12 minutes for hours
many annoying menu issues that anyone who actually played the game daily and had a brain would fix pretty quickly
the worst multiplayer coop ive seen creates easy grieving and headaches due to players having to click ready with a full 2 minute afk timer before removed from group 80 of it is due to the endless grind of the same fight in afk auto battle mode rather than on purpose but still there after all this time as you cant use an auto clicker for coop grinds making it twice as bad

#####

as a final fantasy lover who likes gacha games i really couldnt be happier lol i get to play aerith coop with friends and grind for beautiful outfitsweaponswallpapers whatever it may be side note i havent spent any money to get anything i have in this game theyre pretty generous with the drawing crystals

my only con for this game is sometimes the audio cuts out and you have to restart your game to get it back i am 31 hours in and this has only happened 3 times so i dont really care 

last note some people with friends might consider it a con that you have to get to a certain point to play with friends but you can literally just skip all of it  

#####

first things first this is just a mobile game ported to pc and they truly did not do a good job at transitioning the controls
the interface is clunky and bloated and parts lag the game is also riddled with predatory microtransactions

#####

trying to reach my wallet leveraging my childhood memories good try

#####

f your login system clicked on 50 or so pictures just to try and login to get an error im not doing it again go f yourself

update for those who couldnt login to your account if you transfer your account from your mobile to steam you can log into steam all other logins were getting errors thats the only way i was able to get into my account

#####

theres a few things to say about this

dont try to spend any extra money because all the content is extremely expensive and unreasonable you can earn blue coins to get some stuff but i will say on a cell phone the game runs very hot glad they managed to port it to pc but it is still a cell phone game with daily crap to do to earn the points the more active you are the more youll have i have spent no money on the game but ive managed to afford all the free character skin ive wanted

cons
as for the story i feel the sephiroth redemption elements theyre adding are okay kind of forced though the three new characters they add who were nonexistent before are bland and boring and kind of take away from the whole crisis core sephiroth only had his friends angeal and genesis who he could relate with suddenly these guys soften him as a youngster just seems forced

the cons include the first paragraph about it being a cash grab for ff7 which was originally a beautiful story that seems to be being shamelessly profited from but oh well square had to hit the big red button cuz they were going under

pros
the soundtrack is outstanding and this is because it actually remakes the songs from the og ff7 in creative ways that are not changing from the original in destructive ways i personally hated a lot of the ost to ff7r and this game makes up for a lot of missing tracks

when it follows the original story it is much missed because of the nature of the ff7r
i can appreciate the retelling of the og in good graphics if not it being an abridged form of itself some of the extra stories for characters cloudtifaaerithbarret are very fitting and add to the og in a comfortable way

the backgrounds look great reminiscent of the old style in a good way character models are decent enough for a chibi style and fighting models look like ff7r so good

id recommend to play simply to og fans for the storymode but as far as the online content goes it is queue with 2 others to fight a boss over and over repetitive easy and boring

i only recommending it for the effort put into the soundtrack my review is honest though so take it for your own decisions


ost  10

#####

aaand its back to not loading anymore

this game is just not worth getting on pc
it takes hours of tinkering to get it set up and it will work for one 1 day
the next time you try and launch the game youll have to spend those hours
resetting cache
removing data
uninstalling
reinstalling
trying to run normally
trying to to in admin mode
relinking account

and still youll sit there saying why the fuck wont this game run

this is one of the worst ports to pc ive ever seen
dont get this unless you want constant headaches


the game it self is fine and works fine on mobile

#####

since some people have issues with linking the game data
link your smartphone account with square enix enable steam overlay and then you can link your pc version with your smartphone account easy took me 3 minutes

its a nice game with good animations and fun gameplay even though you will face many auto battles on the high difficulty challenges you can and should take the controls in your hand
many events and much content no p2w you can indeed reach higher levels as a free to play gamer surely you will get some advantages items gems artworks cosmetics as someone who is willing to pay a few bucks in the month nothing new nothing bad of course they want make some money with it but you dont need to spend money in order to reach something in this game
the developers are also quite generous you will often get presents which will include gems to roll the gachas you like

as a new player you should watch some guides on youtube which will explain the core game mechanics and give you some hint on what to do best

i am playing since a few months on android and have much fun with it its not perfect and maybe a little different as one may suggest but you should be fair before rating give it a real try its a good game in my opinion

#####

im not exaggerating when i say its literally unplayable

cant even get past the title screen without an error has occurred returning to the title screen

#####

i have been playing the mobile version since the release

and its a pretty good gacha game but its still a gacha game
its single player  coop so u dont have to worry about going against whales in multiplayer  sometimes developers award everyone if the whales manage to complete hard events which is pretty nice
even if you dont spend money and dont have the best weapons u can still find ways to complete most of the harder content
if you decide to play ever crisis just sit back and relax there is no need to go hard on all of the banners collect what you like and want and enjoy it
there are also bunch of tutorials and guides on youtube if you need them to help you get a good start

gameplay  nothing special but you gotta know how to equip your characters and when and how to use your abilities
graphics  really good for a mobile game
story i mean its ff7  bonus storylines so its great
events good fun storylines with good freebies but requires alot of grinding
pay 2 play  not heavily in my opinion

tips
recommended power can sometimes be misleading and u can beat it with a weaker team
growth and materia priorities  over flat stats are gonna help you alot so dont ignore those
dont pull on every banner because its meta if you are f2p pull on what you want or what you actually need
for more just search a bit on youtube and enjoy the game



#####

i cant believe you abuse the name what made you guys famous today you guys slap ff7 name on anything really disrespecting the game i used to love if you disagree with me theyre bringing ff9 characters in the ff7 universe its not really cannon is it

im a die hard fanboy when it comes down to ff7 ff7 is what got me into the whole series and any chance i get to support it i try but not anymore on this ive been playing since closed beta and today was the last time cuts out a lot of story and and feel more like a pay to win with the rng i spend some money to show support but only 50 thanks for trying se but not playing anymore of this

#####

after bsod on solo quest game now freezes everytime i start any solo quest t_t
redownloaded  same any solutions or just need to wait for a next patchupdate

#####

eww dont suport this type of crap

#####

ill preface this by saying i am huge ff7 fan i played the og back in the day and have consumed every piece of 7 related content over the past 20 years 

this game is not it i dont mind gacha games and ive played a few longterm however the systems in ever crisis are designed in such a way that its near impossible to max out a weapon without spending some serious coin oh do you see a costume you like if you are free to play you may get that costume but you can forget about getting the next two or three that you like and the stamp system oh the stamp system fills me with so much rage its supposed to be a bonus but its also the only pity system i cant articulate how bad it feels to get 1s all the bloody time im told you can get a 12 you need 12 stamps for the costume but the highest ive seen is a 6 since launch 

they give out a bunch of gems which makes it look like its super generous but again the way the system is designed guaranteeing a costume could cost up to 36000 gems if the stamp system hates you which it does me xd

its such a shame as the game had so much potential but i think ultimately greed will sink this ship before it leaves port i would not encourage spending on this game i doubt itll be around all too long the fact that theyve already pulled out a ff9 crossover ec hasnt even been out 6 months indicates to me that se arent making the money they thought they would 

i really wish i wasnt writing this i love ff7 so much but this game isnt it avoid 

ps its also incredibly grindy and time consuming

#####

the worst final fantasy vii game ever made and also the most greedy one

i cannot imagine anyone playing enjoying this pile of thrash and even spending money on this garbage guys there are tons of much much muuuuch better games so dont waste your precious time and go to play really worth time

how mighty final fantasy vii has fallen

h3prosh3
bmouse cursor supportb
it is rare to see this kind of support from a square enix game

bmusicb
you cannot beat the uematsu legendary score

h3consh3
bawful graphicsb
lowres graphics that was not properly adjusted to high res pc monitors it also looks somehow flat and worse than the original ones cgi loading screens  everything is lowres you can play the game on ultra but it still looks like a pile of a horses

bawful mobilelike uib
large icons large font the game tells you to tap instead of click virtual dpad not adjusted for pc to look good and elegant it is just a direct port from mobiles

bawful grindingb
it is pay or grind

bno real gameplayb
the games gameplay is about clicking on various confirm buttons when the game tells you it gives something like a reward to make an expression that it gives to you something valuable to keep you exciting to play or rather persuade you to buy these things for real money because it is good for you or informs you about various packs you can buy to enhance your gaming experience there are tons of items to enhance weapons materia etc traditional free to play mechanics but you know the drill  grinding there is a lot of cut content from the original games so exploration is very shortcoming and you will be witnessing known scenes much sooner than you used to be it is really not an another way of remake this is a demake

bno real added valueb
it is just a machine to draw as much money from you as the game can

#####

do you enjoy hours upon hours upon hours of grind andor do you enjoy throwing potentially thousands of dollars at a game in order to see bigger numbersreduce some of the grind if so this is the game for you if not look for something else 

its like playing an mmo except 90 of what youre doing is meaningless dull dailies and most of the remainder is hoping the materia system will let you finally have a decent drop after a few thousand attempts the devs are almost on their third level cap raise and the games only been out for a little over 3 months

as for something positive the framerate looks much smoother on pc

#####

mobile welfare game garbage keep this garbage off of steam

#####

another download when i got in the game beat the tutorial another download 12 pop ups for systems it hasnt explained trying to sell me stuff did 6 missions 2 of them where fights one was the iconic scorpion boss i left auto play on after it raised its tail i didnt level up or gear up or anything and it did like 1  10th of my health  whats the point in any of this  you show me the things i remember they act how i remember them acting but nothing means anything  pop up for gacha rolls 10 more times before i uninstall

really wanted to like this very disapointed

#####

how  when we collect your personal information

from the moment you begin interacting with square enix we are collecting personal information sometimes the personal information we collect is provided by you and sometimes it is collected automatically

#####

the only remarkable about this cheap rehash of assets dumbed down story vignettes and uninspired gacha mechanics is that the chibi models could prove useful one day for modders of the original ff7 if the modders are able to properly rip them from the game files  that is

#####

so much good work went into this game on the art side great model replacements for the original chibi models in ff7 and so on that said the game itself is sort of a fastforward through the story and while you could consider the materia system in the original a bit shallow and grindy what we get here instead is much worse

weapon gacha materials to upgrade so number bigger this game fails as a mobile game by providing nothing better or more meaningful mechanically than what you could get in any other mobile game it fails as a final fantasy game by making use of combat that is more efficient on auto than having the player strategize any meaningful interaction or build it fails as a remake of final fantasy vii by distilling worldbuilding and character storylines into the bare minimum required to get the story across in order to make way for weapon gacha and daily grind quests

squareenix also has a terrible track record with maintaining liveservice games so be ready to lose any and all progress you make in this game a year or two down the line at this point square isnt even shinra its the meteor

#####

i miss dffoo

#####

okay i dont know how many hours its going to say i have on this so far but ive been downloading the 10ish gb data pack for about 12 hours now and have been stuck in the  6070 area for about 5 hours

this
this is why
we dont do
ingame downloads

further note
another 12 hours of downloading and no dice so screw it going to the phone version

#####

standard mobile game nothing special

either fix the fact that you can never match in a fucking coop game or stop tying rewardsgoals to using energy in coop battles

#####

nope not really no dont even install it

#####

this is a gacha game never indulge a gacha game not even to try they exist solely to get you hooked and then steadily raise the bar on your expected efforts and investment until they find the threshold of insufferable just to try and force you to buy exploiting fomo fostering investment fallacy and baiting group mentality its all here

if you were hoping for this to be the definitive ff7 remake experience it is sadly not that the story skips around as it pleases leaving in only chunks of the juiciest dungeons to explore and a fragmented handful of story beats that completely skip all the travel minigames and flavor between locations cutscene decisions have been rendered completely inconsequential and skippable no one cares if you give the flower to marline or tifa it does nothing and only a fragment of the actual story is available to begin with youll have to wait a year or two for the live service to slowly churn out one new chapter at a time chopped into a hundred bitesized pieces of course naturally any parts that werent already seen in ff7 remake will appear exclusively in lowquality ai upscale instead of actually being remastered to a meaningful degree

if you were hoping for an engaging multiplayer experience this is also not that while online coop technically exists and is beneficial the gameplay boils down to hope youve grinded power numbers in the specific attack types you need for this boss and its better played by the auto button rather than actually giving it your time and attention to play manually

if you were hoping for a casual slot machine you can throw a couple dollars into for a quick dopamine rush as you hope for something good this game wants over 15 usd per spin straight up and bombards you constantly with limited time offers regardless its petulant

if you were somehow hoping for a game that will stand the test of time and make you feel good for all your time and effort spent on it im sorry to remind you that this is a live service you do not own your save data and it will be shut down at any time even if they didnt finish the story yet any progress you do make will inevitably be a moot point anyway as the weekly updates perpetually churn out new events to grind new goals to reach and new power to obtain you will never be on top for long because the entire game is fundamentally designed around incrementally making everything you own slowly become outdated and worthless as the power creeps steadily and inevitably nothing in this game will be special or unique every single weapon will immediately already have two different variants upon release just to give the same weapon to multiple characters in case you prefer one over the other

why are you even reading this go ahead and fight four hundred scorpion sentinels in a row if you dont believe me grind to level 50 and watch as the level cap gets raised by 5 every month until they reach their favorite numbers 99 or 120 max out a weapon only for two new gachaonly weapons to appear that outclass it with every event carefully farm synthesis items and generate materia in every sigil every element and in both magic and physical forms while the game cycles through focusing on each in turn until eventually they introduce a new type of materia for you to grind all over again

this is not fun this is just busywork something pretty you can idly poke at while you wait for something real to happen thats all its good for and even then youll want to keep it muted or the same three songs repeating constantly will drive you up a wall

#####

gatcha grindfest sadly required to know the entire story behind specific events very pretty game but the balance is beyond bad

#####

if you are waiting for ff7rebirth this is the place

the game over all its pretty fun it does have a lot of content i wish it was a full game rather than a gacha
gacha is pricey but if you grind enough you can unlock the cute cool skins like aerith  tifa christmas edition
 sephiroth story is cool  its the main attraction

se ethics comite didnt put their stupid censorship here because they know gachas need sexy to sell so expect to see normal racks like in real life

#####

had applibot decided to learn from nier reincarnation in good ways and included things like skips sweeps and autorepeat from the start this game may be worth the trouble

as it stands it demands too much time from you to be a side game and isnt worth the grind in my opinion to be a main game

as a collector it works but they really make you feel like youre missing out constantly by not meeting the grind requirements

ill change to a recommend if the qol is brought up to speed so the game doesnt take several hours of playtime per day unless youre cheating

#####

terrible game 

it doesnt add anything interesting to ff7 doesnt replace ogff7 by a long shot this is a very abridged version thats not even complete gameplay sucks a proper turnbased battle system akin to the original ff7 would have been fun but this is just autotrash that plays itself

massive grinds where you set the game to auto speed up and wait for the battles to complete so you can do it over and over because theres grinds for exp materials for materia materials for weapon enhancement materials for character growth events and more only a few encounters require manual play manual as in you control 1 character the other 2 is still on auto regardless

you also get so little value if you are spending money for example to get a costume costumes has stats not just cosmetics which is timelimited you have to draw gacha weapons and every time you draw you get stamps 1  45 235 315 42 515 605 12001 and you need 12 stamps to get the costume every draw cost 3000 crystals thats 30001236000 crystals you need to guarantee you get the costumes you can get 12800 crystals for 88  95 so you would have to buy 3 of those packs to guarantee you get the costume thats 264  285 for 1 one costume assuming you have 0 luck and theres right now 3 costumes available aerith tifa  redxiii and you only have until feb 19 for aerith and mar 4 for tifa  redxiii and then theyre gone

naturally you can get free crystals in game so if you save up enough you can get costumes for free but you wont have enough by far for every costume especially once you have cleared all the story and stuff at that point you can only get 5000 free crystals per month assuming you play every day or 8000 if you play on mobile and also watch ads every day which is not available on steam

only thing i like was the graphics on mobile on the pc it is subpar but at least you can have 4k 120fps so theres at least that

#####

abominable

#####

this to me is the sqexs idea of upgrading dffoo which i can see they have put the back into making something that is really noticeable on a pc screen dffoo i think was just an experiment but it took off in a big way and now i see a similar setting of gameplay here except with jaw dropping graphics and a new story to fit in with what is already a huge entanglement of so many metaphorical storys that hugely relate to real life events thank you sqex playing this on the mobile doesnt do the graphics justice but its great i have the option to play if outaway from the pclaptop etc and sqex never force any ads onto players something i have always respected about sqex mobile gatcha games

#####

i love final fantasy but the price of things in this game is extreme  20 for a chance to get a 5 star weapon you have to land on 10 more times in order to max it out  nty

yes you can play for free but i will never recommend a game that expects you to spend thousands and gives you nothing but cosmetics and bigger numbers for it  this is a time waster attempting to exploit fomo and nostalgia

#####

oh thank god i dont have to use bluestacks anymore

#####

i have a few hundred hours on mobile phone and this is a good pc port
performance is really good also on older hardware

story and gameplay is good even there is some difference in the story between the titels

#####

its alright and extremely grindy but the auto battle feature makes it tolerable

#####

this game felt like it was a joint between two distinct teams one that really loves final fantasy 7 and another comprised of suits that insisted on it being a lifeless gacha
the app itself seems to be a straight port of the mobile version with only a few keyboard hotkeys added there are remnants of the mobile version sloppily left in like pinch to zoom indicators that dont apply to desktop controls the menus like to softlock a lot and require force closes finding what you want in the menu is difficult and moving between screens is laggy opening any given menu has a 1 to 2 second load time and switching screens takes 4 or 5 after claiming a reward you then have to claim it again for some reason every couple of days or at character upgrade breakpoints youll face an onslaught of popups the menus are the absolute worst of the game and unfortunately you spend most of your time there
the story modes are fantastic and retell the original ff7 and crisis core stories a new soldiersephiroth prequel story and a few new avalanche members prequel stories using the sd aesthetic of ff7 complete with the prerendered backgrounds even the seasonal events mini story modes are charming and wellwritten the visuals are upgraded to look like ff7 remake and the music is remastered but closer to the originals than the remake arrangements while enjoyable the stories are very short and are padded out by dungeons free movement areas and battles or boss fights and while the battle system is okay its pretty unremarkable as you will almost always leave the game on autoplay and fast forward they at least give you some cool music and fancy attack effects to watch in the meantime sound effects vary from neat to really abrasive and harsh
surprisingly aside from the aforementioned popups when you hit certain upgrade breakpoints the gacha doesnt feel very predatory i never felt the need to pay anything for resources i was short on and everything was farmable using the plentiful stamina they give you in my entire 120 hours of playtime i ended up only spending 3 for an outfit voucher that came with some premium currency the only resource i felt they were pretty stingy about were character memories which are used to unlock the sphere grid of this game most of your power comes from upgrading materia and weapons though whose materials are readily farmable i was able to make it about 50 hours 80000 power on my main team in before feeling like progress slowed down a lot which i think is pretty reasonable
the art is the other high point of the game there are great skins weapons and menu wallpapers to collect and character portraits were done in a sort of kingdom hearts style that i really liked

the people that designed the story modes skins wallpapers weapons and art deserve praise but the main reason i cant recommend this game is that its a steep time investment for a small payoff that could ultimately be enjoyed through story summary videos and screenshots

#####

game itself is ok but lets be honest having a half anniversary event for celebration is fine but lets say its cost are a bad joke lets make small calculations of 1 part of it

lets make a special 10 pull that gets somewhat better rewards per step with 7 steps special and lets people allow up to 2 loops  2 times those 7 steps  and make 1 loop cost arround 70 cash no ingame currency cash and now lets think about it this game is supposed to celebrate for ff vii and now 2 loops would be arround 140 for those ingame gaccha pulls as celebration for the same ammount you can get ff vii remake  dlc  when it releases on pc rebirth as well and probably some small little figures or posters of ff vii for the same ammount a celebration pull is 

#####

continual crashes and freezing after more than a dozen tries the title screen is all the further i get

#####

hey gamers so here is my take on this game

features
 its final fantasy so it has one of the best stories ever
 three final fantasy stories in one game stories from final fantasy 7 final fantasy 7 crisis core and the new story final fantasy 7 ever crisis
 new final fantasy characters
 pve both singleplayer and coop
 fantasy
 stunning characters
 amazing graphics
 cgi animations during battle

pros
 very fun to play
 original and new stories
 story cinematics
 story cutscenes
 cosmetics for characters and weapons
 some character and weapon cosmetics can be obtained for free during events
 one new story in the final fantasy 7 franchise with new characters

cons
 very difficult unbalanced bosses
 caters mostly for p2w players
 endless grinding and daily chores
 terrible drop rates on items
 ridiculous amounts of exp needed to level up characters on higher levels
 materia system is a nightmare with very bad rng
 weapons need a ton of duplicates to power up to max p2w gacha system
 most character cosmetics are paywall locked behind gacha summons and some behind seasonal passes
 fomo fear of missing out content
 scam seasonal passes
 scam gacha
 scam cash store
 scam premium currency

i did a firstlook gameplay video of the game and i rate this game 5 out of 5 in honesty i want to rate this game 1 out of 5 because of all the greedy monetization practices but if you are a casual player and only play this game for the story then you wont be disappointed

here is my first look gameplay
httpsyoutubeeabezjbaurg

please watch like subscribe share and help my channel grow

thats my take keep gaming

#####

dont recommend at all played hundreds of hours on mobile spent money and fully lost my account because se decided its a great idea to not auto connect their game with google when it was a mobile game first naturally i assumed it was auto backing up to my google account like most mobile games do so when i upgraded phones i didnt even dare to think that i would need to link or set up a special account or anything to have it transfer over wrong call on my part apparently loved the game but its fully unplayable to me now cause theres no way im going through another couple hundred hours of grind to get even remotely back to where i was

#####

sephiroth 

#####

auto grindfest 

#####

the cut sceens and look is really good however like all other reviews this game kills with having to spend money to get anywherefree to play is possible however you will need to pick and choose what banners you want to spend crystals its an ok game overall

#####

yarrraaaaaaaaaakkkkkkk gibi oyun amk

#####

after around 75h of playing this game i think i can write a review because i have nearly faced everything that the game has to offer i also had a ctd and cant enter the game anymore which is just the cherry on top just brilliant
first and foremost this is a mobile game from applibot in coop and not from squareenix the main focus are microtransactions which means they only want your best your money while riding on your nostalgia trip feeding you memberberries till you understand they switched the memberberries with made up fan fiction aka bs
sure you need microtransaction for a f2p game but this one is insane nearly everthing needs to be paid with rl currency or their ingame premium currency which you have to buy with rl currency

the positives
 the grafics and animations are pretty good
 the music is from ffvii cant go wrong with that
 some concepts are well done like the chocobo farm yeah the one from ffvii which let you get free resources and exp for characters who join them 3 at max
 the inventory wont let you lose items when it is already full

the negatives
 no updated steam version after installing the game you have to download another bunch to even start the game
 endless grinding for everything
  a exp for characters duh this should be fine but it doesnt stop here
  b sigils for magic attack heal and character symbols to update their skill tree more attack magic health healing and increase the damage of your ult 
  c guess what point b applies to summons as well
  d weapons need to be upgraded and unlock the next stages as well and because you dont got just one weapon and one character while charcters can have multiple weapons equiped 2 main and more in the sub section this will end into a grind feast
  e materia needs to be unlocked leveled up and recipes need to be found to create newother materia

 it is all the same over and over again because of the grinding and you cant skip anything
the same level same enemies same animations same abilities that need to be interrupted etc
sometimes you get a rare enemy which is always cactuar in different shapes normal iron gold but mostly the next area is the same area as before just with higher level or different models of the bosses

 animations cant be skipped automatically

 fan ficition combined with crisis core ff vii the first soldier ff vii remake and ff vii rebirth sequences
i call it fan ficition because many things never happened like they show it in this game on top of that there are storylines of things you never wanted to know or asked for in some cases you cant even skip steps because they found it really good to have dialogs from ff vii implemented that you have to answer as well with no different outcome

 multiple jumps from one solo story to another one because you dont got the recommended power for the next step you need to jump between ff vii crisis core and the first soldier all the time

 confusing menu with submenus that got submenus everything seems to be put together on the fly and without really thinking about it

 confusing unlock system when you start the game it gets even more confusing when you have to jump between storylines and to switch to other submenus

 manual semiauto and auto battle is not what you think they will do
  a manual needs you to use switching stances from offense to defense will cause healers to heal offense they will dmg but no combat skills will be cast 
  b semiauto is the same thing like manual but with combat skills
  c auto battle will switch the stances automatically
in all stances no summons will be casted if you unlocked them and no limit breaks will be done why especially with auto battle on top of that when even player of ffvii ever crisis get the explanations wrong in their videos you know there is something wrong

 the ai for the semi and auto battles is low effort

 no character overview where you can check and equipupdate them seperately you need to go the party menu select solo or coop and then you can check on your characters  updating your gear or you do it in the beginning of battledungeon to even call it a dungeon is just insane also solo party and coop in the party menu were not created for your gear they were created to edit your party for different types of battlesdungeonsenemies not for updating a specific character when you received a new materia etc and you need to update them manually the equip will stay the same if you dont switch it manually

 exponential growth of encounters solo content and storylines

 memory leak after playing a longer period will slow your game and increase the loading time

 spontaneous updates will interrupt you here and there and ends the music queue soundscombat sounds will be still active

 prefered weapons from the gatcha feels more like to exclude them instead of increasing the chances only when i removed them from the list i received them

 dungeons are mostly 13 small areas with bosses where you got a small area to move around and that is it and we call it dungeons yeah right

and the worst of all are the coop battles including the friends system who in the hell thought this would be a brilliant idea that you need other players to join you in a battle with a 1min queue and then you have to restart it but you dont know if someone else on your step and looking for someone because they need to be at the same fing point as you and searching at the same time as you do and even you would be 2 player 3 player needed the system wont add a bot or tells you hey only one player is missing please wait no the queue will be cancelled and you can start again
there are no bots which would be useful especially for new players and lower tiers of coop battles so you can catch up or dont lose interest because the mobile players are 6 month ahead of the pc commnunity
the friends system is so stupid you cant search for anybody who is online you need to have the id of the player or have sent a request after a coop battle which they have to accept the exact same coop battle that wont start for new players when you arent lucky and find a group in the first place holy jesus
invite friends to a battle is stupid as well while you are doing a dungeon mission whatever you see the invite popping up but till you finished what you have done and enter the submenu to accept it it is mostly already over and the group has been formed or the player who invited you left you cant just accept it instantly and will be automatically in the group with the notification right now in this mission will be joining after the battle or stop the mission join the battle and continue where you stopped

conclusion
the game itself looks pretty and sounds cool but only in the beginning after seeing the same animation the 3rd time at the same enemy model its getting worse and worse and worse the ui was created by a 3 year old toddler who had to add more and more and more to submenus instead of an experienced uiux artist who had information of upcoming features the ongoing interrupts for the store are getting anoying after a few times that you have to switch between different storylines is insane the friend and coop system is a mess everything feels clunky like a castle build on sand but we have to put more and more on top the ai is underperforming and the whole thing is pay to win i cant refer to it as a game it is just a gatcha machine with some animatons nostalgic sounds and characters and fan fiction stories ive seen posts and videos that this thing is not that bad really who the hell paid you to say or write that you can buy ff vii for 13 bugs and enjoy a real game without pay to win etc

#####

cant say if its good or bad never got the chance to play it constant errors saying cannot connect and asking me to retry 
give it the old college try but tbf its a port of a mobile gacha game didnt go into it with the highest of expectations

mobile games really dont have a place on steam and should be removed

#####

too much tutorials too much mobile bloat if that makes sense just gives us the the bare bones story thats all i care about

#####

an error has occured return to title screen cant even play the damn game

#####

if final fantasy 7original is your favourite final fantasy game like me seeing it combined with all horrendous gacha mobile game mechanics is like a nightmare plus they put the extra story for sephiroth after all the story chapters like a dangling carrot you have to either waste your money or time to get there shame on you square enix

do yourself a favour and dont waste your time and money on this garbage buy ff7 remake and crisis core instead

#####

its fine ig but the difference between the cutseines and the gameplay like come on man

#####

another fantastic journey

#####

gacha game

#####

ive been playing since ec launched and im really enjoying this game beautiful graphics and remake models and very fun combat and its all ff7
just fyi game is very fun whether youre f2p or a whale entirety is playable and you can play it however you want and it doesnt take anything away from you enjoying it
a lot of events monthly story updates make it so that there is always something to do whether youre a casual player or very into the game and while we currently have 10 characters to choose from who exceed in some roles more than the others you can still choose your favorite 3 characters and play only with them and i find it great

#####

honestly here for the story just another cash grab

#####

really really hard to recommend this game i love ff7 and actively would consider myself a dolphin in this game especially for tifa however its hard to ignore how egregious the pricing is how many popups there are with limited time deals and how much of a grind everything is unless you are a ff7 superfan i would stay away or accept life as a f2p player i heard f2p isnt that bad but i cannot speak as i like to put money in

on the positive side of things
it looks amazing
the atbbased combat is actually fun and pretty challenging
tightknit community that comes together especially during crash events
the stories are all good ff7 and crisis core were known to be great but first soldier has been great too since young sephiroth showed up

update still ever since release of steam version the online functionality of this game just does not work for me i cant connect to coop matches cant do things like dungeon rankings crash battles etc this game works completely fine on my phone though not sure what is the problem with this version

#####

it could have been ff7 remake in style of ff3 from nintendo ds or ff15 pocket edition demake but in the end its another mobile 7gb sic cashgrab with nonexistant combat system that gonna be closed in the next 5 years

#####

i would love to give this game a full 5 star review but if i cant port my data from my mobile device then all the work ive done is completely for nothing  squares cloudflare settings are blocking me from linking my data that i already backed up  i will completely refuse to start over when ive already dumped so much time and effort to get the stuff i want if you guys have the same issue and cant port your data  just drop the game completely

#####

i think final fantasy vii ever crisis is a good game with mean was it can go tha batytle symtim is good and the way they give things to ree playes are good to way hatye a game that they have put all there time to make lets not make this end the way dissida nt or oprom  omna becuse the game si good


#####

just play the actual games this is horrible

#####

before anything else be informed this is a gacha game and very pay to win if looking to get the best itemsweaponsmateria in any timely fashion and compete in some of the leaderboard style events if youre very set against pay to win games despite if they let you complete the story content with relative ease and not much grinding then either skip or play f2p purely for the story  nothing so far story wise has made me feel like i need to pay money to at least experience the story

its still a very fun game with a surprising amount of depth to its synergies with itemsweaponsmateria and doing a good job through its story content bringing the newer generation of ff7 fans up to speed on the original story of ff7 and its prequels  

a nice touch is any new level cap increase always seems to be tied in with new real story content to enjoy  they dont just raise the level cap and call it content  game is only a few months old when considering mobile version so well see how this changes over time as they get caught up with the story content available in the ff7 universe

if any devs are reading comments please consider making the p2w aspect a little less drastic with the power difference between a f2p player and a p2w player  at most a p2w player should never be able to be more than 10ish higher in overall power given similar play time skill level synergies etc  anything more than 10ish is getting into the realm of promoting gambling style financial addiction for impressionable teens and young adults since ff7 only has a teen rating

hope this helps anyone out there on the fence about the game

#####

better off buying the original final fantasy 7
also most of my playtime was spent downloading the game

#####

listen i get it its a gacha game it has microtransactions but you dont need to buy any of the microtransactions to progress in this game you can easily grind for the currency you need to do pulls on the banners it has a lot to do i have spent so much time on my mobile device doing all the events dailies and grinding to enhance my gear they provide you with so many stamina bottles that you dont need to wait for your stamina to refill you can keep playing you can keep progressing you can keep participating

not to mention if you are a final fantasy 7 fan they have added so much in terms of story and character development for these characters that we grew up with that the grind is truly worth it ive learned so much about tifa that ive grown to love her more than i already do now being able to learn about sephiroth before everything went down has also boosted my appreciation for the character

like i said i get it it certainly likes to push the microtransactions in your face but you dont need them just give it a try because it truly scratches that final fantasy 7 itch

#####

i played this on mobile
this is an insult to gaming the final fantasy community and the worlds population as a whole

this is not a faithful adaptation this is not the real ff7 remake this is not fun and this should not be on steam

every chapter is either a short exploration level with a few unchallenging battles just a level with like three battles in a row or literally just dialogue after each of these you get sent back to the main menu and have to load into another chapter it was very tedious and just plain stupid
many locations are skipped and just replaced with a black screen and white text like wall market you cant explore basically all of sector 6 and 7 it is impossible for a new player to follow this abridged nightmare so they have to had played these games beforehand

the combat is just brainrotting you can just turn on the auto option and just sit there the ai does a better job playing than you do its like chess ai it thinks ahead why play the game when you dont need to play the game

and of course the predatory monetization ive read posts of people saying you dont need to pay or interact with the gacha god i hate that word mechanics which is just plain false i hit a roadblock during the wall market section where its just like two boss rushes it was impossible to progress without opening a ton of these shitty weapons and cosmetics and even then it was still impossible to progress and thats where i quit oh yeah good luck in a couple years when these servers shut down and you lose the money you stupidly spent on this garbage

please just dont play this wait play this for 5 minutes and leave a negative review

#####

i only recommend it because i like it but if you are not into gacha or ff7 then i would not recommend this as it is very grindy

#####

final fantasy because slaying dragons is a more acceptable life choice than adulting my only regret is that i cant cast cure on my reallife problems 1110 would trade my job for a chocobo ride again 

#####

i have been playing this since the launch pretty much took me a while to get into the groove as this is the first gacha game ive ever played i played on an older ipad air 2 and it can be laggy there syncing my account on the pc version worked when i used my steam account tied to my squeenix account but when i tried google it threw an error 

annoying pc specific things i noticed
one thing i notice on the pc version is the scroll is too sensitive the menus are more zoomed in than on the ipad so things i didnt have to scroll before i do now when i click on a weapon or materia to select it the game thinks i am doing a long press and brings up a preview window of the selected item instead of selecting it so i can enhance it that is actually quite annoying and i hope they fix it 

positive pc things i noticed
the better thing about the pc version no lag everything runs smoothly on ultra and my laptop is 6 yrs old also the commands in battle are tied to keys and its so much easier and faster to toggle the stance hit your limits and select your spells 

if you like ff7 and can handle the fomo if you are f2p its a pretty decent little distraction the big draw for me are the following
 the chibi characters are very cute
 the environments are surprisingly beautiful which kinda mirrors og ff7 with its prerendered backgrounds being more beautiful than the character models
 the costumes are very fun and they translate to your characters chibi model as well as the battle model
 the new story elements are interesting especially the character ones they are adding little bits and pieces of depth to the lore 
 the events can be silly and fun and i like that they bring that aspect of ff7 into this game as well

the mediocre
 chocobo expeditions are very lame but they are the way to get passive items and exp for characters 
 you just buy chocobos they dont level up so it feels impersonal and unlike chocobo breeding in the original
 the time commitment is very high so when you are not playing story moments it is best to grind while doing something else

the pain points 
 coop time for players to confirm to play or quitcontinue upon team wipe is 180 seconds long there are a lot of afkers in this game they need to at least cut that down to 90s if not 60s there is so much wasted time in full lobbies that someone has walked away from
 the recommended party button is very bad it is good to start as you learn and gather more and more weapons and materia but you need to build your team everytime you try some new fight unless you are very over powered for the fight then recco can be used for speed
 everything is rng i am not a gacha player but man i wish there was something you could have more direct control specifically materia gives you stat boosts creating a materia is rng for its strength its strength then determines the size of the stat boosts the stat boosts can be static bad or percent based good the type of boost is random then when you level up the materia a stat at random may increase or not thats just too many rngs for boosting your power level it would be nice to be able to use materials or other materia to give a materia a specific stat and slowly increment perhaps up to a max 
 cheap rng battles for dps races where the enemies attacks become a literal wall that kills your party before the timer for the battle is up why have a timer if your enemy will scale to an unbeatable level if you take too long 

verdict
i still recommend the game if you can just accept its limitations and you love ff7 focus on the outfits story and beautiful environments 


#####

i gotta say i really love this already a great mix of storys and great art work as well as graphic detail along with a amazinhg storyline  to the final fantasy series
i would recommend trying this game and never knock it

#####

final fantasy 7 gacha

#####

been playing from day 1 on mobile been having a lot of fun there is no shortage of things to do to a fault if youre a more casual player youll find yourself left in the dust pretty quickly in terms of power and events there is a constant grind but you can easily use the skip function to make it grind automatically on a node you do have to be present as it expects you to hit a couple of buttons after the node is ran through to do it again easy to have on the side while youre doing something else 
if you hate not being completely caught up 247 this game may not be for you unless you choose to dump actual hours a day for weeksmonths on end or if you plan on being a whaleleviathan yes this is a gacha game but not for characters you are given every character straight up and for free when future characters are added 
the gacha is for the weapons and costumes the only way to get costumes is to do x10 rolls so youll need enough crystals each time and fill out a stamp card 
aside from looking cool andor cute the costumes add some stats to the assigned character while the stats arent exactly game breaking they do help
if you dont care about the costumes or dont care about midmaxing then youll want to roll weapons it gives you a wishlist that gives the weapons of choice per character a much higher chance to appear as a 5 than other weapons you might have gotten as a 5 
so far it appears that only the costumes are limited the previous event weapons often get added to future wish lists of course this may have changed with the last event the ff9 crossover event as those weapons were not added to the christmas banner wishlists this is still a relatively new game so changes are bound to happen

if you care about meta characters
cloud aerith young sephiroth

also good luck trying to get a 5 materia of any kind youre gonna need it
all the materials youll need for upgrading leveling and creating are there ready for you along with some challenges to earn better rewards its just gonna be a grind you do have a limited amount of stamina each day but if you log in daily youll always get a stamina potion which you can collect
if youre like me who logs in daily since mobile launch day and dont do extreme grinds youll not only have the max on hand 99 youll also have hundreds of stamina potions in your gift boxes that have been sitting there since sept

it will also be expanding upon og ff7 scenes and add side stories all written by the ff7 staff apparently they plan on adding in scenes from the novels as well i could be misremembering but theyve already added an animated wallpaper for remakes traces of two pasts

if you have time and love ff7 this is a great game
if you love the story and characters and want to see more this is a great game as well

so far i wouldnt say that the gachas are needed to enjoy the story or events but they are if you want to enjoy the game and events to the fullest the amount of power your team needs skyrockets in events and even if you manage to pass the power suggestion you may find yourself outmatched anyways

overall expect a big grind

#####

as much i love all of the ff games this is a total cash grab stay away and play the ps5 games instead

#####

im just here for the cloud outfits

#####

final fantasy vii the first soldier was a much more exciting mobile game with unique gameplay that actually would have benefitted from a steamconsole release why square chose to bring this autoidle grindfest mashup of existing games to steam instead is a mystery

you now have three ways to experience final fantasy vii on the same storefront the original the remake and this freetoplay mess save yourself from ever crisis and backtoback advertisements assaulting your eyes every launch a nightmarish maze of menus and a story reduced to the piecemeal bare bones shell out a couple of bucks upfront to play the original or remake and skip watching square turn a beloved series entry into a predatory embarrassment

i betatested this game on mobile and put enough time in then  postlaunch to walk away disappointed its clear in porting this square and applibot havent given this the necessary qa either as of writing this the menu button to link your mobile account data to steam flashes a connecting message before doing nothing

diehard fans only benefit will be the additional story elements spoonfed in between the ads theyll also hold onto hope that this game survives long enough for before crisis to see a worldwide release of some kind 

i wouldnt count on it  see the 1year lifespan of first soldier for reference youtubing the new cutscenes later will be time better spent

#####

steam just wiped my review so let me shorten it down this game is a paywall trick giving you missions where everyone talks instead of fights which is weird because the game seems to be actionfocused fights are boring in the early stages but i imagine soon theyll hide behind those upgrades forcing you to drop money to proceed i wouldve spent 40 bucks on a proper remake of ff7 thats authentic to the original story even shorter this is not what the fans want square this is sad

#####

this is a gacha game it doesnt try to hide that from you only play if you are prepared for gacha mechanics the target audience are those with nothing better to do and are excited for further ff games and this acts as a hold hover it is obviously a cash grab but a well executed one

#####

pay to win draw gamereally shame

#####

ever crisis is a better remake than remake

just dont be a sucker and spend money on a gacha that will eventually shut down  be unplayable at some point making your money spent worthless just enjoy it for what it is the game gives you what you need to do what you need to do and its a pleasant recap on games that mayve never been played relax a bit dont dig int your wallet and enjoy the ride

#####

i dont know that ive ever fallen asleep playing a game as much as i have playing final fantasy vii ever crisis

its a gacha game set in the ff7 universe featuring snippets of story and borrowing elements from ff7 before crisis materia synthesis the cast from the ff7 universe is back and going nowhere fast because there is no real exploration to be had  only a treadmill set beneath a content drip while the game starts off decently strong it begins to fall apart as the monetization angle becomes increasingly clear youll have more fun replaying the real ff7 games  this will eventually bite the bullet once they fail to attract fresh blood

i initially picked it up for the ff7 nostalgia and because the gameplay footage looked pretty impressive i grabbed it through the steam store to see if it might drop my system utilization a bit i had at times used an android emulator to run it  if youve played this type of game before youll know why

the core gameplay loop like that of most freetoplay mobile games is pretty bad regardless whether youre willing to open up your wallet or youre looking to clear the content without spending be prepared to grind leveling up your entire cast of characters at once is only possible by clearing encounters in story content which cant be replayed for exp this leaves the rest of the content for exp farming and only the characters you take into battle will gain exp autopilot becomes the default to the point where folks dont pay attention to the game even in coop fights meanwhile communication with other players is limited to a set of canned responses so you cant tell the bonehead trying to clear coop content with you how to set up their loadout for success you will however probably find yourself toggling between ready states trying to get the last member of your coop party to start the battle

people do seem to like the costumes they release for the female characters though

#####

the only time i see people playing this is when tifa gets a new outfit and thats why im here too 1010 pls stop making mobile games canon

#####

its not bad honestly but my only gripe with it auto doesnt work like even though youre like over double the recommended power you still died because the ai decided it doesnt know how to use skills anymore

#####

typical gacha pay2win game it is obviously this game makes final fantasy fans feel dumb and entices them to spend money to unlock upgrades if you are a decent game developer with morality you should make things unlockable via game progression and not creating ingame mechanics that were locked behind paywall 

it is 2024 and people already learned about this kind of crap 

typing this review is a waste of time anyway as long as theyre making money and people with gacha modern online gambling addiction exist these kind of business practices will thrive i am just expressing my anger for this greedy capitalist arseholes if you are a smart person and highly value your time this game is not for you

i will just finish the young sephiroth story and uninstall the game afterwards

that is all

#####

pros 
tifa
aerith
yuffie
lucia

cons 
the game

#####

can understand the negative reviews especially on the pcsteam side saw a friend play thought the game had a good bit going for it and even during my struggles with this version i played it on phone while struggling with this  but this review isnt for the phone version

this pc version at least to me is crap i still havent gotten past the flarking title  download screen and yes thats 13 hours of trying to its been capped at 100 for the base game multiple times and just repeated connection timing out only this game internet no issues even uninstalling to try to do a fresh reinstall of the game even that took hours to uninstall i dont know what it is with the files not smart enough but if someone cant play your flarking game and even uninstalling it pops up with issues for something that should be as simple as a gacha aka works on mobile devices fine then theres clearly something wrong here

#####

this is a soul robber do not  download you are paying with way too much time of your life to basically unlock cut scenes from actual games it prays in our brain mechanics to keep you grinding

zero game development ethics
against our humanity
i played over a hundred hours just not waste the time already spent but as you progress it gets harder and harder to get to next story part even if you spend money

stay away


#####

i played ever crisis on the tablet before there it crashed all the time and the eternally long loading times were also annoying so i thought about switching to the pc that was a mistake for several reasons

 after downloading almost 25 gb it still has very long loading times for literally everything you go back in the menu loading you take a mission loading you start the mission loading you finish the mission loading you do anything at all loading this game has been adapted for the pc like the zebra is adapted to live on the south pole

 the cash store is predominant you get a popup after almost every mission which you only get rid of with 23 clicks

 i played for about 110 minutes when the game crashed apparently the save system isnt working either because i got back to the tutorial and all my data was gone

 i then did the only right thing and uninstalled it if the greedy people at se want my money they should try harder and at least make the game playable i mean at least a superminiscule effort would be nice

#####

it says ive played for 4 hours what a joke all that time was spent trying and failing to get it to work

#####

predatory design and incredibly confusing systems

#####

when you begin playing a gacha game you kind of have an expectation of what the game is going to be like that said some of them are far better than others this is due to the simple concept of being respectful of the players time

as an example well use marvel future fight when i played that game last you would do your mission or event and after you successfully completed it once you could then instantly complete it again when spending energy to do so this facilitates the grind in such a way where youre not constantly waiting for the entire fight to play out to get your meagre three items

in ever crisis you do the entirety of the fight every time it makes doing all of the various item grinds you have to do in order to level your equipment to progress in the story essentially very slightly truncated chibi retelling of the story of final fantasy 7 crisis core and first soldier one of the most boring slogs ive ever come across

the combat is essentially all automated you can do it manually if you want but i wouldnt really say youd get much more out of it doing so you do three waves of enemies and then your event is over in the story missions you get a couple of short scenes which can be nice for the nostalgia factor but failing that it doesnt really add much oomph to the experience

on the upside the game is fairly generous with how often it gives draw tickets and other various things to you i basically played as long as i could tolerate to try to see when the wall occurs for free to play players and while it was starting to feel tight after three chapters of both first soldier and ff7 crisis core currently only has 1 i never fully felt brick walled even at the mission i last left off at it felt like itd be doable with a bit of level grinding but i didnt really want to do so it wasnt that interesting it was a thing i had running in the background while watching things on youtube or netflix

i tested it because it was free and because it was a final fantasy thing so i wanted to see how it was

i will legitimately forget it even existed about ten seconds after it finishes uninstalling dont bother

#####

enjoyable free and no crashes that being said its gacha setup so of course progressing will probably eventually become a grind but really its a free game that gives us a new story as well as summarizes what already existed so really its awesome and you really shouldnt complain unless the game ever becomes just straight up unplayable or they start to completely bar progress with transactions which so far is definitely not the case 

also love that i pretty much get to play all the side stuff using zack

#####

this whole thing is just an excuse to sell png of tifa in bikinis to horny people

you know what happened to all of squares recent live service games especially the f2p ff titles that are closed one by one the only way this thing will turn into anything significant is if it becomes a preservation method for the ff7 oeuvre especially if they can represent stories that are no longer accessible such as before crisis in an easily accessible way only then will it be a valuable work otherwise this is definitely not a wellintentioned game

#####

its a legit grind but its fun and nostalgic as all heck

#####

another clunky gacha game pulling on nastalgia strings for easy  halfhearted attempt with a very irritating and messy menu system the gameplay itself is the only good part about it but youll have to pay out to keep stamina so you can play continuously this is why certain countries have banned the gacha system thankfully as well as the login everyday and topup purchase systems these predatory games are the center of controversy and should be done away with if you have to take advantage of addicts to make money you deserve to be shut down

#####

i cant stop playing this but that doesnt mean i enjoy the experience

looks nice runs well but its a shitty manipulative f2p game the only comfort i get is how i get away with not playing it as intended and sticking it to the intended premium business model fuck that

310 cant stop playing it

#####

i cant in good faith give this game a thumbs up  as ive played it since the september launch on mobile samsung s7 runs it fine on ultra its been noted that a portion of the fan base was expecting this to be like ff15s mobile version with highresolution backgrounds while all the characters and enemies are chibi versions  it is not that it is a daily grind of the same handful of battles over and over once youve completed the few hours of story it includes so far

storywise there are 3 chapters  final fantasy 7 is a retelling that has so far cut out just as much as theyve made up or taken inspiration from the remake for  i feel it leaves out way too much to actually retell the original story of final fantasy 7 while just straight up making up new content thats neither in the original nor the remake  which is fine as long as theres actual content to play   ff7 is at the time of writing this to the best of my knowledge not to junon harbor yet in the storyline  crisis core also cutting out the bulk of the story and barely even giving you the highlights will leave you confused as to whats going on from the short chapter available for that so far  you would be far better just buying the crisis core remake available now if you want any chance of understanding that story  i dont believe thats been updated beyond the opening chapters of getting to know zack and his first major outing to wutai  again if you know the original story this isnt going to be the remake you want as it barely gives you the highlights

the third chapter entirely new content based on the exploits of 3 shinra employees glenn lucia and matt and later on young sephiroth basically gives you the story of a group of people making their living working for soldier with the usual blunders and antics of a final fantasy story until they come up to the issue of being replaced with super soldiers like sephiroth with all the expected elements of an after school special

as this is a gatchastyle game the equipment and loadouts are handled differently than games more faithful to the rpg series of the past  you will quickly find yourself repeating the same 3 fights over and over in an effort to get materials to upgrade weapons and materia  you get 3 premium quests a day to gather slightly more upgrade items than normal or one of the regular ways of actually getting character memories to upgrade your characters

weapons rely on the use of weapon parts to upgrade them through five levels of rarity which is where the payments come in for things like gems to do weapon draws  they have so far been extremely charitable in events with the weapons earned during events making it a slog but doable to upgrade them fully to overboost 20  however doing that with banner  paid only draws gets very expensive very quickly if you want those weapons upgraded to their overboost stats  they do give a nice amount of free gems but if youre going to be free to play you should watch for draws of weapons that help with several big battles or save gems for a draw you might really want such as the character costumes

the draws themselves have a forgiveness mechanic called stamps so every time you draw 10 weapons on a banner 3000 gems you get stamps to earn items alongside the weapons you draw  this usually includes outfits and weapons at the end of every line on the card  personally since september ive gotten 5x stamps once and 2x stamps 4 times the rest have all been 1 pulls  so if youre using free gems youll burn through them quickly or if youre paying it can get quite costly to finish the banners before they leave  

leveling up works by gaining exp as with most rpgs but to power up your characters you require memories  you can gain a handful of these every day with your 3 premium missions and these memories are the main way of raising your power levels and upgrading characters limit breaks and skills as well as your summons limit breaks and skills with the memories being slightly easier to earn for summons as you can always access their battles in solo and they are occasionally offered as a coop battle

once youve completed the available content the game becomes mostly a slog through the same battles over and over again in an effort to grind materials to make new materia upgrade weapons or get memories to power up your characters and summons  i will say they do keep constant events on but my experience for the most part since launch has been far fewer parts where you controlmove a character around a level and mainly just repeating fights over and over where you eventually just start letting it run them on auto instead of manual  its a mobile gatcha game its whats to be expected  

if youre looking for a few hours of entertainment or something to play while maybe dropping the kids off at the pool while at work im sure this would be great for the steam deck or something  if youre looking to get the story of the original final fantasy 7 or of crisis core youre going to be disappointed with whats offered here  i personally think its a fun little time waster and have spent only about five dollars on the game  the cons to me are the insane pricing of digital goods the bugs in the game every update and the weird compensations theyll give with no rhyme or reason for why one messed up banner gets 1k gems while another gets people who participated 30k gems  the coop issues of players never clicking start battle or being held hostage for 3 minutes when the party dies and someone was on auto and walked away still get plenty of complaints on the discord and forums  the stories of ff7 and crisis core leave out huge chunks of context and really do depend on you having played the actual games to understand whats going on  and the push to steam right at the holidays with their pricing on everything really just feels like its aimed at getting kids and adults steam gift cards spent in a game that again may not exist in a few years  square enix is horrible for making mobile games that are nothing more than cash sinks from new kingdoms which slapped fans in the face and catered to whales to first soldier which died before even hitting the oneyear mark  as with most gatcha mobile games there is no guarantee youll still have access to or be able to play any of this game and digital goods bought within should square enix decide this game isnt bringing in enough cash and shutter it  

maybe if its out long enough to finish any of the stories its trying to tell or if they make their pricing at least slightly reasonable ill happily change my review to a thumbs up  for now its a moderately buggy mobile game that exists only to be a money pit and whilst yes it has enough events and enough to do to keep someone busy for an hour or two its not the game to turn to if you want the story of ff7 or crisis core retold through bare glimpses into the original stories  their third chapter the whole new story theyre telling is interesting enough to keep me playing for the time being  the coop battles can be fun when not ruined by afks or people less than half the power requirement trying to be carried through the stages  the upgrade mechanics are all gatchalike but doable for free to play making most of the content accessible to f2p and only some smaller events such as timed dungeon runs or raid boss fights really only being for the whales investing in this game to get their power levels high enough

ill still have it both on pc and mobile as im sure itll be handy to run in the background on pc while im playing other games to deal with the grind but if youre looking for the traditional final fantasy style jrpg thats fully playable as is this isnt it

#####

yet another gatcha mobile game ported to pc

#####

the game is fine and i am very glad it is available on steam because it is unplayable on my phone however i find the menus to be incredibly cumbersome so cumbersome in fact that i wouldnt know what to spend money on even if i wanted to its incredibly difficult to just access the game or collect ingame gifts and currency among other things its super confusing if the menus and layout could be dramatically simplified i would be way quicker to recommend this game

#####

h1 wasted potentialh1

final fantasy vii ever crisis would have been fantastic if it was at all what square was originally teasing it to be  a more faithful remake of final fantasy vii integrated with the stories of its numerous spinoffs unfortunately ever crisis is just an episodic heavily abridged retelling of the highlights of the original game and these spinoffs

ever crisis is a mobile gacha game first and foremost which is endlessly disappointing it currently only covers the same amount of ff vii as remake  up until the end of midgar  but cuts out essentially everything from the original that isnt a boss fight or the lead up to a boss fight

an actual remake in the style of ever crisis  with updated overworld chibi models battle models taken from ff vii remake and overworld character art  would be great this isnt that unfortunately

if youve been waiting for final fantasy vii to be reduced to a grindy gacha mess this is the game for you for everyone else though just play the original game

#####

game puts a lot of sales offers that are only available for a day which is a death sentence for f2p and those paying money unwilling to spend beyond their budget
most events actually demand people to spend spend and spend instead of depending on our ability to play the game good
why the frick do i need 6 copies of the same weapon just to make it relevant by the time me a free to play get 6 copies of that weapon the event is over 3 months later
the character specific weapon pieces are so scarce they are basically useless on a positive note these pieces give the game a lot of potential fixing the issue of not depending excessively on spending and attempting to get the weapons through the gacha or it would if these pieces werent so few as i stated a while ago
no quitretire button on coop is there any reason to stay when the team i get is crappy im not spending any gems just to have a second chance no one is this is a design flaw so stupid it feels intentional

#####



#####

i sure love getting hit by 20 fullscreen ads about the different things i should buy as soon as i open the game thats the final fantasy experience we all wanted

the idea of a compilation of the various ff7 side content is great but i wish this was a normal game instead of the mobile gacha slop that it is the gameplay is nonexistent and if you dont mind gacha games just play this on your phone

#####

stories made no sense while key events are in everything within each event are filled with nonsense compared to the main games

also the grind is real even korean mmorpgs have less grind then this

only plus i can think of about  this game is their custom costumes for the characters thats it

tldr
gameplay is trash
story is trash
3d models in battles looks nice

#####

modern beautifully rendered graphics for cut scenes is about all this has going for it this game should be advertised as a mobile gacha ported to pc especially given the main ui and that it offers autoplay features basically eliminating you as a player of the game i wondered why this was free to play makes sense in hindsight

need to fix account liking until it does i cant play this on steam when i really want to

#####

its a mobile game plain and simple it lacks substance and is just a pointless grind fest
as a final fantasy fan i wanted to try and enjoy this but in truth this will only appeal to people with low standards for their games and people who dont know better

just skip it and enjoy the 7 remake for what it is you will be happier

#####

we lost mobius ff for this

#####

nothing but a cash grabber
this game is a waste of time trust me

they release skins for aerith and tifa making both go seminude just to feed all the coomers around the world

game has a automode feature which makes you lazy to the point you dont even need to play the game at all neither make strategy etc etc

dont get me wrong i really love final fantasy as a whole but i hate this game with passion specially to the fact this game is also the reason dissidia final fantasy opera omnia dffoo got the eos recently dffoo is going to die march 1st 2024

dffoo was the best mobile game square enix ever released and i trully hope this game die faster than dffoo
#bringdffooback

#####

enjoyable specifically if you are already a final fantasy fan

#####

moved over to the steam version and linked my original account without a hitch the game already looked fantastic visually on mobile the higher resolution and framerates do the graphics true justice screen transitions and load times are much improved i have not gotten used to the keyboard shortcuts yet but they seem like they could be helpful my only gripe so far is the excessive use of screen shaking effects on the larger screen which tend to fatigue my eyeballs at accelerated battle speed in terms of game performance audio and visual fidelity this is an outstanding version

as far as gameplay is concerned you are in for the full gacha experience if you like grinding for mats and gambling on items then get to it there have been a lot of banners to roll on so far and plenty of currency to spend the developer tends to give out a lot here and there the most promising features of this game are the higher difficulty events and competitive ranking levels figuring out proper builds fight timing and efficient dungeon scoring has me really excited for the future of this game 

story quests are a reimagining of ff7 characters and ips i expect that returning ff7 veterans will enjoy the story content more than newcomers

#####

i really enjoy this game im hooked on this i cant get enough the combat is amazing i love my abilities i get to play with my friends and kick ass as a team theres so many amazing things to do as well i cant wait to play more

#####

gacha mobile game ported to pc

all you have to do to win is just click auto and let it run this is gaming in 2023 everybody


why are companies so quick to port mobile games to pc dude with like no new content

#####

this is just a gambling simulator stay far away from it

#####

this is crazy and this game did very well running

i never knew that the final fantasy 7 mobile game would come on the pc version now that we absolutely can enjoy the nostalgic gameplay and immersive story of final fantasy 7 mobile game by opening up the game for the wider audience who may not have access to a mobile device its also a great opportunity for having this in for the franchise to relive their favorite game on a new platform if needed or want to


#####

the only good thing about this game is the tifa profile background i got from the points shop after letting the game run for 2 hours

#####

played for sephiroth

#####

i totally recommend this game especially with friends first of all i want to say that it has most of the story from the rebirth the characters are adorable and this game is a grindfest but in a good way because every weapon materia and beyond has some sort of use give it a try

#####

bullshit gacha

#####

my first ever review on steam and all i can say is that game is pretty mid not sure how it is on mobile but every either everyday or every other day this game has an update its never a small update either its always 2 gigs really square this game needs to update every freakin day

#####

ive probably played over hundreds of hours on this and the phone and i can just warn to stay away
predatory cash grabs a chopped up story generous on the free crystals however not generous on the drop rates
is it fun maybe a little if you really have no other games to play with
is it worth it not at all i only play this game at this point because i have become incredibly lucky with my account rng as f2p
is it a grindfest the materia system alone is the worst grind and to spend countless hours trying to get a materia with 24 of the proper stats let alone try to get a good rarity is nearly impossible

tldr this is a gacha that is meant to play on your nostalgia but falls short in so many ways except the digging a hole in your pocket money stay away

#####

i am a huge fan of final fantasy and ffvii and all of its spin offs and accompanying games and the remake of which ive only played part one so far but i cannot recommend this game to anyone i have and do play gachas and while i do think that they are problematic in the way that they weaponize progression to leverage money from players my review here has nothing to do with any of the money elements of the game

interface is clunky and not smooth menus and subsections of these menus are annoying to navigate also the whole ui build of the game feels like its at least 10 years old in design the graphics are nice and polished but the way that you interact with the game and control it is unsatisfying and doesnt at all impress

content is awful at explaining what i need to do to progress  even to the effect that i dont even get a good idea of what i should buy to progress if i want to do it faster  and have to slog through other guides just to understand the systems in game for how to build weaponscharactersmateria to make the most of what i do have the learning curve is steep if you just want to come in and try to see if you want to invest the amount of time in this game to get to the point where you can fully experience all the game has to offer 

the ai for auto battle is not good you can have curecuracuraga materia and other healing abilities on each character in battle and despite their atb guages having the needed energy and the curing options being available there are plenty of times that the ai refuses to heal the characters despite their hp being critically low leading to defeat now either the ai is bad or the ai is purposely causing you to lose fight which your battle power clearly surpasses for the purpose of trying to make you spend premium currency on a continuation to drain you of premium currency in order to tempt you into spending real money to get more i shouldnt have to do a continuation on battles that my party is fully equipped for and exceeds the recommendation for battle power by over 10000 points

i cannot in good conscience recommend this game which looks and feels like it was developed and made 10 years ago needs significant developer attention to address how unhelpful the game is to new players trying to navigate the multiple systems and what is needed to progress and either has exploitative battle ai or just crappy battle ai 

if you want to play a strange amalgamation of classic ffvii ffvii crisis core and ffvii first soldier where you have to hop back and forth between these different game stories in order to open up more story in another and which abandons much of what made those games fun and interesting all i can say is the only way i would play this game is purely f2p because it doesnt deserve my money for the experience it gives in return

edit addition i forgot  the way this game updates is also weird and annoying you can enter the game to find an update which you download and this game does a thing where it gives you choices between what i imagine is a minimum data needed to use the game and a full download which i suppose is for aesthetics and i always choose the full download to hopefully minimize the amount of times im made to download more things so you update and enter the game then youre playing and doing whatever youre doing to progress or enjoy the game only when you try to go from a menu into battle or into a sub menu and bam you gotta go back to the title screen and download something else i admit that the updatespatches are typically very small and download quickly but they also seem to be constantly happening i wouldnt be as annoyed by this if i hadnt been playing daily for at least the last 2 weeks of which i only entered the game once without there being an update to download only for a short time later my play get interrupted by a patch or another update and then for there to be yet another update the very next time i load the game up is this an indication of there being no beta testing before updatespatches and so the devs have to hot fix things multiple times a day to me it seems that way

#####

final fantasy vii ever crisis is a mobile gacha game which unfortunately means
list
    a lot of the gameplay can be automated
    a lot of the game is timegated
    some parts of the game are paytowin 
list

but its still a bfinal fantasy viib game which means fans of final fantasy vii can still appreciate parts of the game

#####

its alright

#sephirothshouldmakelovewithred13inff7rebirth

#####

its a gacha game that pretty much begs you to buy stuff every time you try to do something you mise as well spend that money they try to get you to spend on this game on the actual ffvii and experience the game how it should be experienced

#####

another gacha game for me to spend money on but its ffvii so now ill spend 10x as much

#####

ever crisis is a gacha version of the final fantasy vii universe the idea is to see events in manageable tale chunks from crisis core the first soldier and final fantasy vii it is not a remake of any of the final fantasy vii propertiesdespite different forms of marketing concealing this fact it is made from the ground up to play like a mobile game a cutscene plays you select a task from a menu and then an autobattle begins repeat after rinsing that is the fundamental framework although some sections are expanded to the point that they resemble dungeons they are primarily flavorenhancing zones that span only two or three screens

#####

i love it so much

#####

gacha fantasy financial crisis

#####

its a fun little game  i played the mobile version and its nice to be able to do it on pc now too  i like the stories and the fact that its free and you dont have to spend money to play it is nice  people complaining about it being a gotcha game duh its a mobile game dont spend money easy

#####

if you like ff7 you will probably like this game i have not spent any money and have grinded up to the top 1000 players the first soldier story is very interesting with awesome new characters and playing through the og game and crisis core in a new way has been super fun the game is grindy like any rpg but it is definitely rewarding and compensates you fairly for your time

#####

the tutorial was kind of cool but as soon as i finished that i was berated with a dozen different popup screens that plague so many games today and altf4d out of there go play the originals

#####

i dunno im a sucker for ff7 and this scratches a good itch

#####

beep beep get outta the way tifas milk truck is arriving to keep this gacha cash grab alive until squeenix inevitably shuts it down

#####

straight port 
cutscenes are just as bad as before aa is poor   bad backgrounds and controls suck
the game at times looks as bad as the og and 1000x worse then the og modded

the ui is so manipulative it should be illegal it take hours to navigate anything and free rewards are hidden behind 10000 secret menus


generic gacha game

all p2w games are bad but genshin shows that they dont have to be completely terrible
dispite hating genshin for its unfair and manipulative gacha  i see effort there

there is no effort here

models and cutscences just lifted from the remake and even some from crisis core



who is this for gacha fans have better games  ff fans dont want a mobile gacha game and the general audience would rather be on buldurs gate 3 7 super fans hate everything that isnt the original game 

they advertise this as something to rival the  remake trilogy   but thats not true at all

 also just in case if you didnt know there is no va and  the like 5  line here or there that are voiced are  jp only
i am done i have had enough already

#####

this is not a game there is no gameplay only menus and opportunity to spend your cash

#####

the game doesnt even load past the tittle screen

#####

an error has occurred
returning to the title screen

#####

i am addicted to this game
i was using bluestacks so i could play it on pc and now with steam there is a big difference in performance and i love it

#####

not good  i really wanted to like this game but its not even a good pay to win  great graphics  meh version of the story  try it i know people who like it a lot but just not for me

#####

based on mobile experience

early into the game power level wasnt as much of a problem and events were properly scaled

however after a few events the scaling has grown out of control and unless you spend a little money on this game u wont be able to keep up

the combat is decent and the graphics are just fine but i honestly wish this game was more like ffrk due to its more complex version of atb battling


#####

its a gacha game so its inherently flawed but if you like ff7 its kinda nice ur missing out on 100 gems a day tho if you dont play it on mobile and watch the ads

#####

while the mobile version of the game was plagued with heavy battery draw and limited to 30 fps the steam version fixes all of these issues and adds a cinematic smoothness and aaafeel to a title that many would argue took itself a little too seriously

i have a strong feeling this was the way it was meant to be enjoyed and it certainly moves the needle from passably enjoyable to a surprisingly thorough game experienceespecially for a gacha game

810 for ftp 910 for ptw

verdict highly recommended

#####

the pay to win factor is there but its not necessary to enjoy the stories each retelling is truncated of course but theyre getting the general gist of the ffvii lore across for new fans and old players both  the graphics in cs and fighting are top notch i just wish there was some japanese voice acting going on especially in scenes with sephiroth and genesis  all of the leveling mechanisms take time to figure out but once you get it its easy  theyre fixed a few things that used to irritate me so thats nice and it runs so much better on pc than on my phone ungodly loading times before and overheating  i enjoy the events but a lot of them cant really be completed unless youre high leveled which is irritating as i finally hot my max power of 40k for a party which was my next goal for the 2nd part of the christmas event after the event ended sadly  i do think the draw system is too expensive as are the crystal packs  i had spent every crystal id saved up since launch and still was going to have to drop about 50 just to get the kuja outfit for sephiroth which sadly i didnt get because as i went to purchase the pack the game moved to the next day and the ffix crossover event was over  so either the odds on the chocobo cards need to be evened out for stamps or the price of 10 draws needs to come down from 3k crystals  however everything else about the game ive liked  just the draw stuff is really my only big complaint  i think its a must play prior to ffvii rebirth especially if you havent played the original ps ffvii or crisis core  getting to learn the story about glen and sephiroth when he was young is really the reason im playing it because ive a feeling that knowledge is going to come in handy in the next ffvii game

#####

one of the main things in this game is coop dungeons no one does them so you can never do them therefore you cant unlock many things other than that its ok

#####

this games quest design indicates that it wasnt supposed to be a gacha but it was forced to be one it is significantly worse than all other free games like genshin and honkai that are available on pc and mobile
there isnt enough content in it for it to justify being a gacha game ive finished all story contents in about 80 hours that includes all the grinding for exp points fighting the same enemies everyday for weapon upgrade materials got boring in weeks i cant imagine anyone playing this game for years you fight same enemies hundreds of times that re appear in different colors and different elemental weakness over and over

also giving us the story in bits and pieces ruins the enjoyment they should have released the story in chronological order instead of whatever the fck this is i cant even enjoy the monthly released new stories from boss rushes because they require certain power level to clear it and get the full story once you miss it its gone forever if youre free to play player its painfully boring to play thats why coop lobbies are empty all the time no one plays coop in a game thats not free to play friendly

#####

i love ff7 but this shit is awful 

ff7 should have nothing to do with gacha

#####

not recommended because its a gacha and gacha is crime its pretty well executed as gacha goes but i failed to get into this game twice on mobile because it contains the full set of gacha mechanics 400 popups when you open the game constant limited time offers in the cash store stamina limiting how much you can play dozens of different currencies that are metered out slowly by the game unless you pay up etc 

supposedly the best way to grind rewards is via the coop mode but if you want to play low power coop or you want to play coop more than 2 days after the weekly reset good luck in the last 2 days i have not successfully found a single coop partner via random match so that mode is basically unplayable

gacha aside its ff7 crisis core and the first soldier 20 events set after the shortlived battle royale game if you just want to see what happens in the first soldier be prepared to grind through the other two games in episodes while you slowly eke out enough crafting material to become strong enough to make progress in th e third game the games few story scenes are there just to hold the repetitive combat complete with autoplay and fast forward together im a ff7 stan so im forcing myself through it but i am not having a good time

#####

dont expect a good final fantasy 7 experience from this game its your typical gotcha game with collect it all marathon casino and the typical terrible menu system that pulls out of the fun and into a online cash shop theres better things you can do with your time like going outside and watching grass grow or better yet cut it makes some money and get the real deal

#####

i was trying to play it for the new story parts as i love ffvii but i just cant do it anymore lol the gacha crap does my head in i would of loved this style with the original games turn based combat and no episode crap just as i am getting into the story the episode finishes and back to a menu to pick another braking immersion i cant recommend it and i am going to just youtube the story lol

#####

не тратьте электричество игра будет пытаться продавать вам оружие персонажей по 40 это просто не мыслимо

#####

gacha mobile garbage that is heavily monetised i hate it

#####

game is not starting

#####

redownloaded 3 times atleast each time it just tries connecting and then gives up i guess leaving me to click and create blue circles to the main theme tune

#####

psa you  dont  have  to  spend  money  if  you  dont  want  to

seriously why are people always surprised that gacha games have microtransactions ignore them and let the whales keep funding the game so you can play for nothing 

ive played since day one on my tablet and ive found it to be one of the most f2pfriendly games around 

 events are regular and with farming offer tons of items you need for improvement for free 
 you get free stat stick weapons with surprising regularity which you can get to ob10 with zero monetary spend
 somehow you get so many stamina tonics youll be hardpressed to run out of stamina unless youre playing for 5 hours a day 
 there are strong builds usually gated behind the pulls but youre not beholden to them most of the content is viable with a little planning and understanding of building teams 
 remember you dont have to pull on every banner youll get plenty of crystals over time so save them up and when you see a banner you absolutely must have go happy much bigger dopamine hit than stressing over pulls as soon as you have 3k crystals

ultimately like any mobilegacha game ff7ec is a game that demands investment not of money but time and a lot of it its deep  there are a lot of systems in play and they can seem a little obtuse at times but once you get the hang of the daily routine and set yourself milestones it becomes a great game you can have on in the background more or less afk farming i play a lot when watching the football for example 

for anyone expecting a normal rpg this isnt for you but thats fine some games are your cup of tea others arent just go play the original remake pixel remasters or chrono trigger and have fun instead of stressing over this for the rest of you glhf

#####

wouldnt even go past the download patches for me spend 45 hours just trying to install the game for it to not work

#####

i want to love this because the core concept is good and its a ffvii game but sadly no i just cant it fails on so many points

 gameplay 
its ok you get shown a cut scene and then do a few battles sometimes you get to run around between battles and collect a few chest along the way the combat is actually fun the core structure of the combat system is actually something that could become fun strategic and involved but sadly it falls short that it either real easy or surprisingly hard when the game wants you to go to the shop so you can pay to win 

 controls  
no native controller support i mean wtf i know this is a phone game but as far as i understand it allot of ppl plays with controller addon on on their phone now a days so its becoming a standard feature and this is squareenix we are talking about the company that made whole mmos around controller and made it work impressively well that this at least was not rdy for the steam release is baffling me
i used steams controller feature to make it sort of work but then we have the pointer that is so blue that it easily disappears into the background
if you dont mind playing without controller you just use your mouse and pretend its a touchscreen 

 the gotcha 
its sickening i know you want me to pay 20eu a day to play your game but please can you stop forcing it down my trout every time i log in i know the shop and gotcha are there you showed me once thats enough you dont need forcibly show me multiple times every day

 conclusion  final thought 
its sad that this had to become a greedy cash grab you had a good idea here squareenix i know allot of ppl would have loved a ffvii compilation game made in a similar fashion also a good idea to make it so that ppl how started playing the remake can catch up on the original timeline if only you would have made it a normal single player experience many of us would have payed full price for a game like that instead of this cash grab gotcha bullshit 
i will be playing it a little bit more just because i love ffvii but i dont think i will be able to force myself trough this for that much longer

 recommendation 
if you like phone  gotcha games and throwing money away on useless trinkets then this might be for you if you are like me a hardcore jrpg and ff fan make your self a favor and stay away this game is not for you
go play the original and emulate the ones that has not been released on pc you will be much happier for it

#####

its a gacha game and my luck is trash

#####

its fine honestly kind of a time killer and sucks at times but every once in a while something really nice comes out also nice costumes for both male and female characters like nicenice

#####

super awesome reliving the days of earlier ff7 and more

#####

keep getting stuck on loading screen cant even try first mission

#####

if you dont mind constant microtransaction messages popping up then have at it i much rather play the jrpg or the og ff7 rather than this hot mess of a gotcha

#####

i cannot even get the game to install without crashing at 100 because of nonexistent network issues se if youre gonna port a game from mobile to pc make sure the damned thing actually works
