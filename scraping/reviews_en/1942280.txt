i uninstalled the game  it was the only way i could stop playing  ill be back in two weeks

bwhat is itb
you control a potato that autoattacks with up to 6 weapons the only controls are movement at the end of each survival wave usually lasts about 50 seconds you enter a shop to buy various items and weapons to get stronger

bsummaryb
 fun and challenging
 dopamine inducing and addicting
 cheap and no macroscamsactions
 many different characters that feel unique and vary the gameplay
 no story and lacking things to unlock such as different maps

bhow does it compare to vampire survivorsb
 more challenging
 characters feel much more unique from each other
 the intensity is broken up by shops at the end of each wave
 some people might prefer the more casual nature of vampire survivors
 beyond more characters and the 5 other difficulty levels theres not much not unlock unlike new maps and relics as in vampire survivors

disclaimer im one of the developers of godot engine the game engine used by brotato which is how i first heard of the game but im also a fan of indie games and ive been playing brotato for my own enjoyment so my review is from a players perspective

i love it

its just so much fun ive played a bit of vampire survivors the game which seemed to restart the craze around this kind of arcade action games now dubbed horde shooters or reverse bullet hell games
brotato seems heavily inspired from this genre but refines it a ton on all aspects graphics sound design gameplay variety and replayability ive played it over 15 hours in just a week and im itching to play more

my favorite feature is the insane variety that youll find in what kind of build you can play like most such games you start with a basic set of stats which you can influence both positively and negatively with levelup upgrades eg 5 damage 3 speed etc and weapons and passive items that you buy between runs with the collected materials you can equip up to 6 weapons aside from a couple exceptions and combine them in ways that make sense for the build youre going for and the items you buy or acquire influence your stats passively theres a significant impact of randomness here but its well designed  the game learns from your start weapon and the items and weapons you acquire early on and tends to pick random purchase options that make sense to develop you build eg if you start with a medical weapon youll be proposed more medical weapons early on and also other types but your starting one  or the type of other weapons youll acquire  weighs more in the balance and helps you focus on one or more types if you want

then what makes the game absolutely amazing to me is the variety found in the characters each character that you can choose has a set of bonuses and penalties that affect the base stats and guide your build heavily in some direction

some examples
 crazy 100 range with precise weapons knives etc 25 attack speed starts with an extra knife 30 dodge 10 engineering 10 ranged damage you can imagine what kind of build is favored stack fast precise weapons with high critical chance like knives and carve your way through the waves while making sure not to get hit as you definitely wont dodge youll probably want some life steal 
 onearmed 200 attack speed all damage modifications are increased by 100 you can only equip one weapon at a time so youre super fast to hit you can make a build that will reach insane amounts of damage per second but youll be limited to a single weapon
 masochist in short starts with 100 damage does only 1 damage per hit but gets 5 damage whenever they get hit so after 20 hits youre at 0 damage modifier and everything after that is pure damage increase goodness so you have to balance hurling yourselves on enemies to get hit but without reaching 0 hp  and your base stats help you with that thanks to 10 max hp 3 armor and 25 hp regeneration

that should give a hint of whats possible  the game as of early access in oct 2022 has a whopping 30 characters all very different from each other and leading to very varied builds you start with maybe 6 characters and unlock the rest while winning on various levels of difficulty with various characters

long story short its amazing pick it up

#####

i bought this game 61 hours ago and i have 61 hours played

#####

bought 230 dollars worth of steam games on a sale including cyberpunk hogwarts legacy elden ring yet i booted this up while those were installing and proceeded to play this for 8 hours straight

#####

after 3 hours i realised that i can combine similar weapons

#####

felt like a classic flash game

#####

it is like a fun mobile game so unlike any mobile game

#####

#####

very nice roguelike that also works very well on the steam deck
compared to vampire survivors this game is very difficult you dont get permanent upgrades after every run
graphics and music are very good and you can also save your runs and resume them later there are also plenty of characters to choose from making every run different
the 5eur is well worth it

#####

this game is more challenging than i expected but im also not an elite gamer  i paid 5 for this game that might be the best pricevalue ratio on steam  i see myself playing many many hours over the next few months

#####

best 5 euro ive ever spent on steam i got 176 hours of gameplay out of it

the nice thing about the game is that its very casual and complex at the same time

casual because one run takes 30 mins at most and you can pausequit the game and continue that same run from the moment you paused at any time i was literally playing brotato while waiting for loading screensmatch ques in other games 

indepth because if you want to beat the game on max difficulty 5 and with every of the 30 characters you actually have to learn a bit of mechanics and how the ingame stats workyou have to minmax

#####

its a potato it has guns

#####

this game seems super simple on the surface but as you spend more time in it youll come to realise that its actually a very welldesigned shmup  brotato boasts 49 unique characters and each of them demands that the player adopts a unique playstyle to fully realise their potential

it took me 87 hours to beat every character in the game on danger 5  its an addictive grind as the character selection screen will colour the background of each character with the corresponding colour of the highest danger level youve completed with said character  the goal of painting the character screen gold becomes quickly apparent as you start to knock over your favourite characters onebyone

fast forward a week or two now youve completed danger 5 on about 1520 characters and as you look at the remainder of the roster you start to wonder just how in the hell youre going to complete a run on any of them  this is honestly why i had so much fun playing this game the characters i wasnt comfortable with truly challenged me and had me on the edge of my seat as i beat the final boss wave to ultimately paint them gold on the character screen

this game is best played with a controller if you have one  id happily recommend this game to any completionist looking for a fun and unique challenge

#####

doesnt look incredible but its incredible much more depth than your typical vampire survivors clone could probably play it forever with more updates

#####

brotato is a one of a kind game i find it so hard to explain this game to friends and others because its so much more if youre that kind of person to look at the top of a review to see what people are saying then this section is for you here

if you enjoy games such as  vampire survivors the binding of isaac etc there is a good chance youll enjoy brotato 

and if you havent played the games i listen above in short due to brotatos cheap pricing and the amount of funhours you can get out of it its a no brainer to pick it up at least to try



and a small plug if you need help with any character or the game overall ive written an entire guide just for beginners and achievements hunters here on steam check it out here 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2896126855

back to the actual review of the game

brotato is naturally a difficult game although can be made a ton easier or harder in the settings with easier difficulties and mods which as of writing are becoming more and more common with so much more content 

the combat is incredibly fluid and never gets boring with the massive array of weapons allmost of which can be used with at least 1 different characters to bring out the best combinations and have the best time with each character leading you to want to try out as many characters and possible to see what will work

speaking of characters there are so many to choose from that itll keep you occupied for hours on hours simply unlocking each one then playing it and you can replay each character on a harder difficulty which will change the way you have to play dramatically

there is also so much that goes into the items and stats of brotato and everything can quite easily be understood and explained to help you get a grip of the game from the very start

for my final point i must say that a lot of this game is trial and error even when following a guide of the best strategy due to the random nature of the game you will have a completely different experience to others you can follow a brief outline but youll need to learn and adapt based on your circumstance during a wave which can feel very rewarding when you turn a game around in your favor

all in all as said above due to the cheap pricing of the game and the countless hours of strategy and fun i really think this is a nobrainer to pick up you can always give it a try and refund it if its not your cup o tea

thanks for reading and i hope this helps  3

runs on a potato is a potato can be played by potato

#####

b h1for every like this review gets i will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaiseh1 b

#####

great game but could use some accessibility optionsfeatures like colorblind mode i find it annoying that my runs keep getting ended by enemies that shoot barely visible projectiles

#####

i played the demo for over 200 hours and was one of the beta testers for this version

issues with overpowered builds from the demo were fixed and there are a lot of viable builds and playstyles now the difficulty is a bit on the higher end so be prepared to loose a lot at the beginning but its never unfair and there is nearly always something you can do about bad situations

#####

spend 1000 on a nice gpu buy a dozen or so aaa games to try it out end up playing a game about potatoes that could run on a potato more gpu looking at me like seriously

i dont know what you call this genre bullet hell action rogue like if you like vampire survivors then this is well worth the 5 you can probably scrounge up in your couch check your car for some change if that doesnt work how do you not have 5

you can quite literally literally in the classic sense before it literally took on the definition of figuratively literally play this game with one hand ive discovered these games are great if you have some cardio equipment near by and a nintendo joy con handy youll get so distracted that youll end up going well past your intended goal and earn that bag of doritos thatll negate the entire session

#####

this game reminds me a bit of binding of isaac and vampire survivors

but the major difference between the three games is that this one has basically no variety in the scenery

the only thing that changes is the monsters and your survival strategy

vampire survivors is better for scenery and a better variety of weapons although the weapons part is debatable but inferior by far in how you can upgrade yourself

if this game introduced maps such as different maps every wave walls pits so on this game would be so much better

it also lacks in achievements though thats more of a goal

as it is i find myself quitting the game after a round or two because i find it getting repetitive but coming back because its also interesting to see how i can upgrade myself



#####

one word addiction i love a good and simple ui and effective feel of killing bunch of enemies looks simple but has a deeper game designfeel then it looks very much liking it since the minute i bought it definitely recommend

#####

inspired by vampire survivors but with its own twists on the formula bbrotatob is one of the finest games to come out in the recent autoshooter games trend despite being in early access it feels more feature complete than many final released games with many characters to unlock dozens of different items to choose between waves accessibility options a mode to play it like a twin stick shooter and much more its an excellent value for the money

the greatest achievement of this game to me its that it strikes a very bgood balance between the dopamine rush feel and a highly challenging gameb with several extra difficulty options to unlock brotato is certainly one of the hardest games in this new wave of autoshooters and i love that 

theres also a nice dose of brisk iversusi rewardb that adds a lot of strategy and theorycrafting to the mix constantly demanding from the player to choose whats the best to do with the available level up perks and items that offer a good bonus alongside some handicaps so this is a system that allows a lot of creativity this also reflects on the visual of the character that morphs into some creepily awesome creature with the combination of several items and perks think binding of isaac

if you like highly replayable games you cant go wrong with brotato it already feels great very feature complete super customizable to your liking and needs it has a potato protagonist and it runs on a potato what more could you ask for steam deck support of course this game doesnt have a native linux version yet despite being made on the godot engine which is very penguinfriendly but it runs without any issue on the latest proton so you can enjoy being the bullet hell while avoid a hell of bullets on the later waves on windows and linux systems 

overall its an awesome game b100 recommended b

#####

30 vampire survivors
30 snkrx
40 20 minutes til dawn
100 potat

#####

better than battlefield 2042

#####

the amount of content you get with this game and 5 bucks should be illegal tbh

#####

nice spin on vampire survivors gameplay feels pretty different yet as catchy
still slaps after release with plenty of unlocks to do

#####

of all the vampire survivorslike games that have been coming out recently this is by far the best better than vampire survivors even and i really love that game the round based format works so well in keeping you engaged

#####

fun game which has a few phases
phase 1  going through the difficulties at the time of writing there are 6 0 through 5
discovery of what wins runs and how what works with building a character

phase 2 unlocking all characters
this is simply done by going for challenges

phase 3 can be split into two separate smaller phases
 winning with each character
 winning with each character on difficulty 5
this is by far the most fun phase in the game because each character brings its own difficulties through its passives which in turn forces you to play differently on each character and adapt

game is very fun and accessible 

note for developer an achievement for winning with each character on difficulty 5 for bragging rights would be awesome

#####

once i keep playing a game after getting all its achievements theres no more discussion if the game is good

#####

im irish must be a good game

#####

bro this game is lit for the price i mean bro it took me 80 hours to get all the achievements developer is a pure bro for making this cost so little bros game reminds me of other roguelikes but without the runs taking so long out of bros day 1010 bros

#####

the best way to describe brotato would probably to call it an autofiretopdownroguelikearena shooter 
on the surface the gameplay is quite similar each game you look down on your char try to survive 20 rounds and hope for the rng to be on your site  
unlike other games of the genre that i have played brotato requires a lot of intuition on what items to choose there are some general ideas for builds but nothing more 
if you do not have any intuition about item choices like i had brotato will teach you 
the small downside of this is that the game has a steeper learning curve because of this but it feels so good once you finish a run after figuring a character out 
   
other things i really like about the game
a lot of different characters that each require a different approach
a lot lot of different items 
beating the game with a character unlocks a new strong item
being able to upgrade andor recycle weapons 
stackable itemstats
6 difficult levels 
        
brotato is still in early access but its already filled with tons of contenthours of playtime and definitely worth its current price if you enjoy this type of games even a bit you should give brotato a try im very sure you wont regret it 



#####

this game is definitely worth the price but has one issue that stood out to me some characters just are not viable on certain difficulties want to play defense only and stand still the whole game like using turrets you cant because eventually you will run into a boss who forces you to move out of the way which will end your run a lot of the later enemy types and bosses feel like they are designed without half of the character roster in mind

#####

to compare this to vampire survivors does this game a great disservice as much as i love vampire survivors this game bests it quite easily im amazed this is early access it already has more content tighter controls more soul and just overall more fun than many aaa 60 games how they manage to get so much character out of a potato is beyond me but i often found myself giggling at some of the tiny details on the characters in the game kudos to blobfish 

dont think about it just buy this game its worth double the full price if its on sale youd have to be an idiot to pass it up its that fun

update we need more tatos to bro it up with 

#####

the soundtrack of this game goes hard

#####

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay

#####

its like vampire survivors with a little more depth and a lot more spuds

#####

boil em mash em stick em in a stew

 sam gamgee lord of the rings

#####

engaging and difficult bullet hell a lot of content for the price
this is the game that shows  you can actually make different characters feel unique with the number sliders you just need to go big each new characters plays differently you have to make adjustments to your build i expected it to be more like vampire survivors and was pleasantly surprised
calling the game a roguelite is a bit misleading  yes you unlock weapons and new characters but you dont have persistent upgrades like in vampire survivors id say its a roguelike but whatever i thing youll get the idea pretty quick anyway
because of that the game also is harder than vampire survivors  you cant just upgrade your self between runs to the point you can steamroll anyone you need skill strategy and luck on your side to win
pleasant art and amusing sound make the game feel even better i really like that each upgrade is visible on your brotato  i wish more games went this way
another indie gem to your collection

#####

brotato is a roguelite shmup and it isnt a vampire survivors clone the only considerable similarity is that its extremely engaging too it looks tasteful however id argue it could use a more vibrant colour palette to stand out but hey look at the ratings it has already accomplished that task with what little glamour there is and it should tell you something or maybe i should tell you something after all thats what reviews are for before we solve this mystery lets contemplate brotatos inconspicuous rise to fame some more how is it so wellreceived when you have to play in a browngrey arena that barely changes and with so few enemy types baffling some people choose to hyperfocus on these still legitimate flaws and dismiss the game before tasting it

their loss you dont throw away a good potato just because its brown and covered in dirt god i hate it when shops wash potatoes before selling cutting their shelf life short to please a bunch of misguided vegetable aesthetes anyway the saving grace is that you have no time for sightseeing being too busy fighting legions of slugs from commander keen 4 tom hall stalks my mind forever collecting valuable materials to level up and shop for goodies between the waves theres one great thing about the visuals the gear you acquire affects your potatos sprite which is a neat touch in the vein of the binding of isaac by the end of a run no potato looks the same giving each session even more personality still the skin isnt where its at

h3fun shoppingh3
you can concentrate your firepower manually but i preferred to use autoaim because it shoots your normally 6 guns in all directions at the same time avoiding overkill i guess it kinda resembles vs this way but you might never use autoaim or use it interchangeably  the game wont stop you its rather democratic with its options so after a couple of minutes of murder and looting in the arena youre in the shop drooling in anticipation because shopping is fun weapons and items are ranked by colour reflecting their power you may be lucky to buy a godtier gun but the usual way of upgrading your equipment is stacking duplicates of the same colour it works differently for items but you dont need these nuances

stacking things and theres quite an assortment of them as it should be in a roguelite is a satisfying task the ability to lock and reroll the goodies makes it the most intense and controlled shopping experience ever the sprees seldom leave you emptyhanded but these rerolls can burn a hole in your pocket if you get carried away youre always deciding whether to save or to spend always have something to add thinking of another gun or stat to upgrade a build to design i know for a fact that the game provides you with a bigger chance to get weapons and items you already have so that you could reliably create any setup you want considerate isnt it

h3flexible progressionh3
consistently so brotato feels friendly and aims to please without coming off as smarmy that bro is in the title for a good reason it also keeps you wellinformed with comprehensive descriptions besides you can easily check how much damage a weapon managed to dish out or how many stat points an item provided you with i wish more games that heavily rely on theory crafting did this now said comprehensiveness supports a flexible progression system its a minmaxers paradise you have 16 stats to juggle yet somehow the power creep doesnt feel incremental you typically get noticeably stronger with each wave

upon beating a run which takes no more than 2030 minutes you unlock items and characters characters are balanced in a way that makes every item and mechanic bear significance for at least some of them depending on your current goals and benchmark data these diverse potatoes are the main course that will make you want to stay for longer it seems like the dev had a lot of fun designing a complex system and then going wild with it by creating an extremely gimmicky roster to test its limits how about bull who cant use weapons exploding on getting hit instead or lucky who kills with items that proc from luck these arent even the weirdest two

h3clever gameh3
there are 6 difficulty options or levels of danger from 0 to 5 ive beaten brotato once on danger 5 but then went back to 3 finding it a gentle mistress allowing a modicum of mistakes then i kept popping in for a chill run since the game made it appealing to persist if youre hardcore youll find the ceiling high enough if you want to relax brotato will oblige its a clever game it has nothing to say about the plights of society and all but its nonmaliciously addictive game design changes your brains chemistry without uttering a word one more run one more wave one more reroll its that simple at the same time there are plenty of strategies to sink your teeth in i hope i made it easier for you to imagine what potential depths brotato holds this game doesnt try to do much but it succeeds at everything it does

thank you uberdanger 3

#####

very relaxing and satisfying

#####

i was impressed by the creativity and fun factor of the game gameplay is simple and intuitive but the levels become progressively more challenging as you progress through the 20 waves the graphics are colorful and simple and the soundtrack is great
the game keeps you constantly on your toes with new enemies and items to interact with the environment there are countless combinations or ways to strengthen your character to survive all waves that in turn makes it challenging there are many brotatolike games out there eg bounty of one but none of these games can compete with brotato
all in all brotato is a fantastic game that will provide hours of entertainment for players of all ages the combination of challenging gameplay and good graphics makes it a must for anyone looking for a fun and unique gaming experience

definitely worth the money for 499 its a joke there are games that cost a lot more but offer much less the value for money is great i can recommend it unreservedly i look forward to new contentcharacters this game is great for chilling pastime or level 5 challenge i sincerely recommend buying the game and supporting the developer

#####

i find it difficult to get into the vampire survivors sub genre of games  they are mildy entertaining for half an hour though i usually just feel like im wasting time when i could be playing something deeper or with more to show  

brotato is the game of this style that i enjoyed the most thus far

#####

needs naked female potatoes

#####

good potatothemed roguelike one might even say spudtacular 
40 different characters each with a different set of pros and cons 
huge variety of items so each run is unique
do recommend

#####

after 45 hours ive finally cleared a run with every character and completed all 5 danger levels if youre familiar with topdown roguelike games like vampire survivors then this is for you i really enjoyed the agency the game provides in that there are so many different kinds of builds you can run on all the characters these characters all have their unique gimmicks which make them interesting and fun to play except farmer like using extra weapons at the cost of damage or not being able to use weapons and instead exploding on contact with an enemy for 399 i cant recommend this game enough more than got my moneys worth from it

list

h3now to elaborate on my notesh3

¹ the games combat is perfectly set up not only with satisfying sounds and clear hits the watery noise of picking up materials and the levelup sound reminiscent of an arcade but also with very tight hitboxes so you never feel cheated when trying to dodge an enemy attack as well as your stats and choices throughout the run influencing what style of combat you will be enduring from a gungeonlike bullethell weaving yourself through waves of enemy projectiles to a relaxing ranged run as you sit in the center of the map with sifds relic collecting all materials for you sniping every enemy before they even have a glimpse of a chance of attacking you though the default for this game is as an autoshooter there are circumstances in which youd want to aim which they have an option to enable in the settings

² the art style is incredibly consistent and beautiful even with ui elements meshing perfectly alongside the sound design and the satisfying idle animations all come together for a very polishedfeeling experience

³ with 55 weapons split across 15 classes along with 177 unique items and 44 characters theres a iloti to consider while doing your run the developer still managed to keep great balance in all of this and even with stats interacting with every one of these things differently you still have to consider what youre grabbing the game also manages something that i see even some aaa games miss out on input choices you can use the mouse to navigate menus or either the arrow keys or wasd which you can also use ingame to control your character you can choose to manually aim or let it autoaim by default i find the controls very intuitive even if i need to switch hands to grab my drink while dodging alien attacks

⁴ the game has an amazing modding community with mods ranging from thousands of new characters to ridiculous gamebreaking weapons and new weapon classes all with direct support from the developer and steam workshop functionality

⁵ the varied characters and stat combos force you to understand the different weapons and stats and use them appropriately with each other scaling well with difficulty

⁶ a significant portion of the achievements are for simply beating a run as a character which can be done on danger 0 the equivalent of a very easy difficulty making those achievements repetitive and at times unchallenging id have loved it if they were for danger 5 and maybe more for beating all characters at each difficulty

hrhr
h1conclusionh1

biid highly recommend this game at its price point of only 499 at the time of review you can easily get 18 hours just getting the character achievements putting a price per hour at only 28 thats excluding all dangerbased and passively obtainable achievements this is also a great choice for those of you who work or have children due to the short run times and ability to quit a run midway and resume whenever you next have time ib

perfect game for steam deck

#####

im glad that i listened to my friends recommendation on this and bought it its been a fantastic game for playing on the steam deck

i love the challenge of all the different characters that can be unlocked the time it takes to complete a 20 wave run feels like the right amount of time sure it sucks to die on the last wave but the time spent is short enough that it doesnt feel like i wasted a significant amount of time and im ready to give it another shot

#####

you could have never convinced me i would play this game over 100 hours now im here over 100 and pretty sure there will be 100s more its so well balanced and fun to play its a one more time game that just feels good if you have a steam deck you really should have this

#####

despite appearances its a genuinely very brutal roguelite not just a very brutal survivorslike
on the surface it seems very simple but the vast variety of characters have all sorts of different playstyles simple decisions can make or break runs  and you wouldnt know them unless you tried
there are accessibility settings to lower or increase enemy stats so dont fret if the game is infuriatingly difficult
if you thought other survivorslikes are too casual this is for you extremely replayable extremely frustratingly difficult

#####

i have potato blood in my veins my life is potato in your working life and in your living its always potatoes

1010 i dream of potatoes

#####

sobrotato ive finished a few runs this is another in that enemy hell style gaming inspired by vampire survivors and old arcade games in this one you choose one of a variety of potatoes undead potatoes adventurer potatoes mutant potatoes wizard potatoes fisherman potatoes and so on your goal is to survive twenty timed and increasingly difficult waves of enemies in an arena setting

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3152383311

the arena itself so much as i can tell never really changes you earn coins during and at the end of each wave this functions as both xp for leveling up and as cash for the weaponsupgrade shop which you visit between each wave

you start each run with buffs and debuffs dependent on your potato of choice you also begin with at least one weapon which you can choose from a slate of starter tier one weapons your potato with tmk one exception can wield up to six ranged and melee weapons at any moment its an auto battler so you just try to equip your brotato as good as you can

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3152130518

leveling up gives you increased hp as well as giving you the option to choose from one of four randomly generated stat boosts there are many categories from ranged and melee damage to sight range hp regeneration and so on

similarly the gear shop offers four randomly generated and priced items you can buy as many as you can afford can pay for a reroll of items and can lock items you want and cant afford so they reappear after the next waves as well

weapons have an array of specialtieseffects from precision to explosive to elemental to medical life stealinghealing and so on you can also when lucky buy itemsweapons that drop turrets and landmines to help you out in battle and you can combine weapons if you have two of the same weapons in the same tier which raises their tier level and stats

you can also dismantle any weapon for extra coins

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3152130428

on the battlefield trees will appear destroying the trees will drop what amounts to healing packs and occasionally chests which offer free items in between runs 

beyond that you just run around the arena like a potato with its head cut off trying to survive twenty waves to win the day wave 20 is the big boss fight with some bullet hell elements to it there is also an endless mode and a mod workshop which you can easily access in the games menu for people interested in such

this is perfectly steam deck compatible running at default settings and the game more or less maximizes your battery life

all in all this is actually one if the more challenging and fast paced entries in the genre is as fun as can be and is definitely well worth your time its very easy to pick up and play anywhere anytime cost vs value is insanely good with this one give it a look

h1brotato is the most addictive and satisfying game to play on the steam deckh1

been playing it everyday at work wifes getting mad at me for playing it in bed and i just cant stop playing

insanely high replayability factor ultimate goal is to complete all 20 waves with dozens of unique characters while unlocking new items characters and achievements

for me its indefinitely better than vampire survivors 1010

bif you have a steam deck buy it  no questions askedb

bupdate 100 completed the achievements of the game beat the game with every character and on all difficulty levels hours upon hours upon hours spent at work playing brotatob

h1loved every minuteh1

#####

for its price this is a exceptional game it has a plethora of different classes a fun yet challenging game loop and even hidden game modes and a fun soundtrack

if you dont have it  and the game play looks even mildly interesting to you  then its a easy instant recommendation

#####

this is my new favorite turn off my brain and relax after work game 

#####

overall 710

brotato presents itself as a compact and accessible game perfectly tailored for those moments when youre seeking a quick entertaining diversion without the commitment required by more extensive titles its minimal hard drive footprint is a commendable feature making it an easy addition to any gaming library particularly for players with limited storage space or those who prefer a lightweight gaming experience

at its core brotato is imbued with a fun engaging gameplay loop that offers immediate gratification and an easytopickup structure this aspect makes it an excellent choice for casual gaming sessions where the aim is to unwind and enjoy without getting bogged down by complex mechanics or storylines the game shines in its ability to deliver short bursts of enjoyment making it a goto for filling brief periods of free time

however its worth noting that brotato may not hold the attention of players looking for depth and variety in the long run the gameplay while initially captivating can evolve into a repetitive cycle potentially diminishing its appeal over extended play sessions this repetition is a doubleedged sword on one hand it allows for a straightforward and accessible experience but on the other it may lead to a sense of monotony for those seeking a more dynamic and evolving challenge

brotato stands out as a fun and enjoyable game with a specific appeal to those in search of light engaging entertainment that doesnt demand much in terms of time or system resources its simplicity and ease of access are its greatest strengths though its repetitive nature might limit its longterm appeal to some players its very low cost which drives the overall value up for most overall its a good choice for gamers looking for a fun rogue like simple game

#####

i love murdering monsters as potato only using movement stick on my controller
fun basic and most importantly lots of different potato chars

i recommend if youre gonna play in wrong way possible makes it even more fun

#####

brotato is one of the most fun games in its genre its a topdown arena shooter roguelite like vampire survivors but with its unique style you play a potato who has up to 6 weapons at a time and have to finish 20 rounds in order to win 

the main aspect that drew me to the game was the amount of different weapons and item combinations you can have there is also various amount of characters with unique gimmicks that make each run different from any time you pick a new character as a consequence of having a lot of characters some of them end up being very good and some are just really hard to win with 

nonetheless the game is hard but once you start understanding what each enemy does and some good combos the game becomes a lot of fun

i fully recommend the game especially considering how cheap it is

#####

fun game pretty addicting i dont think its in the top tier of vampire survivor type clones but its pretty close its very much stat based especially with all the classes you have to know what everything does even when its not explained properly and knowing the optimal strategy for each scenario class is paramount also youre just really moving around in circles for the most part the game is 80 strategy 20 execution gameplay 

you can make some pretty broken builds if the rng gods are with you you can also just suddenly die because you didnt have enough dodge or armor or hp or some stat that just never came up maybe youre just too broke to buy that one upgrade that you needed this game is perfect for mathematicians  statisticians  honestly a college course on this game would make math a lot more interesting

this has to be the best game for steam deck 2023 right i nominated it

brate 710 solid game for the price i will do my best to go cold turkey after 326 hoursb

#####

its legitimately insane how many characters there are and how different your builds get despite the game being this seemingly primitive i mean its literally a square box with enemies spawning around how diverse would you assume that could be

the game requires the skill level mildly above vampire survivors so basically next to none making it a nice time killer to unwind there is however a difficulty system which can get more challenging if you go for it

#####



#####

controls like vampire survivors looks like binding of isaac very lowfriction play experience tons of content for the price if you like moving a stick around and shooting enemies its a strong recommend

#####

assasin potato that looks more like an egg goes on a killing spree

simple but challenging and fun to play either as a casual run here and there or going full on achievement hunter its a great game either way

so the game is somewhat simple yet youll have the opportunity to build your own strategy in order to beat the hardest difficulties we have a vast amount of hero potatoes each character has its perks and cons youll have to find out which abilities and weapons suit each of them the best if you enjoyed games such as vampire survivor or you like roguelikes in general give this cute potato a go i bet youll like it

the game is still ea as i am writting this review but the devs are very active and continue to work on this game i have already gotten all the achievements there are so far but im looking forward more content in the future

art is simple and music wise we have few tracks but all are very enjoyable and suit the game perfectly i never got tired of it

#####

im not sure what to call these kinds of games  its tagged action roguelike so i guess thats it but the game out there right now thats most like it is 20 minutes till dawn  i guess its a roguelike in that each run is its own thing and theres a semirandom aspect to it what weapons or upgrades youre given but i think id classify it as more of a 2d arena shooter 

your brotato who looks more like dizzy from the commodore 64 games from 35 years ago is basically forced to kill a horde of enemies that spawn in shown by a red x before they appear for a set amount of time that goes up with each corresponding wave  at wave 20 you fight the boss with a ton of annoying other enemies too and if you win that you get to go up a difficulty level 

much like 20 minutes till dawn i have had a terrible time trying to make just to wave 20 or 20th minute  ive made it to wave 19 or 20 a couple of times but my ability to avoid damage or heal it faster than i lose it is marginal at best so i havent yet made it past it   there are certain builds that would probably help but not everything is available to you at the start  

the game is played in a small arena that you can run laps around at least 23 times in one round though the first few rounds are really short  you also have to pick up green exp gems to level up so you cant just kite enemies all day at some point youre going to have to go back over the areas and pick up your winnings  anything you dont grab by the end of the round is lost though the game sorta forcefeeds you the leftover hp pickups  and btw those hp pickups look like the food from oxygen not included green and lumpy  

edit so i learned that having the optimize end of round option turned on means you dont see the the animation and thus you have no idea whats going on  anything you dont pick up is sorta banked shown by a coin purse and so whatever number it shows is how many green gems will be double value next round  if you have the animation turned on its made more obvious because you see all the remaining green gems fly up to the coin purse and from there you can hover over it and see that youre getting those points back next round   i dont even remember turning on the option to optimize the end of round

you start out with a good all rounder class that doesnt give a ton of bonuses but has no weaknesses either and as you play you unlock the ability to choose different classes depending on if you met some criteria  the first dozen or so classes you can unlock by normal play meaning  you dont have to think or plan about what you need to do in order to unlock those characters  some characters however have specific conditions that you have to meet first

for example theres one class i have yet to unlock that you get when your hp regeneration hits 5   it shouldnt be that difficult to get that but the game doesnt give you what you want or sometimes even what you need so you kinda have to luck into the situation and then take advantage of it  theres no single item that i have seen that will allow you to just immediately get hp regeneration to 5 so when i see one that says hp regeneration 3 i take it and then hope to see another and nope  i get a bunch of items that add hitpoint regeneration instead    

i often have a plan of what i want to do to create the perfect build and then the game says oh you wanted more attack speed you wanted 6 of a particular weapon  tough luck guy  heres a stick and a magic wand and instead of more attack speed im going to give you the option to increase your max hp   its like the game tries to keep you from stacking up in one area and instead provides you with a bunch of different options


you can probably get at least 10 hours of enjoyment before the game starts to annoy you like its starting to annoy me but the game is cheap and so thats not a big deal  ive paid 70 for the digital deluxe edition of a aaa game that i thought i was going to love and been disappointed in it but if i spend 5 on a random indie game i find that i can get my moneys worth out of it and if i didnt like it at all then its only 5 

anyway this review is getting too long so the bottom line is this if you enjoy running around a small arena while enemies chase you while the game chooses when to shoot and what to shoot at then this is probably worth the money  if you are looking for more of a strategic game or a game where you can test your aiming skills 20 minutes till dawn is probably better for you  both are great games though

edit finally won a round with ghost because of the high dodge percentage  i didnt manage to kill off the big bad at the end though which is basically saying im probably not ready for the higher difficulty levels

#####

really really fun game that makes you want to play just one more run although it may seem boring from videos it is really entertaining and i rarely stop a run midway through like how i do with some other games the game was also made in the godot engine which is so underrated so that by itself gets my support

#####

like vampire survivors but theres no afking  a fully won game takes 30 minutes  very much arcadestyle with inrun progression and a surprising variety of viable builds  very light metaprogression theres no meta currency and thats for the best

#####

this is probably the best game to come out of the survivor craze i already had a blast with the demo and didnt think the full game would add this much more content but it did definitely worth the money and then some 
installed it got stoned and probably played a lil too much cuz its 3am now

#####

really fun and a bunch of unlockable characters and replay value highly recommend for the price no need to wait for a sale its more than worth 5 bucks

#####

h1 crisp n crazy the potatolicious alien annihilator h1
our titular hero crash lands on an alien planet he possesses remarkable skills fearlessly taking on any challenge equipped with the ability to wield six weapons simultaneously our hero fearlessly annihilates hordes of pesky aliens no time is wasted as players dive right into the action you choose a starting character and weapon and start fighting hordes of enemies in a standard sense the goal is to survive 20 waves you choose rewards after each wave and go back to killing poor aliens who probably were just going by their day until you crash landed there for those seeking a lengthier challenge an endless wave mode awaits i enjoyed it but should you buy it we will have to discuss it more
the first wave lasts for 20 seconds the second wave is 25 seconds long the third wave lasts 30 seconds and so on brotato relies on instant gratification rather than satisfaction the fast paced monster killing increases with geometric progression with each passing wave after a few hours of gameplay you feel a craving has been left unsatisfied like a premature climax but you are at least satisfied that you got off the waves conclude swiftly almost justifying being called ripples a slower paced but longer lasting waves would feel more rewarding
moving on to the pros and cons i will just list pros and cons in bullet points for people with shorter attention span who this game seems to have been designed for 
b pros b
 the game offers an excellent option to adjust difficulty allowing you to finetune enemy health damage and speed with sliders that move in increments of 5 providing distinct steps between 25 and 100
 responsive controls and smooth animations make the gameplay fluid
 energetic music complements the frantic onscreen action exceptionally well
 there is a good variety of characters weapons and abilities that allow for diverse strategies against a range of enemy mobs and bosses
 the game encourages modding enhancing the overall enjoyment and replayability
 shorter waves allow for quick bursts of gameplay and accommodate shorter gaming sessions for those pressed for time
 accessibility has been given due attention the game can be played entirely with just the mouse making it accessible and providing easy and intuitive controls particularly for players with limited mobility
b cons b
 waves end when the timer runs out even if enemies are still present it would be better if the timer stopped spawning enemies instead of abruptly ending the wave
 visibility becomes a significant issue in later waves a high contrast mouse cursor with the option to increase size would solve this problem
b conclusion b
i ponder the reasons behind the games overwhelmingly positive reviews perhaps the widespread acclaim stems from the consensus that it is a promising game even if it falls short of being a masterpiece personally the game leaves me yearning for a more fulfilling experience however considering its price point of 159 it offers a decent gaming experience


#####

simple but amazingly well done

#####

honestly as addicting as the gameplay loop canbe when its going good and its fun on deck for sure i think this game has some really obnoxious problems there are so many items and stats that many runs can fail simply because the game only feeds you items that are either useless or actively harmful to your run this means a lot of time the game is fun for a while but almost every run ends feeling bad literally nearly every run ends because of some bullshit the way the enemies scale up between waves means that at higher difficulties an incredible run can get cut short no matter how much good stuff the game throws at you the thing that finally made me write this review is that i added a mod that lets me reroll the shop for free and that didnt even help i could sit there for minutes just spamming the roll and just get the most  useless shit this game has way too much bloat i cant believe some mods want to add more i dont like games that only ever end in bad vibes

#####

be potat

#####

super fun game that is alot like vampire survivors and army of rain it has its own style of graphicsart design and its got good fun gameplay if you are looking for another game to scratch that itch that vampire survivors gave you check this game out

this and army of rain both are super good games in that same vein nice prices to the gameplay and controls are already really good cant wait to see what they add because the base here is very good

it also plays and controls very well on the steamdeck

#####

if you like bullet hellheaven youll maybe love this its slickly made looks and sounds great and plays very polished
unfortunately its just not my kind of game in this genre i really need some carried over upgrade progression to keep me going to feel that im headed somewhere with a few steps in between to help me get closer to success and that its not all skill based because at that point im probably going to fail and get found out pretty quickly
not the games fault at all it does what it does extremely well but it kinda punched me in the jewels giggled and ran off and i decided i was ok with that
some games just arent really for me


#####

this game price is basically a steal for how much fun this game is and the amount of replayability as well i have such a blast playing this game every single time for sure i wouldnt even hesitate on getting this one if youre into these types of games im super excited for full release too

#####

it good


#####

everyone whos playing vampires survivor etc etc 
should have this too in their library 
worth every penny

#####

a well polished top down shooter with amazing replayability that is well worth the full price a must have if you enjoy crazy roguelites like vampire survivors this game singlehandedly saved me from boredom on a 10 hour flight some games you keep playing even after completing and this will definitely be one of them for me i love that it works really well on the steam deck

#####

nice game to play while listening to musicpodcast

#####

bought a steam deck to play aaa games plays brotato

#####

i am allergic to dying a lot i usually set the difficulty down if that happens
i dont do that now i play on normal
this is the most fun ive had at failure as it still feels like progress 
i also feel about 18 again  too much fun it is and the price is great

#####

one of the best rogue like survival games after vampire survivor

the variety of the early access is just insane and the combat is super fun challenging
therere so many builds you can try
i even tried a suicide bomb build and it was awesome

on top of measly 5 dollars price tag for hundreds of hrs of replayability 
a must buy game
rly hope this game will go viral

#####

definitely worth the money it cost  100 pays out ive completed the game at zero level danger because im not hardcore player and i look forward for new contentcharacters ill be glad to come back and try out new stuff this game will be good both for chill and time killing or to challenge yourself at level 5 of danger also if you struggling in passing the game you can go to the settings and customize the game for yourself by changing the movement speed damage and hp of your enemies i sincerely recommend to buy the game and support developer

#####

brotato might not revolutionize the genre and youll likely spot familiar mechanics  yet for the price  its a fun addictive romp around 

thankfully i dont think brotato makes any grand claims at being the next sliced bread it doesnt suggest itself to be some grand epic tale either youre a potato who gets strapped to the neck with weapons and munitions and sent out against hordes of enemies they keep it pretty simple yet if youre one who likes getting their stats yolked to the max  you can do that too

picture this as you gear up for a run you face the critical decision ofchoosing a head for your potato body riviting  i know a large amount of the games achievements surround which head you went with id say more but that might spoil your spud p

pros

 lots of weapons
 lots of carnage
 traps and turrets rule
 minmaxing is fun
 unique memorable graphics
 priced at 5 anything less is a steal

cons
 lack of enemy variety
 lack of arena variety
 why not more colors green purple red


for how cheap it is its an easy pickup in my book it offers nothing groundbreaking but it does provide for several hours of hordesurvival entertainment plus who doesnt want to play as a sixweaponwielding potatoguy saving the potato world from aliens p

#####

dont buy this game i stopped working on my projects because of this

#####

this game is incredible i have so many hours in the demo version that i purchased this as soon as i saw it was available if youre a fan of run based twin stick bullet hell random item time killers then look no further if you have a steam deck i bet you just found one of your favourite new games as well as it controls beautifully and runs like a dream at least half of my hours were played on my deck

for a price tag under 6 dollars you will not be disappointed do yourself a favour and pick this game up and support a cool developer

#####

its like vampire survivorsbut your a potato

#####

the best vampire survivorsalike i have played  pretty deep options for builds and every unlockable character of which there are many plays differently from the others so tons of replayability  bangin music although the game could certainly use a few more tracks  highly recommended especially for the price

#####

h1played on steam deckh1
brotato is a fantastic horde survival game similar to vampire survivors but has its own unique gameplay and upgrade system i really enjoyed the various characters with strengths and weaknesses shopping for upgrades and the different weapon choices potato cannon anyone the final boss has very often ended a run i thought was going quite well _ so the challenge remains on every run whereas i feel vs got easy after a good run of upgrades the only upgrades unlocked after winning are a single item so the base gameplay is mostly the same every time the map is rather blah but fine enough enemies are cool and have unique abilities also cool to unlock more enemies with even more attacks as the difficulty level rises 5 is an absolutely great price for this game and excited to see where its at with the full release

#####

solid little vampire survivorsalike where your blobby potato glides across fields of battle wielding up to six autoaiming autofiring weapons at a time and the weirdo statboosting items you buy between rounds gradually cover them up like a demented mr potato head and speaking of statboosting items does this game ever have a lot of stats and scores all of which interweave with the excellent weapons items and character mutations gained from levelups to create a surprisingly deep network of possibilities for every run

and the runs are short and to the point the earliest stages wrap within 20 seconds and even the final stage number 20 lasts maybe 2 minutes the rerollable shops between give you just enough of a breather  and your joystick thumb enough of a break  to keep things interesting without breaking the pace

the unlocks flow swift and steady and the various different brotato characters you can play as introduce even more variety and specialization possibilities thanks to the awesome tagging system for gear appropriate items show up more often and the more you specialize in a particular line the more of that kind of item shows up in future shops

#####

its a top down arena shooter with flavors of risk of rain except youre a potato there are an enormous number of classes and items allowing for a huge variety of builds its a fun quick to play arcade game with no great comitment to time there are 20 levels and each level is at most 60 seconds long you can do an entire run in under 20 minutes

the cost of the game is also approximately the same as a potato thanks to recent inflation so theres excellent value for money

the game has excellent accessibility options as well are you old like me and need to slow down the game you can go into the options menu and make your adjustments the game does not penalize you for this theres no get gud set your accessibility options and go be a potato

the same accessibility page also lets you increase the difficulty if youre a masochist

#####

potato grabs weapon enemy die i die restart repeat

#####

is a silly addictivefunchallenging and quite unique game
and is not expensive either so give it a try

#####

i only played it for one session on my steam deck but like vampire survivor this game is a must have for the deck



#####

better than every single vampire survivors clone out there

combined

#####

skyrim elden ring jesse im man of culture
i need deep storytelling
















#####

very addictive game similar mechanics as vampire survivors but much more refined  polished

#####

bbrotatob is a shining example of why progression via metaunlocks is not required for this genre in order to thrive as much as i enjoy the bullet heaven games one pattern i find distracting from most of them is the need for permanent stat progression between your runs roguelites in general have this feature and while it is a popular tool to incentivize repeatplaythroughs i feel like it has become the accepted norm which has led to an issue where poor play is rewarded with persistence even worse is that in many games of this type the balance depends on failing runs until metaunlocks permit you to succeed which isnt so much a challenge as much as it is a grinding chore

then brotato hits the scene with a simple philosophy if you fail try again only this time with more knowledge at your disposal every goof is a learning experience did the bro you pick fail with your itemweapon loadout try a different one are you struggling to survive on a specific bro stack some dodge  healing is a particular bro too challenging try another and come back later when youre more confident there is a strong incentive to improve and you never feel like the game is giving you an easy run your use of rerolls combined with pattern recognition and economymanagement will lead you to smooth runs everything in this game is in your hands and when you fail you know why you failed

and it feels great especially when you reach a point of comprehension and perform better than you thought what once seemed hard on danger 5 became a neverending winstreak from bro to bro brotato is a strict teacher by not giving you boons between runs but it is also a responsible one by teaching you to reach into your skillset to unlock the ultimate metaprogression your potential

highly recommended if you enjoy a good challenge

#####

cant really say anything bad about this little gem here its simple yet highly entertaining 
tons of gear and possible builds variety check replayability check difficulty curve on point banger soundtrack 
cant go wrong for 5 bucks 

genrewise its worth noting that brotato is a real roguelike means you unlock new characters and new items for future runs but theres no metacurrency or any permanent character upgrades

#####

good game d

#####

worth every penny

#####

brotato is a blast

right now its one of those gems thats a steal for its price even at the early access state
the developer himself is really helpful even in steamforums which is sadly not quite often the case
another great point is that the game gets updated quite often so you can come back later to have a fresh experience

there is a lot of content for the money all characters feel and play different
you can be a mage that burns all evil aliens to death for example or even be like a bull and crush into every enemy just to explode and deal damage that way 

i managed to 100 the game to its current state but its still superfun you can always try new stuff out

this game is an example how the early access state should be practised within the game development industry

what are you waiting for
get brotato and kill some aliens while having the fun of your life





#####

the most fun ive ever had as a vegetable

#####

extremely cool and replayable arena game with a lot of possibilities and challenge

#####

never piss off a potato trust me

#####

the gameplay mechanics are quite fun and there are many unique combinations of items and weapons to discover there is just one thing which leads me to leave a negative review most of the time the regular levels are way too easy and although this fact it takes quite a long time to get to the final boss this final boss is significant harder so most of the time you just die to the final boss after a long period of grinding the regular levels

#####

from the very first moments of playing brotato it becomes abundantly clear that a lot of thought has gone into its design the game is a masterclass in crafting clever gameplay mechanics with so many intricacies that every playthrough feels fresh and novel one of the standout features of brotato has to be its diverse character roster each character doesnt just offer a cosmetic change but significantly differentiates gameplay opportunities just by tweaking few numbers here and there this isnt just a matter of having a different set of moves or abilities the synergy between characters and builds is so deeply interwoven that every match feels like a new puzzle waiting to be solved

brotato also excels in its core game loop which is exceptionally wellbuilt this isnt a game that becomes monotonous after a few hours the rhythm of play is engaging keeping you hooked as you strategize adapt and overcome the challenges it throws at you the synergy between gameplay elements not only adds layers of depth but also encourages replayability as you always find new ways to approach situations

in summary brotato is a testament to what can be achieved with a dedication to polished game design the diverse characters their unique synergies and the impeccable core game loop make this game an essential experience for anyone with a taste for brilliantly crafted gameplay highly recommended

#####

an incredibly addictive survival roguelite i would close it in frustration after incredibly lucky run gone bad and then some minutes later id launch it again trying another build and approach quickly racking up a day worth of playtime

this one has you running in a limited arena dodging enemies spawning periodically taking them down to collect dropped resources in short mostly 60 second rounds a total of 20 in a regular game between these rounds you pick level up upgrades and buy up items and weapons its a very simple loop with short hectic rounds and purchasing as thoughtful as you want it to be

the most hooking part in all this its very fun to create and try out entirely different builds theres a variety of characters to unlock by playing each offering very distinct ways to play giving bonuses in exchange for some playstyle or progression limitations like one rewards you for keeping enemies alive at end of life while dodging them another one strongly restricts all ways of restoring health apart from food pickups that drop across level then theres weapons some characters have restrictions or additions but mostly everyone gets max six each firing or swinging at closest enemy apart from damage outputs and trajectories theres varied utility effects like improving player regeneration adding permanent stats for sufficient kills trough a round etc and then theres stats and items you buy see theres just always at least a couple interesting interactions between those especially in the second apart of game when you secure rarer artifacts with special bonuses like one extra damage for each speed bonus  and beyond lower difficulties its crucial to find a tactic that helps scale the stats to keep up with enemies and give you an edge in survival also many items you buy come with a drawback that adds additional nuance  like one critical chance increasing item also slightly drops damage but is that a big deal when youre focusing on critical chance effects of your weapons

only thing i dislike is that its rather bit granular way too many 1 to 5 tweaks sure you stock up a whole bunch of these per run but its a far cry from how it feels to get a new powerful item in other surviorslikes also i guess depending on build the screen can get very overwhelmed with stuff not as much as many other of these games mind but space here is very limited so it feels so much more tight also wish there was more music the soundtrack works surprisingly well but there arent that many tracks there

i totally recommend this one if you enjoy experimenting with stats and builds goes real cheap and yet is extremely gripping

#####

awesome game one of the best roguelike games ever very fast paced lots of upgrades  i personally like it when upgrades make visual changes on characters vast variety of weapons machine guns shotguns pistols knives maces spears wands and a lot more  lots of fun designed characters to choose from each one of them got their own specific pros and cons
its definitely worth the money you pay for it enjoy the good sound tracks of the game

#####

game has horrendous problem with its balancing if you enjoy being miserable the entire time you play this one is for you the snowball of enemy spawn rate and damage level to level is downright atrocious you go from beating the level easily to being killed by an enemy after bumping into slightly or an enemy will charge you from what feels like halfway across the map and itll do your entire health bar of damage the rng is simply not fun if you are in the mood for this type of game go play vampire survivors

#####

costs less than a can of red bull in my country and it scratches that itch no longer scratched by vampire survivors i can tell already that this is a game i will pump hundreds of hours into trying to get as far as i can with builds that i myself have stumbled upon through hours of mixing and matching 

i have nothing negative to say but i will say you should go out and get this game if you like games such as vampire survivors  oh and a huge 1 for the mod support as well in this game which will no doubt aid its longevity and replayability

#####

what do the developers keep doing to this game fans complain about the way things get nerfed and you ruin more items and make the game harder and less fun the newest update in the beta took all of the fun out for me the game should feel challenging not frustrating every run relies on rng and it gets so tedious having a run ruined because you cant get the items or weapons you need

#####

pros
 lots of characters with different playstyles
 generally enjoyable gameplay loop
cons
 90 of the weapons feel the same shoots bullet shoots bullet faster swings melee weapon pokes melee weapon
 doesnt quite have the wow factor of getting have a sick run that scales out of control
 certain stats just scale or are more useful than others but at the same time all the stats are necessary in some shape or form so when you get an upgrade thats  damage  attack speed it feels pointless or net neutral
 higher difficulties just add too many layers at the same time more enemy damage and health less itemshigher costing items new enemy types faster enemies tldr the higher difficulties are just anti fun and are an rng fiesta

overall outside of the character differences all the runs boil down to are you playing melee or ranged the weapons are not unique enough to feel like a scissors run is that much different than a knife run yeah they have minor differences but gameplay is literally all the exact same higher difficulties expect you to have all your stats as high as possible damage defense dodge armor because its scaled so awfully cant go pure dodge because if you get hit you die without armor cant go full armor only because without any dodge the swarms of tanky enemies will just melt your hp

i dunno at some point in my 28 hours i was having fun trying the character playstyles but in the end to me that this game is absolutely a waste of time with no respect to me having fun for the sake of artificial difficulty and samey feeling runs every time i hit play

#####

h1brief summaryh1
after playing for 30 hours and get like 4 of my friends addicted to the game it it time to give the positive review it deserves
lets stars by saying than game is pretty much a mix between binding of issac but with the fast paced action of bullet heaven games
games are fast  fun  chaotic and beautiful once you get your build working 

it doesnt have meta progression but i think the fun on this game is to learn a character and then move up the ranks or once you unlock max difficulty level you can just straight go up to max level difficulty which is the best imo dont have to grind for difficulty setting with each characters

h2tldrh2
 just get it it is pure fun if youre into these kind of rng games and bullet heavens 
i do recommend brotato

edit  took me 70 hours for all achievements 85 done max difficulty
and took 82 hours to get all characters max difficulty

is potato

#####

ya like vampire survivors but always wanted big newgrounds esque energy in it well here ya go

#####

this game is very fun and addicting

it is a simple dual stick shooter that is easy to pick up and start playing

this game is very similar to vampire survivors

you run around killing waves of enemies until you die

once you die you lose

after each game youre rewarded currency and exp and can purchase and unlock new and more powerful gear along with a large amount of new playable characters

the game has very smooth clean controls and is very appealing on the eyes like beyonce

totally a great game and would recommend this title especially at its current price


#####

this game works perfectly with the steam deck unlike its parent game  vampire survivors 
while being in early access it works well and offers many hours of fun superaddictive one more round is very strong in this game 
one thing would make this game great  some perks to spend as at the moment you have no way make it a bit easier on the metagame side and nothing to do in menus between the runs  

issues
harvesting thing is totally confusing and not explained well 
crashed once midgame

#####

fun exciting even definately addictive

lotsa content for the price lotsa items lotsa potatoes
game loop is right on point you need to juggle improving both offensive and defensive stats so no op builds nonsense there is mouse only mode no need to make snack breaks
shop rng is tag based game baisically feeds you more of what you already have stats wise

cant wait for more potatoes to mash enemies on full release

#####

just a potato running around killing evil aliens whats not to love

#####

before playing this game i kept my potatoes behind the fridge but after playing this game i put my potatoes on my bed and then i sleep behind the fridge

#####

an okay game mediocre rogue lite survivallike shooter with the biggest downside being very basic it is still fun to come back time from type to complete a run on every character but it is very limited and has little to no variety same old thing same scenario same weapons with slight stat and schtick variation per each character  more variation of challenges different levels or mobs longer rounds etc would make it better as it heavily lacks core gameplay variety

#####

pretty fun

#####

i came to this game as a fan of vampire survivors i read the reviews and knew it would be different but for 4 lets give it a go at first it was addictive i put 10 hours into it within a few days 

it has instant allure in trying to figure out how to build your character but ultimately its extremely luck based even with the luck modifiers nearly every character option starts out with a significant set of negative stats 

unlike vampire survivors or even rogue legacy nothing you can do improves your overall station there are no permanent buffs you start off with a character set up for failure from the negative stats and hope the random roll of items that all conflict with each other works out in your favor the damage from red bullets and other select hazards is so overwhelmingly large compared to hp regeneration or life steal the only time i beat level 20 was using the starter character who has no penalties and getting very lucky on weapons items box drops etc i have achieved nowhere near that powerful of a character in a run outside of that fluke 

i dont have jedi reflexes and bullet hell is not my strong suit but vampire survivors stands out in this genre because if you just keep investing time you will overpower it eventually this game is just throw 30 minutes at it to suffer the same scenario repeatedly until the end of days

for 4 i got enough play time out of it but i would rather have my time back in retrospect well thats life for you im probably not the right audience for the game if youre like me with handeye coordination ironically like a potato this review is to warn you off if not you might just love it

update there were some updates including endless mode i learned there are options to make the game easier they are under accessibility which is odd these things together made the game more playable endless mode made it feel closer to vs you can get more powerful for a while and then the intake of cash to use between rounds drops significantly i forget if its level 30 or 35 now so endless really isnt that endless its worth the 4 if you want to try an alternative to vs

this game is amazing it feels so rewarding getting higher difficulties unlocking more items for the shop and unlocking more characters jack is prob the most annoying tho
i highly recommend this game if your looking for a way to kill some time and really have fun

#####

so awesome 

#####

you kill aliens

great game 1010

#####

brotato is in the vampire survivors universe of hordedefense games with roguelite elements its my favorite of the genre because each game feels engaging and challenging and the play style and draft preferences change dramatically based on the class youve chosen theres meta progression in terms of unlocks but its not strictly required to progress strong recommend from me

#####

brotato is a mash up of crisp gameplay and loaded weapons items and build options even my nonpotato enjoying friends like watching the game it rules french fry puns are missing however

#####

potaytoes boil em mash em stick em in a stew

#####

aggravatingly addictive frustratingly fun you will learn the true meaning of time waster while playing this game as infuriating as it was i had a helluva good time very simple concept abundant in value you will not stop till the fat lady sings yes i do recommend

#####

after winning danger 5 on about half of the characters ive noticed that there are only a couple of ways to build no matter what character you choose the developer has nerfed pretty much anything other than defense out of the game if you roll down for damage every round you might keep up but you waste 20 minutes every time you have just one bad buy round which is to be expected pretty much every run judging by the history of the games development they will probably nerf defense even more making only 1 or 2 very specific build actually work

#####

i played this game for maybe like 45 hours and it was fun
now for anything after that  not really its just boring and difficluty is made that way if u dont follow what it strong then you are not winning
you cant make fun builds you cant make strange builds nothing works only same one builds that you have to follow with exact same characters
from that typ of game u kinda expect more than that
but it was fun for 4 hours

i found this to be fun for the first few hours but it quickly got repetitive  part of the problem is how rng dependent a run can be with certain highrarity items totally breaking open a run especially if gotten at an early enough wave  yes rerolls are pretty generous but there are so many items and weapons that rerolling doesnt let you search for specific items just toss out the trash  its not a bad game and its priced aggressively so if it looks like its up your alley then you might still want to give it a shot  really this is a case of the binary updown doesnt work and i give a solid vote of meh

#####

brotato has a highly addictive gameplay loop with fun weapons and hilarious characters potatoes all with their own unique playstyle
difficulty levels add more nail biting moments and completing said levels opens up more potatoes and weapons
i highly recommend playing brotato

side note if the autoaim is you biggest complaint you can change it to manualaim in the settings

#####

it should be named eggtato i cant help but feel like a killer egg of destruction everytime i play

the gameplay loop is simple but addicting and entertaining with lots of options that every run feels a bit different

#####

tens of hours of intense fun interesting discovery and build and gameplay diversity

#####

you know how there are people who thinking rng in isaac is bad this is the game theyre actually thinking of

its fun at first but this game has godawful rng it could be a lot of fun if you actually had control but you dont player agency is almost nonexistent unless you play a tank build which is boring and still incredibly inconsistent the real killer is the more stuff you unlock the worse the game gets as the item pool increases your chance of a given run being able to make a functional build plummet most of the time youll just find yourself stuck unable to buy the items you need to either do damage or survive meaning you cant make more money so you cant buy even barely helpful items and on and on really bad

#####

pure potato dopamine
its a great addition to the action roguelike games lots of different potatoes to play from the start and you can unlock even more  so there are a lot of builds possibilities if you like games like this is a nobrainer  get your brotato today

#####

at a glance brotato is about dodging bullets however the more interesting half of brotato is the decisions you make while youre not dodging bullets upon the end of a wave you get to choose how to allocate your character stats and which items to buy from the store should i increase my damage or my defense shall i save or spend my money which items will synergize with my current inventory do i invest in the present or the future these are the kinds of questions youll be answering in between carving through hordes of enemies unlike most bullet hells smart decisions outside of the arena can buttress your dodging deficiencies which creates a more engaging cerebral experience

despite the vast cast of unlockable characters items and weapons brotato runs start to feel samey once you uncover the core mechanics and find the best builds however the journey to discover that formula for success still holds nuance and complexity with some balancing tweaks to increase the viability of weaker weapons i think the game could become even more interesting but for now ill continue to enjoy the soft pitterpatter noise of six smgs firing simultaneously into a deformed purple alien

#####

lit

#####

its just stupid fun theres no other way to put it

a simple game with many choices then running around in circles for 2090 seconds trying not to get killed

#####

 dont make my mistake dont try and do max difficulty all characters you can have a perfectly pleasant 30 hours in this game stop playing games when they stop being fun instead of throwing all your play time into the most unenjoyable character again because of some obsessive completionist instinct i hate the saver character so much i wish id never played this game at all

#####

this game is on the verge of magnificence the rng implementation completely ruins it people talk about builds but youre lucky if you even get half of the things youre after by round 20 well restart and another 20 minutes here we go what a waste whats even more crazy is you see a game like drgsurvivor getting slammed for this yet in brotato people love it people say its unique runs every time which is technically true but most runs are trash and trash is trash is trash

now that point means something because this game is not a build maker in any meaningful way its pure and near totally random dodge the circles and lines within 500ms or you lose half your health but you get some funky fluff along the way those thing you want to dodge theres 100 on the screen at once everything else is just janky broken rng you have to play over and over again to get an even remotely fun build lets not even talk about all the amazing possibilities you might see one of by 3000 in some characters are relatively easy to d5 others are just not worth the time unless you really like going wasd and if you do there are just better games that reward your time more 

its a weird one as the game is almost stier but the decision to ruin the fun of build making solidly shoves it down to ctier its bizarre as i love idea of the game and want to play it then i do and i remember why i shut it down every time its just a waste of time 95 of runs there are some many cool items and synergies that can be made but you have no influence on it so you never see them come to light well maybe if you sink 3000 hours into it you might see one but why bother when you can play another game how many times do you play ranger start with smg and never see one again far too often

pool weightings per character should be fixed the only character that should be this random is the starter generic character its 2024 and somehow devs are still thinking like a tiktok algorithm and just trying to keep people playing mindlessly rather than having actual fun while it is fun for a bit the achievements tell the tale most people arent even completing most character on d1 let alone d5 i wonder why that might be

save yourself some time buy a d20 and when you want to play brotato have a roll did you get a 20 wahey you won good job not a 20 you now have to randomly press wasd for 20 minutes or dont just skip that part just like you should here

what on earth is the between game progression also this is the ideal opportunity to let the player level up and spend points on increasing weightings for example want to play king with a good chance for med guns for some weird reason great you do you man instead you get to play ranger given melee weapons for 20 waves i dont get it the devs have missed so many shots here im shocked

#####

i was impressed by the creativity and fun factor of the game took me about 26 hours to complete with one class the gameplay is simple and intuitive but the levels get progressively more challenging as you progress through the 20 waves the graphics are colorful and simple and the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat
the game consistently keeps you on your toes with new enemies and items to interact with the environment
overall brotato is a fantastic game that will provide hours of entertainment for players of all ages the combination of challenging gameplay charming visuals and potato themed antics make it a must play for anyone looking for a fun and unique gaming experience

#####

this game is like an abusive partner who keeps beating your ass and making you feel like shit but you keep going back because youre addicted to them

#####

bought the game like ahhh yeh 6 what of it right
played for 7 hours without realising it had been 7 hours
gifted 2 of my mates a copy each
1010 would recommend its just plain simple unadulterated fun and thats sometimes all you need

#####

i waited to test everything with the recent update and here are my thoughts after clearing everything through endless mode highest i got on the broken potato gun build was 100 so im decent at this game id say take what you will but here are some things to consider in terms of longevity of this game overall it is a fun and addicting game but it has a few fundamental things that should be repaired

1 endless mode is useless currently

unless you have a ladder ideally for each potato that people can rank in then endless mode is meaningless in the previous build you at least had a reason to try to do it to see how far you could get with the game breaking setup but now thats been nerfed there really are no incentives to doing endless mode why bother theres no reward no extra stuff no rank nothing there should be more ways to break endless mode imo or at least a ladder because that would make it fun again

2 too many glass cannon builds in this game

the designers are in love with frantic glass cannon type playstyles i get it it can be fun but practically every hero in this game is played that way with the exception of less than a handful even the new golem is basically a glorified glass cannon because you cant heal at all so you are just a glass cannon with a little extra layer of glass dumb even the heroes that are typed for hp regen and tank mode like bull are totally not in pace with the damage scaling of the game there are very few defensive heroes in this game and too many glass cannon builds

3 engineering should be better

this will tie into the next point but even the engineer which supposedly is specialized in engineering has nothing on other classes that can manipulate economics in their favor it is lackluster because the choices for turrets are pretty minimal and there are very few items that can make engineering fun or viable into endless mode the recent update added the pocket factory which is cool but overall engineering is just not that inventive and could use more build variety item variety and relative power it can have its moments but overall there are no items to make it scale in the way other things get scaling and this is what should be fixed to make it viable for endless

4 economics classes are broken

any class that has vast economic privileges far outpaces other classes to the point where its ridiculous loud thief can do practically every build in the game better than those builds because his economy is so strong same with entrepreneur and anyone that can ramp up econ if you can manipulate the shop in your favor this game is very much about items in other words being able to get a ton of items far outpaces and outweighs whatever benefits you may have inherently in the character this is a problem because ultimately it reduces the game to a few classes after the novelty has worn off of trying some new toon

5 range is way better than melee

again reflective of the glass cannon style of play the designers seem to love melee is not nearly as interesting or effective as ranged imo ranged has so many advantages on average because ultimately damage in this game is very punishing and it is also governed by rng melee can run through a group of monsters and get 0 hits or it can get 3 and almost die i still dont understand what determines these events after all my hours of play because it seems totally random which is stupid

6 rng is rng is rng is rng

there are times when you can have a great run but you didnt get one simple item and by a particular choke point ie wave 10 or boss at 11 that great run you had is practically useless heals splash damage are examples it is a slot machine game so it is what it is but there is so much rng that at times it is frustrating between the shop the way the bosses can come either at wave 11 or 12 the upgrade choices etc etc not sure how to fix this directly because it is more a matter of small tweaks but maybe people like having to gamble their time away which is another problem altogether

in the end this game needs endless mode fixed and that will solve many of these issues

make a ladder for each potato and let us rank globally on these ladders so theres a reason to play all the characters after clearing them on danger 5 because most of them are useless for endless

add items that allow scaling for various things which are not in the game like engineering scalables so that other builds can make it to farther rounds in endless once you implement a ladder then you will see which ones are lowest rank and can adjust this way

my two cents

#####

i really wanted to love brotato the concept is cool but the game is frustrating first i always feel you get too much trade off than gain when you get a new item also the map is empty the waves are very repetitive and it lacks variety if you compare to games like vampire survivors with its secretsunlocksmaps or halls of torment with its gearsaccessories theres a saturation of roguelitebullet hell games and brotato offers too little to be unique hell i prefer holocure which is free than this game

not recommended 510

#####

my vote for best game on steam deck award

#####

honestly there are just better bullet heaven games out there this ones good but the lack of progression between games is a huge turn off for me

#####

 now i am become death the destroyer of worlds i am potato

potato 

#####

nice game u can put a lot of time into it and grinding the difficulties with every character nice variation in characters and buyables would recommend

#####

it physically hurts to loose late game stages of brotato run due to your own stupidity and false impression of own immortality the pain lingers for hours and the disappointment haunts you for days you wake up in cold sweat and remember that perfect rng you had with items levels and how splendidly you screwed everything up
i10 points of selfhatred and inner pain out of 10i

on a more serious note the game is really great 
ubmusicbu is amazing very energetic and puts you in the right mood for the game game sounds are very comfy and nice
ubvisuallybu the game is very eyepleasing animations are very simple they dont distract you as it should be everything looks very smooth and polished
ubgameplaybu could seem repetetive but you actually have a lot of options how play
olist
   1 there are bunch of weapon types and weapon classes each one is unique weapons have on hit effects kill effects knockback class bonuses26 of the same type will provide you additional stats for example different range and number of projectiles projectiles can pierce ricochet melee weapons can hit multiple target in one swing etc you can be melee ranged or you can play around turrets and mines you can focus on elementalmagic dmg you can choose weapons that deal dmg based on your hp
olist
olist
   2 there are bunch of characters or better to say brotatos each with its own specialty and playstyle you normaly can have 6 weapons but there are characters who cant have weapons but they explode when hit some can have only 1 weapon some 12 there is even a pacifist brotato who benefits from not killing enemies

   3 each time you complete a level you get to choose how to lvl up and what to buy and you never have the same run

ubconclusionbu
for me its a mustplay game from the genre very enjoyable to watch and to play
definitely recommend to everyone who enjoys this type of games
not easy not insanely hard good balance

ps nominated it in 3 categories for the 2023 steam awards

#####

i do not enjoy potatoes that much but this game is quite fun

#####

fun game

#####

he not built like a french fry but the gun bullets are

#####

it was good it was fun then the 31 october patch came out and now its no longer fun

increasing the difficulty by x100 is not what i can say is fun i was passing difficulty v with a few characters and now i cant even get to wave 11 anymore with any characters

#####

its got tremendous variety and sufficient difficulty right from the start no grinding easyboring games to unlock the good stuff though there are also plenty of interesting unlocks  mostly new characters that play quite differently

#####

better then baruto

#####

if you like games like 20 seconds till dawn and vampire survivor youll love this i personally like this one the most by a large margin theres just something really satisfying about the different characters and the crazy builds you can do 

i highly recommend

#####

this little potato taught me to be the best potato i can be

#####

i got bored of this really quickly your mileage may vary

#####

great fastpaced action roguelike potato game 
im not good at it but i really like it 

#####

a very skillbased roguelite wave shooter thingy very satisfying and fast gameplay wastes none of your time crunchy sound effects great performance etc 910 so far for ea

#####

5 and 50h fun absolutly worth

#####

easy to start tough to master the best way for a game like this to be

#####

i dont know why i bought this but it turns out to be super addictive and im loving it loved the mechanics and the music is just oof you can go smash smash pew pew or both bet you will enjoy

#####

brotayto

#####

its an interesting game and can be fun in very short sessions overall the game is very luck based as i either get good perks weapons or i dont you can pretty much tell by wave 8  10 if you need to just quit and restart the problem is the game feels like a waste of time quite often because of this i can tell they want the game to feel challenging but it just comes off as obnoxious because its not really skill based i am coming into this without reading any guides or watching any videos on how to play i think this is actually making it more fun

the biggest perk of this game is it not a vampire survivors carbon copy i love vs but wouldnt want a clone with a new name and different skins

#####

vampire survivors walked so brotato could run 1110

#####

warning this is not a game it is a time skip machine which as soon as you press play transports you 10 hours in the future ive burnt 10 hoursday for the past week who would have thought that a potato with 6 arms wreaking havoc among aliens could be so entertaining

1010

#####

it gets boring fasssttttt

#####

great vampire survival type of game
can cause addiction
satisfying sfx and animations
great music but sadly only couple of tracks  so far
defnitely reccommended

#####

not balanced that well imo
i really struggle to enjoy this game

vampire survivors is much more fun and by now there are a lot of games like this so i recommend get a different one

on the other hand its cheep

#####

nice quick game with a lot of variety for such a small game
if you like rogue lite games this one is for you

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2912044275

#####

just finished this game played every character on max difficulty and beat the game 5 is a steal vampire survivors and co are a joke against the depth of this game 

#####

fun for the first 4 hours or so but after a lot of unlocks it gets very hard to rng the items that synergizes with your build and the games become very stale and hard 
 the devs should reduce the cost of rerolls for every unlock you unlock the game should reward your achievements not punish it

#####

what you see in the videos is what youre getting one very bland square map with no obstructions or dangers to avoid mass using 12 of the same type of weapon your only build diversity depending on the character this repetition is more evident with time played this has made beating every available character your only progression or pushing the high difficulties so boringexhausting 

till then you dont even need to get that indepth with synergies and number crunching as the reviews are making it appear so long as youre generally buying the same important stats you can make a build work till the later danger levels mostly rng dependent dont get me wrong its a good game but its just good not what i would call overwhelmingly good as the rating would have you believe with how popular this genre has now become its better to find one that has more varietyflavor in it

#####

mechanics seem pretty solid and theres a reasonable amount of build variety but the game sorely lacks a personality compared to similar titles like vampire survivors or the binding of isaac 

arenas are small claustrophobic and are nothing more than barren lands bigger maps with some elements would make a massive difference not just for aesthetics but gameplay variety too 

brotato desperately needs some character and maps which offer more than just being empty landscapes the foundation is somewhat here but it needs much more to become a great title

#####

well good game for me  very awesome
a quite engaging and antistress game the game is simple in some cases but it provides tons of characters and different builds to try if we take the price into consideration why not give it a try
as for the cons i think the build is rather straightforward and lacks of combination and combo and after passing each danger the game unavoidably becomes boring and unattractive i will recommend this game if you decide to play it at fragmented time and wont play this game for a long time
i personally wont tag this game with hard compared to other similar games passed danger 5 after 45 hrs using loud  ethereal builds its easy to reach high attack speed  max hp  damage

#####

in the land of move character while it auto attacks games this one is way up there in terms of fun and progression  dont hesitate to get it if you like these games at all

#####

fumbs up

#####

the game is addictive in a fun pickupandplay way it has excellent music and an enjoyable gameplay loop that has a surprising amount of headroom for skill growth in terms of picking your powerups and utilising movement when you hit a difficulty ceiling and your progress plateaus however the game edges into frustrating timewaster territory 

but despite issues peaks and troughs of progress and some truly brutal difficulty the higher you go it is hard to put down as the sense that your next bit of progress is just over the horizon exists perpetually 

is this manipulative yep but while its harmless fun its very accessible harmless fun

worth the entry price

#####

elajjaz recommended this game to me
yes gud game

#####

fun

#####

h1brotato is a game about a potatoh1

a potato who wants to make it big in the world of bullet hell games but hes not quite there yet he needs your help

you can play as brotato and throw rockets use your fists or just run around in circles like an idiot
whatever you choose itll be fun because the game is wellbalanced and easy to get into
and what makes this game really stand out well there are a ton of combos you can discover and since you have to unlock characters it makes playing even more fun

if youre looking for a ton of fun and standout in the newevolving genre of horde survival games well worth the price

#####

the fact this has overwhelmingly positive shows just how starved the gaming market is

but genuinely good game for an extremely cheap price id happily even pay 10 or 15 bucks for this



#####

best 5 euros of my life

#####

you gotta get this bro

#####

taters precious

#####

fantastic rougelite shootemup with diverse character builds and impactful decision making that will define your run 

highly recommend 910

very fun game to play

lots of content and builds to try out as well as new mechanics added to the genre 

cant get a much better timemoney spent ratio

#####

very good


#####

i am leaving negative review for one simple reason on the highest difficulty the game is straight out rng and you only as a player have too little effect on winninglossing you either get rng you need in shop and in arena or you just dont and lose so instead of fun rouguelike experience making best of what you get to win you get fuck you experience you just play this game like a lottery game  you invest lots of time and maaaaaaaaybe you will win once in 50 attempts in broken run chimp monkey could win

#####

brotato is an exciting new entry into the action roguelike genre the games that followed ten minutes till dawn vampire survivors and twenty minutes till dawn what makes this one different is a smaller set map size a steeper difficulty curve and a lot of options in build choice as you are buying upgrades and leveling there are investment mechanics so its more along the lines of autochess economy management than this level gated upgrade system this games an easy 5 buy if you like this genre its in early access for balancing new maps and new items while at twenty hours ive barely even touched the surface

the game is a buttery smooth experience the controls are easy to understand and there are accessibility options if you dont enjoy the brutal difficult at just flat 100 difficulty scaling this game is just thorough in its execution excited to see what updates build on

#####

while brotato doesnt upset the genre or move it forward its super polished and high quality

 lots of characters and while some are samey the majority push you to play in a way you might not otherwise
 decent variety of guns upgrades and stats but feels kinda small considering that the character generally pushes you to focus on a small subset of the overall pool
 not a big variety of enemies but thats ok because im usually thinking more about my build
 smooth difficulty progression
 great art style and just enough visuals that i dont feel overwhelmed by noise ie its a good balance

dont wait for a sale just buy  its just a ton of fun for a low price

#####

very fun cant stop playing good soundtrack

#####

wavebased vampire survivors with a shopping phase between each wave tons of items and characters to customize your run lots of fun

sound effects are great whether youre punching something in the face or unloading an smg music is good

i find it difficult to boot up vampire survivors and strap myself in for 2030 minutes on a single run brotato runs can also take 20 minutes but each wave is 2060 seconds and you get to upgrade your tater after each level way easier to pick up and play

#####

belgian fries or french fries
i guess well never know
because this potato will remain a potato

#####

boil em mash em stick some guns on em and kill everything

#####

it starts great and the endgame just turns to ash in your mouth what started as amazing fun ends up being an exercise in frustration as earlier difficulties become too easy without any kind of progression system or reason to continue where youre having fun and the final difficulty has build tolerances so fine that playing outside of any current meta requires even more rng luck than the vast pile you need to succeed with boring rote meta you have to grind out over and over every time i start up this game looking to have fun i just end up with the same frustrating experience

specifically elites and bosses completely ruined the fun of this game just go play vampire survivors

update for 10 nothing changed

#####

there is absolute no progression you unlock nothing but characters
it all depends on the random weapons you get all characters play the same

#####

my opinion on this game
pros
 genious and easy designed
 always takes your interest to finish this game i have the same feeling when i play tboi
 bunch of unlocks including characters
 infinite replay
 alot of random
 cool graphics music and sounds
 price of this game
cons
 none

get this game and enjoy definitely recommended

#####

ask hänno why im here
arcadeshooter asmr 1010

müsst ihr wissen

#####

almost a 100 hours so far into a game about potatoes kicking alien ass never thought thatd be a sentence id ever say or write down before but here we are lol 

game is just fantastic absurd amount of characters and build variety and enough difficulty scaling to allow lowly fries to the hottest spuds get the challenge they need all combined with a banging soundtrack

if you like rougelikes  lites  bullet hells  looter shooters etc you cant go wrong with brotato esp at its cheap price

#####

 huge variety of items
 you can see every equipment you purchase
 many wacky characters to choose from
 great music
 choices become tougher and more nuanced as you progress

 no long term progression except character unlocks
 bland backgrounds
 bland enemies

overall a very good game if youre in the mood for an arcadey vs type game theres enough novelty to set it apart from the others

#####

ever wanted to be rambo potato well now you can be a rambo potato with 6 guns killing monsters wave after wave

really like what vampire survivor this for this genre since i get to play the many alternative to it with different but welcomed changes that every variant provides

a lot of potato dudes with unique buffs and debuffs cool mixes between weapons and items that can give you some op builds

been enjoying some runs and cant wait to see what the developers bring to the table during the early access period and how the 10 holds up

#####

i wasnt particularly convinced by the trailers but brotato is a very solid evolution on the survivors formula with a wide range of build options stats and weapons to consider

there are a ton of characters to unlock with their own ideal gameplay styles and youll naturally find yourself  painting the board in as you complete the game with each of them

its dirt cheap if youre tired of vs and holocure give this one a try for sure

#####

who knew potatoes had a sense of adventure peel your eyes open for this game thats tuberly entertaining 1010

#####

nice

#####

532 hours in and still going

#####

superb  1010

#####

potato is cheaper than a pizza and just as tasty

#####

of course i didnt play thaaaaaaat much yet but i absolutely love it
the idea is great the  graphics are simple and fun and the things you can find are absolutely crazy

i just would love to be able to have a picture of the potatos final form when you lose or something because it is hilarious

keep up the good work

#####

best game of this genre so far

#####

this game is actively trying to destroy its own playerbase everytime someone finds a good build the dev nerfs it into oblivion i have never seen a dev misunderstand its own customer base so badly the whole point of this game is to play over and over untill you get a good run with great rng so you can push further and further the dev will intentionally nerf items and change stat values to stop you from doing that there is literally no point in playing as you will inevitably run into a wall where you simply cant keep up with the buffs the enemies get you cannot get better at the game you cannot get a lucky run this is because any item in the game that works will be nerfed beyond useless any strategy you develop will only serve to inspire the dev to nerf or otherwise sabotage that method

 why would i be motivated to play again for a better run when i know the run will die because the game suspiciously suddenly stops giving legendary drops despite my luck stat being through the roof why would you punish players that want to go into wave 100 this isnt a competitive game it has no esports scene there is literally no reason to balance the fun out of the game understand that its not a skill issue the game now has mechanics in place to kill runs for the sake of killing runs you cannot get better to counter this its hard coded

brotato became popular because of the broken builds thats why people loved it you could get good at the game and push for a good run and become a potato god now you die on wave 36 with an overpowered build because the game refuses to drop the items you need to keep up you heard me right its not an rng thing it is literally designed to stonewall you brotato is boring now

#####

having played multiple games of this genre i am flattered by brotato
it is easy to understand and getting your way around what which stat does thanks to the tooltips is very helpful
very very smooth gameplay
what i also enjoy is the level of difficulty in this game in comparison to other games of this genre brotato feels more challenging right from the start 
the variety of characters and the ways to unlock them is just so fun and really boosts the replayability of this game
i am excited for further content and surprises


#####

i find this game rather unsatisfying one wave youre doing amazing and then you get 2 shot by an enemy on the next wave it ramps pretty fast and not only that but it heavily encourages a glass cannon playstyle even on tanky characters for some its a non issue but the game feels really repetitive a lot of the time

most of the runs feel really samey ive tried different items separate combinations and nothing seems to really set much apart

i feel like theres something im not understanding in the 24 total hours i have playing this game given that its rated overwhelmingly positive maybe its just not for me and hell i gave it a lot of time to try and impress and i dont find myself satisfied with it as most times when i feel i got that real powerful build happening i get shut down by the next wave just about every time

games like this are bound to have rng but this game has rng in the rng it feels i dont consider myself unlucky by any means but this game really makes it hard to even establish any sort of build

a good side of the game is the music it really helps amp you up i find 

it may be a skill issue or something but ive only beaten the game 4 times i havent even gotten to difficulty 5 yet despite how hard ive been trying to get to it but the game doesnt leave me feeling satisfied or happy enough to keep trying

bosses and elites feel a little more tough then they outta be they dont leave a lot of time for error in such a chaotic environment

game could really benefit from something the other games of the genre do which is like some kind of point system on failed runs giving you the ability to get outside of game upgrades that can be toggled on or off based on preferences something small but can really help people like me who feel frustrated by the game


#####

brotato is a fantastic little bullet hell game that kinda reminds me of a mix between binding of isaac and vampire survivors you play as a potato and you have to survive waves until wave 20 and fight a boss to help you along the way you collect items materials and use the materials to buy weapons upgrade them and get passive effects as well its a very fun and cheap game that you can easily sink in many many hours just experimenting builds and combos with characters etc i highly recommend this game to people who like bullet hell games and like a challenge

#####

it is an amazing simple yet complicated indie game amazing choice to play something if you get too many more than 0 zoom meetings cant recommend it enough

#####

a good analogue of vampire survivors in graphics

#####

perfect game for irish people

#####

good and funny game
 play as a potato with guns and weapons
 kill monster to survive
 play 30 different characters  and survive 20 waves
 good prices for a good game
i recommend this game 100

#####

to edit my review after another many hours if you are trying out a build and hope for a specific level one item for it dont hope to get it within an hour of trying
starting to wonder whether the game is rigged or just plain bad
yes i would like to try a shotgun ignition build
many thanks for getting three fire spreads to enemies nearby items
but whould you terribly mind to just already give me the one to actually set them on fire in the first place
i should try the open store mod this is just unplayable
there are too many items in this game  we need a blacklist where you can select stuff that wont drop on your run
50 hours of playing and there are many items that i have seen only once or even not at all many of them high level with luck upgraded well beyond 100
it would be nice to try them but the game wont even drop them for you


old review
a negative reviev after 125 hours played

it is because the system to distibute weapons is crippling your progression
weapons get really scarce in between everything else after you unlocked most of the items
in addition the system tries to be intelligent by giving you more of the weapons you purchased before
this means you get few weapons and no diversity
in turn you cant clear waves fall behind on money and no longer scale either
queue a death before wave 10 at high difficulty

then there is the issue of money no longer dropping after a certain amount of it is on he ground
if you have difficulties clearing enemies it is an immediate hurdle run to try and sneak in between hostiles to collect money
if you just leave it no more money drops what you can collect is very little and immediately you lost your scaling and die in the rounds after

this game also has a serious difficulty problem
yes a challenge is nice
but this is not a triple a title i havent even managed to clear all characters on difficulty 0 let alone 5
after 125 hours

in other words i am tired of grinding my face into a wall without being able to make any meaningful progression

buy it if you can just enjoy playing for a few hours and then drop it
if you are a completionist dont bother

i like potatoes  i recommend this game

#####

if you think about it is brotato truly a potato they are white and have an oval shape 
do you know what else is white and has an oval shape 
exactly an egg
what if     what if brotato was the impostor all along 
this really speaks a lot about tuber society  

#####

brotato is a great game thats one of the easiest of its genre to learn while still being challenging and engaging i like being able to easily see my skills to help me decide what areas to focus on theres lots of variety for different builds with different weapons and stats and the different characters help to encourage that variety gameplay its got a low price tag and lots of difficulty settings including extra settings for difficulties in the menus its a great jumping point to learn the genre

the options menu is still difficult to navigate there is some lack of clarity in regards to some of the upgrades piercing damage explosion damage  its not always easy to see which of the options will actually effect your build especially when youre first starting out its surprising since in general a lot is very clear so why some are and others arent is confusing there are still a number of bugs that im hoping get fixed going forward i am a little worried that potential future updates will be like ea development where things drastically change even though they have a strong foundation to build on rather than change

but these are mostly nitpicky things overall this is a great game it has a fairly steep learning curve but there are tons of settings to make it easier to play around and see what style suits you im really happy to see it out of early access and im looking forward to spending more time plugging away at it

below is the negatives of my old early access review
i cannot recommend the game while it is in early access i would wait until the full version is released every update drastically changes the game to the point i feel as though i have to relearn it from scratch i was playing at difficulty 5 and after an update i rarely managed to get halfway through i figured id have to go back to difficulty 0 to learn the new enemies and game mechanics and honestly i just wasnt interested in doing that i dont really know why the difficulty levels are completely changed rather than just adding more dont get me wrong i love when games keep things fresh but another review mentions that it feels like youve wasted your time learning the previous update which is how i feel about it it feels like less of a new challenge and more starting back at square one the difficulty spikes between updates are wild it feels like a different game and i dont have the motivation to learn everything again only to have to do it all again at any point

ive also experienced a few bugs i keep having an issue where my game crashes just after completing a wave but not saving so i have to repeat the wave this added with the difficulty spikes was extremely frustrating  finally beating a wave only to have to replay it and risk a loss this is where i stopped playing i had another bug where i would sometimes buy items before the shop fully loaded which resulted in items that undermined my build

the options menu is frustrating  rather than being on one page its two separate pages that require you to click first i constantly adjust sound so you would think this isnt a big deal but i absolutely hated it

maybe these are just normal early access growing pains for most folks but for me i really cant recommend the ea purchase  though i wouldnt refund it even if i could really disappointing  great game but definitely wait out for better settings more settled game difficulty and hopefully less bugs and gamebreaking crashes im looking forward to trying it out again once everything is polished

#####

a very fun take on a vs clone with dozens of classes

#####

i really want to like this game i spent 12 hours trying to like this game but as of right now its just too difficult maybe im a scrub but ive played a lot of games like this and ive never struggled to improve like i have with this one i think the main issue is that there is no meta progression so you cant incrementally improve to get over difficulty humps i dont think every game needs meta progression risk of rain 2 doesnt have one and i got every single achievement in that game but i could use one here
so for now my recommendation is to hold off ill probably keep trying as the game gets updated and ill update my review as things change

and to respond to the inevitable comment i know i can adjust the difficulty down but i prefer to advance on normal as the game is intended to be played

#####

its cheap its fun you gun

#####

steam ladder worldwide no1

#####

perfection i did not expect this game to be this addictive and this fun 3


#####

most of the reviews seem to be memes so heres a real attempt at describing why this is as good as it is

this is vampire survivors that plays like a highlevel tower defense game with the shop rerolling meta of ring of pain tldr  someone actually added a skill ceiling to vampire survivors and it actually works

if youve played any td that relies on combining multiples of the same tower to upgrade imagine that your character is a group of 6 tower slots in a hexagon pattern and your weapons are the towers beating a wave doesnt involve killing everything just surviving a specifc duration killing stuff gives you exp leveling gives you flat bonuses to all your stats between rounds you buy new weapons or relics or pay for repeated rerolls to the item pool and the rop strategy of spending 80 of your income on rerolls to get exactly what you want is viable and works well here

if any of that sounded interesting just drop the 5 bucks put on a podcast and zone out its a good time


#####

there are so many different builds to make and the different characters just add to that variety you can also adjust the enemy ai difficulty to match your preferences its a small game but still felt polished with its mechanics you can spend hours on it and its as much fun as the first time definitely buy if on sale and even if its not i think you will get value for your money

#####

every single item in this game has a negative downside barring only a few

some of the items are so stupid like 10 damage 6 attack speed like whoopie whatever dude give me some items that actually matter

the items that matter usually have some horrible downside triangle of power 20 damage but every time you take damage you gain 2 damage which is dumb because these items already have a horrible downside of having a high price point

80 of the items in this game are a noob trap when you download the mod that lets you see harvesting returns you realize that all of the harvesting items give no returns after like wave 6

i just cant get behind the game design of this game i didnt find it hard i just found it frustrating after i realized how to game the system

#####

brotato is the lastest in the current swarmer craze which includes games like vampire survivors

i find this one to be a lot more fun theres an option for twinstick controls which i much prefer the various characters impose serious constraints on how you play and which upgrades will be useful so going through various runs with them is very interesting so far in my first two hours i have not completed one run and there are a ton of characters to go through succeeding unlocks the next level of danger and there are many of those as well

personally i think the developer is way undercharging for this game

i have two very minor complaints
1 i wish i could let go of the stick to stop shooting so that i could coordinate the various cooldowns on the weapons for a big shot on occasion
2 i wish i had more of an indication of when i get hit i find i cant really tell in all the chaos if ive taken damage

if you like these kinds of games at all dont miss this one

#####

potarto

#####

h1now was it first the egg or the potatoh1

brotato is a simple roguelike where you hold up to 6 different guns and kill as many aliens who look like violet lice monsters as you can collecting and hoarding lots of materials in the shape of radioactive green bills to purchase in the shop more weapons or items that match your current gameplay style according to your character and so on until you reach the final wave and slay the final boss you depend only on either ranged elemental or melee weapons each with different properties items in the way gives you different bonus some at the cost of a small debuff but as long as you get your class stats those debuffs are nothing

upgrading stuff and getting the best items aswell as the high tier stat choices every time you level up is the core of the game which is very rewarding to do so provided youre loaded with materials getting the maximum amount with the time you have each wave is a must as purchasing things isnt cheap but you cant get hit several times before dying and with the number of enemies present it feels like a bullet hell once you finally beat the game you can keep on by increasing the difficulty and unlocking more charactersitems the former can make elite enemies appear on late waves but the main issue is that theyre difficult to kill if youre a newcomer without too much knowledge or your character has some limitations but thats the fun here and it is intended for some reason

graphics are very simple and the game is built with godot engine which makes some features to be quite unique like the racking of hatscosmetics into your character the options menu also features a lot of gameplay options and accessibility like hiding the flash explosion or highlighting the enemy bullets the music feels a bit repetitive as there are only six soundtracks but its very energetic and lasts for hours

overall a very enjoyable roguelike with cartoonish graphics and quick runs will make you hooked for hours as i did


#####

brotato is an engaging and challenging innovation upon the vampire survivors formula bringing characters that strongly force diverse playstyles and a large plethora of purchasable items between waves help keep the game fresh and fun for a long while

#####

this is the one youve been looking for

#####

he is more of an egg really shouldve been call eggcellent 810

#####

sadly i feel the free android version of this game offers more content and longplay value then the payed steam version dissappointed that we dont see the same gamemodes and stuff that there are on phone on pc

#####

casual brain off kill everything and have fun 

#####

this game is great 

it plays a lot like all the other survivors type games except i find it to be quite a bit harder   theres more strategy to the builds and the different base characters add a lot of flavour making every game feel different than the last  

highly recommend this one

#####

whilst it still could do with some adjustments brotato is feeling a lot more like it did in the demo and is as addictive as ever

#####

surprisingly high amount of depth to build decisions that keeps things interesting with lots to learn over dozens of hours

#####

potato

easily one of the most replayable bullet heaven games out there so much content  mod support  amazing humor and charm  dope game

#####

super addictive enjoyable gameplay nice sounds and graphics brotato is great to play on steam deck
not a single clone is a mile close to this masterpiece

#####

omg 
me and my wife played like a lot 
i dont like roguelike but i loved this one

#####

sunk a ton of hours into the demo and needles to say i was incredibly excited for early access release i absolutely love this game if you enjoy games like vampire survivors you will most definitely enjoy this

game is obviously still in early access so i am sure it got ways to go with content but it still got plenty to spend hours and hours on if youre into these type of games i personally havent been one to give feedback in terms of balance and such but i know the dev has been very active on updating the game according to feedback and ideas from the community which is a very positive thing in the early access gaming world  big thumbs up

#####

fun bullet hell achievements seemed broken but it was just that the counters didnt track progress after 5000 even though achievement progress continued better instructions on how stats work would have been helpful too

#####

this game infuriates me to no end 1010

#####

i dont know i played 44 hours of it in 10 days this game hits hard

#####

just started playing this game but omg its genuinely the most fun ive had playing anything in a while _ 
 the accessibility options r a godsend
 as someone who gets stressed easily this game doesnt make me want to tear my skin off 
 gameplay is wellpaced  varied
 difficulty is fair
 lacks story which id love to see shown tbh

its rlly reminiscent of early flash games i love it 

#####

you could say ive been getting my moneys worth

#####

absolutely awesome a lot of fun mechanics

#####

potato goes brr

#####

i have a very addictive personality what are you doing releasing these type of games
