we have another digital homicide here folks

the game itself is just more freetowait garbage in the same vein as dungeon keeper mobile  feel free to enjoy the same gameplay as games like wildlife park but instead of being able to actually create a zoo the way you feel you get to place one item then wait for days if you dont pay the ransom  if you do pay then all you get is another wait to try to grind dailies for a tiny trickle of the diamonds that are the real currency

thats not the real problem here however  the problem is the developer who is yet another example of a forum tyrant indie developer who gets upset enough to ban anyone who levels any form of criticism and go through the negative reviews to argue with anyone who leaves a negative review i await your passiveaggressive im totally not insulting you youre just too stupid to realize how totally not fighting with you i am response

you can see the horrible horrible thing i did to deserve my own ban here when i created a thread telling the developer that picking fights with his customers is not exactly good publicity for his game

httpsimgurcomav7r9u

so since he banned me for making any kind of comment and then responded an hour after banning me so that he was shielded from any sort of response to his response  klassy i just downloaded the freetowait game and made another negative review since he cant delete that teehee

that said after pointing out that the game had a negative steam review score suddenly mysteriously the score suddenly jumped up to exactly 40 just enough to get a mixed review score just like all the other games from this developer has  this developer sure seems totally legit folks 

update now that i have the ability to edit this review again i just want to put up that he also flagged this review to try to get it deleted as well  slowclap  also as the developer response states my ban was an accident but then went and deleted the thread that was previously just locked because someone else posted on it after i was banned i got it on the wayback machine first though because i have no idea how i had the foresight to think it might be necessary httpswebarchiveorgweb20180308125614httpsteamcommunitycomapp694130discussions01694914736017534643

that said the games seem to be going in and out of mixed and negative review totals even though the total number of reviews doesnt fluctuate that wildly so it seems like this might be steam being schizophrenic rather than actual foul play at least in this regard

#####

its a facebook game
its slow the tutorial doesnt mach the progression at all
there is premium currency and its esentually not fun at all
enless youre the person that likes facebook games then sure
get it and play it

but after all i cannot recommend it as it is a facebook game and should
stay on facebook not steam

#####

freemium game definite paywall and no realistic way to avoid it

i get that this is not a new concept and many games follow this business model to attract their customers but i feel like if you stick the word free right in the name of your game youre open to this criticism

yes i have a good number of hours into this game and yes ill keep playing it and trying to enjoy it for what it is but a quick look through the mid to late game and the writiing is on the wall about 80 of those things cost diamonds the games premium currency and each one a significant amount filling out your zoo with late game animals and objects looks like it doesnt come close to being attainable from the insignificant amount of diamonds the quests provide or the few other methods of obtaining objects and animals the system of puzzle pieces and trading is like trying to put together a cake with a couple of crumbs you receive daily its nice that they put on events but those dont look like they provide enough to get you very far either

#####

all about the microtransactions no real progress can be made without buying diamonds and the only way to get diamonds is to buy them the developers do pay attention to the game which is nice too bad the developers have never addressed the problem of being able to get diamonds without buying them this is an extremely expensive free game play at your own risk or have an extremely deep money pocket

#####

this game made me think of the facebook farm games that everyone played when they were 12
having to wait 20mins for a shop to build and spend real world money to make things faster is not my idea of fun

#####

free game where you must pay if you want to build something sooner then in one month thx but rly no

#####

typical generic mobile game in which you have to pay for everything

#####

sure its a facebook fremium type game but that doesnt mean its bad i played tap zoo for 6 years well really 2 and then logging in daily 4 more but when the ios updated to no longer accept 32 bit games that game went extinct this is a good replacement and its on the computer which is nice there are more options from what i can tell even though nowhere near the animals offered in tap zoo and no where near the options for pay up front gamesbecause its free its decent enough thoughwish i had the option to make more than one zoo maybe there is that and i havent discovered it id give it either a solid 7 out of 10 but you have to know its a freemium game going in otherwise you will be disappointed

#####

why this shit browser game is on steam 

#####

ultra booooring pay to win or waitforever 

also bad graphics bad music simple gameplay 110

nothing more to say

#####

with 58 minutes game play by children who arent the most efficient at progressing in games the point of necessary microtransactions had been reached  

what an easy way to kill the fun of a game

in games that are made for children microtransactions should be banned  kids dont have money  i know that they want to make money so why not put out the basic game and then have dlcs  

or just make a game and charge for it  im sure that im not the only parent who will pay for a decent game for their kids

but its ok folks they found another version of the game without paytoprogress

#####

meh

#####

takes real life time to build up money which kinda sucks but for those of us who grew up playing zoo tycoon this game is great

#####

this game is like a mobile game where its cute and nice to waste time on however unlike most mobile games if you spend money you dont get much of a value and the game is even more slowed down than a typical mobile game you can maybe spend 5 minutes on this twice a day and get nothing done or spend 20 a day and still not get much done if i spend 20 on a game i want the full version and get to do what i want this game wants you to spend 100s of dollars for something that is not worth it they really need to increase the timers a bit and give you much more if you want to spend money in this im very disappointed but its possible ill keep messing around on it from time to time when i really have nothing better to do

#####

the animals dont even move around their cagepen i can see this game being fun for maybe a five year old but other than that super boring

#####

first off let me say  i do not know the devs or publishers at all so i cant say bad or good about them

i do however know a bit about zoo simulator games such as zoo tycoon and thought this would be worth playing for free i do not think it is

this game is very proor to run on my laptop might be my problem but still does not work very smoothly and to add to that this game is very slow and very poor at what it tries to do

this might not be as bad as people say but it to me was just boring and too slow to play and find any fun in this game it has a decent base to build on but i dont think i will buy any dlc for this game if any come out 

there are much better zoo games on steam and else where  buy one of those and forget this

310

#####

this game is one of those games where you do your daily stuff go away for a while come back build and do more money generates really slowly exp is earn very slowly apprently you cant join an organization til level 15 which takes quiet a while to get to i hate to use the paytowin term on a game like this but a lot of stuff cost gems which are oddly very pricey for a game like this certain animals can only be purchased with gems as well 

cons  
ptw
expensive gems
slow progression 
not much to do starting out
takes forever to unlock items due to slow progression
pros 
can do a lot to customize your zoo if you manage you get the money
laid back

#####

this game is essentially pay to play and it is very slow i was hoping for something very similar to zoo tycoon but this is way too boring for me i really wanted to like it but it is just very dull

#####

im gonna be 100 honest with some of you who are planning to get this game it takes forever just to get a couple of animals you dont get a lot of coins so it takes months just to get a decent zoo size to be able to get a nice sized zoo you would probably have to pay more money than its worth just to get more coins as most of the stuff in the game shop is expensive andor doesnt make you a lot of moneycoins there are better zoo option games where you dont have to afk grind forever or pay a good sum of money just to get the zoo going and you can actually play easier

#####

i deleted this game the only way to get anywhere is to spend actual cash yes you can play for free but you get no where fast they charge outrageous amounts of their zoo dollars and the return is almost nil it costs 5000 just to change your profession in the organizations when you are lucky to bring in 3000 a day if you can afford to pay large amounts of your hard earned cash then go for it

#####

plays like a mobile game i dont recommend it 110 for at least working

#####

if you spend too much money in the game you ruin everything no chance to restart really frustrating

#####

its a mobile game but the quality is ok i was actually excited to play this i love designing zoos but this game just killed off that excitement with in the first half hour

you reach level 4 really fast but then the money is gone and you are just waiting to gain some profit from the kiosks and toilets but those will at the most give you about 24 a minute while the three troughs you need to buy to progress cost 1000 a piece

also they should just skip having construction downtime on building at least in its current form which just screams im a halfbaked mobile game

furthermore the game progression is slow beyond belief i just cant recommend a game this tedious

#####

this is a hostage simulator that withholds game elements from you and if you wait long enough or spend enough money youre slowly given the pieces to complete the game
but the game you will get is no competition for the many many others from the same genre out there 

the ui is horrendous the tooltips cover the tabs in the store so you cant select those when placing an item animal and you dont click on the correct spot you lose your selection and have to select it again its these small annoying and badly implemented mechanics that bring a mediocre game to downright bad

placing a path youll have to do that tile by tile you cant click and drag a path out into a direction

you cant click on your visitors to find out what they want what does the icon mean in the small thoughtballoon i have no idea i had visitors thinking about poppy plants when i didnt have them and after placing seven of them that didnt change

speaking of visitors they wander aimlessly through your park they dont interact with the animals or the stalls shops ive watched the same five people just walk around no new visitors and they dont leave

which leads me to the economic side of the game i stopped playing because i ran out of money no new visitors so no new funds coming in

the music is a boring droning mess but you can turn that off

bottomline this isnt a free game you have to spend a lot of time and energy into it to even get to the game mechanics not worth your time and definitely not worth your money

#####

starting new game every time i launch the game  no savegame

#####

its a mobile game its not even as good as the old zoo tycoon

#####

slow progression unless you pay for diamonds to exchange for cash too many things need to be paid for with diamonds otherwise you dont have access to those items or areas of the game takes way too long to generate enough income for even one enclosure or animal in game prices are crazy for how long it takes to acquire the amount needed for enclosures animals buildings etc

#####

this game sucks its slow graphics are bad the animals dont even move the enclosure that is there is so bad for them it takes forever to do anything and its just a half assed game that is desprate for money

#####

ok game but pay to win predatory pay to win too

#####

literally cant move forward in this game unless you wanna wait hours or pay real money i dont mind games that have in app purchases as long as they make it somewhat playable for those who dont want to spend actual money on games cute game but a waste of time

#####

very nice always used to play the flash version online when i was a kid and nothing has drastically changed so far still the good ol my free zoo im used to

#####

this is an old facebook game that hasnt aged very well if youre familiar with this type of game you know theres a lot of waiting on timers you basically check in a couple times a day do a few tasks then leave im ok with that but this one seems to have iveryi slow progress youll quickly find yourself hitting a wall where everything takes a lot of cash or diamonds to buy it is possible to get some diamonds the premium currency for free but its barely enough to do anything 

with a lot of patience you can eventually build up a zoo but much will remain locked to you unless youre willing to spend a lot of real life cash it is free to try butmeh there are better zoo games out there even other free ones

#####

this is game for your grandma it is so primitive its hurtfull it isnt hard on achievments but you have to put so much time into it it is not harmfull but not fun either usually i would get it very low score but i think its just mediocre also i have little bit of nostalgia if you are action type gamer i would not recomend it 510

#####

upgrading stuff is exaustingly slow  but if you just buy a few diamonds

yeah its one of those  its not as bad as some games elvenar so its still somewhat enjoyable

be patient dont buy diamonds

#####

i hate it no fun 3

#####

it seems more like a mobile game or facebook game than a game you would find on steam it reminds me of farmville from facebook  youre locked out from progress unless you wait or you buy the games money with irl currency honestly there are better games out there that are less predatory on your wallet

#####

yes it is a good game and yes i like men





jk

#####

horrid its a pay to win game  just like simpsons tapped out i do not recommend it

#####

bad game

#####

the reason i got this game is because it was free and i love animals i can understand the aim of the game bt this feels like it should be on mobile and not on the pc the waits are so long i almost feel asleep also the goals are so tiny in the bottom corner that you can miss them by time you realise they are there you have no money you have no way to level up apart from topay a lot  of money into the game to get gems you even have to pay to bulldose if you mess up it costs you to clear a each piece of path you start with a lump of cash but i feel like this game is a waste of time there are much better games like this on androidapple and you do not have to spend half as much to get a quick booster pack 
if you have a lot of time to waste then please go ahead and waste your time play this game if you have a lot of spare cash go ahead and waste it on this game or you could do a good turn for someone

here is why i stuck around i did manage to get to level 4 which was not easy i actually left the game runing by its self while i wwalked away the only thing i had to come back to was collecting water from a bush 3 clicks and i had another 10minute wait for about the same amount of game play there are no tutorials i have no idea if my game is saved so i was reluctant to shut the game to start with no exit button

i can even be bothered with continuing my review sorry just a waste of my time

#####

i really like the game and it does have great potential but the amount of diamonds you need to purchase to get any were is drastic    when you get to your forth land expanion its 80 diamonds only not zd to pay  then the fifth one is 150 diamonds its crazy and its not like you get much land not to mention the amount of real cash for diamonds is crazy 12 bucks canadian for 130 diamonds i am on the fence about this game i really enjoy it and the concept just the amount of diamonds and zoo dollars that is spent is way to much  i am soon to be level 38 and it takes me 4 days to collect 300000 zd

#####

more like a phone game ok to amuse a 2 year old for half an hour but not worth playing otherwise not really free as would need to buy diamonds to make progress after playing 2 hours things would take another 2 hours to build and would need to log in 4 or 5 days to do nothing just to get enough cash to buy a newly unlocked animal etc

#####

this game is boring you cant actually do much as it relies to heavily on cash and when you do buy something to complete a challange you cant even progress unless you are immortal and have the game constantly running you really cant make progression in the game that feels worth your time if you get where im comming from i know the game is free but i would just like to see the game be a bit more enjoyable as the game makes you broke in like a second and you cant do anything to gain money apart from wait and collect literally 2 dollars from your stores how am i suppose to make money in this game

#####

funish but also frustrating and kind of boring theres another game that functions almost essentially the same way that i prefer over this one just trying to accomplish tasks is a task in itself from waiting and waiting to try and get the money in order to get better enclosures so you can have the amount of each animal you want and deem fit for them to be together as well as to make them happy

#####

i really liked this at the start but then it became a frustrating exercise of staring at a paywall saying youll never make decent progress for free and im the first to defend games where just playing can get me pretty much anything some special items for moneyonly are perfectly fine people who support devs of a fun game deserve something special so it would take me a few months to get what others may just buy thats fine i want to play the game after all but thats not possible here 

if theyd at least slap some insane zoo dollar price onto everything alongside the diamond price it would be something to work towards and suggesting a way to get premium currency ingame like ive seen in shop heroes for example just has them say that this is their business model and i can do all sorts of things i see no point in without being able to maximize the size of my zoo and get some decent sized enclosures of all kinds  never mind the animals 

they didnt respond to the suggestion of selling a pile of diamondbought animals for diamonds back to the game instead of getting some tiny amount of zoo dollars for them breeding those animals would be something else that could be done that takes time but allows getting premium currency ingame

hey path of exile for example lives pretty much on cosmetics and stash tabs which i even bought why cant mfzoo devs just make special editions of animals that could be bought with a pack or some special building that lets you get n more xp permanently on all things like that 50 dollar armour in gems of war  i think it cost that much not sure didnt need it but its a nice thing to get when you can donate that much money to the game crusaders of the lost idols churns out golden epicslegendaries regularly and people buy them for an idle game

id even welcome an affordable onetime pack that enables insane zoo dollar price slapped onto everything 5 euro would be affordable or at least 5 euro on sale yes devs need to eat but i do too

as it is i feel throttled and see no point in playing anymore


old review

i was very enthusiastic when this game turned up in my queue and i saw the screenshots just right goto  for some extra rambling

im happy with it what else can i say not helpful i know i want to leave them a decent review

so some basic points and rambling at least

freely place and move decoration like hedges and trees and flowers stalls and shops special items like garbage bins and toilets and of course the enclosures and the animals in them

you can buy enclosure expansions and stick them to existing ones for more creative shaping of said enclosures and redo it when you dump the stuff back into your inventory  it separates enclosure from expansions 

theres a great big variety of types of enclosures and stuff to add to them and from what i can tell they all arent merely cosmetic but also make your zoo more attractive theres also a great big load of animals to add with from what ive seen so far a choice of up to 3 different types of enclosure you can put any specific animal into like you can put a parrot into forest savanna or jungle but obviously not into ice 

its a bit of a shame that you cant put animals that would get on into the same enclosure like sheep and goats for a petting zoo i dont know if at later levels there might be an actual petting zoo though

you can lay paths any which way you like but to remove them or rearrange the layout you have to buy remove path pieces more bothersome than anything and a bit tough to find  might get a bit expensive when you need to rebuy rather than move the costlier types of paths or maybe by then their cost is negligible

there are storytasks to tend and small tasks that pop up now and then that require direct interaction with stuff in your zoo unless you have hired help for that then theyll tend most of those small tasks automatically they wont build new enclosures or place animals you need to be a certain level to build the administrative building that lets you hire folks for different things but you also get a few free ones to test them out as reward for building it which is a storytask 

without hired help things like emptying garbage cans feeding animals collecting money also needs to be done manually anyway gives you something to do while waiting for more cash 

small bonuses turn up at every corner like the treasure chest that gives random stuff after a time which increases with each use but can be reset with gems daily booster pack tending friends zoos and collecting stars for an extra card some of these items are split into several pieces that you need to collect a certain amount of you can also offer to trade these for what you want instead the building for trade unlocks at some level too building it is another storytask

btw friends can only be made on the same language world server you can change world by changing to a different language in the settings for the game in steam but itll be an entirely new zoo from the start there then

lots of eyecandy like cute little animations for every animal shame they stay in their spot instead of moving around and people walking around and stopping to look at stuff and detailed plants 

and last but not least there are great supportive devs also active on the steam forum


so i read tos yeah im one of those odd people who at least scan through it found nothing i object to random sideamusement its very german   downloaded started and got an error made a post about it got a reply within 24h and then one of the devs spent an afternoon in steam chat with me finding the problem my aversion to random cookies found a way to solve it that agrees with my aversion and went on to happily finally play whee
return p 


with some recent examples of a different kind i feel the need to point out that you dont need to give them your email steam login works just fine yay devs


the one thing i really dont like is the sound of the rabbits its just i dont want to hear that plus kangaroos and goats dont make sounds either for example so why do the rabbits but thats it cant complain about anything else 

#####

its a great game but im sick of the errors it happens a lot

#####

this is like when you want to play a mobile game and paytowin only you have to load up your computer and not have it handy wherever you go super bummed by this i can play maybe 10 minutes and then i have to waitor pay

#####

i love this game this game is fun to play and interact with animals learning the game is really easy also if you like building things and interacting with animals like me then this is the game for you
but i get bored really fast specially when im out of money to buy building or decorations

#####

good concept bad engine game has weird hitboxes and bad responses
using blizzard makes the game run crappy and no you cant blame my pc as it is above the requiredment level
any other game i can run on fullsettings with no fps drops mixed about that in this game please improte the framerate of the game its self while using blizzard weather if you want to know my specs
gtx 1060 6gb
i74790 cpu
16gb ram
more than enough to run this game

#####

not as good as wildlife park in general needs work to keep up with wildlife park

#####

i really enjoy playing this game a lot  my only dislike is i can not reset if i feel i need to

#####

its hard to earn money and to level up 

#####

heck no terrible hard to do do not play it or i will come for you

#####

this is designed to get young children to steal their parents credit cards to buy digital goodies

#####

i remember playing this alot when i was younger and its really fun to just start up check on your animals do some tasks if you dont have much time this is great or if youre bored 

#####

hard to play

#####

big stink

#####

not very user friendly do not recommend it

#####

my free zoo is a fun game animals are cute and so are all the decorations

#####

tricoaie

#####

this game is actuaklly isnane

#####

it is a fun game it gives me rolles coaster tycoon vibes it does get boring pretty fast in my opinion

#####

my free zoo is an amazing game to play because i love animals and one of my other games on my other gaming platform is a zoo game also this game is fun to play and interact with animals learning the game is easy also if you like building things and interacting with animals then this is the game for you

#####

wow its time consuming

#####

i was not sure what i expected of this i guess something like zoo tycoon i was highly disappointed it plays more like it was devolped as a mobile or a facebook game there is a lot of waiting around very little customizations and you have to invite friends to play with you it was at this prompt that i opted to stop the game right around the 30 minute mark making money isnt easy at all unless you buy it and i really dislike microtransations games

#####

just another phone appfacebook game where you build something and wait 20 minutes minimum until it is done being built you have to come back every day and click on your animals to feed and play with them as well as water plants you dont collect money as guests arrive so you cant keep playing through the day you have to come back the next day and play again this is where you should hit the fast time button and continue playing instead i was forced to find a different game this is basically zoo tycoon with wait timers and pay to play for the cool stuff

#####

its a cute game but very slow going  cute for kids

#####

the idea is good but it takes so long to make money that it becomes boring

#####

another shitty facebook game

#####

i mean hey its free for waisting time its indeed great 
graphics and the game itself are questionable tho its like ea did this game so much you can only reach with money
overall not the best thing to play but hey better than dying of getting bored

ich meine hey es is kostenlos zum zeitvertreib definitiv geeignet
die grafik und das spiel sind jedoch diskutabel es ist wie als haette ea dieses spiel erstellt so viel muss man ausgeben um weiter zu kommen
alles in allem nicht das beste aber besser als an langeweile zu sterben

#####

 nice

#####

 

#####

not much to do i was over it very quickly

#####

bad game i tried to play it i seen in the first few minutes you had to pay for animals if you really wanted them the game crashed on me and said that it was unsynced with steam every time i tried to load it up kinda like zoo tycoon but much worse

#####

kinda same like old zoo tycoon but this one need to pay boring long  one big no

#####

apla thelw to achievement 

#####



#####

low stress game

#####

my free zoo felt pretty rough for a zoo sim in my opinion it has your standard time based gameplay found in many free browser or mobile games its slow to progress and i already know most people will dislike the game but i feel like anyone who is a fan of this genre of game will find it decent i know this type of game rubs people the wrong way often but there is a subset of gamer who enjoys it

#####

i was having a good time but it kicks you out and says its backing up your game and then refuses to close the tab after waiting for a while i just closed it myself which corrupted it or something now it refuses to play even after uninstalling and reinstalling

#####

best game ive ever played the graphics and the story really drew me in best game ever i love animals

#####

an enjoyable casual builder game theres ingame currency in the form of diamonds that you can purchase but the base game is playable enough for awhile at least without making any purchases i liked it

edit i still like this game great for a free game

#####

there is no way to speed up time because of this it takes forever to build things and get enough money to buy animals i guess they want you to spend real money to buy diamonds to do those things faster

#####

a nice free game  unfortunately you will probably have to learn some things on your own like how the different plants appeal to different ages and genders  or how there is a lot of wasted space in some cases  but overall a good game you can spend money and will gain a lot from it but its not necessary for enjoyment of the game

#####

bad

#####

1 of the worst games ever its so gitchy

#####

best game ever


#####

exciting to see how your zoo grows very creative


#####

fun interactive and free great game worth downloading

#####

amazing reminds me of the first zoo tycoon

#####

having to be forced to make a zoo is no fun

#####

im enjoying playing it

#####

the game is based on you purchasing the diamonds with cash to meet the growing demand of the game  i refuse to spend a dime on a game that freezes up often and needs resetting at least once an hour  usually more often the name free in the name is very deceptive when they put in goals that are impossible to keep up with 

#####

nice lil game to sit back relax to

#####

i helped friends but im not getting credit for it game keps showing erra


#####

very slow going to start with till you build up a steady income but really good if you only play once or twice a day like me  no cons or anything just a reasonably simple fun game

#####

i am very mad right now i bought this for my two kids and they cant play together in real time online multiplayer coop and im going to cry so hard and piss


#####

it wont work

#####

uhh

#####

good game for nothing

#####

chill relaxing game

#####

its ok better then zoo tycoon feeding and watering stuff gives expierence  needs to be saved online with an account like world of warcraft though

#####

u shall not play pls

#####

didnt reach lvl 5 cause there were no button to wash flowers gl hf all

#####

bad 110


#####

the only game my mom let me play thanks mom i love this game mom

#####

no more story quests for me only manged 5 and then the game stopped progressing also had to close the game when planting trees to gain the xp from the mini quests not sure if its a glitch but it is very frustrating overall not much progressin

#####

its fun with lots of cute animals to add to your zoo i like that its not hard to play you dont have to think hard about this game and it relaxes me

#####

sdas

#####

 easy fun game the need for diamonds for a free game takes some enjoyment out of it but fun otherwise

#####

monke zoo

#####

it is good gamebut againits too much time consuming and most of activities are directing to microtransactions

#####

cute game reminds me of the old zoo tycoon

edit review on 31320

been playing this game for months now and its just grinding my life away you barely progress playing for free and the worst part is the currency is way too expensive 

example 100 diamonds cost 15 dollars

220 diamonds cost 30 dollars

some of the animals cost diamonds example 
zebra 2 
crested porcupine 20
ostrich 6
domestic donkey 30
bald eagle 25
wild boar 42
snow goose 66
elk 69

to buy alone one of these animals would cost a fortune but since you need 2 for breeding you have to double the costs this is ridiculous 2 pairs of animals can cost you already 15 dollars and theres over 100 to be bought with only diamonds shortly to be able to get all the achievements and get all the animals in the game youd either have to grind for decades for free or spend hundreds of dollars if not thousands 

this game has an extremely skewed ratio of price vs reward im sorry but its utter trash for the prices it demands for 60 dollars i can buy multiple triple a game titles that offer hundreds of hours fun gameplay and not this martyrish daily eternal clicking grind 

i wish i had never started it for the achievements since a friend recommended it to me im angry at that friend now its a crappy game and i hope either the developers make it more playable or it disappears from steam 

nobody wants these crappy lifesucking facebook freemium games get a life theres better things to be done than spend time and money on getting these digital animals that are not even very well animated

edit 18420

the developers developers like you are just cancer to the community and i wished you and your game would get banned from steam youre just a cash grab shame on you i hope you find something useful to do in life instead of wasting more hours into this but i guess your greed overweighs anything else 

and for the last time all the people here told you by definition your game is pay to win pay to progress etc and from what ive seen written about that the game is the exactly same after almost over a decade and hasnt changed it means you are just lazy and made an addicting product hoping to just make money off of people who havent understood yet how bad this game is and havent stopped playing it and youre not even fixing some basic bugs that shouldnt even exist after these many years 

all those hours that people waste on games like these should go to advance humanity we have so many global issues that should be addressed but you just target weak souls to occupy their attention shame on you

#####

very good price
nice aminals
1010

#####

way too basic

#####

its games like this that make me want net neutrality to get revoked 010 get an app thats twice this quality

#####

this game has no place to change the volume and sometimes there will be bugs popping out

#####

this game is trash its pay to play and thier lot better zoo games on steam then this wet dog shit mess

#####

super nice free to play pc game i realy like it you can play it

#####

while the artwork and concept are appealing im going to have to say no on the recommendation i have played much better free to play games like trove hearthstone cubic castles and pokemon tcg online based on entertainment and how much microtransactions affect the play my free zoo is parasitic for transactions and doesnt have much to do without spending two weeks wages while it might be possible to play for free it is tedious and requires a lot of maintenance throughout your real time day  which most gamers dont want if you like this concept i recommend sticking to zoo tycoon or wildlife park

 i really really hope that the developers of this game will listen to this sound advice

 shoving a sales page in a players face before theyve had a chance to play on an advertised free game is just rude who in their right mind is going to buy something they havent decided they like or not not happening here

 nobody likes waiting around to play a game 

 people looking for a free game arent going to have 80 to throw around for a minimally entertaining game that is way too much for a transaction which is not oneoff for a game which is poor in terms of entertainment however you might have been able to squeeze 10 from more people looking for a free game for the same offer as the 80 deal i dont believe in developers working for free but i do think they should offer a fair compromise in payment

#####

i like this game the graphics are old and pixelated but it gives me a nice feeling of nostalgia 

its very playable without a premium account there are no intruding advertations you get some small pop ups when you open the game that suggest you to buy diamonds this is not necessary at all there are some non disturbing small buttons where you can click to buy diamonds its still a lovely game without diamonds
since its totally free if you like zoo tycoonlike games and dont mind older graphics give it a try

so i played this game months ago but im writing the review now because i dont know either this game is not intresting and thats why i have less than 5 minutes in it i dont want to write in my review cringe because im not a random kid who is edgy and when he dont like something he thinks its cringe but whatever i personnaly dont like it u have to spend so much time in it i found this game so random im not even that type of player anymoreif you go in my profile you will understand what type of player i am when we were kids i played on my phone diffirent free games from the google play so im not going to fully hate the game because of the nostalgiai personally think there wasnt put effort in it or im wrong
i give this game an 210
if my review was dissapointing dont mind me im just a random guy in the society
if u like it then play it no one should stop u i am just expressing my opinion
if i have made mistakes in the review sorry for that

#####

game would not even open

#####

my free zoo is a nice little zoo management game
the graphics are welldrawn albeit relatively small and the gameplay is selfexplanatory

in many respects its like a clicker game  you start off being able to do a lot relatively fast to draw in new players but then the game slows down and it becomes a long grinding process which encourages players to start spending cash to move on quickly
however you dont need to spend money if you dont want to  just treat it as a game to visit for a few minutes each day or whenever you feel like it
just be patient and settle in for the long haul

the game is free so it wont cost you anything to give it a try

in the game placing animals will attract visitors to your zoo who will bring in cash which you can then use to buy more animals
animals have levels the higher the level the more popular the animal which attracts more visitors buying animals cost ingame dollars but sometimes youll get animals for free via the games card system
placing animals into the zoo require enclosures which cost ingame dollars the more advanced enclosures will increase the zoos popularity level
stands can be placed to garner yet more cash souvenir stands hamburger stands etc when you level up you can start to place shops and generate even more cash
toilets also generate cash as you get money every time a visitor decides to spend a penny
rubbish bins generate xp so make sure you clear them regularly
you can also place flowers bushes and trees to increase your zoos popularity you get xp when you water them

the more animals plants and stalls you have the more money and xp youll get
obtaining experience points xp enables you to level up in the game
levelling up enables you to access different animals and other zoo items the higherlevel items will earn you more cash and xp

card drops are given when you log in each day as well as when you click on your treasure chest
when you start the game you can click on the chest every few minutes but the waiting period increases each time you click on it until eventually you have to wait for hours then days until you can click on the treasure chest again presumably if you play the game for a long time the waiting period will eventually turn into weeks and months  but the chest is only a small part of the game anyway

at each stage of the game you will be tempted to buy things for diamonds the more expensive form of ingame currency  this is where the developers make their money
when you log in to the game there is often an advertisement to buy something with diamonds a great bargain  of course to get those diamonds youll need to spend some real world cash
you get a few diamonds for free at the start of the game which introduces players to the concept and might encourage some people to buy some more spending real money
there are a lot of things in the game which you can only buy with diamonds but do not despair gentle reader for there are also game pieces available which you can accumulate which can help you to obtain hardtoget items

to play my free zoo either be prepared to spend money on it to advance in the game or be prepared to play it with a degree of patience as you slowly grind your way up the zoo levels
if you are someone with a lot of patience then go right ahead and enjoy playing the game on the other hand if youre someone with a lot of patients youre probably a doctor or a nurse  excuse the bad joke i couldnt resist it

in summary my free zoo is a nice game but youll need a lot of patience to deal with the inevitable grinding if you can handle that then you should find it to be an enjoyable zoo management experience

bad game

#####

i love this game is an relaxing and exciting game


#####

i like this game however it is a slow pace game you cant earn money to level up you have to sit and waite for the game to give you money

#####

good little game to pass the time and relaxing totally addictive and best thing is its free you have the choice weather to purchase diamonds in game but just completeing tasks gets you them for free its all down to how you play it

#####

used to play this as a little kid but i still love it when im stoned 3

#####

no jst no

#####

its a shittier freer version of zoo tycoon  honestly its exactly what you think it is  but i had fun

#####

good game why all the hate brah

#####

#####

my free zoo is a facebookmobile app time managementscreen tapper with a heavy microtransactionpaytoplay cancer infesting it 

they might as well have just dumped farmville on steam  this browserphone cancer doesnt belong on pc

#####

#####

my review of this game is that its boring i honestly only played it for 20 minutes before i was bored but i suppose its kid friendly so lets just leave it to the children to enjoy this game but i doubt id recommend this game since i didnt enjoy playing it

#####

not gonna lie kinda sucks
the path design  setup that you start with sucks and you cant just rearrange them you have to buy a thing to remove them then buy more paths game progression is sooo slow

#####

reminds me of the older games not bad

#####

i love this free game with super cute animals building the zoo is fun but this game takes time if you dont want to purchase money and diamonds

#####

this game isnt the best and here is why
my free zoo is horrendously glitchy and has spelling mistakes everywhere
if you look at my screenshots you can see that i found a spelling error within the first 5 minutes of me playing the game
also i could not figure out how to rotate objects how do you do it
it does not tell you what any of the controls are
and why is logout the quit button its quit not logout
and yes i know that this game is free but please avoid it


#####

i cant recommend this it looks cute on the outside and it is but to get past level 2 you need to do in game purchases so im guessing thats why its free

#####

i lke the game but paid for diamonds 3 days ago and didnt get them

#####

pretty great

#####

good

#####

made me touch grass from playing this game  looks like it was made by a steam greenlight  developer  looks like a mobile game and facebook moms and mobile gamers will surely grind a lot from this game easy to obtain the achievements if you are a mobile gamer i regret playing this game and nothing is fun playing this game

#####

its fun


#####

  my free zoo reminds me of early facebook games but somehow its more restrictive and less fun than those the creatures feel more like objects they are incapable of moving from the spot and orientation given to them and though i noticed a nice animation for the pig thats about it the music was annoying after 5 minutes and i can only imagine thats a slippery slope to torture by anything more than 15 hours in even simple things like button mappings dont exist with the addition of microtransactions any soul that might have been present is no where to be found

  i will admit i was hoping for zoo tycoon but even comparing this to something like farmville a game it more closely resembles it seems devoid of fun for anyone of the who has created a steam account as i would believe they would be aware of the concept of fun in regards to computer games

#####

this game is my personal hell i had the misfortune of playing it as a kid and now i crave building the zoo of my childhood dreams i adore it and will keep playing it but im not willing to put real life money into it which makes progress painfully slow do yourself a favour and dont get into it at all im out here in the trenches

#####

расслабляющая игра

#####

one of gameonly this one which ran smoothly on my i3 pc

#####

i was a big fan of zoo tycon but i am still looking for a fair replacement and thats not it
until about level 6 you can make fast progress but then it is the type of game you have to log 3 times a day for 5mins and do repetitive tasks as said in other reviews its like a mobile phone game it is fun at the start but then its not worth it i wish you could just pay for the game and then enjoy it ill give it few more days and see if i drop it completely

#####

wow its expensive to play this game for this reason i can not recommend this game i dont mind spending money but this is ripping people off sad because i was enjoying it until i say that i had to buy expensive diamonds over and over again to progress in the game and its glitchy thanks but no

#####

love everything animals a specially it is a layed back game got plenty to do years of work and fun very excpensive  which is silly get to go to different farms as you go a long

#####

i strongly do not recommend this game
play lets build a zoo instead
like my comment if you agree

first look
seems fun but very slow unless you wanna spend some real money an alot of it its glitchy asf i did some tasks an when i finished them i never got the money from the reward part of the task so starting is not so fun will give it some more time its a free game so thats why the cash grab

over 22 hours in last thoughts
well gave it some time i can say this dont waste your time or money its really just a money grab everythings about diamonds an they show you lots of ways to earn more by buying more ect nothing special in this zoo everything is still slow asf you can buy a different game thats similar to this one think its called lets build a zoo and you get to even breed different animals together to make new ones that games cost 15 bucks you get everything this game you get nothing an have to pay to advance or sit an wait day by day for years 15 bucks i think gets you 200 diamonds wow so cool not 

trash

#####

i dont like it progression is gated takes a lot of time and theres a shop to get you going faster so nah thanks but no it looks fairly nice tho

#####

fun interactive and can add friends too 

#####

this and my free farm 2 are free on steam and very fun you have a challenging farm style game mixed with group chat and friend games that keep the play fun you can play extra fast for money but it is not an unplayable game for free

#####

good

#####

got a little zoo tycoon over herexd

#####

best game of all time

#####

not a good game

#####

i remember playing this game via google a lot back in primary school when i was like 10 years old and the game is exactly how i remembered it being only problem is i have no patience anymore and the game is just very grindy always was just didnt notice it as a dumbass kid dont expect too much if you log in like 2 times a day to collect money and exp youre set

#####

pretty fun and a nice game to play while diong something elsetakes some time for money to generate in the beginning

#####

prices are to high you hardly make any money 70 of animals buildings are purchased with diamonds and you have only 1 diamond per level its a pay to win game and also diamond prices are high as well recommanded only for people with a lot of patient or someone who spent money on games like that

#####

the game is ok only if you like not to be challengedit has so many issues with crashing l have played for a long long time but now the problems are getting worse without help from anyone

#####

amazing d

#####

great game

#####

its not that great it is hard to get money and it is boring

#####

its ok

#####

if you want to have fun but you have no money this game is perfect even though i havent played a lot of it it is fun

#####

whoever expects another successful zoo tycoon wont find it here 
a fb game that lost its way and now is a desktop version 

graphics are silly  not my type but they are ok 
gameplay is mundane the moment i saw unlock with diamonds kinda of dealio i immediately closed the game and started to think on what ill write in my review 

as a game ill give it 410 if you do like these kind of games 


#####

fun little zoo project

#####

i like the game but it gets tedious pretty quickly takes forever to expand and forever to make the money needed to expand i want to play the game but these things really hinder any long term play

#####

this game is super fun and easy to play


#####

brilliant game

#####

simple easy to play for everyone

#####

its a fun game not gonna lie all you do is do task buy animals and all those things

#####

great game

#####

my little brother loves it so recommended

#####

pretty fun free game if you into the zoo tycoon genre this game is for you

#####

it was good and there are shep

#####

it is fun

#####

good retro game


#####

i love this game

#####

not interesting in the slightest

#####

its really fun

#####

the game made u missed gameloft

#####

moje farma je najetá

#####

i enjoy playing it is a bit addicting i wish i could level up organically faster

#####

its alright its good for young kids but planet zoo is easier

#####

very guud


#####

lol its my free zoo

#####

there are still errors in game get frustrating

#####

לא יודע

#####

it is fast moving and has a lot of growth

#####

its a slow game takes forever to get enough money to really be able to do anything i pop on for a few min at a time long enough to tend to the animals then hop right back off there is not much to do except wait until you have enough money and it seems like its a bit hard to earn money 

the missions the game gives you are in short supply it seems you do get mini missions that just give you a little bit of xp but no money  

if you enjoy these types of games then im sure you will enjoy this one

#####

its a mobile game on your pc if you like a game you can run in the background its okey

#####

it was good lots of animals much fun

#####

you can not restart your zoo tried to uninstall and reinstall playing a game is about developing as a player yet you are locked into your zoo

#####

its a fun and interesting little game do need to be patient or spend money

#####

amusing game pretty good balance of play just update your place once or twice a day

#####

i like the idea of being able to own your own zoo and buy exsatic animals

#####

i like the craft aspect of it but hate paying real life  to progress in game

#####

stupid greedy customers wouldnt give me money to increase my zoo
and only 3 quest 
 bad game waste of sundday

#####

noice game  lol

#####

such a great easy little game

#####

super easy to play and to get addicted to 

#####

its a fun little free game

#####

cant log in anymore it keeps telling me an error code saying i need to relogin then it reloads only to do the same thingso glad i never bought anything or i would be very angry

#####

good for kids

#####

great game so far do think the money is a little slow to gain though and the plot is slow and kinda boring but its a good game to have going like while i work and can only click stuff here and there

#####

i realy recommend game for all because its realy calm game you can trade with friends and it have so many different animals so its realy realy good

#####

good game overall

#####

very interactive  i love the sounds the animals make  game play is easy  purchases if you want to  not necessary  minor tasks to complete if you want to  animals dont move around but they are so pretty to look at

#####

seems okay easy to play but no obvious way to restart the game or start over once you figure it out
does get to a point where you are cornered into online purchases so be aware

#####

this game is really nice if you have played zoo tycoon in your childhood you will definitely like this game things might take time if you dont want to spend from your pocket but surely it is worth the patience plus they have variety of animals which makes the game more interesting one of the best free games on steam

#####

easy to play take your time to build the zoo of your dreams

#####

casual little game letting you be creative at the same time slow at times while trying to gain money

#####

interesting

#####

i like the various animals

#####

xeqtr gamesense

#####

slow game but fun to play

#####

slow to grow and pay rewards can be frustrating but addictive for animal lovers and children alike  id recommend for someone who is looking to play something not hugely taxing and creative 

#####

started out cute played for an hour got a well be right back dont worry were saving your game kind of screen stuck there for an hour some kind of error is preventing reload

#####

why do i have 7 hours on this game i dont remember playing it

#####



#####

addictive game its worth a time to spend it if you have free timeday off give it try i recommend this even though it needs money to buy things but you gotta find your way to play this game without spending much money give it a try 

#####

crashed my first time playing

#####

fun game lots of goals to work towards

#####

this is pretty much a game with a very slow build up and doesnt take much time to go through while providing an interesting progression as you build up your zoo

the downside is that so much of it is based on real cash currency that they didnt adapt from facebook and similar services that gave you a slow steady supply which locks out a lot of features unless you pay for it

#####

i thought it might be cute and worth spending some idle time  instead i want that time back  paytowin if you can even win a game like this trash  its pretty obvious theyre looking for whales to sustain the game since they offer for sale a package of their ingame currency diamonds for 325  three hundred and twenty five us dollars

i think everything you need to know about the game is based on that information alone  the fact that theres enough bullshit to buy in the game that could use 325 worth of diamonds is insane  fuck this game and fuck the developer

#####

pay to play and my antivirus flaged it when i accidentally pressed the buy ingame currency button

#####

slow progression money grinder boring

#####

was alright at first but as soon as youre low on money its suddenly a really slow game the pace completely changes thought i would like this game but im disappointed

#####

i was playing this game just to help me wait for another game but this didnt help me at all

#####

seems like a very nice game though i am not sure how long i could play without getting disinterested

#####

cant progress easily

#####

i found it difficult to move or demlish paths the controls are bleh and really boring

#####

extreamly hard to get started very slow moving game only lets you play about 10 minutes at a time

#####

my free zoo 

i started playing this on a suggestion from waies i believe it is from the same developers but i will state now it is definately not the same quality of game this game is poor simplified and very slow  waies i was hooked i enjoyed the game but this version which uses much the same design scheme only with a zoo is very boring 

althought this is a free game i would not recommend it

#####

1 its slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww
2 half ass graphics
3 hate the dimond sales
4 hard to do the tasks in the game due to running out of play money and just waiting around all day long what a waste

#####

this game is a facebook type game farmville reskined with zoo tycoon and its not even good at its job its not good but it could be worse

#####

it takes forever to play again so please fix then i will rate it better

#####

too slow tutorial isnt very helpful and gets annoying

#####

its a slow boring  facebook game with clunky controls and the tutorial is really boring

#####

played tutorial got bored facebookmobile game that has a time to build stuff no thanks

#####

this is totally a phone game

#####

this is just a rip of of zoo tycoon

#####

buy diamonds or do nothing

#####
