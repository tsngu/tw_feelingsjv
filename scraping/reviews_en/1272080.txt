come back in a few years let this one cook

this is painful to say but payday 3 is a huge disappointment in many ways it is a step back from both payday the heist and payday 2 i wont discuss the always online nature the disconnects or the crashes further as these have already been well documented

if you want a tldr just play payday 2 instead for further detail pros and cons are listed below

pros
  some of the stealth mechanics have been improved  cutting windows and picking locks and the ability to combo these mechanics together is pretty cool and there is now increased capabilities without masking up
  the ability to take and use human shields
  the fact that you no longer need to rng roll for particular mask options is a massive upside note that these are now locked behind a terrible account levelling system  more on this later
  graphics and game engine are an improvement from the older payday games
  the game can finally be borderless fullscreen
  the fact that its payday  dallas chains hoxton and wolf are back

cons
  the tutorials are poor  it was easier to figure out the basics of gameplay in both payday the heist and payday 2 without a tutorial compared to completing the tutorials in payday 3 and still being confused
  the music is not terrible but is still a downgrade  i have both the payday the heist and payday 2 soundtracks looped on my spotify not the payday 3 soundtrack
  the menu ui and ux is horrible  navigation filters and changing loadouts are particularly problematic
  the inability to customise and name things such as loadouts and weapons
  the number of heists and their simplicity  at launch payday the heist had 6 interesting and lengthy heists payday 2 had 12 heists some of which were short and harvest and trustee was far too common but there were a variety of approaches and objectives payday 3 had 8 heists almost all of which are watered down versions of heists from the earlier games under the surphaze feels like the exception added two legacy heists were added postlaunch but i would have preferred other legacy heists ported over first instead of murky station and cook off such as first world bank heat street hoxton breakout etc
  some of the stealth mechanics  stand in some arbitrarily spawned circles to hack wifi
  the account levelling system being challenge based is atrocious its now been improved in that you can get some experience for completing a heist but it still feels terrible and unrewarding
  a weapon levelling system so bad that call of duty abandoned it  each weapon needs to be levelled up individually not only do you need to unlock modifications for each weapon individually you then need to individually purchase each modification for each weapon even if multiple weapons share the same modification
  the reduced number of weapons  at launch payday the heist had 10 weapons payday 2 had about 25 payday 3 had 13
  melee has been removed as a combat or cc option its now the same as shouting down civilians
  the fact that the weapon stats are now on a sliding scale with no indication of what they do and what they mean
  the massive reduction in the number of weapon mods which are available both categories of modifications as well as the modifications within each category
  the downgrade in cosmetic weapon customisation options  you can change the colour of the weapon but thats it  the available skins allow no modification to the weapons whatsoever whereas you could still add or remove modifications from skins in payday 2
  the reduction in the number of mask customisation options  base masks colour options and pattern options are all greatly reduced
  the loadout itself  some of the loadout categories are only useful for loud or stealth but there is no option to leave them behind or swap these for something useful depending on what heist you are doing and how you want to approach the heist
  the skills and perks have been massively simplified and it feels like there is less diversity and flexibility in build options
  the ingame currency system  you have to heist for ingame currency to buy ingame currency overly complex unnecessary and seems grindy for no good reason
  loud is not fun  the enemies are very bullet spongey  even straight headshots will not kill enemies on the lowest difficulty and youre no longer helmet popping this is exacerbated by the change to the armourhealth system with nonrenewing armourhealth and a lack of dodge which essentially reduces loud to a cover shooter
  heister ai is much worse in loud compared to both previous payday games  the bots now stand around and do nothing they do not appear to kill anything control any civilians go down and do not pick anybody up although they do now drop deployables such as ammo bags and medic bags
  the really annoying opening cinematic that begins at the start of every heist and is no longer skippable at least the opening dialogue in payday 2 was skippable
  the difficulty in matchmaking for heists  each heist and each difficulty is an individual queue meaning if you queue up for a particular heist on hard and your friend queues up for the same heist on very hard youll never see each other  a straight downgrade from payday 2s server browser system
  restarting instantly queues you back in  you will need to rejoin and requeue if you want to change up your loadout before attempting a heist again payday 2s system where a restart put you back into the pregame lobby is much better
  the difficulty in getting friend lobbies up and running  my and my friends will be ingame and visible but still unable to invite to a lobby via the game we have to invite via steam
  the lack of lobby chat  so even if you somehow get into a pub lobby you wont know if the lobby is loud or stealth until youve loaded in and probably unintentionally ruined the run loading in
  even if you do the manage to get into a pub match everybody gets kicked out of the lobby and back to the main menu at the end of each heist so you cant even make new friends  sad as i made a lot of friends playing the first two payday games
  the removal of ingame events such as halloween and christmas
  the addition of a story mode  payday the heist and payday 2 were more fun because you could do anything you want in any order there was some timelinerelated heists such as hoxton breakout taking place before hoxton revenge however career mode didnt really add much to payday 2 and it doesnt add anything in payday 3 either

we are now 3 updates in but qol still hasnt really been addressed from the launch but they did manage release the first dlc of 1 heist and 3 weapons which costs 50 of the base game there were a lot of payday 2 dlcs but the price and amount of quantity for this first dlc is excessive to me

#####

i cant get my 40 back but what i can get back is my 55 gb

#####

thats karma for preordering the gold edition like the genius i am

never preorder games kids

#####

the only heist here is on everyones wallets

#####

the audacity to release paid dlcs at this point just finish your game first you greedy pigs

#####

pro heist game

con youre the loot

i remember buying the silk road dlc in payday2 thinking this sucks but i want payday3 to be good
i remember playing the beta and preordering the goldedition thinking this sucks but i want payday3 to be good

little did i know even the devs did not share my vision compromises were made for no fathomable reason no care was put into payday3s health or success payday2 was supported for years past the games finale propping up overkill as all their other projects failed and what did they do with this support what promises have they delivered on

not a single one ultimate heisting simulator what a joke 
ive been drafting this review for over half an hour now and trying to find a concise way to list all my issues with the game has been fcking exhausting theres too many stupid design choices to be concise i cant even count the game as a successor to payday2 it doesnt feel like an accurate title there are so many successful elements of payday2 that payday3 ignored for seemingly brainless reasons 

the staff have waved away all of these complaints citing stupid bullsht like payday2 wasnt built in a day even though its first year did about 10x better than payday3s first year is shaping out to be 
we need alwaysonline for crossprogression for the mythical gamer that bought payday3 on two different platforms dont think so 
we need alwaysonline to combat against the many cheaters who abused payday2 abused a coop game get real 
payday2 didnt launch with voicechat either that was ten years ago you really didnt learn that voicechat is useful in that time 

no serverbrowser 
servers being split by heist and again by difficulty fragmenting the alreadysmall community into shards
no playstyle variance 
unbalanced weapons and perks
buggy movement protocols
server instability go ahead say it happens when we broke the servers on day 1 of the beta and days 1 through 5 of the launch despite multiple we fixed it brofist sunglasses messages

hell the exclusive preorder bonus even became a dlc on the storepage does that sound honest to you like a fulfilled promise

overkill has promised up and down that payday3 would eventually be improved until everyones expectations are met but at this rate i think theyre going to run out of funding first considering how much time and money went into payday3s development all i can really say is what a massive disappointment and a real fcking shame

if you want to play a heisting game just go play payday2 they still havent gotten rid of the eos bullsht but its still leagues above payday3

#####

devs present an unready button as a highlighted feature 6 months after the launch of the game

more than 10 years of devs experience with payday2 one would assume they have a solid base to make a new game well no its like they learnt nothing and start from 0

no unready button no voice chat the game disbands your group after every heist etc etc
its a miracle that game keeps even a 500 player count

#####

to preface this review isnt about the server issues those will get sorted eventually
it isnt about the online only they are already starting to walk that back
it isnt about missing features those will come eventually

it is solely about the changes to the xp system

in past games you did stuff in the game you got exp you did more stuff in the game you got more exp you did stuff in the gamer at a higher level you got more exp

but they have decided for some reason that the only way to earn exp for this one is to complete challenges which may seem small but is huge

lets say in the past you shot a guard on standard this might net you 20 exp on hard it bumps to 30 at overkill it maxes out at 60

in three it doesnt matter if youre on beginner or overkill that kill is worth one out of x for your kill x people with x gun achievement doesnt matter if it takes 1 bullet on easy or 1 mag on hard 1 guard is worth 1 guard it completely kills the progression scaling why would i waste my time doing harder missions when i can farm just as many kills on easy difficulty


and thats before we consider that each gun only has so many challenges eventually killing 1 guard with my shotgun is pointless i already killed the max amount of guards with that shotgun doesnt matter that its my favorite shotgun and i love building around it i have killed my 1k guards with it so no more kill exp for me

same goes for missions i am not getting exp for completing a heist i am getting it for completing that heist x times on a certain difficulty doesnt matter if i steal 1 bag or 100 kill 100 guards or 10000 it all just means a single completion and those will eventually run out of meaning too eventually i will only be harming myself by replaying old missions i enjoy


in the 2nd game they had a mission where you could keep making money by cooking meth as long as you kept cooking and stayed alive you could keep earning but they can never put that kind of thing in 3 theres no point in making more meth its still only 1 completion


the worst part of all of this is if they were truly committed to this achievement based system they could have worked around it
as far as i can tell you get exp while filling up each achievement then a chunk at the end one its complete

so they could have had a simply repeating scaling achievements for x kills with every gun x stealth completions and x normal completions of every mission and so on first its 1 completion then 5 then 10 then 100 scaling forever

this would incentivize using different weapons and doing different difficultys and missions without penalizing you for replaying your favorites


at the end of the day they made so many good improvements with three the gameplay feels quick and snappy the stealth changes are fantastic and the new engine looks great

the act of playing feels so good
its a shame they want to punish players for doing it the way that want to

do not buy

half baked game and they are already releasing paid dlcs

h1 simply not worth your effort time or money h1

its worth noting that ive played an unhealthy amount of payday 2 after many hours of payday 2 i came to realise the games flaws but few of those flaws were objective problems so when payday 3 dropped i went in with new expectations
u payday 3 is very different from 2 and thats by design which i respect so ill avoid comparing the two u

currently the game is still without a content update insane given its been two months already furthermore due to starbreeze underestimating server costs the game was practically unplayable for the first few days in some regions

h3 multiplayer functionality 21100 h3
heist and objective coop in payday 3 is very good with many objectives benefiting people working together and splitting up to complete them something i love in other coop games
so whats the problem pretty much everything else
the party system is a pain to use and causes a lot of unnecessary stress
apart from that with friends the coop is to reiterate outstanding however payday 3 pubs are to put it simply not an option
due to the games astonishingly low playercount spoiler dead game spoiler finding players in pubs is a lost cause only some heists on certain difficulties have consistent player counts and even then this games social features are downright hostile
text chat is limited to when players are in a heist not the lobby screen or end screen furthermore text chat is not worth using as a large portion of the games playerbase that being console players cannot use chat or even see text chat messages also no voice chat this makes coop more or less a lost cause in pubs
and worst of all no server browser unacceptable for a game like this your only choice when choosing a heist is difficulty meaning if you are dropped into a stealth lobby when you wanted to play loud too bad not like you know if people want to play stealth or loud until the heist starts either due to the lack of lobby chat
and once a heist is done get out no text chat there no steam links and you are on a minute timer anyway leaving no way to continue playing with a party you just played with for a multiplayer game its astonishingly lonely huh
and no the team ai bots are not good in fact im convinced they are designed to encourage players to avoid playing the game solo by being borderline detrimental in most cases
long story short with friends pretty good although clunky however in pubs dont even bother

h3 visuals 77100 h3
to my knowledge the visuals for payday 3 are mostly outsourced outsourcing is not inherently a bad thing and in this case it might be why the game looks so damn good
the outsourced artists clearly understood the memo that being to make a world worth heisting making a place as depressing as new york and making it look as miserable as it does takes a special kind of skill from the clutter the invasive billboards and hostile urban design and yes the grittiness all looks outstanding stylistically its not a style that will click with everyone but its admirable none the less
effects are outstanding too with many textures taking permanent damage from explosions and bullets animations are a mixed bag with reload and firing animations being a little too rigid and rough but this is a point of taste like the environment design

h3 progression 4100 h3
u it stinks u
im not exactly breaking new ground with that comment but wow this games progression is so bad it brings the whole game down with it
no xp from heists instead we get a challenge based system this is a concept im not completely averted to but the challenges are astonishingly bad
challenges include competing every heist 150 times in stealth and loud for a total of 2400 heist completions getting 1000 kills with every weapon placing 100 of every deployable that kind of pointless tedium
if you are not going out of your way to get kills there is a very high chance you could go 5 heists without earning xp
i almost dont know what to add as this has all been said before so heres something new
u the infamous armor systems problems are directly linked to the progression u
yeah that might be a new one i find that payday 3 is a tactical game with armor being a resource but since kills are good for xp this leads to armor becoming much more important with players frantically getting as many kills as possible for xp taking excessive damage in the process i cant blame them i do it too
another key point is once you are done with a weapons kill challenges stop using it you are not gaining xp after all this leads players to using guns they just dont want to use and ditching guns they love
worse yet money loses all value within the first 50 hours too the secondary currency cstacks are dirt cheap at their lowest price too meaning if you are patient they are just as useless
ive got more to say but this is a review not a thesis so lets move on

h3 ui 7100 h3
b hostile b no other description
the main menu is beyond bland and clunky no flair no descriptions for weapon stats online related content is on a timer its all just awful so awful my complaints will likely end up sounding pretty esoteric so im just going to leave it as the worst ui i have ever used

h3 soundtrack 82100 h3
with the departure of simon viklund the composer for the first and second payday games starbreeze was gonna have a hard time filling the rift left by such a talented composer however im glad to say that gustavo coutinho has fit into their new role perfectly
while gustavos compositions for payday 2s final dlcs bordered on overbearing and only good in moderation payday 3s soundtrack is for the most part reminiscent of what made the early tracks of payday 2 so damn good
stylistically the soundtrack is quite varied too with some synth heavy tracks balanced out by other more traditional instrumentation although im still more than open to hearing some of gustavos more bombastic tracks later down the line
there are a few duds like the main menu track but overall very promising

h3 gunplay 73100 h3
compared to the often cheap and outdated gunplay of payday 2 payday 3s gunplay is much more modern
although worth noting is that its surprisingly tactical with split gunkick and recoil stats each with horizontal and vertical stats respectively ads and sprint to fire modifiers and other assorted stats to fine tune
despite this weapon modifications all affect each gun in very minor ways i often find the differences between modification setups barely noticeable which is a damn shame as the framework for good gun modding is still there
luckily the weapons themselves are all very distinct with varying recoil and spread patterns which leads guns with otherwise similar stats feeling very distinct and some guns just feeling right for different people which i quite like

h2 summary h2
enjoying payday 3 is a challenge so many distinct problems bleeding into every part of the game leads the overall experience feeling cold like the game just wants you to play something else
content wise i genuinely think the current variety of skills weapons and 8 heists is decent but not worth the high asking price
and whats good about the game just isnt good enough especially given this games budget and whats bad is a dealbreaker for most
i struggle to see this game getting content updates past the first year once the quota of promised dlc is finished is starbreeze really gonna give this game another chance and even if they do what about players

still even if this game is just downright bad i still find ways to enjoy it im allowed to enjoy a bad game right its just a shame that i believe thats all it will ever be
b a bad game b

h2 overall rating 41100 h2

#####

online only was a huge mistake

#####

the payday devs pulled the greatest heist of all one against the players 

jokes aside game might be good after some cook time

#####

i love getting all the loot stealth on overkill just to be rewarded with 0 xp because i did not play the way the challenges want me to  amazing feature 

#####

half a game and already has dlcs

#####

imagine waiting for an hour and ten minutes and still not being able to get into a private game

#####

the very core of this game is great

but it lacks the absolute basics that need to exist in a game like this and were already existing in the previous entries of the series

 no ability to kick players in game either by host kick or vote kick
 no ingame voice chat
 no unready in lobby preheist
 no server browser 11 heists x 4 difficulties x 6 reasons  264 server queues that you have to hope enough people are in the same queue as you
 no text chat visible by console users
 no preorder bonuses still for some users mostly console and playstation specific

the content is not the problem its everything surrounding in that is just inadequately nonexistent or broken on launch  and were now 4 months after launch and only with three major patches one of which was just the planned dlc drop

#####

h1b as a day 1 player bh1

h3b my hope for this game had been slowly drained away bh3
list
    b first it was the launch week b
  i was so hyped when i first played the game trying heist after heist grinding challenges and rushing achievements with friends it was honestly fun but it didnt last long game breaking bugs and crashes started appearing plus the terrible progression system and unorganized ui my bhypeb slowly degraded into bfrustrationb
    
    b but starbreeze soon gave me hope b
  many people might not know starbreeze had several dev streams during late september where they answered questions related to the game and potential future update they planned to release multiple updates in october with bug fixes and quality of life changes even though they were generally vague about what will be included in their upcoming updates it nonetheless brought me bhopeb
    
    b and then came of the heels of bad news b
  at the start of october i was at my highest hope waiting for the update that was previously promised until it was delayed cut in half and delayed and delayedand nothing everything starbreeze promised in late september not a single bit of them got released in october at this point my hope is almost gone and i started playing some other games instead

    b now in november an update finally dropped b
    midnight scrolling youtube i saw people talking about payday just got an update if i were me from a month ago i would have jumped out of my bed and rushed to turn on my potato and download the update but now i just skimmed through the video almost emotionless thinking ok its here and looking at the patch notes in the morning i cant help but notice very little dedication from starbreeze to fix their relationship with the community

    at the very start of their patch notes it said to contain a massive amount of fixes wow this might actually be good but no the entire patch doesnt take more than 3 minutes to finish reading with a total of 132 fixes

    for comparison another game with a rather bad launch urlstoresteampoweredcomapp1501750lords_of_the_fallenlords of the fallenurl has been releasing patches with the same or more amount of fixes bevery single dayb the difference in dedication here is night and day
list

h2at the endh2
    i do not hate the game i am just simply disappointed i love payday 3 and the entire payday franchise so much but for now im gonna step away from payday for a while


  3nov2023





h1 update 2 looking pretty promising h1


h2 a step in the right direction h2
   bringing back 2 fan favorite heistsspoilernot sure about murky stationspoiler ip gain for heist completion ai teammate getting a mega buffspoilerthough they still go down if you are not actively protecting themspoiler lobby chat and bunch of other bug fixes these are all well needed addition to the game cant say i didnt expect them in update 1 or even at launch but better late than never

h2 butspoilerof course theres a but spoilerh2
    as good as update 2 is still therere a lot of work needed to be done most specifically quality of life changes like being able to organize my weaponsmasksoutfits name my different loadouts a proper filter to all the challenges and most importantly voice chat im still shocked till this day that this game didnt implement a voice chat 


    overall i would still keep my not recommended for a game thats charging for 40 it just doesnt have enough content as of right now you could buy 4 copies of payday 2 for the same price and have much more replayability there so just go play payday 2 and buy 3 when its on sale


1dec2023




h1 almost half a year later the game is barely any different from release h1

b the launch of this game should have been delayed by at least a year sure it will cause disappointment but im certain that it would never be as disappointing as the game is right now b

always online even for solo players is disgusting



edit

aboveoriginal review was half baithalf true not being able to play solo because of server issues feels bad plus i prefer to solo unless irl friends are playing with me not a fan of trying to play with randos via text chat offline play should be available for the same reason online play should be available  inclusion

now that servers are working ill post a real review


overall if youre new to the franchise its a solid game probably worth 40 bucks if youre a longtime fanbuy it to support the company maybe in hopes that it gets more updates i guess payday 2 is still better payday 3 feels undercooked and it seems like they took the start wars 3rd trilogy approach i love the payday 3 heist but most feel like rehashes of payday2 heist

gimmick mechanics that imo could easily be in payday2 and a newer engine dont make up for the the massive loss of qol features skills and weapons we lost

get it together devs this isnt some art piece youre placing on the wall of a museum that people oogle over bc you are unique and want to be edgystand out give the fan base the game they want and the new fans the game they deserve 

payday 3 feels like a bad movie based on a good book you literally have a formula to follow that is proven to be successful but instead of following it you want to leave your mark on the world and put your personal twist on it please stop and make the game the way you know people want it to be

i feel like most people would agree that this game needs

xp gains through money gained not just challenges
melee weapons
more variety of weapons in general not as many as payday 2 after 10 yearsbut this is just pitiful
challenges seen while in game
completing challenges seen while in game
concealment i feel like the real move here would be a dead drop for your heavy stuff in case stealth failsthat feels like an upgrade from payday2
crimenet or similar interface and matchmaking a left to right menu is cumbersome and matchmaking sucks as is
some motionmovement cinematic why am i watching a powerpoint slide show when payday2 had live action
preplanning maps seems wild we dont even see a sketch drawing map of the place were about to robplus placement of favors helped make heist unique each time
post crew stats  its fun right
no post heist pick a card  its fun right where is my pick a card

that last one leads me to my final and imo most important point you arent fooling anyone we all know you are going to be slime balls and introduce some kind of shark cash shop scheme to scalp the fan base just stop we dont want this i promise if you make a quality game with quality dlcs and have quality communication you will make money its not a hard concept  games dont need battle passes or real  cash shops just a good product with good communication and youll rake in the  even better youll gain reputation which is arguably more important long term

#####

buy the game  play 12 maps with friends  matchmaking crash happens 15 hours later still crashed 
overall experience 2023

edit
servers are fixedit is what they are saying now after the majority of the players got their game refunded or just left   so it is not as populated
perk system is pretty bad compared to payday 2 by far only a couple of the perks are good  all that gives you the rush bonus stealth is fairly okay made with the stealth tree you can easily do overkill missions without sweating too much but if you are just looking for the mad massacre run and gun vibes that you had during payday 2  welp any run and gun action that is above the hard mode  id say avoid it 

#####

merely owning this game makes my life inherently worse

#####

always online even when solo servers went down within 24h of release forced to use 3rd party account

#####

okay this hurts to write ive waited on giving my review on payday 3 as i believe overkill would be able to fix the mistakes theyve made at launch and within the first two months but theyve only managed to put a bandaid on the wound rather than suturing it up payday 3 is disappointing
ill start with the positives of the game
𝗣𝗢𝗦𝗜𝗧𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦
the graphical upgrade is amazing legacy maps like turbid station and cook off look absolutely stunning and makes me wonder what legacies they bring back will look like
the engine change to unreal engine is a life saver diesel had its funny quirks but payday is definitely a game that requires a better engine to be the heistingfps it was always meant to be and with unreal we got that
the music is astounding with the departure of simon viklund i was excited to hear what the new musician would bring and i can firmly say gustavo coutinho has done an amazing job at living up to simons legacy with his work on payday 2 and now payday 3 i cant wait to see what his genius comes up with for future tracks
the gunplay has been improved drastically it makes me feel like im in more of a real life police assault rather than a fake horde shooter guns feel more real in this game than they did in payday 2
stealth changes the changes to stealth are amazing stealth was definitely in need of a makeover and the new mechanics such as being able to do more in casing mode and the ability to full on beat stealth heists unmasked adds new challenges that payday 2 couldt do

now onto the bad side of things
𝗡𝗘𝗚𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗦
lets start with the obvious online only im sure overkill you have your reasons for online only but by going with live service you completely alienate whole sections of your community who would love to play your game going online only because almost every big game like apex fortnite overwatch 2 and others or because its industry standard is not the way having online only can make it impossible to play if servers are down if i paid up to 90 for a game only to be unable to play it because servers were down id be pretty pissed an offline mode needs to be added it should not be on the table for discussing it should be on the table as a feature that needs to be added an offline mode brings back the sections of the community you alienate and brings more players to your game payday 3 should stand out among other triple a games or industry popular games by using what payday the heist and payday 2 have learned for it those games crawled and walked so payday 3 could run and right now its not running
𝘚𝘱𝘦𝘢𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘰𝘧 𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘯𝘨 40 for a triple a game made with the latest engine more than fair 60 for the game and half a years worth of content also fair 90 for the first full years worth of content and the game itself also fair if you fix the online only issue the problem here lies with dlc pricing in the heydays of payday 2 a dlc costed around 5 and with that you got a heist tons of cosmetics and at least two weapons in the late days of reviving payday 2 it got more expensive with dlcs costing maybe around 6 but there were bundles which included all dlc for that campaign payday 3 on the other hand has dlc heist yes just the heist costing 10 the weapon bundle 6 tailor pack 5 lootbag 4 to expect your player base to pay so much for the dlcs with the game quality being as it is right now is insulting its a spit in the face to your players
removal of crimenet where did crimenet go instead of crimenet we got call of duty like selection screens for heists making searching for specific lobbies basically impossible as there is no filter system for heist tactic you are just expected to click and hope for the best if shade was a friend of bains youd expect shed be able to get crimenet running again
preplanning why have we gone backwards to pdths form of preplanning rather than payday 2s preplanning feature that was introduced with the dentist with unreal engine at the front it should be able to handle a pretty in depth preplanning system in 2024 the preplanning should have been at least like payday 2s if not more in depth
leveling dear god instead of xp that you get for completing a heist at launch we got a shitty challenge menu they have changed it to where you can rely on both just heisting or challenges to level up but the level system for weapons is still atrocious instead of having to buy or receive attachments from card drops you now how to level the weapon up super slowly might i add and then purchase the attachments the game has become less like payday and more like call of duty with these changes if you want us to level up the weapons then increase weapon leveling speed and or remove cost of attachments since we already have to level the weapons up
speaking of call of duty the menus are straight out of it boring with no personality payday is a game that has had tons of personality payday 2 had the most with its menus looking like you were using an actual hidden network of websites to find contracts purchase weapons and such now its bland menus
finally lack of communication the lack of communication from overkill has just made the community more mad as until recently they havent said a lot about fixing the game and or listening to the community and now we have it again with their plans for february im sure an nda is involved here somewhere but communicate that you are listening and are doing your best to fix issues the community finds wrong with the game
i want to recommend this game to people and to my friends i want to talk about this with them constantly but i feel like i cant because of whats wrong with it please overkill make payday 3 the sequel it was always meant to be



#####

dont buy this game ive been a fan of payday since payday the heist this is a step backwards from payday 2 the developers of this game do not respect their player base at all

having to make a starbreeze account having to search for a lobby for 4 minutes just to play by myself having my solo stealth runs ruined by server disconnection makes me feel abused by the developers

if they just ripped out the starbreeze nebula account and added offline and fixed the progression system and completely remade the skill tree from scratch then i would consider playing this game instead of payday 2 until then i will be staying away from this game

i remember how excited i was when payday 2 came out and how i thought it was an improvement on payday 1 in every possible way but payday 3 is a downgrade from payday 2 in every possible way except for the graphical quality i dont understand how they had 10 years to learn from payday 2 and yet learned nothing 

f in the chat heisters

update 0211  i am going to remove this game permanently from my steam account im done with payday forever bye guys i had a lot of fun with you all

payday 3 is a significant upgrade and downgrade the good things are that the guns feel better as in realism and coolness the stealth feels way smoother and more consistent however i only played up to very hard so i dont know how the harder difficulty is with ai holding people hostage and being able to shove them in corners or use them to open doors is a very cool idea and adds a lot of new ways to complete a heist both in stealth and loud i am indifferent to the overkill weapons at least for right now cause theirs only two a grenade launcher and a sniper the grenade launcher is useless and only hurts you and your team while the sniper which is gained at level 40 or 50 is very good against dozers which is all i care about if everything went right this would be way better than payday 2 however it did not go that way 

  the guns feel the same all except the dmr which is the only good gun imo at least up to very hard thats all i played up to takes too long to level up guns the most fun way to level the guns was to run 99 boxes and just glitch the xp cause in payday 3 weapon xp isnt based on kills its just based on completion stealth gives more weapon xp than loud they have taken melee weapons out which is odd because it was a neat thing to have last game and would just add extra play styles and more stuff to buy 

 theres no crime net which is inexcusable for not having it back in even if its only the 8 maps on launch that pop up it would still be incredibly helpful to see if people are doing loud or stealth cause every single game ive joined in 39hrs has always been stealth and only began loud when someone messed up you need to give players a choice because right now all of it is stealth except for one mission theres crossplay and that might seem good on paper except for the fact that most of them are kids who are not great and on top of that the ingame chat only works for your device so if you type in chat a keypad code or try to inform someone they cant see the message so its almost completely useless as to why they would even add a chat box because it wont work most of the time considering at least in my experience there are more console players than pc 

 the player progression is by far the worst thing about this game the only way to level up the player and get more guns skills masks clothing is to complete these in game challenges like kill 1000 feds with the m4 complete this heist 50 times on normal complete that heist 50 times on very hard when you force players to use a certain gun or do the same heist over and over and over again it gets stale really quick if the game had more heists and more guns to use i could see these not being so bad but theres only 8 heists and maybe 15 guns so its asking you to do these 8 heists over and over and over again killing feds 1000 times with this gun then switching to another gun that feels similar just to kill another 1000 feels empty and the masks are very limited maybe only 20 theres only 6 unique suits you just unlock different colored ones and you need to do these challenges to unlock skills so the game is making you grind and grind again to unlock better perks to help you grind again 

 the armor and health system to me are not good you dont regenerate health or armor so it makes no sense to bring med kits i only bring them for doing stealth cause of fall damage armor is the most important thing so all you wanna do is max out the armor skills and with no regeneration theres no room for error which is crappy and not fun you cant hide to regain armor so you can make another push or revive a teammate when you and your friends are out of armor bags you just have to give up 

  and im not sure if its on my part but i cant seem to find their next updates or patches or what theyre working on i tried their website and twitter but i didnt find anything that could be on my part but it already seems abandoned i didnt think it would be this bad they cant continue like this or the game will be dead very soon

#####

i switched to helldivers 2

#####

the real heist was on our wallets

#####

i love the part where dallas said its payday time and stole the servers truly a masterpiece

#####

online only is a huge mistake
the real heist was on our wallets

#####

well day 2 now still cant play not really happy with that

edit day 4 now played 2 matches so far matchmaking is still terrible

#####

tldr 
the real heist here was starbreeze taking my 90 for an unfinished game
buy payday 2 instead heres why

 always online  no offline singleplayer 

 leveling up is fucked tied to stupid challenges making it super unrewarding when you finish a heist on max difficulty and get 0 xp because you didnt complete a challenge

 it is not possible to kick players from your lobby griefers and cheaters love this

 the preplanning mode where youre supposed to plan for the heist has the ingame chat disabled 

 you get rich so fast especially in comparision to the slow levelingunlocks money loses it relevance after like the third heist

 they somehow made stealth even easier in this game than it was in payday2 multiple heists can be completes on the highest difficulty without ever putting on your mask

 all guns feel the same  there is no real reason to buy a new gun after the starter weapons you can easily beat every mission stealth and loud on all difficulties with the starter weapons for loud the differences in damage and other stats are marginal for stealth it doesnt matter whatsoever wich gun you pick since theres no concealment stat which makes the detection rate always be the same also they removed meele weapons for some reason

 enemy variety has been reduced medics have been removed completely cpt winters has been removed turret vans have been removed or replaced by an antenna lmao dozer varietys shotgun minigun lmg skull dozer etc have been removed and the only thing they added in exchange is a swat unit that can throw grenades wow

 they removed crimenet so now you can no longer see currently ongoing heists choose wether you want to create a public lobby or join a public lobby it chooses randomly for you or filter heists by loudstealth massive downgrade


every single one of these issues is fixed or at least better in payday 2 and in some points even in pdth it is literally insane how you can fuck up that bad the singular thing that his game does better than its predecessors is that it looks better everything else is a massive massive downgrade
at best they were just lazy and didnt put all that stuff in at worst they left out all those wellestablished features intentionally to add them later as content in dlc or updates to make it feel like they added something new would be a classic overkill move to do so

edit its been almost 2 months since the release now and the developers have done fuck all to address these issues player count has dropped from an average of 29k in september to around 23k compare that to payday 2s average of 30k for the past months and you see that the player base has agreed that this game is an absolute scam

#####

when i queued in tarkov id play other games in my other window but when i queue for payday 3 i play tarkov

ill say this i absolutely loved payday 2 and i liked the changes i saw coming from the trailer in payday 3 and thats all i have good to say since i havent played the game yet with all the errors

this is a list of things that need to change badly
 boxy ui menu takes up too much space and not enough information finding a menu i need is actually troublesome to do
 no crime net no immersive way to find games or possible dlc heists that i wont own in the future
 gun customisation has less information it went from defining numbers in pd2 to vague notes and a solid bar that goes up and down in pd3
 its always online always online is always a bad idea especially when its a stealth optional game and you have ai helpers i cant just solo queue so i can learn a map
 you cant just level up by completing a game and doing every objective now you got to do really dumb challenges which include getting kills with x gun meaning i will never get to use my favourite gun since ill be too busy using the one for a challenge and if i dont go for a challenge then the heist is a waste of time as you dont get beneficial experience

all in all there is too much modern design that ruins this game if you want a good idea of what the menus are like and gun customisation is at the least it feels like a direct clone of modern warfare 2 2022

#####

the matchmaking got me feeling like sisyphus

#####

releasing paid dlcs on an unfinished underdelivered halfbaked game is crazy    theres a reason the player counts are so low

#####

the game actually starts getting better after you uninstall it

#####

come back in 3 years when they make the game good

#####

for the love of god please give us

a proper lobby browser like in payday the heist  payday 2
a loud  stealth lobby filter
regenerating armor
an option to play offline
infamy points for completing heists

damn this review really hurts to write but it must be written as someone who has seen every stage of the payday franchise  and has been with them since the beginning i can only concur with the negative reviews i remember the golden days of paydaythe heist and even more the golden era of payday 2 20142015 overkill was on top of the world they created an addicting product that i spent countless hours with the same three peopleit felt like we were truly a crew i even joined cashnet a group of amazing 1ers dedicated to the best of the best that the payday franchise offered at the highest difficulty i had become an overqualified fan sinking countless hours into their game  

after all that then came the loot safes which turned payday on its head overkill slowly recovered and made a decent comeback after the announcement came of payday 3surely after learning from their mistakes they were going to honor their roots with a hybrid of both titles like they promised nope now after seeing what they werecan be and this steaming pile of bad decision making i can only say that a game about greed and robbery is what paydays legacy has become i mean in 2023 how the fck can you force people into a connection based game with poor stability and no reconnect option the matchmaking is non existent so most of your game time is finding a match i can get past the challenge based progression but seriouslyno xp on completing a heist on overkill forcing people to play other things they really could care less about to get levels is medieval at best 

however the best part is when the server no russians you mid heist and you lose all your work which happens frequently even after their stability update speaking of updates this game has had the longest period without patches i have ever seen with a newly released aaa game the very few patches they did after about two months of silence have been ridiculously light and skating around the big elephants of stability qol and common sense today they released two legacy heists from payday 2 with the revolutionary addition of a pregame lobby chat yes two months for a pregame lobby chat ignoring of course the major issues that have dried up the player base for this game i mean you can not keep pulling a todd howard redoing old content to buy time with your angry fan base this is not fcking skyrim 

long story short they really put on the clown masks during game production will they pull a rabbit out of their ass that has yet to be seen do not buy until if they fix their damn game you will only be  a disappointed fan like me

#####

great demo almost playable even cant wait for the game to release 

#####

i will revise this review when you let me play the game that i paid for offline fuck you

#####

an online only game where you cant play online amazing

#####

i preordered the gold edition and now nobodys playing anymore
fun fact this is also the first game ive preordered in a very long time ill definitely be a skeptic for a while

#####

payday 3 is a fine example of a fantastic core game compounded by baffling outside decisions stepping back into the heisting world its immediately a blast and that can persist for a long time however this is all defeated immediately by a lack of offline functionality incredibly laborious challenge xp system questionable currency systems and a general lack of polish outside of that

it doesnt take a genius to know that payday 3 is a stepup from payday 2 some people will describe it as a regression but i find that a complete exaggeration the way it plays is toned down but it is vastly more breakneck than its ancient contemporary of pdth its a hybrid of game design philosophies with many of the conventions of both heists are fantastic a much mightier offering than payday 2s launch they arent quite as inspired or have as much personality as pdths initial offerings but there is a lot to enjoy here the same cooperative objective teamwork youre used to in loud and stealth weapon feedback is really good much better than payday 2 right down to the hk mp7 slap or the pump of a shotgun helmets fly explosions ring chaos enemies generally are better ai wise with some exceptions there is a lot of good here when you read everything below i dont want you to get the general impression the game is impossible to come back from its not

stealth im not a big stealth player for me the action is the juice but giving it a few shots even as far overkill its much better this time around the scaling in difficulty does affect the heists drastically in stealth and some heists similar to counterfeit in the past are assisted even in loud by taking the first few steps in stealth you have so many more tools and the ai has so many more nuances that its much easier to slip into it

ive played a lot of payday 3 and i gotta say this much while you level up initially pretty quick that doesnt last forever around the 60 to 70 level mark it gets harder the bar to achieve levels gets higher until youre scrounging out whatever you can it gets really really bad this is all before you even hit level cap weapon levels are more efficently ground out by running one heist and staying as long as you can in loud to get kills to level them up if you run stealth you barely get anything at all it needs more of an incentive to complete heists than just grind on the same one for a hour

im gonna shortly talk about cstacks its a psuedo crypto system that you can sink your money into as you buy cstacks they get more expensive each week before resetting however these are the endgame currency save them as much as you can weapon attachments loadout slots and even prices as high as 500 cstacks mean that the game will take multiple weeks in order to get the preset you want assuming youre even the level to get them in the first place it sounds great at first until you realise that the weapon attachments you can buy with cstacks are stuck to that particular weapon and do not unlock it forever you get another gun of that type you wanna use for stealth too bad another 50 cstacks loadout slots are going to become an issue as more and more guns are added to the game 100 cstacks doesnt sound like too much in the grand scheme of things but throw that in ontop of other things you have to pay for and it just doesnt feel great

the uiux are frankly a bit terrible they arent good especially with the heist selection menu it works great for a first time player running through the heists for the first time but thatll last around 7 hours lobby systems are utterly awful you cant pick and choose which lobby to choice in a browser youre just thrown into matchmaking will you get a game or will you not thats down to the servers

its no secret this game has had some serious problems with server stability and ive seen it all i dont think i can add anything here that will surprise you or be different from anything else that anyone else says it sucks and has made every issue above even worse 

i hate to do this i have so much fun with this game
i cannot recommend payday 3 not right now wait wait wait


#####

payday 3 main menu simulator

#####

they made the throw bag button into the throw grenade button and i blew up my whole team

#####

h1bain would be disappointedh1

boy oh boy where do i even begin well lets start with the positives which are mostly surfacelevel

1 massive graphical improvement over pd2 and it runs pretty smoothly on the same hardware even on ultra settings 

2 sound designs great and the soundtracks good

3 the grenadier special enemy is a fun way to integrate the gas that featured in some of pd2s heists as a proactive enemy instead of an environmental effect

4 the lockpicking minigame is a simple timed button press but oddly satisfying 

h2the negativesh2

1 the progression system is i hilariously i bad unlike in pd2 where you would get xp based on the specific heist and the difficulty you chose to play on completing a heist in pd3 awards 0 zero xp of any kind whatsoever even if youre playing on difficulties higher than normal such as hard nope the b only b way to progress is to grind out specific little challenges such as getting x kills with y weapon kill x of y enemy etc etc this means that this game which is fundamentally supposed to be a coop game forces you to be aggressive in farming kills as much as you possibly can which of course actively hinders your teammates from progressing after all if youre getting kills your teammates arent getting those same kills and vice versa this applies to both character and weapon progression more on that in a bit creating an environment where one players success can only come at the expense of their teammates i genuinely cannot comprehend the logic behind this design decision

2 weapon mods now arent random loot  great making a weapon even remotely usable now takes hours of grinding out challenges with that specific weapon to level it up as each individual weapon has a level track this means you cant save up weapon mods youve found along the way move them between weapons as you could in pd2 nope none of that each weapons progression is hardlocked to that one weapon and they only get xp under certain specific criteria you can complete a major heist on a higher difficulty killing enemies with the weapon as you go but unless you killed those enemies in the exact way the game wanted you to none of them count repeating what i said in my previous point because i cannot stress it enough this means you can complete a mission and all of its bonus objectives and gain 0 xp for your trouble making it all a complete waste of time unless youre already at level cap whatever that happens to be

3 experience no longer being tied to how well you execute the heist means that unless youre specifically short on cash theres absolutely no incentive to go after bonus bags loot etc in a payday game its actively less efficient in terms of progressing your character to be a better heister what why 

4 you can no longer sell weapons you buy you still have a limited number of weapon slots that you have to pay to unlock but if youve bought a weapon you cannot sell it to get some money back like you could in pd2 your only option is and im not making this up destroy they couldnt even be bothered to give you a 1ofpurchaseprice refund for selling a weapon nope that weapon and all the cash invested in it is destroyed outright a quick test seems to show that a destroyed weapon does keep its xp if you should choose to buy it back later a bonus that wouldnt be necessary if the progression system wasnt a complete farce 

5 the skills are the storebrand bran flakes equivalent to pd2s artisanal chefmade threecourse dinner with a fantastic view and a great band in pd2 you had access to a bewildering array of hilarious effective dumb and ridiculous skills and of course the ability to combine those very freely for dumbly efficient or ridiculously dumb builds with a perk deck on top skills here are much more similar to the perk decks except largely more bland i can enjoy 10 bonus damage as a passive buff for a limited time riveting looking at all the skills not a single one stood out to me as an oh that seems funinterestinghilarious etc unlike pd2 where skills transform the game  

6 the game requires an always online connection want to host a private game you have to go into matchmaking set to invite only and then wait for the game to queue you into a lobby even when youre just playing by yourself yes you must sit there and wait for a queue to play solo meanwhile in pd2 you just pick play offline you can even customise your ai loadouts which i couldnt find here in pd3 though its possible that i just missed it the always online requirement means that its impossible to play if the servers are offline or your internet connection is down 

7 the weaponbuying ui is an actual trap lets say you go into your secondary weapons and buy a weapon from the list of what you would then assume to be valid weapons for your secondary slot well turns out it lists primary slot weapons there too so yes you can go into the secondary weapon slot buy a weapon only to then find out its not actually a secondary weapon but a primary there is absolutely no indication of this in the weapon buying process and theres no way to actually filter for the weapon slot youre shopping for so unless you already know ahead of time you have to cross your fingers and hope this is especially fun given that theres no possibility of selling weapons youve bought

8 theres this new feature which is basically a kill streak bonus you get enough kills to fill up a bar you press a button and the magical multiple grenade launcher santa claus drops a 6shot semiautomatic grenade launcher for you along with some spare ammo for it at no cost this isnt payday this is call of heist modern robbing

9 the hostage system in pd2 was already silly but this is ridiculous you can just trade in hostages and it magically spawns health packs instantly you can even upgrade this function with one of the skill lines

10 weapon stats which in pd2 were displayed with numbers after the community requested them are now back to worthless bars that mean nothing and convey almost zero useful information

h2in summaryh2

the progression system is one of the worst i have ever seen where players in this coop game have to compete against each other the challenge systems structure means that you have to rotate between weapons and playstyles to progress your level to unlock skill points even if youve already found a loadout and playstyle you enjoy 

there is no incentive to complete bonus objectives unless you specifically need the cash

always online means you cannot play offline and you have to waste time matchmaking with yourself when you want to play solo

microtransactions and season passes are already confirmed for this paid game sure its not the standard aaa retail price but its still a 40 game 

there are no skill trees with choices to make just linear skill tracks they function similarly to pd2s perk decks except these are way less interesting and have completely replaced the core skill tree system pd2 had 

weapon mods being locked by progressing a specific weapons xp means you have to restart from scratch with every single weapon whereas in pd2 you could accrue mods and move most of them between weapons 

h1conclusionh1

except for visuals and arguably sound pd3 is a worse game than pd2 in every conceivable way being always online to add insult to injury few heists terrible progression nothing to encourage you to learn a heists bonus objectives etc etc what weve got is a far shallower restrictive and dull experience without a single redeeming feature outside of visuals 

h1as long as payday 2 exists payday 3 has no reason to its a shell of a game riddled with design decisions so selfsabotaging that it defies comprehensionh1

#####

this game breaks my heart i was so so so hyped for payday 3 but they really effed up starbreeze has seemingly done everything they can to keep you from playing the game there is not play button im serious to play you have to wait for a matchmaking lobby and wait and wait and wait always online drm is truly horrible for all gamers everywhere and studios should know better by now unplayable

#####

positives
 graphics look great

negatives
 everything has been simplified to the point of butchering any meaningful navigation or friendly user interface

 less variety of enemies

 all the skill trees have been removed and what we have is closer to basic perk decks that existed in payday 2 

 less weapons and all very basic no fun overkill weapons or any special ones but hope to see these with dlcs however combined with the lack of skill tree and lack of customization everything feels very linear with characters and game play no variation

 little to no customization they have butchered the whole weapon modding mask variety mask and mask part collection weapon customization and weapon aesthetics

 the ai bots are as bad as ever and i was hoping for an upgrade they dont take cover they dont shoot at snipers and theyll just die in the middle of an open area surely you could at least make them take cover now that its payday 3

 the game difficulties have been tweaked hard is far too easy but very hard is now impossible to do solo and needs teammates but the servers are so bad for connecting to others

 the game makes no attempt to actually reward more for completing higher difficulties the rewards and progression system is broken no xp bonus tied to higher difficulties and just slightly more money this is such a mood killer it takes away from the highrisk highreward game play for a robbery game we used to choose high difficulties to try and level up quicker doing missions above our character levels

 progression is objectively horrible the only way to progress is to do random challenges and try out every gun in the game theres no rewards for normal expected and fun gun or stealth gameplay you can hit caps on leveling immediately and earn 0 xp for playing with the guns you enjoy what a stroke of genius that was i cant believe i have to slide thousands of meters to level up in a competitive heist environment as if im playing call of duty with 12 year olds 

 pregame why is there no proper mission setup phase you literally cannot add assets like payday 2 you cant talk to each other and discuss whos taking what supplies or what the entry plan is either stealth or loud game play or halfhalf whats worse is that right now if you want to change the map difficulty or any detail you cant you have to disband the lobby and remake it again hoping you get it all prefect from the start what a waste

 loadout selection the pregame loadout selection is horrible i cant name any of the loadouts to distinguish them and forget which ones are loud versus stealth ones and the user interface is so bad that ive selected the loadout i want several times but have forgotten to also press confirm meaning it previews as if you have the equipment you want on the left but wont actually bring it into the game that could be solved if you could unready up like payday 2 but here if you ready up youre stuck so ive commonly forgotten to confirm my loadout after selecting it and immediately pressed ready up that means im stuck bringing a stealth loadout into loud game since you didnt have the foresight of people making mistakes with your unfriendly loadout selection process also speaking of lobby issues why cant we kick players thats a standard game mechanic both at the lobby and the game if you have 3 good players and 1 low level you shouldnt have to choose between disbanding and carrying a low level

 postgame why are we forced to disband upon completion of a game and how come we cant add anybody as a friend on the mission completion end screen i thought the whole point was to encourage community building and sticking together for a few games in that same lobby you know you find a decent crew and you chat to select a new game and continue together why on earth cant we reselect a mission type change difficulty or deselect the ready up option when in the game screen who thought that was a good idea the public community was quite strong in payday 2 but here its as if the developers are actively trying to kill it and keep us separate and why can we not see individual stats upon finishing a game meaning our kills etc to compare with our friends and fellow heisters is it gonna hurt our feelings or something to learn the truth

 mission length and complexity id argue its less complicated which is a con since it means less content in payday 2 missions could be multiple dayslevels for example a jewelry heist intended to be quiet would get a second mission added just for escaping if it turned to loud some missions were 34 days long whereas here we have 8 missions only 1 day long if even that  in terms of payday 2 lingo

 quality of life no crime net means you cannot find any games easily nor can you see if the lobby is full almost every game i find is an empty lobby we used to have realtime showcase of all possible options for games which worked out much better here ive only played 1 game with 4 players in 20 hours of gametime londoneu zone in payday 2 my condition for playing a game was dependent on whether or not the lobby was full but here i just have to accept playing alone mostly what a shame and why have they added a silly timer to force us into games in the mission lobby instead of letting us patiently wait for other heisters to join its as if they think were all part of the tiktok generation that cannot be allowed to sit and wait or have multiple options everything needs to be dumbed down to the most simple and streamlined option such as the single button to find a lobby so that no one gets confused its quite insulting honestly the point is to cater to the hardcore fans who will stick with your game for years and many dlcs not the crowd that will drop your game instantly after the first purchase 

and what you fail to see as developers is that your choice has created an unnecessary burden for the servers everyone has to overload the servers 3 times as much constantly quitting and researching for games since youre created such a inefficient system for finding a lobby where were forced to search instead of finding a lobby and sitting and waiting like payday 2 get rid of the silly timer for lobbies and let people fill them up to full capacity whats better 5000 full lobbies or 20000 empty ones its honestly stupid and then were all confused as to why theres no server stability and no extra budget to upgrade since it creates ridiculous spikes for short intervals that dont justify larger upgrades for most other times this would also be fixed with having offline play abilities

and part of the fun of crimenet was intending to play one mission but upon seeing something else with a good lobby being readytogo you just changing your mind and jumping right into that instead its made everything too linear and predictable and boring ie sucking the fun out and removing any chance for spontaneity 

 stealth i see people praising the stealth but i thinks its a step down theyve gotten rid of the detection system used to be guns and equipment tailored to reduce detection to 3 versus 75 now were always loaded as if 75 on payday 2 lingo but were treated as if on 3 the guards just dont see you and its game breaking stealth is a joke you can open close doors on guards and sprint past cameras and guards without detection look straight at them

overall
it seems like the company decided to throw out 10 years worth of feedback given over the course of payday 2 and tried to emulate the new cod crap and simplified all aspect of the game to the point of it being a shell of its former self all they had to do was take payday 2 and create new missions new masksweapons and update the graphics how can the developer be so out of touch

#####

and after all this time we were the loot

#####

releasing paid dlcs when the core game desperately needs attention

#####

no offline play no crimenet no lobby browser no pregame planningchat no ability to kick grieferscheaters very little content weapons are samey missing tons of features from the previous game 

100 not worth even 10 at this point absolute scam of a game at the time of writing go play payday 2 instead

edit okay its just getting worse and its impossible to find games now or even connect how do i thumbs down something twice

#####

so immersive in that youre actually getting robbed of 40 or more to sit on a menu screen

edit in a more serious light  the few times i got into a game it ran well like the new mechanics especially for stealth gunplay is ok misses some weight compared to 2 uiux is alright its only going to get better and i believe it will but the bottom line is its a game we pay money to play it if you cant play it then welp hopefully im right and it gets better very soon would not want to see another series ruined 3

#####

h1 my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined h1

i very rarely write product reviews however this game is a i special i exception despite the fact that this will get lost among tens of thousands of similar reviews i hope that at the time of this writing it can dissuade at least 1 other person not to make the same mistake

as both a console and pc gamer payday 2 is currently my favorite and the most played by an exceptional margin game i own on pc with over 700 hours logged i was beyond excited to hear the announcement of payday 3s release this year i checked back monthly waiting for more details after getting burned many times i stopped preordering years ago id almost given up on the gaming industry as a whole but had no hesitations in believing this game would live up to my high expectations now that the time has come its clear to me that this game deserves nothing but contempt in its current state

after a literal decade of amazing development and support for payday 2 it is genuinely baffling to me how far regressed this title is in almost every aspect by comparison with a new ip one might hesitate to think b this b is as good as it gets yet here i find myself unbearably aware of how much better it was and no understanding of the directive decisions that brought me here

h3 pros h3
given my feelings overall im barely comfortable giving any credit for the good changes here

list
graphics and audio are unquestionably improved from pd2 being ten years from the last release the bar was low here this feels pretty bad as the i best i change in my opinion and i would have been perfectly happy if it was the only change

the story is enhanced i in game i although i will consider this a pro it has some caveats between each new heist is 1 or 2 short dialogues with a stillframe backdrop tying the characters and locales together admittedly the stillframe style is not my favorite and when compared to the high production live action trailers of some pd2 dlc heists there is a lot of squandered potential

personally i find the changes to stealth mixed there are a handful of interesting and welcomed changes that make stealth more forgiving and engaging otherwise some mechanics have been removed and i find myself missing them in many instances more on that later

crossplay is supported and will u always u be a pro for me in noncompetitive games
list

h3 cons h3
although it took me a few hours to adjust i quickly realized how barebones most of the features are when using pd2 as a standard i cant stress enough how impossible it is to list every issue here

list
the b very first b thing i noticed after playing the tutorial was how few mechanics were explained throughout it the only reason i did was to find out what was new in the end ive learned most of them by myself or through random players telling me as a veteran player this wasnt unbearable but it felt useless and was immediately apparent

id reckon the biggest issue at the time of writing would be the plague of server problems aside from a few hours i used to explore the ui as well as fix up my control bindings only about b 20 of my total game time b has been spent in game this will likely hopefully be the first thing fixed which would otherwise be fine if this wasnt almost unplayable as a brand new game

id also reckon the biggest design mistake was making this game alwaysonline i cannot grasp what would lead to this decision and it has manifested in a few different problems the first seemingly being linked to the server problems at launch others include accessibility during connection downtime or maintenance and the requirement to matchmake into every setting even private or solo play speaking from ignorance im not even sure its possible for them to redesign the game in a way to fix this however i genuinely hope they can change this functionality

the ui is poor in general the settings seemed fine however most of the menus are confusing and disorganized there are no explanations settings have a wide range but cannot be adjusted finely and many of other changes are arbitrarily counter intuitive compared to pd2 primary and secondary weapons are put together in the shop with no clear differentiation the list goes on this is not necessarily a deal breaker but instead of feeling any benefits im left asking myself why for every decision here

with so much experience in pd2 i would consider the lack of so many features carried over to be a b huge b disappointment a brand new player might not notice or care but again im left asking myself b why b many features are simply neutered by comparison yet still many more are just completely missing some of the features i would consider fundamentally i core i to what made payday feel unique and fulfilling such as the heist preplanning for example others like using chat in the lobby affect the quality of my experience as a multiplayer game ive seen this happen with games before but i just cant comprehend the total abandonment of ten years worth of insight
list

h3 summary h3
payday 2 is top 5 one of my favorite games of all time without a doubt at the time of this writing payday 3 is like an atrophied shell given a new coat of paint the surface game play feels like payday and there might even be a new shine that looks good digging down however you will find indescribable neglect potential is there but its going to take u a lot u of work to get back to healthy

unfortunately ive requested a refund until the communities concerns have been resolved as it stands i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone veteran or new players alike id easily recommend payday 2 as it provides a much better experience

there are so many issues with this game still after launch and with the servers working but the biggest problem this game has is the hard lock gatekeeping so xp is tied exclusively to challenges and some of those challenges are locked behind other challenges so even if you wanted to focus on one which you shouldnt have to you couldnt anyways because its locked behind another you have to complete first and there is so much insane tedium to them and its built purely to force players to grind and grind and grind and spend more time in the game than just enjoying it as an example if you want to reach level 150 youll eventually need to run the heists an x amount of times on normal 150 hard 100 very hard 80 and overkill is 40 but wait thats only for running it loud you also have to do it the same amount of times for stealth and you have to run it loud before you can unlock the stealth ones so you will have to run all 8 heists at least 300 times each 150 in loud then 150 in stealth  by the way thats if you run them in the other difficulties first since running once in overkill also counts for 1 of all the others  for a total of 2400 heists in payday 2 this wouldnt be mandatory itd be a goddn achievement and a cool mask and this right here breaks the game for me the most forcing players by hard locking them at the time im posting this i do not recommend this game at all i spent 40 dollars and i still feel ripped off maybe if they fix this change it and make xp notthat maybe ill play it again but right now hell no

#####

why on earth did they think it was a good idea to charge for the dlc on something that didnt work in the first place

#####

beneath a wide array of genuinely frustrating and playerunfriendly logistics is a deeply fun game that has the clear potential to outshine its predecessor payday 2 yet with a dogged insistence regarding onlineonly systems that actively bar players from playing the game along with unwillingness to listen to key feedback from the community regarding just about everything outside the core gameplay loop it is not enough for the game to be fun

h2prosh2
 b  the fundamental mechanics of the game are fluid and fun from movement to shooting
 
  expanded upon stealth gameplay offering more mechanics such as lockpicking locational security states and safe breaking
 
  excellent soundtrack composed by gustavo coutinhob


h2consh2
b  servers are incredibly unreliable which is a huge detriment to an onlineonly game since launch the game has not been stable enough to ensure getting to play the game with friends let alone consecutively continue playing after a single heist

  player progression systems are tied to challenges which feel arbitrary and unnatural to the core gameplays flow it also diminishes the value of completing a heist successfully as your only consistent reward for completing heists is the ingame currency which you may or may not feel particularly enticed to use if none of the further weapon selection or cosmetic choices are to your liking

  the amount of content available in this game feels a little sparse for its asking price of 3999 with only eight heists six playable heisters and nineteen weapons not counting for presets which are just modded variations of the original arsenalb

pay day 2 is better lol

#####

as of 9302023 i do not recommend buying the game if available and if you want to play use game pass i will be using payday 2 as a comparison to this game and will be used has a the standard for this series most things said are my opinion if i dont write about anything in the game in this review then it isnt good or bad just neutral or okay 

the pros
 graphics are much better and the art style is nice
 overall gameplay including silent and loud are either improved in areas or are just as good stealth mistakes are slightly more forgiving such as if being detected while in casing mode he will simply be escorted to a public area which i dont mind casing mode in payday 2 was pretty much useless in this is was made more part of stealth
 the soundtrack is just as good as payday 2 even though i believe its made by a different artist if i am not wrong
 story is more focused on and is more clear even though a lot of people dont care with this type of game for story 
 there is a small selection of 8 heist but they are all good i was never not having a good time playing any of them that being stealth or loud so i suppose quality over quantity for now 

 c stacks are like a more premium currency that is bought with money in game so 1 cstack would cost 50k for example i like this system and is a nice change from the offshore money and cash in pd2

 enemy voice lines are awesome in this the cops sound like they fucking hate you

the cons
this list is much larger

the leveling up and gaining exp system is garbage the only way to gain exp towards your infamy levels is completing tedious challenges that are very specific such challenges are beat no rest for the wicked 150 times on normal or higher difficulty before the assault has started every heist has these type of challenges that vary from 50 time to 25 times etc these are ridiculous challenges considering this is the only way to level up as well 

 weapon leveling has been added and along with the exp for gaining levels on your infamy these require tedious challenges to level up your weapons too and take forever

 little content there are a selection of 17 weapons 6 weapon charms and 13 weapon stickers as well as 25 mask and 14 mask patterns i would also insert that mask customization is the exact same no improvements were made which is disappointing as seeing something like a call of duty emblem editor or weapon skin creator for masks would have been cool there are 5 outfits in the game besides the base im not counting slight color variations on the same outfits as different ones same goes for gloves there are 5

 weapon stats and customization is a copy and paste from cod there is not even any twist to it to show originality its just that i even believe some weapon attachments which you earn from leveling the gun up have the exact same affects as ones in cod and in vendors there is no clear slots to buy weapons from like assault rifles shotguns etc like from pd2 its just labelled as weapons

 the overkill weapons like a killstreak in cod if you kill a enough enemys you get to call in a super weapon there are 2 a grenade launcher and a 50 cal although personally i dont mind this being in the game as it can offer more for going loud it just feels out of place in a payday game maybe its just me 

 amour has been changed instead of a constant thing you have that just recharges after taking damage in pd3 it can run out when it does you need to pick up plates from a deployable like a medic bag i dont like this change as it is just another idea from how cods amour system works and amour no longer shows up on your character i am assuming due to more focus on customizations of your outfits there are no stats for amour just a paragraph explaining what it is and how heavy it is this confused me for a while 

 skills i have seen a lot of complaints about how the skill tree is and how skills work although i agree that pd2 did them better this is not so bad its just odd at least half of the skills are based around 3 buffs you can get edge which increases damage by 10 grit which increases dr by 10 and rush which increases your movement speed although some skills dont rely on these it feels it can restrict some future skills pd2 skills just felt more useful and made the game more fun 

 tasers names were changed to zappers enough said 

 final charge mechanic in pd2 enemy ai worked in waves a wave would come for however long and then you get a little break in this that happens too but an system it seems is always running in the background to keep track to where you are at in a heist i have noticed usually when you start bagging loot is near where it starts when it does endless waves up cops come until you are either dead or escape i have found this system to be extremely annoying and unforgiving this also limits any heist to be added such as the continuous making meth one from pd2 this feature in in every heist on loud this was on pd2 but only on a handful of heist that were designed around it 

 no improvements to enemy ai more some downgrades i have not felt or seen any improvements to how the friendly and enemy ai work from pd2 to pd3 besides some animations what really bothers me is that if youre playing solo the ai wont revive each other anymore so if an ai goes down you have to revive them

enemys feel especially beefy some feel almost like the division type bullet sponges not fun or satisfying this is for sure noticeable when most shotgun close range head shots wont be a one hit  

 the game is very unfriendly to solo players this being with the only online system so no matter if youre alone you play on a server that can crash or have connection problems which could be a problem in stealth 

 no friendly ai customization

 no safe house

 cant name loadouts

as of now this is all i can think of and this took a while to write so i recommend not to buy this significant downgrade from payday 2 







#####

just buy payday2

#####

as of today payday 3 feels more like a sequel to payday the heist than a sequel to payday 2

not is all bad mind you but while they made steps forward in some categories such as graphics and gun shooting we got also massive steps backwards in things you thought they learnt from in the 10 years of payday 2

someone at starbreeze director of the ui and overall gameplay had to be a giant call of duty 2019 fan looking at how things are

few examples can be

 forced variety to be able to level up in infamy ranks you will end up not getting exp anymore by playing the same difficulty and same guns encouraged variety is nice forced is not
 no server browsercrimenet
 lobbies selfexplode at the end of games
 no chat in the lobby
 you cannot kick people out
 no loudstealth markers for lobbies meaning most games are forced on stealth for most people yes i get it its the most reworked and actually well made feature but sometimes i just wanna shoot my gun
 preplanning is 10 years steps backwards only 1 player can bring 1 item and remaining favor slots are lost if you dont have a full lobby
 overall disgusting ui thought for consoles and very codlike gun customization
 many elements that makes you think youre in a battle royale such as the armor system
 big balance issues such as cloakers having 0 noise when theyre nearby and able to engage a charge towards a player even when theyre not in their line of sight

many of these issues can be fixed later in updates but as it stands my review will stay in the red for now

#####

pros
 its on the table

cons
 its still on the table

ill change my review once the table is cleaned up

edit the table is in progress of being cleaned up expect a proper review somewhat soon

#####

i want to recommend the game so bad but i cant even play it i paid 70 for a game i cant play obviously i bought the silver edition in order to play the game 3 days early and the game worked great during this time and i fell in love with the game a bit but once the general launch released ive been unable to hop into a lobby with people or play solo due to the online nature of the game ive spent 5 of my 16 hour playtime at the time of writing waiting in que for a match and during this time i asked myself if a game is online only and the servers arent up do i even own the game the conclusion i came to was no i dont even if they fix the servers i plan to never buy an online only game again

#####

crush the hypercapitalism 

game wasnt even close to finished when released and then they release a dlc before the game is fixed

#####

the more i play the game the more i notice how much has been cut a lot of little things that are essential
either the release was rushed or it was just supposed to be a very simple game for casualconsole players
there is currently no chat in the lobby the matchmaking system is just annoying and confusing
once you have pressed ready you are no longer allowed to make it unready which means you are no longer allowed to change the build profile if you accidentally do so chose incorrectly
you can no longer rename profiles either
the outfits are not saved separately in the profile if you change your outfit this applies to all profiles
no precise information when choosing missions you dont know how many times you have played it
there are no multiday missions
the mission menu is not well thought out it is not divided into categories you have to scroll for a long time if more missions are added in the future you will have to scroll for a very long time
then you have to turn off the mission videos beforehand so that you have a better overview every time
and also watch the intro every time even if you just restart the mission you cant skip it
rng is hardly available so you can skip a lot of objectives next time
you can no longer give orders to bots they are useless
sometimes they even get in the way of stealth when they suddenly put on the mask and start shooting around during loud missions they sometimes stop somewhere and then go down unnecessarily
but i like the new stealth system its different than payday 2 and the only positive thing about the game
but everything around it seems cut and very very simple
the mission leaders voice is monotonous and annoying
her information is also not helpful she says the bags are all at the destination while we are still carrying bags there is no information about how many bags are left so it will be a bit difficult with achievements
you often just want a perfect run with all the loot and be rewarded for it but you wont be rewarded it doesnt seem to be important
because now you level with random challenges so you dont concentrate on the missions but have to make sure you do your personal challenges
so you slide around pointlessly because its a challenge or use weapons that you dont even want to play
on the one hand such challenges can be quite good as they progress it shows how much knowledge a player has of the game weapons and mechanics gone are the days when players even with high infamylevel had no idea about the game because they just played the same missions for xp over and over again
on the other hand the missions in pd3 just seem like an excuse and but it feels forced and isnt fun
there should also be a lot of xp for side tasks optional things that you can include during the missions
but if you dont complete any challenges you hardly get any xp
and there is no sense of success which is not a good thing in the long term

the skill system is also unnecessarily complicated you unlock everything one after the other so at the beginning you play with certain skills so that you can unlock them first
only then can you create your desired build it artificially extends the playing time

there are no more meele attacks in the game you can only use them to stun cops or force civilians to the ground
you can no longer dominate enemies unless the guards give up beforehand there is hardly any interaction with them
the enemies generally seem kind of boring the cloaker that you see running around sometimes looking confused but then very determined to blow you away you often dont have a chance
the bulldozer looks like a stupid gorilla that charges and then runs into a wall that seems ridiculous
i like the shields though i also like the effect when you get too close to them you can no longer turn them off as easily by dancing around
what i like are the little mini games at the locks finally no stupid pressing of f until it is open
but so many details are missing paintings have eg the same bags as other loot and no longer curled up
throwing bags also feels strange
no dual weapons no lasers payday never had a crosshair it came as an update for pd2 but very very late i always thought that was good and unique
everything seems as wannabemodern as all the other shooters
the music is also no longer as exciting as in the previous games
in one mission it sounds like in cyberpunk it lacks the feeling of thrill when the assault is about to begin and the excitement when there is a break you dont headbang anymore because the songs just play along and you dont pay attention too bad

one wonders whether there was even a gamedesigner who had an overview of everything and had small but important things added
i can only shake my head as to what they were thinking releasing it in this state
as if they havent learned anything in the last 10 years
i tried to like the game but im not really having fun yet and i can see so many mistakes
its not a bad game the graphics are pretty there are a lot of first missions but everything seems like a generic shooter without anything of its own everything that payday is all about with all the attention to detail and charm

because there is no neutral thumb on steam ill give it a thumbs down
lets see what happens in the future

#####

i have over 2000 hours in payday 2 so i think its fair to say im a fan i didnt know what to think about payday 3 on one hand it was being designed in unreal instead of a bad game engine designed for racing games in like 2005 so i figured it would probably feel better to play and everything else would be possible to fix later

i think the one positive is the aimingrecoilgun handling system feels better

i think the majority of my ingame hours are waiting to connect to a game server

the movement system while on the surface feels better actually feels worse to me because it lost some of the advanced unintentional mechanics from pd2

stealth feels like a completely new game series instead of building on the stealth i enjoyed in pd2 some of the new mechanics are cool but i definitely dont feel like some sort of superhuman ninja

i thought that one of the biggest improvements with this game would be the netcode for online communications while it was bad in pd2 there were mods to help reduce the issues and at the end of the day it was not a deal breaker most of the time if the host had the proper mods installed with the always online play i am finding that in every lobby i have issues with latency on gigabit fiber with a 3090ti 12700k 32 gb of ram m2 etc computer

the perkskill system is dumb and feels like a step backwards

the servers were down all the time at launch

heist selection is stupid and requires you to select heists from an online multiplayer campaign timeline pd2 didnt even officially have a campaign for the majority of the games lifespan i dont like the move to force you to do a story mode

it doesnt feel like the build theory crafting really matters that much when looking at the skills everything is a tiny boost to this or that but nothing feels like a major change to how you play the game

overall this game just does not have the charm of pd2 for me it has the same theme but it doesnt feel like its related to pd2 at all for me

#####

i would like to start my review by first writing what happened on release day and this first text will help you understand why the game has a low percentage of reviews

first of all when the game came out everyone was happy and bought it with a good expectation and went in to play it but
then there was a server problem that lasted for 4 days as soon as a player logged in they would get a matchmaking error error some of them couldnt even log in at all the reason for this was that they had designed everything completely online and the game was being negatively bombarded because the host logic was working on the server and the servers could not accommodate the number of players 

beautiful questionable but still payday but with server problems 

payday 2s longawaited sequel payday 3 finally released in 2023 the game retains the core foundations of the first two games while also offering some new innovations and changes the things i liked about the game are that you can now modify clothes in addition to weapon motifs the animations are more detailed but the ai is a bit weak however the hit feeling and other sensations are nice the game is very welloptimized resulting in a smooth gameplay experience the graphics have been improved but they have a softer more stylized look that is more focused on playability than realism
details
payday 3 is a visually impressive game the games world is detailed and vibrantly designed the characters and weapons also look realistic and satisfying
the game also succeeds in terms of atmosphere the heists offer an exciting and tense experience players have to make quick and careful decisions to reach their target while being pursued by the police

payday 3 also has some questionable aspects compared to the first two games for example the games story is quite simple and not very satisfying additionally some of the games mechanics are not much different from the first two games
for example the basic structure of the heists is the same as the first two games players have to choose a target select equipment and weapons and then make a plan to execute the heist this can limit the games replayability


payday 3 is a game that will please fans of the first two games however some of the games innovations and changes may disappoint some players

final   rip payday 3

dear friends we are gathered here today to commemorate the death of payday 3 loading screen simulation

payday 3 brought so much to our lives it taught us how to rob shoot the police and of course blow up a safe full of gold

payday 3 was also a very entertaining game it kept us laughing and entertained for hours

however payday 3 is no longer with us but we must not forget that it will always live in our hearts

as we remember payday 3 lets remember everything it taught us lets remember to enjoy life to break the rules and of course to blow the safe full of gold

we thank payday 3 forever 

now lets take a moment of silence in memory of payday 3

998 of matchmakers quit right before they hit it big

#####

give us single player i hate people

#####

the act man scammed me

#####

almost all features that have been reworked from pd2 are worse in pd3 
list of dumb changes that i found within just 6 hours of playtime
online only
nebula account
gun customization is a copy paste of the call of duty format not nearly as many weapon stats as in pd2 since some features have been removed threat concealment etc
gun stats have sliders instead of numbers which basically makes showing the stats useless as instead of giving you a 0100 stat you have a very vague slider 
new skill system is clumsy and does not feel as good as in pd2 also making it vertical was probably the dumbest ui change ever
minimalistic hud can not see what my temmates are bringing or how much ammo they have
not solo friendly in any way
no server browser or crimenet
no lobby chat what the fuck were they thinking here
no preplanning

i may be nitpicking at this point and this is probably more personal preference but still changes that i do not like
no perk decks
new armor system feels like cod
enemies have armor and health now
dozers are way too strong i get that they were going for an enemy that is closer to payday the heist but theyre way too tanky which i think is mainly due to the new armor system as his head hitbox is 99 armor
why change the tasers name to zapper
boring skills
endless assault wave is stale and annoying with it only being a feature in some heists in pd2 it gave the mechanic more significane and really amped up the stress it is now just an annoying mechanic
no conealment


all in all i believe caters more to a newer audience that is accustomed to the cod like ui and simpler skill tree with fewer stats to manage kind of looses the magic of creating indepth builds with both perk decks and skills that most pd2 fans loved 
i think if some systems get a rework this game has huge potential as it still has the solid payday foundation

bif it aint broke dont fix itb


bfirst patch updateb

after over a month i have given up on this game it took them bover a monthb to fix just some of the bugs from release keep in mind that some of the bugs from release still have not been fixed
the progression system is still as horrible as its launch state and still feels lackluster
no new content at all so we are still stuck with the small roster of weapons and maps as in launch kind of funny to think they stated new content would be added every month 

it took overkill overr a month to do the absolute bare minimum this game has fallen victim to the unfinished release game trend that has been so prevalent the last few years and it is honestly sad at this point

#####

payday 3 made me stop playing payday 2 but after playing payday 3 i stopped playing payday at all

edit i gave this game a positive review because the sign is a subtle joke the shop is called sneeds feed  seed where feed and seed both end in the sound eed thus rhyming with the name of the owner sneed the sign says that the shop was formerly chucks implying that the two words beginning with f and s would have ended with uck rhyming with chuck so when chuck owned the shop it would have been called chucks uck and uck

#####

1 no chat in lobby why
2 a damn timer in lobby why
3 cant host why
4 melee weapons are removed why
5 no numerical values on weapons instead a slider that doesnt actually tell you anything why
when you make a new game shouldnt it be better than the previous game why make the same thing worse

#####

ive put 40 hours into payday 3
oh nice is it a good game
idk ive never played it

#####

hehe i wonder how this comment got 500 likes 

now gimmie your steam points this game is a robbery

fr tho dont buy this trash the real heist was releasing this in the first place

#####

i played a lot of payday 2 and objectively speaking payday 3 has better gameplay but man i dont know what it is the servers the sparse heists something i dont know but it just feels like somethings missing

tried it with friends tried it solo tried going loud with all the guns stealth with the new stealth mechanics love the new nomask opportunities but man its just not clicking maybe after more updates

i really wanted this to work hyped up everyone for it man its just lacking soul

#####

you had one job star breeze studios which was make payday 2 but with updated graphics and game mechanics how can a studio be so disconnected from what the community wants if this game is to stand any chance they need to add all the features that payday 2 had crimenet preplanning preplanning chat after game chat and party up improved skills because atm they are very meh better matchmaking if you are thinking of buying this game i would say check in in a year because thats how long its going to take them to get it to any standard that seems interesting to any player

#####

good gameplay dont buy until they add offline and fix progression

#####

im joe and this is not my favorite game on steam

#####

h1this game has a really long ways to go from being a featurecomplete gameh1
normally id write a super lengthy review about what i liked and disliked but i would rather not waste my time with this game any longer

ubso heres the long short of itbu
list
progression is tied to challenges you dont earn exp from doing heists anymore
in order to level up and progress far enough to make strong builds for ovk you must invest hours of grinding challenges that are super tedious

feels like none of the lessons from the end of payday 2s life cycle were learned

utterly garbage ui that feels like it was only intended for a controller to navigate

still feels like i am playing the beta

 absolutely zero social features in a coop focused video game

onlineonly status

no singleplayeroffline mode
list
normally i reserve my judgement for a new game a little while longer after launch just because new releases for video games nowadays are 100 going to be terrible no matter what but the devs shouldve known to be better prepared than this

sorry to be that guy but get this game 3 years from now and im sure itll be a banger

#####

eh not yet give it awhile before you buy its unplayable at this moment

#####

hey heisters payday twitter man here with another 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒍 𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒌 moment with only 300 active players we are proud to announce that server stability is looking pretty good again albeit at max capacity as weve downsized to just the one server  but dont worry folks with the savings in expenses were working early mornings and late nights to bring you another absolute banger of a dlc so keep your eyes on the horizon as you can be expecting another wacky h3h3 collaboration again soon  ᵗʰᵉ ᵗᶦᵐᵉ ᵒᶠ ᵗʰᵉ ʳᵉˡᵉᵃˢᵉ ᵐᵃʸ ᵛᵃʳʸ ᵘᵖ ᵗᵒ ˢᵉᵛᵉʳᵃˡ ʸᵉᵃʳˢ 
oops looks like i gotta go guys to save in costs im also using my wifes boyfriends phone to tweet from now so do be expecting some delays from my crazy twitter updates haha fuck keep on heisting heisters 


#####

h1 the bad h1
h2 servers h2
the first few days the game wasnt playable tight but hey at least those have passed and we can get on to the more fundamental issues at play not to worry theres plenty to chew on

h2 progression h2
the progression system unlocking new gear of any kind in this game requires a good helping of levelling up  the starting weapons are awful so youll want to get on that levelling up is tied exclusively to challenges  there are hundreds of these and each will give you a pittance of xp upon completion compared to the xp requirements of levels past 35ish so targeting individual ones is not an especially fruitful endeavor you really couldnt if you wanted to anyhow at least not without navigating one of the most impenetrable and informationsparse menus i have ever seen in order to find out that you need to kill 350 people with the car4 or whatever challenges are also gated behind other challenges want to stealth a heist for xp do it loud first several times this system quickly leads to some interesting behaviour progressionwise  a friend and i stealthed this games big bank equivalent without ever being detected we secured every bag so a good helping of cash fell in to our pockets along with 0 experience something about that strikes me as not ideal

h2 finding other people h2
not for nothing this game is always online to me that would imply that quality matchmaking would have been a priority i was clearly misguided in this assumption please forgive this being anecdotal as i have not done a deep dive on matchmaking and its quirks yet but public matchmaking is barely functional in my experience after a leisurely paced matchmaking queue you will almost certainly find yourself in a lobby with just one other person if you are lucky that lobby will fill up during the 5 minute wait time assuming your other players do not ready up moreover if you decide to start the heist without the extra players the game will happily fill the extra slots for you as the game progresses ya know like that other game something 2 did however there was a rather important phrase i used here  if youre lucky most of the time i have not been lucky i have been in lobbies with one or two other people that have not filled up despite waiting the full five minutes  starting the heist did not imply to the game that we actually wanted more players either finding people in this game takes entirely too long when it does work  and it usually doesnt work

h2 playing with other people h2
people try to stealth everything people do not succeed at stealthing the majority of the time people then vote to restart or leave the heist this might not be so much an issue  not that stealthing with pubs has ever been an ideal passtime  but need i remind you that successful stealth often results in no experience fabulous there is only one heist in the game that cannot be stealthed  road rage road rage is at the best of times a rather unforgiving heist so running it on higher difficulties often separates the wheat that you have been matched with after 35 minutes of searching from the chaff and this being a new game with a shitty progression system through no fault of their own many folks playing this game fit in the chaff category so one often fails road rage despite ones best efforts additionally there are currently exploits in road rage that can make the heist easier  at least the first half this sort of leads to a problem similar to the corrupted gm nightfall situation in destiny 2  people try the glitch fuck it up due to lack of communication and fail accordingly wonderful stuff none of this would really be an issue if the game could just provide a full or 34 lobby readily it cannot so one tends to get a little bit choosy

h2 weapon balance h2
there is only one stat that matters for weapons  armor penetration armor penetration is not shown anywhere ingame 

h2 skills h2
the skills are a step back from payday 2 launch build diversity and interesting build choices  stuff that provides a level of differentiation similar to inspire the saw the ictv akimbo weapons   does not exist in this game the skills are interesting but lack any definite info  numbers and do not do nearly as much as the skills in payday 2 did at any point in the games lifespan that i bore witness to

h2 ui h2
for all my posturing i actually dont have any clue what happened here the ui is awful 

h2 hi im starbreeze and i want your attention h2
the fundamental thing to understand about payday 3 is that it is an extremely fun model for a game with vindictive business practices stamped on top how very in vogue of starbreeze love that for them the vindictiveness is somewhat subtle  it might not seem that business practices are predatory it might seem more like developer incompetence or things that just happened to be a certain way and the devs will change them with feedback they might things might get better but i have spent too much time with another predatory game to not recognise this when i see it the developers know better  they probably want better it doesnt matter this game exists and will persist upon the model of keeping players playing that does not mean keeping players happy it means putting an obtrusive progression system in so players spend more time on the treadmill to see big number it means accidents like the unconfirmed as a bug quirk wherein certain heists have nearly worthless extra loot so that the most dedicated players get the least back for their time it means time gating a currency that leads to weapon attachments it means preventing players from having freedom within their own game by keeping them on the servers and it means obscuring weapon stats so that difficulty is less immediately easy to balance as a well defined available meta pushes people away from the game faster and more definitely than a wibbly wobbly oopsie doopsie system where every overpowered thing could plausibly be a bug and if it is a bug people will get mad and they will drive attention to the game this game wants to keep you in your seat and that is it lessons learned in payday 2 need not apply here  except the lesson starbreeze learned when they went through the microtransaction debaucle a few years ago as long as they fix problems eventually and keep finding new mistakes to make it wont ever backfire on them in any meaningful way they can keep fucking with players in predatory ways as long as theyre a bit creative about it and keep rotating out what tactic they use 

h1 the good h1
the game feels great to play unreal engine is such a boon to the technical lifespan of this game and the naive part of my soul wants to hope for the best as a result

#####

finish the game and add offline

then ill consider a positive recommendation

#####

i paid 3999 for the main menu

#####

paid 60 to let the developer poop in my mouth will update review if they fix this game 

#####

the biggest heist was the game itself

#####

give me xp for something other than challenges pls

#####

payday 3 tries to do a lot but fails in a lot of it

 very unstable
 no options you are not the hoster and so if someone joins that you dont like you have no way to kick them
 no offline play
 no crimenetserver browser
 extremely slow updates
     first slowdown and most significant is due to crossplay pc has to wait for console verification
     second slowdown is before an update they shutdown the server for maintenance for 57 hours
 experience gain is awful and not fun the devs thought that pushing players to do challenges is a good idea cough cough stuff that are supposed to be optional and only for people that want an extra thing you get barely any xp after completing a heist

i couldnt care less about the reasons its just something you had to think about before implementing such unnecessary things that honestly costed you more than not having said features because no one actually gives a shit about crossplay nor is p2p that bad

there are areas where the game has improved from pd2 and made more fun but theres still a lot missing which gave pd2 its charm

#####

they have intentionally omitted solo play and crimenet they could still be found in the games files enjoy your negative score until you add it theyd be lucky to even get to mixed after this embarrassment

#####

paid 95 for a half baked game waited large patch no new content 

#####

oh boy where to begin
even when you ignore the massive server issues and lack of offline play the game still has a bunch of issues as much as i enjoyed payday 2 dsod mask haverenjoyer and really wanted to enjoy payday 3 i often find myself just wishing i was playing something else even with the game being discounted to 40 instead of the traditional 60 i would still wait for a sale if youre looking to buy it or just skip this game altogether

pros
 graphics got a nice touch up from payday 2
 the new additions to stealth are actually quite welcome and breathe a breath of fresh air into the game you interact with most of the mission without your mask on and can complete several missions without ever putting it on to begin with there are now public private and secure areas guards will spot you in private and secure areas but it will not automatically fail stealth in private areas they will escort you back to a public area this has no limit as far as i know and is extremely cheesable
 a ping wheel with voice lines for requesting health armor ammo etc allowing for a bit more communication

unfortunately thats kinda where the positives end some of the tertiary systems like the gun customisation got a slight touch up but they are more or less the exact same there are also some system changes in regards to health and armor but im fairly neutral towards those the game is more about attrition now instead of holding in one spot and doing objectives after the assault ends enemies do far less damage on higher difficulties than before and there is no hp scaling

cons
 the ui was given the modern minimalist look i dont actively hate this but it takes away from the games stylization and reduces the overall experience
 the game is lacking a lot of basic features such as a search bar for challenges the ability to unready in the pregame lobby and even text chat within the pregame lobby
 when you vote to restart a mission you are not given the option to change your loadout and must research for a game from the main menu if you wish to do so
 preplanning has been completely scrapped and replaced with a simple favour system each player gets one favour this has many issues each player meaning that if you have bots you effectively lose out on favours that you otherwise would have been able to take there are also randomly distributed heist specific favours that are single use only why
 the heists are all extremely simple and a couple of them can be completed within a manor of 5 minutes
 none of the skills are particularly interesting and a lot of them just flat out suck you can still make some quality builds but all they do is augment things that you are already doing there are no builds that allow you to focus on a specific play style like payday 2 pistols rifles shotguns melee etc perk decks being absent from the game does not help in anyway and was a mistake to not include imo
 a massive lack of content there are only 17 different guns and 8 heists with only 6 playable characters something funny about the characters is that the actor for dragon is used within the games promotional material but isnt actually in the game why
 some how even the mask customisation got a downgrade as you can no longer edit your masks material why

leveling
the leveling system is genuinely awful and unironically made me stop playing its so bad that it gets its own section

 you have to unlock each skill individually with xp that you get through playing this would be similar to perk decks except for the fact that you only gain xp in the skill you are trying to unlock if you have a point in that skill tree
 it also takes way longer than it should ie getting 600 xp for a match but needing 8000 or more to unlock specific skills additionally the xp you gain is not cumulative its not 8000 total for all the skills in that tree its 8000 plus all the xp needed for the previous skills
 dont let the 20 hours i have fool you into thinking this game has that much content most of this time was spend grinding to unlock all the skills something that i dont recommend you do
 you need to complete challenges in order to gain infamy levels to gain skill points and unlock new guns and equipment you do not gain levels by completing heists and just by generally playing the game the challenges are frankly put slow grindy monotonous pointless and repetitive there is no challenge to any of the challenges and they often require you to kill a large sum of a certain enemy get a large sum of kills with a certain weapon or complete a heist an unreasonable amount of times there are challenges for completing the same heist up to 150 times none of these are difficult or fun to complete and make leveling a chore instead of an enjoyable experience
 you dont get a skill point every level you get the max amount of skill points being 21 total at level 100 you will go several levels in a row without gaining skill points and the rate at which you unlock new equipment does not do enough to offset this by any means i actively gave up on leveling at 38 because it discourages you from playing the game the way you want to it requires you to use weapons that you may or may not want to use and to sit and farm enemies on low difficulties for xp which actively takes away from the game experience encouraging players to switch up the way they play is fine payday 2 offering bonus xp for lesser played heists comes to mind but forcing the player to do this in order to progress through the game is stupid


there is a lot more missing from the game in terms of quality of life but if i were to continue it would be nitpicking just keep in mind that starbreeze are the people making this game it isnt really a surprise that they have almost gone bankrupt twice heres to hoping for a hat trick

#####

how do you release a game that no one can play this stupid online only bullshit is literally unplayable

#####

crazy i was crazy once
they put me in a game
a payday game
a payday game with no offline mode
no offline made me crazy
crazy i was crazy once

#####

h1good game but the servers break down more often than the drillh1

#####

played a lot of payday 2 and this game is such a disapointment 
feels like an empty soul 
bad skilltree
only 8 mid heists
no pre planing
no after heist rewards

it just feels like a huge downgrade compared to payday2

#####

i wont dickride starbreezepayday 3 like many other people since ive waited for the sequel for years the game just feels like a beta product in many many many ways

ui is trash minimalist design that doesnt display important detailsequipment of teammates 
matchmaking is a joke im infamy 6133 hours and 99 of the games were singleplayer experience
no lobbiescrimenet for matchmaking and there are 328 heist x 4 difficulties separate queues to mm from
awful skillperk systemcombined both from payday 2 but feels 14th as impactful
buggy ai clipping through floorswalls and doing nothing a lot of timesjust watched me get pounded by a cloaker
ridiculously grindy skillsweapon mods are all locked behind xp
weaponsgeararmor are locked behind infamychallengeswhich again requires ridiculous grinding beating x level for x amount of times killing x amount of enemies with x weapon etc
lackluster weapons17 in total at launch 2 types overkill weaponslauncher and 50 cal 4 types of primary weaponsrifle marksman smg and shotgun and 2 types of secondary weaponspistol and revolver
limited replayabilitytied mostly to unlocking things with challengesinfamy with only 8 heist7 being doable in both loud and stealth at launch

despite payday 2 being released for years many of the charmqol never made it to payday 3 while it certainly is a joke to call it a payday 3 sequel improvements should still be addressed despite its many flaws the graphics of the game have been significantly improved and the stealth system has been drastically improved and reworked so that it feels satisfying to do but thats pretty much the only thing theyve improved upon payday 2 personally i wouldnt recommend buying the game at its current state40 mediocre singleplayer game but if its anything like payday 2 then you can expect the muchneeded updates and improvements to polish the game to an acceptable if not great statestarbreeze kinda of needs payday 3 to work anyways

#####

best looking at main menu screen simulator

#####

im just gonna keep this short
the horrid progression system for the very lackluster content vs price is an immense stretch
they will add more content sure but paid content for a game that doesnt give its worth in content with the price already
and you only will spend time with part of the content drought because the horrid progression system hinders you in experiencing the rest of the limited amount of content

you would only get this if you are a massive fan of payday

the game is there the polish is there

there is a mighty skeleton to the game but with next to no meat and nothing to support it

#####

what the others say
sadly true

alot of pain to play
through and through

and yes they are robbing you

sometimes its a little fun
after all you get to wield a gun

the design choices though  a mystery
maybe the worst in all of history

why i am playing it i dont know
so do you want to give it a go
at this time  no

#####

almost soloed touch the sky without killing any guards on overkill

lure the guard and escape then matchmaking error

my 2 hours wasted

quotei will update the review as the updates come you can read my thoughts and review updates in the very end of the reviewquote
ready to rob some banks pop them helmets and get jumpscared by cloakers great but the game aint ready for you bpayday 3bs launch has been one of the most horrendous experiences ive seen and it truly is a huge shame because under all the layers of grime and dirt payday 3 is a pleasant experience comparing to the previous entries in the franchise theyve taken a lot of feedback into account and have actually improved many of the more questionable design decisions payday 2 has had over the years its been in development but like said its under a massive wall of problems from technical to design that hinder the overall fun you can have in the game

in many regards pd3 feels like a sequel to the original game urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomagecheckapp24240payday the heisturl rather than a direct sequel to pd2 the skill trees make a return but in much more limited and grounded way and to be honest i quite like the skills when compared to the rather over the top skills in pd2 and they flow well with the revamped difficulty system being early in development some of the skills feel rather weak in the game or they require too many skill points to flow well enough with your build so balance is needed as of right now pd3 has also revamped armor and health system quite a lot by making armor a pseudoregenerative health pool armor will regenerate a portion of damage received after a while when not taking damage for a moment a lot like in pdth but taking too much damage at once will take huge chunks away from your armor making a more tactical cover based gameplay more viable than runningandgunning health works virtually identically to the health like in pdth with the only way to recover it by healing yourself with medikits and packs

the difficulty can be off putting to some as the cops can dish out and absorb quite a bit of damage even on the lower difficulties making even the weakest swat units a huge threat when in groups this has been balanced with lower cop count at a time the spawn rate can be a bit overwhelming at times especially in smaller maps making regenerating armor nigh impossibility without proper skills or builds getting some skills in and getting the feel for the damage system will negate these problems but will not eliminate them completely some spawn points for the cops just feel unrealistic and unfair barely giving you enough time to reload your weapons before a new wave of enemies come knocking

the cops are fortunately balanced to be weak to headshot damage and have a revamped armor system headshots deal a lot of damage and many higher caliber weapons will oneshot enemies even on higher difficulties bodyshotting will not be nearly as effective as aiming for headshots but there are skills that will reduce or ignore a portion of the cops armor making the gunplay a little more forgiving the further you get in the progression

and speaking of progression its a mixed bag of good and bad the player level or as known ingame infamy level is tied to completing challenges and playing heists like in pdthbb on top of that you get experience from playing the heists be it successful or unsuccessful attempts for the iweaponsi you have equipped leveling weapons will award you attachments to further fit them to your builds i really like that even failed heists will award you experience so you will not waste time even if you fail a heist over and over again

but while pd3 is pretty good experience in terms of gameplay it unfortunately has few quite ugly design choices which i wont take too long to talk about as you can pretty much read any other review and get the picture from them but to put it shortly making the game always online was the stupidest decision ever made for a game like this you simply cant play solo or offline making each and every match rely on your ping the servers are also still quite unreliable having blackouts here and there theres also problems with missing content having preordered the game i still cant access some of my bonus cosmetics and on top of that i cant purchase new appearance items the game is buggy at times but the biggest bugs are in the backend side of the game

payday 3 is pretty damn fun now that it works at least most of the time and given the base game price of the game id say its not too terrible of a game but its still a humongous letdown given the development time and hype surrounding the game i really cant recommend the game with good consciousness as pd3 clearly wasnt suitable for a final release

bedit 1 november 7th 2023b the first patch fixed quite a lot of things masks and customization is working better yet still missing weapon charms bug fixes here and there and the matchmaking feels more stable now resulting in more filled lobbies than before step in the right direction but still doesnt improve the experience enough to warrant a recommendation
bedit 2 december 1st 2023b major update better and bigger than the first major one for sure two returning and revamped heists from pd2 and skill tweaks as well as new skill line bug fixes added animations and better progression has been added you now accumulate infamy points profile level experience though the challenges iandi completing heists but once again this update kinda makes it feel like there still are major things missing from the base game like come on they added ifirst person animationsi in this patch thats something that should be in the base game at launch overall a major step in the right direction

#####

i hate to give bad publicity but having 2000 hours in pd2  and 200 hours in pdth which i still play  i cant do otherwise  
generally i feel it more like a dowgrade from payday 2 and as an upgrade to paydaythe heist 
in general it feels more rushed and unfinished with every flaw i find every single map i play  

strike upon release  
i gave 90euros  and i couldnt play upon release for over a week  strike
thats was a major issue for me and therefore i am not editing it out  
i had a few days off and i was waiting for the release with excitement  only to receieve frustration  
they fixed the game  but now i am working and cant spend much time on it  

h3the goodh3 
few new game mechanics that are better than the older games 
 civilians no longer run in the middle of gunfights  
 unlimited tiewraps  
 following civs are running at last  
 no instant detects or back detects  
 i like the new guard behaviour  
 running while carrying stuff  
 npcs gained hearing ability  
 crouch  running  interacting  carrying bags while in casing mode is  b awsome  b 
 slide ability  
 some of the new skills are cool 
 to be honest many of these features are mods in pd2 so iy wasnt as much as a surprise to me  as i had experienced them before in the series   
thats it for the good things 

h3the badh3 

bvisualb
many like the new graphics  but thats expected people  payday 2 was over 10 years ago  still a few things are wrong with these new graphicsgame engine  
 few nice  funny graphical components are missing  like the ability to destroy plant pots  i also found many glass panels to be indestructable  
 unoptimised game  rtx4070 and i cant get 144 fps on first map  even on lowest settings  
 teamate carrying a body looks hilarious 
 droped bodies clip through walls like in early 2000s 
 joys mask is a downgrade  no messages like in pd2

bno singleplayerb
 onlineonly forces you to go into matchmaking even though you are alone in a lobby  
 server connections still suffer from glitches  
 after heists i get disconnected from friends lobby
 server disconections even playing solo

bgameplayb
 no ability of pausing the heist of course 
 soloing heists on higher difficulties is almost imposible  
even if you manage to reach the vault  you cant get all the loot intact by yourself mostly speaking about dye pack timers which require at least 2 players to get all the cash intact for example   
 difficulty in loud is brokenunbalanced  tried normal difficulty  shot 3 bullets in the head to kill an enemy  hard  3 headshots with the same weapon  very hard  guess what  3 shots again  the enemy litterally has the same health pool in all those 3 difficulties  also  even on normal  ai has aimbot  a single enemy emptied his clip on me in a single second  slicing a whole section of my armour  just a single unit 
 friendly ai still sucks for the 4th time in this franchise kinda expected tbh  i also count raid ww2   
 civilians rescued by law enforcment are not recaptured even if you shout or shoot at them 
 killstreak ripoff mechanic from call of duty 
 try to point a guard or camera places a marker 
 rng does not reset upon restart  so every run has the same steps until you complete map or exit to main menu  
 no dumbsters to hide bodies  i miss that   
 guards still see bodies in the water
 grindy challenges to play 100 times a hated map to level up and unlock stuff  i utterly hate that  
 forcing palyers to play the game as devs want is never fun   
 no bot commands 

bmenus  uib
 menus are not user friendly in general  
 no option to move weapons in different slot  quit game button is hidden in a menu tab  esc key doesnt work either  whats more simple than that these days really  menu pages no do not change with mouse roller  like in that other game  what was it called  oh  yeah  payday 2  
 there are primary and secondary weapons in the game but there is no distinction between them in store  pistols are secondary  duh  but wahat about smgs  are they primary pdth or secondary pd2  still havent got one   spoiler they are primary  spoiler
 weapon slot prices increase with every purchase  making them cost more than weapons themselves 
 weapon customization from call of duty  again  and i hate it  
 broken currency  weapon cost  75000  a single modification for this weapon  100000  oh  and if you have 2 of these guns  you need to rebuy the mods for the 2nd 
 very few weapon selection and weapon slots  even on pd2 they recently added 10 pages of 16 slots total 320 weapon slots for more than 250 weapons  there are only 1 single sniper rifle  2 shotguns buldozers gun is not available no machine guns  no akimbos  and many more  
 spoilerand since we are not dumb we know they are gonna add them as microtransactions later  as that is their intention even before launch  hope i am wrong but i dont hope  spoiler
 strikechallenges do not count  and some are not explained correctly strike
 challenges do count but the menu is not updating  you need to restart the game to see progress  
 also  a certain challenge with the northwest b9 weapon is so bugged that 2 challenges require the same amount of headshot kills  and none counts  so i am stuck and unable to complete it and progress any further  
 strikeprogression systems is rubbish  everything is locked behind stupid grinding bugged challenges with no describtion on how to unlock them  no explaination in how most things work like skill points   strike
 they added infamy points for just completing the heists now  so just playing the game actually means something now 
 no search function in dozens of pages with mixed challenges 
 buying cstacks multiple times doesnt reload the vendor screen and prices are incorrect you see that you spend 90000  but in reality it could be millions if you dont exit the screen and return in order to refresh the prices 

bmisc b
 no lobbies screen  so we can choose if we like stealth or loud only games  
 no way to kick abusive player from lobby 
 vote to restart the map instead of host having complete control over it will make host leave the game if the heist is not going like they wanted  unlike  yeah  pd2  again  
 no preplanning  no choice where to place assets
 strikerewards in pd3 from nebula account event are still missingstrike they finally fixed them 
 new underleveled and underequiped players can jump into higher difficulties ruining the session  
 no creativity  get inside  hack phones  stand in spots  enter codes  open vault  carry bags  leave  
also maps feel the same as previous titles  we have bank heist 20  green bridge v2  jewlery store remake  nightclub redux presented by vlad of course   big bank remastered  ukranian prisoner 2023 edition  framing frame day 3 standalonemountain master revision  

bbugsglitchesb
 strikein road rage  truck drives on the air above potholes without the palyer placing the support equipment strike may be fixed now  
 reviving ai is bugged  even solo 
 stuck ais may revive you from the other side of the map  

i will edit it multiple times  but positive review will only come if onlineonly features will be removed entirely and soloing higher difficlty heists in stealth is doable with all loot intact  
i play alone or with 12 friends most of the times  as public lobbies are very annoying in this game series 
so forcing players again to join strangers who dont even know how to play the game  is a bad decision on my point of view  

as always  this is my personal opinion  

sorry for long post  thanks for reading this  developers and players alike

after 10 years of waiting it breaks my heart to say this but this is not payday 3 it is payday 15
these past few months i couldnt help but wonder how content was still regularly being published for payday 2 considering how much overkill studios has loved and cared for this franchise for over a decade now i just assumed they were able to juggle that content with development on payday 3 that is until i realized this game was not made by overkill studios no the payday series was stolen by overkills publisher starbreeze studios and what a mess they have made
now payday 3 is not the worst game ever made the gameplay is solid the heists are enjoyable and the enemies are fantastic on paper this should be a fantastic entry in the payday series and it would be if it had been released after payday the heist a game that first released in 2011 
because this is not payday 3 it is payday 15 almost everything that was added in the transition from payday 1 to 2 is simply gone concealment gone unique skill trees gone meaningful weapon attachments gone multiday heists gone starbreeze studios had the audacity to take this franchise from the people who made it in the first place overkill studios because they presumably had some kind of vision hopefully it would be a good one
wrong their vision was stripping everything away from payday 2 that made it unique complicated so that it would be more palatable to casual and console players of which i typically am in doing so they have completely alienated the audience who have waited ten years for this game its a joke and it just makes me so sad 
to whoever is reading this i need you to understand that i am not a spiteful person i so desperately wanted this game to be amazing but unfortunately im not even sure its good that is something i never imagined myself saying about the payday series ive never even written a review before but that is how badly i needed to share these thoughts
to sum it up starbreeze studios took an amazing series away from a studio that worked very hard to make it into what it has been this past decade their reasoning to make a quick buck doing as little work as possible stick to publishing starbreeze and dont you dare find a way to blame this mess on overkill studios

#####

its really quite phenomenal how every bad part of this game is almost entirely unrelated to the gameplay itself the gameplay is perfect amazing even a huge improvement over payday 2

everything else feels like it was taken and disfigured by the live service vat of acid
menus are bad and the online features are even worse

youve got no preplanning no lobby browser the complete inability to play solo grind is increased overall and theres the fun bonus of possibly matchmaking for 3 minutes to an inviteonly lobby with nobody in it   

i just hope it gets better

#####

the only clown is the one playing the game

#####

a friend and i decided to play the game as i believed the devs wanted us to chronologically heist after heist after 2 sessions over 2 days we managed to entirely complete the game we decided that in hopes of milking as much enjoyment as we can out of the experience we would attempt to speedrun every last heist tonight we decided that this game was not worth playing further 

first the game is rather short at the moment i have 127 hours on record but we beat the game in maybe 58 hours i get that the game has only just released and new heists are likely to come later on but it was very disappointing that my friend and i managed to entirely complete the game in the span of two days 

second there is no need for any variety in gunplay the only change i ever made to my weapons was adding a silencer to the pistol and buying a shotgun also with a silencer the guns do not effect how quick you are spotted and most of them can kill rather quickly so there really isnt much of a need to experiment 

third the skills are hardly necessary to play the game ive managed to successfully complete most heists without ever touching them and i never felt as though there was some barrier to my completing of any heist in payday 2 for instance lacking the stealth tree bonuses was immediately felt upon attempting to play in this game i felt as though i already had the max skills required and i hardly touched them

forth the favor system is silly as it stands completing a heist will randomly and without your knowledge have a chance to give you favors in other heists without these favors some heists are incredibly hard or nigh impossible therefore the successful completion of a heist will sometimes hinge on the fact that the game randomly decided to give you a favor for instance in the heist gold and sharke the very vital to stealth favor of access to the elevator hinges on you experimenting with every heist in the game in hopes that theyll bestow the favor to you from pure rng alone to me thats not enjoyable in the slightest 

fifth theres no replay value in the majority of the heists all of them are hardly fun to play though there are a few outliers such as the limited amount of time to deliver loot in 99 bottles my friend and i enjoyed that my friend and i only managed to find fun in the game through hoping to break the mechanics to complete heists as quickly as possible 

sixth i feel that the money is worthless in this game theres one gun as my friend informed me going for 20m but why would i ever purchase that to say that i spent 20m on a gun the rest of the guns work fine and the most modification i will ever need to do for any of them is adding a silencer i dont find it necessary to buy outfits or masks and heists dont cost anything to do outside of maybe buying ziplines which only cost 10k while you get at least 300k from most heists 

seventh the game developers did the unforgivable sin of having npcs you need to trail while they walk slower than you do 

eighth you never know how much money youre walking away with they removed any feature letting you know how much bags are worth when you throw them in the van meaning you cant weigh the payday you are receiving with whether you want to go back and get more loot 

ninth ive never had issues with the servers but this is because i played from midnight to five or six in the morning every time i played hardly anyone is awake and playing at the time so there is very little server strain i have heard however that the servers during the daytime are unbearable 

lastly the game is simply boring i had more fun playing zookeeper simulator for an hour or two than i had playing this game for almost thirteen once you learn a heist the only way forward is skipping notneeded steps and going as quickly as you can since there are only ever two methods of completing any heist stealth or loud in payday 2 there was replay value in various approaches to stealth or loud like the bfd on golden grin casino in this game since the favors arent always available you tend to just do the same heist over and over again the heists arent fun to do once youve learned them so playing just becomes quite literally a chore play this other heist youve already learned and maybe get favors so you can play the heist you really wanted to play with the favors you may have gotten it is a chore its not a fun gameplay loop and its what ultimately made me decide to leave this review 

so until the game becomes enjoyable i recommend that you reader do not buy this game

#####

add offline play

#####

ngl its probably more fun to rob a bank in real life than in payday 3

#####

the servers work less often than the broke ass piece of shit drill

#####

please dont buy this gametrust me im doing you a favor

#####

guys dont you get it its so obvious were all part of the biggest heist of the year the publishing company stole our money and theyre playing payday 3 with our wallets

#####

do you really own the game if they can just shut down the servers

#####

i fell for it

#####

no offline mode is a real bummer for us solo players queues and lag just to play by yourself is lame

#####

gameplay is fun offline mode would be great

#####

what do you get when you cross an onlineonly game with servers that dont work

you get your money back

#####

i love the game itself and would recommend it entirely but for the love of god add a damn offline mode then i can recommend it beta was extremely fun imo because the servers worked and i thought you could only queue for online because thats what they were testing but i was wrong i cant even play the game because of this always online bs the servers have been down two days in a row i want to see the game succeed hopefully as much as overkill does make the right decision overkill please

#####

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay

#####

cant jump in the van after a heist is completed

#####

payday 3 has had a very rough start

the game looks beautiful and the animations for everything are really nice after reaching lvl 60 as of writing this and patiently dealing with the constant server issues and matchmaking problems since launch i think payday 3 has the potential to be a very good game i have so much fun when the stars align and the game lets you connect you get a good team and win through an intense uphill battle warzone or everyone cooperates and pulls off a stealthy heist that leaves you feeling like a genius

the few issues i have with the game are matchmaking and the way you level up in payday 2 you simply hit crimenet and were brought to a screen showing all your fellow heisters doing crimes from there you could get a big view of all the different activities and playstyle types people were doing or you could even host your own lobby with the heist you want and the playstyle you want to do for the mission and other players will see your game when they browse crimenet hell you can even set the level requirement if you dont want low level players coming into your high difficulty game where alot of perks are required to survive

payday 3 doesnt have any of this instead you press the heists button choose a heist a difficulty ect then you que up and it throws you in with random players you cannot communicate with anybody until the heist starts something you could do in payday 2 and by that time you dont know if your stealth build or loud build will be the best choice not even resetting the heist lets you change your loadout like you could in payday 2 on the planning screen you would have to leave entirely to do it so its really going to be a coin toss most games i play in are very divided with what players want to do some players want to go in guns blazing and cause chaos and some players want to stealth and will spam the vote restart when someone gets caught until everyone agrees or they will leave making the team suffer especially on the higher difficulties 

the leveling system sounds cool you level up by doing various challenges such as getting x amount of kills with x weapon or doing a heist a certain way or using your equipment a certain amount of times ect while its good to try different things forcing players to play a specific way will almost always cause issues you could pull off a solo overkill difficulty mission and kick so much ass but if you didnt complete or progress any challenges you will get 0 exp from the heist and it is such a mood killer when it happens im sure as time goes on and the game receives more heists weapons and updates completing challenges and leveling up will be much easier as theres much more variety and options but as if right now you are mostly forced into playing ways you wouldnt normally play or using weapons and gadgets you dont have interest in which is funny considering the whole weapon level thing they got going on where you unlock attachments the more you use a weapon you like

aside from those issues my time in payday 3 has been really fun when things work and everyone is on the same page i just wish the devs didnt try to fixchange things that werent broken and worked well from payday 2 hopefully future updates will bring qol changes as listed above only time will tell

#####

b ive been part of the payday experience for over a decade and this needs to be said b when payday u2u first released it was rough and i keep seeing reviewers talking about how beautiful payday 2 is without remembering that it too was a dumpster that needed so much air freshener before the dumpster became a palace it took them years to integrate mechanics and ui changes that would stick around nowadays as a staple that were not there on launch good ui great gameplay large mission varieties etc all the things i see people expressing that are in payday 2 were not always in payday 2 keeping this in mind people need to remember that incomplete games have been a thing for literally 8 years you dont gotta be happy about it i know im not but you jump into games like this knowing its going to be a yearly based commitment not a one and done its usurprisingu people dont remember that it took years for payday 2 to have a preplanning mode and they had to release a dlc featuring the dentist just to make it happen and it took even imorei time before it was added as a necessity into base game they even changed the infamy system useveralu times i remember being infamy 3 on payday 2 at one point and then logging back in a few years later to see i needed to do it again b i got payday 3 knowing its future will be better than its release day but then again i still enjoy it despite its very obvious flaws in some areas b

h2 with that lets be reasonable here h2

b pros b

 gunplay feels excellent easily my favorite among the three games
 i love shade if there were ever to be a replacement for bain shade was a great choice
 though the story cutscenes are a little short and vague at times the story is enjoyable so far
 heists are genuinely fun and highly replayable yet a bit limitied for now until they add more
 you dont need to play missions a thousand times to unlock gear and customizations you just buy them
 heist payouts are fairly reasonable now and correlate with the explanations of the mission ie spoilerthe bank job first mission they say the traffic isnt all that high but in this one instance theres a lot of cash sitting therespoiler which is reasonable read the specifications of your mission before jumping in and complaining you arent making as much the narrative fits the missions 90 of the time
 maps are larger and more spread out with more entry points to complete your tasks
 stealth is fun no more needing to worry about your concealment since there is no concealment in pd3 you can stealth with any kit until it gets loud
 enemy ai feels very responsive
 enemy ai looks and responds better to situations
 cloaker can do insane parkour and its genuinely spooky when they physically assault me also they do have sounds people complaining about no sounds arent listening clearly because they make it very clear when theyre talking smack or are in pursuit
 when doing skin paint jobs you can choose individual parts of the gun to be painted or the whole gun painted much like pd2 but pd2 took years to implement that feature pd3 has it day one
 the ingame currency cstack is purchasable using the cash you acquire and while still concerning is reasonable for getting higher quality equipment b no irl payments necessary b
 premade exotic weapons that are bought using said cstack currency
 lockpicking is fun and doesnt take 3 lunar cycles
 music is banger as always
 hostage taking can be used for actual good purposes now like getting supplies
 b you can hostage take swat and officersb its just a skill tree now called manipulator look for menacing in the skills of manipulator reading while some of you dont like doing it pays off
 skill trees cant be exploited anymore forcing cooperation
 solo while i heavily disagree with online only and the limitations for solo players is still doable and fun
 takedowns are satisfying and human shields are useful and work as should

h2 now ill be reasonable with the mixed  cons h2

mixed 

 not being able to see how much money you get in a mission until its done

 the main menu is very empty this needs a desperate change

h2 and now for what the flame lords have been waiting for h2

cons

 b i will never agree with always online b i get why some games do it its a hindrance for people that have unstable internet or play remote with 0 internet i have a buddy who lives in the wilderness waaay up in northern canada drives to town to hangout with his friends and download games and then goes back to his place to play offline he cant play online only games obviously for me though its just a nuisance remove it asap is all i ask for
 no melee weapons yet and shoving does next to nothing but im pretty sure thats a bug con nonetheless
 less ui information for teammates like knowing whos carrying what ingame
 fall damage in some areas is still too high spoiler the skylight in the first bank mission buddy jumped in maybe a 9 foot drop dies spoiler
 the signature 40 pistol advertises its a one and done but even on normal with a well placed headshot on regular enemies not specials its not a one and done its a 2 or 3 and done rewrite misleading weapons as funny and great some of the descriptions on things are you need to be factual
 only allowing takedowns from the back and not the front is a little saddening
 cant pause in solo
 no laser sights
 no safe house probably will be added
 no filter for primary and secondary weaponry but then again secondaries in all games ive played have practically been smallarms while primary is large arms i bknowb that payday 2 had larger secondaries but it didnt at first

h1 tldr which if you didnt read then why take the time to complain or listen to halfbaked reviews that are more arrogant bias than facts h1

 b payday 2 sucked then became great b payday 3 sucks to some im still very much enjoying pd3 and am happy to have been a part of payday 2s disaster period  success period from start to finish but b will b get better the complaints ive read are people expecting perfection on day 1 i and lets be real here i everyone who knows the payday games like we do knew that this game wasnt going to be a gordon ramsay dish sprinkled with appeasement and brown sugar and a little dallas figurine to top it all off this game like many games that are meant to be grown on for years is a commitment if you wish to buy games that are finished on release i can help you with that i know plenty of devs that do so but this is not one of those games where perfection is best served fresh perfection with starbreeze is served in a slow cook

h3 conclusion h3

do i think the game needed more time absolutely 3 more months at the minimum but lately with steam reviews i feel like people enjoy wiping out games and killing reputation on things without letting them have time to breath b developers and publishers have deadlines to follow if youre unaware that a lot of your  games were released unfinished not because they wanted to but because they had to now you knowb the game industry is a business  market with people who got families to feed

but the fact you were all given a standard edition for u cheaper u than a triple a game and yet payday 3 still nails so many things on the head with the fan service and yall still complain 

anyways theres my two cents love it or hate it its good to be back and in a new location and im excited to see the issues many have mentioned worked on and the games future to be plentiful 

h2hope to see some of you ingame sometime have a lovely rest of your day h2

#####

finally came back to reup this review now that servers function the main thing preventing a thumbs up at this point is the lack of a quickplay option or server browser meaning that you will be playing with bots a lot which is just not fun really though this game is really good even without the quickplay

why you shouldnt listen to payday 2 vets from a payday 2 vet

everything is simplified in gameplay  translation the objectives and gameplay now make sense
 im a very long time lover of payday 2 but the simplification from 2 to 3 is honestly a massive godsend payday 2 has a horrible stance on making stealth and loud perfectly distinct from one another requiring completely separate builds to experience one or the other which also makes the game extremely unwelcoming to new players and also sets hosts up against a wave of people they cant possibly hope to educate through each heist in stealth this applies to things like the removal of medics and bulldozer variants which served to confuse players in payday 3 if your gun can kill a cloaker on normal it can kill a cloaker on overkill period while in payday 2 your gun can be perfect on normal and useless on deathwish and up similarly objectives in payday 3 remain far more consistent and follow a more logical progression where as in payday 2 the games instructions based on heist wont make a ton of sense with the potential of being purposefully convoluted just to artificially increase the difficulty big oil day 3

theres so much less build variety  translation i no longer have several dozen options to pick from 99 of which will fall off at deathwish
 a core issue with payday 2 that is absent here is that all of the skill trees that exist in payday 3 are at least helpful and at worst niche where as in payday 2 you have a bajillion option many you have to spec heavily into to get to the god skills inspire requires you to burn points in medkits even if you dont intend to use medkits at all which means that many skills become things you waste points on to get to the things you wish to use another change in 3 is that the death of those bajillion options also means that every option is more finely balanced right now especially with the change from very weirdly stacking stat buffs to 3 reoccurring not stacking buffs in payday 2 you could have 3 to 4 skills all giving you a damage up on a melee strike on top of your perk deck giving you another 3 where as here you have a thing that gives you a damage up which is grit i will also say that the death of perk decks is a good one given that perk decks were honest to goodness powercreep to the very end with leech just absolutely decimating the competition with even earlier additions like grinder completely destroying all challenge when it released

theres no numbers for stats
 an actually decent critique but is not the full story payday 2 took years to add that info and even still that info is basically worthless as you lack break points to compare and contrast what the damage numbers mean with payday 3 and all enemies maintaining the same health from normal to overkill once you hit a weapon that can one tap a swat it will always one tap swats which lowers the need for exact number calculations and a truly deep understanding of break points this also ignores that in payday 2 the best guns were the ones with the most ammo the fastest firerate best ammopickup and dumb perk build ins that would push strong weapons harder while doing nothing for weaker weapons and thats a result of there just being so many cops and so many specials on the map that it became a literal war of attrition to do any heist in the game with payday 3 the game feels a lot more finely balanced a core benefit as you are no longer slogging through thousands of cops for a single heist and instead its totally possible to beat a heist where you dont have a triple digit bodycount by yourself at the end

lack of variety translation i liked that there were 5 of the same bank heist 4 stores and mallcrashers i also liked that the launch of payday 2 was that level of low quality high quantity
 this one is pretty self explanatory but even including the years of dlc doesnt make payday 2s variety much better you have heists like allesso and big bank competing against the far better south of the border saga you have waiting for a drill for double digit minutes in multiple heists vs a smooth transition in comparison to payday 3 each heist is actually idk good and not a fully repetitive waiting game where the game can randomly decide that you must now spend precious time running back and forth repairing the same drill until you win the addition of the qr minigame the safe tumbler the qte lockpicking are all examples of where payday 3 makes its quality over quantity shown but i guess these are the payday 2 vets that did the 40 second lockpick on hoxton breakout which is in and of itself a very slow escort mission where the escort is invincible and werent annoyed the 2nd time doing it let alone the 20th

#####

h1 this is a bittersweet not recommended from me h1

i have many fond memories of playing payday the heist and payday 2 with friends and saw the looming release of payday 3 as the signal to bring the old gang of friends together

disappointment waited ahead however

h2 whats good h2

b gunplay b
i really appreciate the slower gunplay of payday 3 it is more in line with the slower but still intense gunplay of payday the heist cops use shields intelligently staying behind shields and peek out to shoot at the player the faceshield of shields can be shot out to kill the shield which is a nice addition to avoid the unkillable shields of payday 2 bulldozers are actually scary they can take a ton of damage and will eat through your armour like a fat kid at mcdonalds 

b stealth overhaul b
stealth gameplay now feels more natural and rewarding
not having all interaction locked behind masking up is a nice change you are now able to lockpick carry bags ect without a mask areas of heists have been divided up into different categories which limits which actions you can take without arousing suspicion

public area your presence is perfectly normal

private area guards will become suspicious if they spot you and will escort you out if caught this will not force you to go loud civilians will not mind you unless they observe you doing something suspicious turning off power ect

secure area guards will restrain you on sight if spotted and if caught will cause others guards to patrol more

this adds a lot more to stealth runs and is a good addition



b soundtrack is amazing b
gustavo coutinho went above and beyond with the soundtrack no rest for the wicked still gets my pulse going even after 15 runs each music track has both a stealth and loud version with the stealth version increasing in intensity as you complete objectives without triggering the alarm a worthy successor to the tracks of simon viklund


h2 whats bad h2

b progression b
all progression levels unlocks weapon attachments everything can only be unlocked through infamy points which are only obtained through challenges

this means you can complete a heist on overkill fully stealth and receive 0 xp

this baffles my mind challenges should be supplements to the progression not the core of it

the progression system forces you to play the game in a way which you may not enjoy all to unlock the gun you want

b server stability b
if you follow payday just a little bit you will be aware of the major server issues that have plagued the game since before launch yes people who payed to play the game 3 days early could barely play it

the issue is not as prevalent now 28092023 but the fact that the game is always online and requires you to log into your nebula account means that players run the risk of not being able to play the game they paid for if the servers go down




b the gun sounds b
i kinda feel like i had to put this here the guns feel good and impactful cops dock for cover and react to getting shot but the guns sound like nerf guns and create a disconnect for me between the impact im having on police vs the sound the gun is making


b the ui b
it just screams made for consoles not that i have a problem with the game being released on consoles but for god sakes make the ui on the pc something not painful to navigate me having to combine keyboard and mouse clicks just to select which loadout i want to use in lobbies and modify my gun is not okay on a pc

heist selection is on a scroll barwhere is crimenet

turns out both an offline mode and a version of crimenet is in the files however it was removed for some reason during development what the f

b lack of communication b

you are not able to chat with teammates while in lobby which makes it impossible to know if people want to stealth or loud this can cause players to leave the match once you get ingame and realise half want to stealth while you want to go loud


h3 in conclusion h3
the gameplay both loud and stealth is solid and fun however it is held back by server problems an annoying ui and a progression system which boggles the mind of anyone who has played a single progression based shooter before

the game has a lot of potential to be a worthy successor blend of payday the heist and payday 2 but some serious changes must be implemented in order to meet the quality one expects from a third game in a series priced at 3999 euros

b i recommend b
u do not buy  check back in a year u

#####

an otherwise great game that has been otherwise tarnished by corporate greed some higher up at starbreezedeep silver i highly doubt it was the developers decided that online only would be a good idea obviously this is so people wont hack in dlc and microtransaction currency not cstacks something else coming postlaunch to avoid the wave of negative reviews that would come with it however when the inevitable launch day server crash happened this meant no one could play the game hour long matchmaking times that ended in errors and failures to even boot the game were all you got whats that you want to play solo sorry you still need to matchmake for half an hour to play by yourself the people who bought the game had effectively paid triple a price for a main menu a lack of a server browser and lobbies nuking themselves after a heist only compounded onto the issue even if the servers have somewhat calmed down now these issues will continue to plague this game hell they only feel calm in australia but in some places the servers are still constantly failing with some poor devs having to deal with the aftermath of their superiors greed

but once you boot up the game its a blast loud is still a good time with cops actually having a brain forcing you to use your own the game isnt a cakewalk anymore and i love it on higher difficulties teamwork is essential and getting caught alone is a death wish but since enemy health doesnt increase you still have freedom in individual builds stealth is much better being actually enjoyable now unlike payday 2s halfbaked stealth system casing mode feels like an actual feature and civilians arent completely braindead now everything about the actual gameplay itself is fantastic but the things surrounding it just feel like a downgrade

instead of getting experience for completing heists you instead get them from menial challenges making playing on harder difficulties and getting extra loot pointless and turning the game into a killgrind the challenge system also forces you to use weapons you may not like just to level up variety is nice but forced variety is annoying weapon mods are tied to a different weapon specific levelling system lifted straight from call of duty only adding to the grindfest preplanning has reverted from the days of the dentist back to place one medic bag on the map and sometimes you might be able to see the keycard spawns but only sometimes lobbies have no chat function so no asking about preferred plans until youre already in the heist with either no armour or too much multiday heists are gone which were present in payday 2s launch roster and while i personally dont mind the new skill system it is definitely missing the silly factor of some of pd2s skills

overall payday 3 is excellent at its core however everything from the frankly unnecessarily changed levelling system to the corporate mud this game has been dragged through makes it just not worth your time for a game quadruple the price of its predecessor it absolutely does not stack up to even base dlcless pd2s content either wait for deep silver to listen to the community and allow an offline mode or just pick it up on a sale alternatively buy payday 2 for a dollar on sale and play that instead

#####

the actual gameplay is great if you could play literally all it needs is an offline mode and for servers to work

#####

always online

#####

almir how do we fix the backlash for online only
hmm we could remove denuvo people hate denuvo right
yes lets do that

matchmaking error
nebula disconnected

#####

i want to say yes i really do but the community of people defending the abhorrent progression system need to have a lobotomy for some of the egregious choices the devs decided to do solid gunplay with modders making the aspects you want changed be as such stealth being leagues better than pd2s overall the gameplay is great and i want more of it its the backend of it is what is mostly wrong with this game 

the servers being down constantly and the devs giving halfhearted answers to not even slightly relevant questions about the game are always a great sign of things to come this is going to be one of those games you shelve for a long while cause the team that made this game managed to redo the mistakes of pd2s launch and now want to retread that path all over again

i also want to add for the knuckledraggers that want to say the progression is better with it being challenged based yes all your time is spent doing challenges to gain rank not your traditional system but an mmo mechanic that requires you to play certain ways to earn progression no its not slow but its not any faster than had it been a normal system that everyone is familiar with there is no incentive to play the game normally so now you have kill challenge farmers giving up on playing the game the amount of people on copium saying they played the game normally and still managed to have high ranks is appalling to say the least they are just liars trying to get in good with the devs

#####

what a rouge diamond

theres potential here but there are also justso many bad ideas

the good
 weapons are fun to shoot
 heists we have are fun some are reminiscent of heists of the first 2 games
 voice acting is good new wolf is greatthough i still miss ulf in the role
 new drip the heisters got is epic

the bad
 the leveling system beating a dead horse i know but srsly give us xp just for completing heists
 weapon customization i miss the days when weapon attachments gave you straight upsides and not one upside and a crapzillion downsides your better off just taking weapons unmodified
 no pregame chat its 2023 and there is no pregame text or voice chat i know people are like people mainly just use discord these days whats the point of an in game chat lol there are people out that dont use discord ie console players
 the soundtrack while not bad it sounds like copyrightroyalty free music 14 year olds download to use for a stupid and cringy codooty trickshot montage
 unlocks are way too spaced out between levels
 customization is lacking all the suits are just recolors of like 4 or 5 outfits
 cstacks are worthless
 ui is bland
 weapon presets apart from old faithful for the car4 are crap even csgo loot box goblins wouldnt touch
 the only deployable that matters is the armor bag sentries are gimmicky and ammo bags and medic bags are pointless since you can get ammo can be found in security rooms and from ammo drops from defeated enemies and you can get a crap ton of firstaid kits from trading hostages and picking hostage skills also firstaid kits can be on the map already 
 joyjust joywhy did they bring her back nobody likes her but shes a cool character and has a cool backstory people who say that are too much of a wuss to say shes a gamer girl and shes hot
 no offline play again beating a dead horse but they need to add an offline mode it would take strain of the servers and we wouldnt need to worry about not being able to play when our internet goes down cause believe it or not some people cant afford or even get a decent internet package

conclusion 
there is potential here but there are some things that need addressed from the leveling system being overhauled weapon attachments need some work and we need an offline mode also need to address the ui give cstacks more importance and giving the game the same level of replay value the first 2 games had

short version
wait like 1 or 2 years for the game to be more complete if the game is still getting support by then cause this game could be the final nail in the coffin that seals overkillsstarbreezes fate and going back to payday 2 again to add more paid dlc wont save them this time

#####

discard the always online you clearly cant support the servers for it

patch 1 edit the developers think that two musttake core skills required for fun and engaging gameplay at this time are overpowered and need nerfs instead of seeing this as evidence that they might need to buff the other skills they also see the statistics and the community complaining about how there is literally no reason to prioritize ammo or health with the value that armor has but theyve decided to put that kind of fix on the back burner while they added a fix for smalltalk between civilians and employees not triggering and added more small talk conversations between civilians
thanks overkill i was really concerned about the state of civilian conversations in your first person shooter

release of dlc1 edit holy fucking shit 17 for one heist and three guns starbreeze you people are fucking nuts

#####

heist your own bank account

#####

good but has issues
been a month still no update 
fan base is dying

#####

porn games have better match making than this game

#####

at the moment i would not buy this game in my view it should still be beta matchmaker system is broken lagging issues hate the control set up it feels like a downgrade from payday 2 so far online only no solo running no mods dedicated servers only thats it

forward 2 days and they finally have the servers working again and matchmaker seems to be behaving however i still hate the control setup and the movement more worrying tom me is well i cant seem to fall in love with the game at all i dont miss it if im not playing it as i did with payday 2 and so much is left out of this game that i doubt it will ever get close to payday 2 sure better graphics which you would expect after 10yrs and a amazing game engine but it still does not get my pulse moving draw your own conclusions

#####



#####

bcomically large spoon when b

#####

at first i still wanted to recommend the game beside its flaws and terrible launch because i like the base game and was hopeful they would fix all my major gripes i had the heists have depth the gunplay is solid graphics are decent and the skills feel interesting enough however in the recent dev streams they have announced that they wouldnt fix or it would be low priority to fix the issues i had with the game and thus i can no longer recommend the game

obviously the servers are fucked there is no way around it by the time youre reading it they are hopefully fixed but they do not work most of the time right now
but when you even get into a server you will usually not have teammates which is why is specifically i can not recommend this if you dont at least have 12 people you can regularly play with the stealth is very set up for at least 2 people one person masked up and one person in casing and the matchmaking is trash 50 of the time you get zero teammates and no teammates will join over any amount of time i stealthed a heist for 2 hours and the 4th slot never got filled the bots they give you are borderline useless especially if you are alone as they do not revive each other so you are just constantly babysitting these bots playing with bots feels like you are playing one difficulty up over what you are actually playing i can do with very hard with team mates no problem but you got 2 bots its a struggle every time if you have played a payday game before this will come to a surprise to you but i would take the average pub player over a bot yes they are that bad 
i would take davidgonzalles2008 level 10 over hoxton bot at least they will try to attempt to use cover or move bags bots dont i usually dont bother reviving bots a lot of the time on very hard because they have died in the middle of nowhere because they have no sniper resistance do not attempt to hide from them or shoot back it is commonplace that you will hear 2 sniper shots and the sound of a bot going down and i will lose more resources trying to rez them then i would gain from them being alive on overkill they might not be there they instantly go down without any value 
in the current metashield bags are king and half the time they drop useless ammo so not even their resources make them worth being able to choose the resources would be nice or at least lower the ammo chance you also often only have the assault breaks to move bags and obviously they dont help with that you can put bags on them but because they dont keep up with you its an annoying process a collect all bags you come across and move them to x area if you are next to it would be incredibly useful 
also you can do certain objectives during negotiation as long as you dont get to close or shoot bots dont care they will immediately open fire when they see the cops and trigger the assault

they have not said that the overkill system is getting any changes or not so assume they wont but it just feels bad to use what should be a big oh shit tide turner is reduced to the sniper being an easy dozer killer and thats its only use the nade launcher does more damage to yourself then the enemy its detrimental to use the weapon its its a pain in the ass to get it then you have to walk out of the heists during an assault on some maps like the art gallery is so far out where it really does not feel like its worth it at all then you basically cant do anything with it while you carry it if there is a single guy in front of you you can either 1 take the damage and run past 2 waste your precious ammo you had to get out of your way to get it 3 throw it down for 2 seconds kill the guy and pick it up again for 3 seconds why its hold f to pick up is beyond me it should be press it makes the whole system feel so clunky regardless of being unable to literally anything else when you carry it my suggestion is that you can always take it out and put away by pressing the ovk weapon button hold to call and then it drops a special ammo bag instead that you pick up

they said they are happy with the current progression system i have never seen a less satisfying progression system you only get exp through challenges and not heists themselves i recently spend 2ish hours stealthing and beating 99 boxes for the first time on overkill i got zero exp for it thanks a lot sure felt rewarding dont care if its bugged or not the challenges should add onto the progression does not replace it there should be a base exp gain based on heist difficulty and bags amount having to do stuff based on what an unorganized spread sheet tells me rather than what is most fun to me sucks that the game gets incredibly girindly does not help at all im at level 60 and the exp gain feels terrible slow now and have 30 hours and it takes as much exp to get to 70 then to get to level 100 and exp gain only slows down as the challenges get grindier and rarer there is only 8 heists in the game you will either have to do some stupid grind strat or burn yourself out on 70100 hours of the same 8 heists just to get all the weapons or skills the max level is 150 and unlocks more cosmetic stuff

the customization system is also extremely basic and sad and what is there is locked behind such a comical level requirement that you must had played 100 hours before you can make a mask or gun that doesnt look like a shitty nerf gun you can tell that they kept all the good things for the paid packs and the microtransactions they have already announced in a faq page

other annoyances
cant que for loud onlystealth onlyboth not that you can que at all even tho pd2 had this feature
the main menu buy system is just kinda annoying to use little stuff like buying a weapon and it not putting into your inventory but keeping you in the store page who wants to buy more then one of the same weapons especially given that you only need one build of the gun with no concealment in this game 
cant ping codes and have to manually write them down rip console users
glass cutting is def made for controller and feels annoying on pc
no chat in preplanning
no unready button
why do i have to buy favors 10k is such a comically small amount if they cant charge in the preplanning screen because their system sucks they should be free
the special favors just randomly appear and the game doesnt tell you how to get more also doesnt refund them when the server shits the bed or you quit so if you use your rare favor and you have to remake the lobby because the restart doesnt work youre just out of luck
no votekick so if a player is trolling you just must reque and risk not getting into a new match

 in general i am extremely dissatisfied with their response to this terrible launch given that the only thing saving them from bankruptcy was the community buying overpriced dlc for pd2 and pd3 has the exact same model plus microtransactions soon i would assume they would do right to their community however i doubt they will they will try sweeping this disaster under the rug
when somebody is uncertain and angry the last thing the community needs is an uncertain idk we might look into an offline mode because our always online was clearly a mistake not promises tho they want to have their cake and eat it too and this is not what the community needs right now it needs strong commitments to basic features offline mode lobbies reworks of the exp system and bots the game should have had at launch because overkill cant do always online to save their ass
the game needed at least 36 more months in development and till they fix the abovementioned issues i cannot recommend it which is a shame because a lot of the game is fun



#####

no ones gonna see this so imma say that i like naked black men

#####

 tries to create the mandatory nebula account to play the funni heist game on steam

 refuses to send me the email confirmation code so i spend 15min waiting

 finally i can play

 stuck in matchmaking for 20min even on solo play

gg amazing launch its probably fun when they let you play the game

#####

better graphics and better movement as well as a much needed improvement from stealth to loud when things go wrong in a heist
unfortunately this came at the cost of making the game onlineonly for some reason in addition the game just lacks the charm of its predecessor the ui feels boring and lifeless the skill progression system is honestly not great the weapons are just overall bad feeling and lack impact
maybe one day itll live up to payday 2 but for now it feels like a poorly done payday themed call of duty mod

#####

will recommend once the game stops requiring an internet connection and gets a proper lobby and matchmaking system



#####

at least the launch was better then overwatch 2

#####

i cant currently recommend this game 

#####

never in my life have i struggled so much between a thumbs up or a thumbs down never in my life have i wished more than i do now for a more gradient form of review score because never in my life have i ever seen a game that can exhibit so much technical and gameplay improvement over its predecessor while also relegating itself to complete inferiority compared with its predecessor due to some baffling and entirely unnecessary design choices

well start with the good news because that will be a shorter list stealth is massively improved with the addition of hitman style distinction between public private and secure areas no longer will you fail stealth because you bumped into a security guard on the sidewalk outside a jewelry store some heists can even be completed while never masking during the heist since you can do a lot more without wearing your mask in this game  if caught in a private area that is not deemed a secure area guards will opt to escort you from the premises provided you are not wearing your scary clown mask no longer will security guards choose lethal force as their first and only course of action
of course these improvements are compounded by the fact that payday 3 is not using an aging repurposed racing game engine but rather unreal engine no longer will you or a suspicious body bag be spotted by a guard on the roof through the roof windows two floors down behind a bench simply because theres a single pixel gap somewhere in the polygons 

combat is also massively improved for much the same reason as stealth gunplay is smooth and clean hits have impact and enemies are better designed the curse of jules has been banished no longer are enemies specifically designed to be miserable to play against but are rather designed likeenemies in a game truly revolutionary tasers for example now called zappers can only zap you if they have clear line of sight and only if they are close otherwise they opt to lay electrical mines cops with shields now have a weakness in the form of the narrow window on the shield which means guy with sniper rifle is no longer a mandatory part of every team the addition of the grenadier is another intelligent choice especially since its grenades cause poison clouds of course most people have seen the special forces makeover the cloaker has received suffice it to say i no longer resent the cloakers they are fair and balanced and cause a surprising number of horroresque moments clearly payday 3 sees special enemies as strategic units whose purpose is to apply pressure to the player in unique ways rather than simply being oneman kill squads with their primary weapons being absurd dps and hp numbers

by now you are no doubt confused as this surely seems like glowing praise indeed this is the note i would end on but starbreeze has somehow found a way to foul up payday 3 like a public matchmaking lobby of players on shadow raid if you know you know

first ill get it out of the way now yes the game is online only yes there is no legitimate reason for it to be online only and yes the matchmaking servers are pretty slow what youve heard is true post launch when the flood gates opened payday 3 was unplayable for days because in addition to being online only payday 3 has no solo play even if you set your lobby to invite only and invite no one the game will still make you wait in a matchmaking queue presumably because the servers still need to allocate resources to you for what i have no idea 

i dont know what neurosis starbreeze suffers from but it really seems like they want to force us to play payday 3 in multiplayer mode or not at all as of their most recent announcement solo play is not even planned as an addition to the game 
apparently its just so important to the devs that we experience everything matchmaking coop play has to offer like failing a stealth only heist over and over again because of that one player who keeps triggering the alarm he claims he cant see the camera but by the 4th restart i begin to have my doubts
or players on a certain loud mission where you cant allow any civilians to escape in order to get an achievementwhat do they do they drag a hostage to the edge of the map where cops can instantly rescue them or players who refuse to walk to the escape point and simply troll until everyone dies
you get the point intricate stealth missions and public matchmaking simply do not mix public matchmaking is simply incompatible with any game type where one player can fail the objective for all players 

payday 2 suffered from these issues as well which is why i never played public multiplayer in payday 2 i played offline and i used all the mods required to add all the quality of life features starbreeze refused to any you know what i had an absolute blast peak payday 2 is offline solo play with 3040 mods change my mind you wont

but alas like a heister sneaking into the private areas of a bank i get the distinct impression that as a player i am not welcome in payday 3 starbreeze doesnt seem to want players like me
in hindsight this train of thought has more merit than an idle lament its visible in every design aspect
that leads me to my last remark payday 3 lacks much of the personality and charm of payday 2 gone are the detailed photorealistic stop motion shots of the contractors gone is the unique deepweb inspired ui flavor gone is the presence of crimenet really its mentioned sure but its not really something you interact with instead payday 3 features passable but generic music and a ui and loadout screen that looks suspiciously like it was ripped straight from csgo or your favorite battle royale voice acting is hit or miss much like payday 2 but it also lacks the excellent voice acting that certain characters would bring it helps some of them were voiced by actual celebrities but still i feel like im queuing for some generic shooter whenever i start a match in payday3 and many of the missions despite their technical improvements dont have the personality to make up for the terminal deficit

in conclusion payday3 is a game that despite being out of early access still feels very much like it should remain there it holds a lot of promise and features a lot of improvements over payday2 but this promise is very much overshadowed by the nonsensical and frankly anticonsumer design choices made by the developers this is not a game for those without a healthy stock of friends to play with and i fear this might not even be a game for those who liked the previous game but whatever the intended audience is there is nevertheless significant enjoyment to be had here if you have at least one human being who will tolerate you long enough to play with you for now i rate it 5 deposit boxes out of 1 thermal drill and hope that starbreeze will turn this ship around so i can change this review before too long

no bain  no funny

i miss the old payday straight from the go payday
chop up the soul payday set on his goals payday
i hate the new payday the bad mood payday

#####

its a decent game but only when it has a christmas sale price tag 
so just wait 9 months and 2 days to pick it up

#####

after years of anticipation started from pd the heist back in the day played pd2 through its good and bad times this as it stands aint it my gamer

fck man i used to watch the live action trailers like there was no tomorrow listen to criminal ambitions single when i was in the gym because you felt so bad as back before payday 2 went apesht  and we started doing weird otherworldly stuff for bain and yakuza exc exc now we got a random chick that replaced bain  the quality between the two is not even up for debate she sounds robot wouldve expected a better writing and voice acting as shes probably gonna be the person you hear most during your gameplay

i wont go into technical issues too much for now  as many people already did with their reviews but i gotta get these off of my chest currently matchmaking is f tier with what i assume is the launch day players filling up the servers got the gold version so was playing it 3 days before wasnt perfect but wasnt this bad then which will probably be fixed soon still scuffed as fck and a massive downgrade from crimenet or the horrible ui system that is a huge disappointment from everything that pd2 accomplished so far and seems to be designed to actively piss the player off and with more buttons to press to do even the simplest of tasks in the menu the weapon customisation seems to be mostly irrelevant too

the gunfights and skill system took a different direction its much less a horde shooter compared to pd2 and more of a calculated tactical shooter that pd the heist was whether its good or bad time will tell but im currently enjoying it the more i level up the more stuff makes sense although it doesnt have the goofiness and the creativeness of some of the skills and builds that pd2 had it kinda matches the path theyre taking with this pd the heistish more realistic setting stealth was drastically improved and i actually want to actively play it obviously the game looks better albeit some performance problems which again im sure will be fixed eventually

my real anger and sadness comes from the fact that after years of experience this game has many downgrades in many areas compared to pd2 overkill or deep silver  whatever they are now they have done some fcked up sht in the past that pissed off the community but this whole launch is again a slap to the face to the veterans i dont want to speak for everyone here but i think vets would appreciate what im saying right now i wasnt expecting the huge amount of heists  weapons  content that pd2 had of course but with the amount of experience they got from fixing and updating the second game for years i would expect a better polished product but the overall image theyre drawing right now is this was an early access  beta release the lack of content makes me think the game will be upgraded over the years with paid dlc ovk being ovk makes sense

im sure someday this game will be much better improved polished and my review will be positive but for now as a veteran and a long time supporter of the series and the devs i cant shake the feeling that i was betrayed by them

#####

good game terrible matchmaking

fyi you can still refund this game if you have over 2 hours played list your refund reason as multiplayer doesnt work

#####

i played payday 2 for 10 years 1900 h and i worked in payday 2 and  payday 3 for 2 years in starbreeze studios 
it is my time to write the review of this game

i cant talk some stuff because nda but basically payday 3 it is a mix of incompetent people who dont know and dont care about the game at all
as all of you can see they tried to make a replica of pd2 in unreal without understanding the game at all

poor game design choices  terrible art under the direction of daniel perezhahahahha  a guy who did not realize they are copypasting the masks from pd2 with negative sales and this guy was posting  in socialmedia they did a good job the 0 respect for the hardcore community who made them survive with pd2 when they almost close the company dlcs when you are not even selling the game 
a good team of artists and developers lead by dumb leaders who dont know the game the franchise and the community

a lot of veterans from pd2 told them i told them now they can see their ego can not pay this check

pd most of the people working in the game they dont even know you can play in stealth mode 
pd2  look how goofy and stupid are the masks and the outfits thanks to the art director d

another franchsie ruined by greed and  zombie managers

the end

#####

false advertising  there is no single player even for closed lobby you have to go thro matchmaking

#####

great game i just wish i could play something other than the tutorial

#####

mm might be shit but the actual game is valid

#####

online only need i say more

#####

my unfiltered opinion on payday 3 as a veteran whos played payday 2 from ps3 to pc for close to 9 years now

the gameplay is not much different from what we saw in the beta what you see is what you got its smooth and enjoyable and the gameplay loop of popping helmets is just as fun as it was in payday the heist and payday 2

i really love the new specials grenadiers that you can shoot the belts off of tazers now zappers that carry some aa battery pack on their waist that you can shoot to aoe stun everyone with cool particle effects dozers that really run through you like you guessed it a fucking bulldozer cloakers that genuinely jumpscare you just like in pd2 but look a lot cooler imo

the soundtrack rest for the wicked is really good but i genuinely havent noticed any other song its lacking plain too backgroundy and doesnt give you that adrenaline pumping through you like simon viklunds work did

perks and skills really boring they simplified the entire menu to make it easier to understand i feel like barry bugle complaining about morrowind getting modernized and simplified because in essence thats exactly what happened no more 200 reload speed 500 headshot damage ranged revives 2500 melee damage 78 damage reduction you have grit 10 less dmg received edge 10 more dmg dealt and rush 10 movement speed and thats it none of these make a difference or feel impactful in gameplay whereas builds in payday 2 were half the fun every other build felt like a completely renewed and fresh experience

the weapons tiny theres maybe 2025 guns in the entire game not counting presets which are just guns that come premodded and we hardly got anything from payday 2 i think no one wouldve complained if they just ported over the entire arsenal and started building on top of it instead as well as the leveling system to unlock each modification for each gun seperately unlike in payday 2 where you unlocked the optic and slapped it on whatever you want its really really really demotivating to use some of these guns

the armor i fucking despise it the whole resource management in this game was that you had to keep your health up cause you wont get it back and armor gives you the edge to make plays and you had downtime when it broke so it could regen and you would loop it it being a limited resource needing to put on new armor plates the moment yours breaks just punishes you for any sort of movement you do running sliding any type of aggressive play you make will end up with you being punished at least a little bit and it forces you to play a boring passive playstyle to hold on to as much armor as you can so you can live through the guaranteed final push of infinite cops at the end of every heist without getting curbstomped right next to the exit

shotgun is really fun lol 

the ui is really clunky especially in preheist lobby where they improved on some things but left out others you cant chat anymore you cant ask if your teammates are prepping to go stealth or loud you can revamp your build you couldnt in pd2 but you cant unready to change your weapons you could in pd2 so its just really confusing and i feel like it was rushedhalfassed hoping its the first thing they resolve cause it feels unresponsive and janky

overall just like payday the heist and payday 2 its a janky ass launch that they will have to resolve until it surpasses its current state and becomes an actual worthwhile of a 1000 hours type of game

tldr superb gameplay but lacking soundtrack skill system arsenal and questionable gameplay adjustments that dont fit in with the series i would suggest to wait a little bit for some updates to sharpen and polish the game up a bit

#####

i want to like and recommend this game i really do from what i have played it is good but there are some big issues that prevent this


starting with the ugly and the reason for not recommending
always online only if you cant play whenever you want you dont really own the game youre just borrowing
when you open the game you need to log in with a nebula account which you will most likely need to go make on their website first i can understand why they did this as this is how you use crossplay and add friends on different consoles this is only a minor part of the bigger issue

unlike in pd2 where everyone hosted their own game pd3 is overkill server hosted this isnt outright bad what is bad is that there is no way to local host or even play single player you only play on their servers through matchmaking even when setting it to invite only meaning you need to be in the lobby to let other people join you you still match make and it does take time i am literally writing this whilst queuing for a friends only match and i dont even have anyone added yet

this comes with the downside of if your internet connection is out or unstable or the overkill servers are down you cant play as i said at the top if you cant play whenever you dont own the game youre just borrowing it from overkill when they have the servers up and you have a stable enough net connection to play this is the biggest issue by far and has resulted in a lot of people not being able to play i never say literally unplayable but here i mean it and the worst part is that this is by design

i can see why they have done some these things at least conceptually the way they have actually implemented it is awful


now the good
if it wasnt for the above i would actually recommend this game but reality is often disappointing
i actually like the game i like the change to unreal the game feels and looks really nice the models guns sounds and improved mechanics are cool there is traffic and they stop for you if you stand in their way you can close doors there is vaulting and other cool qol things that come from a modern game on a modern engine

the guns are really nice to handle aside from the assault rifles and smgs feeling really weak even on hard being able to interrupt the reload then continue the remaining steps instead of completely restarting the reload is very nice i like the weapon leveling and progression each gun earns xp when you use it this then levels up the gun and unlocks more mods i prefer this over needing achievements and or finding gage packages

casing mode has been expanded and concealment is no longer a thing so any build can partake in stealth then go loud if needed being able to do more especially in stealth is really cool you can sprint fast walk pick locks which is interactive and no longer just hold button crack safes interact with objects like objectives key cards and loot without needing your mask on instead if you are in line of sight of npcs you will be observed meaning they will become alerted to you as if you were wearing your mask

the hostage taking and manipulation is significantly better than pd2 you can now yell once to get all alerted civs down if they are nearby to hear you yelling at them cable ties are unlimited so you dont need to kill them to avoid needing to baby sit them cleaner costs are now a percentage of the take further discouraging killing civs there is even a new way to manipulate hostages you can pick them up and hold them like a human shield cops will avoid trying to shoot you but will shoot if you do you can also use this to move them like you an just take the manager you need and throw them against the lock you need opened

the ai feels better they hide behind shields and actually move away from grenades and shields face them to shield themselves from the blast they move together as groups they dont just feel like individuals roaming around trying to stop you they cover each other and use their greatest strength their numbers against you

returning characters when they said there would be 2 more playable characters at launch other than the core 4 i knew at least one would be female and there was a high probability of it being a returning character i was hoping for sydney we got joy and a new character pearl who sounds east coast us would not surprise me if she was from new york given the gangs circumstances story wise there have been several returning characters story wise i wont go into that to not spoil it i will say that gage is back as our arms dealer the gang hasnt bought from gage since the russian back back in 2018 i am happy he is back as our primary arms dealer

the broke dick drill got an overhaul and its roll is a lot more downplayed as mentioned above lock picking got improved and safe cracking is a thing so you dont drill as much anymore its no longer the go to get through lock option the first heist doesnt even use any drills

the sound track is good



the bad some of these might be a bit nit picker i did say i like the game
the bulldozer i dont like the look of it it looks too much like the rest of the cops effectively just swat but bigger i miss the old look where they were in a full body suit that was very different from every other cop design it also doesnt feel as good to shoot in pd2 there were several body armour pieces that broke off when you shot it front and back external plates tall collar face plate visor now its just a generic riot helmet and collar and they dont break off until the dozer is nearly dead so it just feels like they are a bullet sponge instead of me shooting off and through its armour

as mentioned some of the guns feel weak maybe im just not using them right or with the right mods and skills i havent really gotten too far into that yet the weapon stats are all vague bars it doesnt give you any numbers any modifiers from weapon mods are vague vertical recoil for something that reduces vertical recoil type thing no specifics all smoke and mirrors so when i say it feels weak its because the only metric i have is how many bullets it takes to kill a swat

the weapon store there are no categories of weapons all weapons are in the same place so i dont know if its a primary or a secondary from what i can tell only the pistols and revolvers are secondaries compared to pd2 where smgs and pdws where secondaries not only is this just bad design this is also bad future proofing which is a little disappointing considering they know exactly what happens after they keep adding new weapons and mods for 10 years shit gets cluttered

the ui it doesnt just feel like it was made with console in mind i feels like it was made without pc in mind the quit game button is tucked away in a misc side menu and going between your load out and the store feels awkward you can click on the empty slot to go to the store but because thats a separate menu to your load out you cant just press esc or back to go back you have to re select the load out menu





from what i have heard the skills are based around you stacking buffs i cant really speak to this

there are many good cool things about this game i want to enjoy it but i have just written this review over 30 minutes of waiting then edited later to give more detail and expand what i do actually like and dislike to get a game here and not being able to play the 60 game i purchased read paid for the privilege of borrowing when overkill lets me play

#####

where bain

i miss bain

bain 

#####

23 hours of matchmaking was really a good experience

#####

lacking substance

#####

this is not payday 3
it is simulator of waiting in the lobby

#####

crazy
i was crazy once
they put me in a game
a payday game
a payday game with no offline play
no offline play makes me crazy
crazy

#####

big edit after playinglogging about 46 hours on the game most of which was waiting to join a stupid lobby 

what game does that makes you look for a multiplayer lobby just to play solo with bots i still stand firm of the whole fuck this online only bullshit they are peddling towards us

the game itself is a great and fun experience when it works massive improvement from payday 2 its got fun stealth good gun play even though loud can be slightly a chore every now and then armor system is kinda weird and dumb but overall i dig the game 

but with that all being said it still has a lot of glaring issues not gaining xp for solo stealthing heists on overkill due to the stupid challenge xp requirements is dumbfounded to me i also feel like the armor system could be looked at a little bit being that if you dont run a few certain skills youre just fucked in higher levels and of course the always online crap 

if youre interested in this game just be warned that there are still a lot of huge issues thats why i recommend waiting till a sale comes around and picking it up then instead of wasting your money on another unfinished anti consumer product

#####

this is 2023 the age of scalability and cloud computing made easy paid a lot of money gold edition just to get an unusable game matchmaking doesnt work the most important feature in the online only game 05 stars because i cant even play it highly disappointed

#####


servers go down
people get off
servers stop getting overloaded
devs say they fixed it
people get on 


#####

good game lots of problems excited for the future of the game but id wait until those come to purchase it

#####

overall great upgrade from payday 2 but permanently online dreadful ui and servers committing seppuku even on day 2 of launch is a joke especially after stress testing the servers before release 

wouldnt recommend picking it up unless you have the patience to put up with not being able to play due to the servers completely going down

#####

payday always be like its a simple job in and out and then you proceed to get all authorities in the whole us involved

#####

just buy helldivers 2 instead

#####

ive been playing payday 2 since 2017  ive seen starbreezeoverkill stumble for years  bos flashbangs crimefest 2015 skins backtracking on their promises starvr overkills the walking dead which from what i heard has better melee hit detection than no more room in hell the insider trading accusations and reopening payday 2 dlc not to mention the questionable balance patches for payday 2 over the years

this is yet another stumbling block for the company  theyll probably recover from the poor gameplay of this the movement and gunplay feels way too slow like im in molasses compared to the other two payday titles but will the industry get any better  no

i wish all of the starbreezeoverkill staff the best in their future endeavors because i know theres some seriously passionate staff in there  hell this game makes me miss jules  fuck  heres to hoping the live service project baxter uses the dd ip well and doesnt give a ceoshareholder a golden parachute

if you want a good heisting title i recommend waiting for den of wolves to release but dont preorder give it a solid month for people to react to it launching  the studio 10 chambers has ulf anderson the original voice of wolf and simon viklund the original payday composer  these two know what made payday the heist and payday 2 good  just give it time in the oven though since you shouldnt think of any corporation as your friend

now i really want to refund this game but im getting buyers remorse because i feel like this game might get unlisted  i am a masochist who has more money than iq  im gonna stick around to see this game flop and fumble for a while so i can build up tolerance to the modern industry slop

#####

amazing menu screen

#####

this game is the reason why i dont preorder anymore

#####

this game is great and i feel its hard to go back to payday 2 after how much ive enjoyed of it so far

warning 
if you think this game will be payday 2 the sequel then youll have to understand its more payday the heist 20 than just a updated version of payday 2
also the state of the servers are now in a better state and  or fixed since it the release two weeks ago
so if you hear people talking about issues with servers they are most likely dealt with

thank you

so to start off
this game is what i felt was missing from payday 2 in most ways a game about the thrill of heisting and challenge of those heists so here we are and it was a rough launch servers were a mess which i seen plenty of that kind of issues in games before like apex legends or warframe when the influx of people is too great for warframe in perticular during tennocon with the amount of players joining ingame for the event 
then of course theres the whole issues of not enough weapons cosmetics heists ect from a majority of reviews which its funny that people expect a new game that released in a way the same way as payday 2 launch including but not limited too both games having few starting heist at launch with 11 heists in pd2 vs 8 in pd3 not alot of stuff early on and heck even not alot of perks and such from the start
so lets keep our cool here and not go rage inducing at starbreeze for not having everything right here
and too be honest i feel this might be also a case of a publisher gunpoint at them i mean deep silver helped publish this game and were the same publishers that force the direction of the reboot saints row game yes the that bad one and the same ones who put alot games that werent ment to be epic games exclusives too so dont try and be all pointing guns at starbreeze when even they themselves might be have a publisher point a gun at them

so do keep in mind here payday 3 right now is the start not the finish line

so other than that lets get started with pros
the pros
 gameplay is smooth and rich as ever
the gunplay is a step above payday 2 in everyway and its movement too
with vaulting being moving and pressing jump when near a ledge or small wall or window or heck even a vent its well rounded and very nice the whole game feels a step ahead with the new engine and its new features as well

 its combat is hard challenging and thrilling
 can be taken as either positive or negative depending on view 
its more tactical and harder than payday 2 making pd3 normal feel like pd2 very hard cops are tough but still vulnerable specials have been tweaked and changed to be both vulnerable and more dangerous too especialy cloakers and dozers being realy scary now dificulty scaling is now based on damage and aim and not health after all cops are now more like what they should be tough on bodyshots weak on headshots but not overbearingly tough like pd2s cops on high dificulties
the cops are now designed with reason behind with some specials having weaknesses besides headshots shields are not a wide cover and their front peice can be shartered to headshot him zappers have their battery box to shoot to stun him and other cops around him grenadiers have the grenades on their front peice and can be shot to explode claokers are more agile quicker but dont mean an instadown if taken care of and bulldozers put the fear of god back in you with their charge and autoshotgun these guys dont play around at all 
so if people complain that cops are too bullet spongy then thats a skill issue

 stealth is 100 improvement from before
its better it has more improvements and options and if stealth fails it transistions to loud with no issues and its very seamless too
the stealth in this game is so good that payday 2 stealth i cant go back too after playing it its thrilling redesigned to be more grounded and more balanced the stealth shows how much they wanted to inprove on what pd2 was lacking for a long long time 
one issue with it a minor one but can be serious at times i wish there more rewards for going all stealth on heists
but lets get to the nitty gritty with stealth on how much is improved
stealth at a base level is now universal no more detection risk and do just as much in casing mode as masked on
casing mode is now more redefined and way better heck you can just have one with a mask and another without and complete a stealth with no issues you can do alot more in casing mode too lockpick stuff sneaking around hacking cameras and interacting with stuff a way better improvement
if your caught in casing mode its not a immediate game over and mask on gaurds are now gaurds and will escort you out of private areas only on secure areas were they will cuff you and even then its not a full blown out of luck if you have the perk to uncuff yourself or have a teammate to uncuff you
pagers are now alot better and if lose your last pager its not an immediate alarm it will go into search mode wich then if you answer a pager while on search it will lead into alarm
plus you can build yourself for both loud and stealth and can switch or cross over when needed or just go all stealth and have no issues

even if theres a few points for pros dosent mean everything else is bad far from it
but now we got to talk about the cons
the cons

 online only
not the worst thing and besides in many of dev streams after release they did mention about adding it in the reason i believe had to do with either their response about cheaters or just the publisher deep silver being a pain and forcing them
still this was mainly complained because of server issues at launch which for the most part are now fixed

 exp and leveling
its not the worst but it can be a pain plus this whole challenges progression was also in payday the heist but even then i would love to have a dual system of just gameplay progress with the challenges to help earn specifics or just have better rewards attached to them

the reveiws  
yes im making a section about the reveiws youll understand
alot of people mainly position themselves with the reviews on alot of launch issues which yes is important but also not pernament and lasted about a week with the server issue as well as people complaining about the perks being weaker and less interesting than pd2
 with perks i sorta understand but at the same time i played game like borderlands 2 and warframe with better customization and abilities than pd2 with warframe being a bit more complicated
i mean think about it you have a perk deck that determines a way to play with none even primarly built for stealth by the way and skills to be built around it
in pd3 its more condense and more design for gameplay choices than a whole build just to do even  stealth normaly plus this is the start of pd3 with more perks coming in the future so there will be more to choose
 not enough this or that
alot of complaints about that for a game that took a good while to make redefined and all and they expect to have alot of content at the start even though this is a slow cook not a one and done meal 
to be honest i dont mind what we got right now and i know there will be more to come soon

closing statement 
so for all of you who read my review or just skiped all of what ive said to this part then let me say this
payday 3 is a diamond in the rough
its not bad its very fun and theres a couple of issues
nothing more or less and i think it will go far as long as others gives it a fair chance

#####

six months later barely anything has changed about the game i think you could count the updates weve had on one hand too theyre gonna spend the next few months doing qol patches so come back in a year or two if youre looking for an actual game if it doesnt reach end of service by then

another overkill flop forget preordering this aint even worth postordering

#####

behind some baffling lack of qualityoflife features ultra nitpicky  grindy progression system and an abyssmal launchserver experience there is a pretty solid game here

best thing that this game does is to carry over the payday the heist aesthetic while keeping the gameplay more modern and techy i geniunely love the simplicity of what are you trying to achieve in the heist while having advanced gadgets to work with spy cam is a favorite

compared to payday 2 loud combat feels less arcadeish and stealth feels much more grounded which are both big pluses for me maps feel more worked on while i still wonder if they will manage to keep it up for the bigger ones like goat simulator or beneath the mountain

these aside being a onebuild guy myself i really dont appreciate the progression system at its current state where you have to switch things around if you would like to progress at a faster pace also not having simple features like lobby chat on launch is just plain annoying theyve got their hands on the server issues at the time of this review so lets hope they keep this up

overall ive really enjoyed payday 3 and you should too despite the reviewbombing its receiving right now mostly caused by the aforementioned server issues

#####

live service for this game  was a mistake   i only have 3 hours in the game when writing this review     because  thats how much i was able to be online in an always online game

otherwise   the game was nice only if there would be a way we could actually play it      and we dont have to wait for matchmaking when there is 4 of us  stacked   waiting to be matched with      what

h1 you see i need my payday three h1

as a person who has been playing payday for over 9 years and has 1500 hours of playtime across all games in the series the third installment in the franchise certainly feels like an interesting experience

to begin with it definitely feels more like a sequel to payday the heist both in terms of its groundedness and grittiness it is certainly not over the top with absurdity like its predecessor payday 2 i say it with a good heart though payday 2 is hands down one of the funniest games in existence

however it is expanded beyond belief with all kinds of enjoyable additions so lets dive into them

to begin with the graphics are gorgeous the unreal engine is refreshingly smoothspoilerwho knew that making previous paydays on the outdated diesel engine would not be a good ideaspoiler i was genuinely awestruck just strolling through the lobby of the gold  sharke bank or looking at the golden sun rays permeating the penthouse on the touch the sky heist or the noirish overcast  foggy ashton fine jewelry store sheesh the game is aesthetically delightful each heist feels like a hollywood movie scene complete with tiny details such as cars driving around with music blasting out of them civilians engaging in small talk and guards buying soda midway through their patrol route when you look at say the jewelry store or the nightclub from payday 2 its just laughable compared to this game looks more like fanmade heists the level design of this game and the prequel are literally as contrasting as night and day additionally a lot of the heists do not even conceal the fact that they are recycled from the prequels the aforementioned gold  sharke is clearly a rendition of the big bank the under the surphaze and touch the sky heists are visible homages to the first and third days of the framing frame job respectively etc and what do i think about it its brilliant they took the classics that stood the time test and put an aaatype quality spin on them just playing these new heists once will make you want to stay in them they are not copies they are mature and fully fresh spiritual successors to their predecessors and im all here for it

speaking of the gameplay itself the stealth has certainly had the most notable glowup the best stealth heist in payday 2 was arguably framing frame day 3 the penthouse infiltration where teamwork finesse and coordination meant everything to your success even the bag moving part was made so tastefully that you enjoyed it now take that heist add advanced nonlinear objectives and device hacking reworked casing mode which sometimes allows you to complete the entire heist without even masking up and the search mode which forgives some of your mistakes in stealth instead of immediately calling an army on you and extrapolate it on every other heist with even more cool additions for you to explore there are however two huge issues with stealth first a fixed rng seed which does not reset after you restart the heist it means that upon restart you can bypass many if not most objectives of the mission which trivializes the game beyond reason and is honestly straightup cheating example on the first bank heist nrftw you can find the code to the vault on attempt a and upon restart on attempt b go to it and open it without ever bringing the manager to the biometrics scanner which is required by the game by default and is the most difficult objective of the mission second online only once i was stealthing the gold  sharke bank for nearly 3 hours and just as i was about to toss the last bag into the van and escape i disconnected from the server enough said 

now with the gunplay come a few issues the gunplay is gorgeous and truly feels like a hollywood shootout in the midst of combat it sometimes feels like im playing battlefield or call of duty especially with the stunning visual effects blasting on the screen but at the same time it really feels like most maps available at launch clearly favor silent gameplay rather than loud gunplay both in terms of the maps notsobig scale and objectives which not always but sometimes turn from dynamic and engaging to the more classic ones such as wait for the drillhelicopter andor move the bags

it seems that the game at its current state simply cannot showcase all its newfound gunblazing glory due to quite simply lack of heists

repeating myself many maps feel claustrophobic and geared towards stealth when you infiltrate say the neon cradle nightclub the objectives are very dynamic and are not all about loot moving or vault drilling but as soon as the alarm goes you suddenly find yourself tossing many bags around while engaging in primarily closequarter combat dont get me wrong i have certainly enjoyed it but when 68 heists are focused mostly or solely on it it gets old quickly had you given me my fullauto saiga from payday 2 however 

the game desperately needs heists ala the communitycertified bangers hoxton breakout rats and hotline miami where dynamic shootouts across all ranges take up most of your playtime and the objectives are both challenging and dynamic not boring and timeroriented developers did a good job with it on heists like road rage which has been reminiscent of both the hoxton breakout and green bridge heists but it needs scale fun and explosions a bomber helicopter appearing out of nowhere a cussing russian commissar or blowing up a whole petrol station thats the sexy stuff we want you feel me 

ill say a few words about the unfortunate launch too not talk down on the company everyone is fed up with that already anyway but speak from the perspective of a longstanding payday fan i knew exactly what payday was so by all means was i not surprised by this launch the people in charge of the company are known for making unreasonable greeddriven decisions in the past isnt it ironic that a greedy company made a game about giving in to your greed but they are also known as one of the most attentive creators in the industry who always consider the needs of the community and successfully implement them into the games dont hate on the developers though they have clearly poured their heart into the game

at its core its a masterpiece game with tremendous potential but most importantly its the payday we all know and love with a new exciting spin put on it im certain that all of the bad marketing decisions were made by the corporate bosses who are eager to line up their own pockets and perhaps save the company from bankruptcy which was impending not that long ago but they have to understand that in 10 years the money will be spent and there will come a time to make payday 4 however people will only want to play it if the company works on the longevity of the title and the reputation of caring for its core player base 

is the game halfbaked not at all here and there there are mistakes sure but without a lengthy beta test its impossible to reveal them all payday 2 at launch didnt have more than 85 of the content it has today literally i counted thats kind of the premise of the title the game expands drastically with time to keep it fresh and relevant for new and experienced players alike realistically you can expect the game to be fully playable in mid or late 2024 when more updates come unless they make even more detrimental decisions microtransactions im looking at you 

would the game have come out better 612 months later perhaps with fewer bugs and a bit more content but im sure that the core decisions such as onlineonly would have been made regardless now they have a clearcut community reaction and conclusions to draw from it a vivid case study so lets hope theyll make the right decisions

#####

congratulations payday 3 in my nearly 20 year old steam account with over 500 different games yours is the first to ever get a negative review from me across my entire library

thats how badly you screwed this one up how do you go from mountains of content in pd2 to whatever this is

#####

was fun despite only having 8 heists
but more than half of my playtime is in main menu queuing

#####

i cant even play the game

#####

as of writing this the game is currently launching for everyone

ive got about 30 hours as i had access to the early launch and boy im impressed but there are definitely some things to improve upon

pros 

 stealth has been majorly improved its more forgiving more intuitive and more open no more detection stat any build can be used to stealth if you can pull it off

 new mechanics are a welcome addition using civilians as shields will push the cops to change their strategy to get the civ out of harms way before attacking you negociation phase is also great to buy yourself time and ressources

 i personally like the armor rework it feels more useful and important now you seriously want to keep those chunks full and make use of your surroundings to avoid any amount of damage
additionally the new armor choices are pretty neat you either have low armor but high mobility the middle ground or high armor but low mobility as an armor enjoyer i approve 

 feels like each weapon has a use now but again you might find a favorite or two because of your playstyle

 overkill difficulty now really means overkill you will not be able to get through it loud on your own seriously they upped the ante on the difficulties and thats without even increasing the ais hp nope theyre more accurate and coordinated as it should be

 special enemies have had quite a change in designs they tend to blend in more with your basic cops especially the dozer taser whos now called zapper in this game dont ask me why and the brand new grenadier who i personally quite like
i feel its a neat change in my opinion making the use of pinging much more important in regards to team cooperation especially as theres now a skill line focused on that the new weak points are also a welcome addition its a great way for casual players who might not be too keen on always aiming for the head to be able to deal with these threats theyre pretty easy to spot if you pay attention so kudos to the designers

 the maps and heists themselves are great each have their own gimmick and all can be done either stealth or loud except road rage being only loud with both options feeling special in their own way environnement design is next to perfect you can seriously turn any of the maps into a pure warzone making use of anything as cover and using nearby extinguishers  propane tanks as opportunities

 skill trees and perk decks have been combined into one single skill line system feels more simple but some might disagree overall it seems to do its job for now

 tutorial seems to be good enough for whoevers getting into the game for the first time or for any returning player  veteran great job on that 

 the tools you have can be used both in stealth and loud just as efficiently expecting the ecm jammer which i find is a great design choice imo

overall if youre looking for a mix of payday 2s rpg elements  weapon  character customisation with pdths more grounded and mediumpaced gameplay and gritty setting youll love it here


cons 

 no offline play i get its likely necessary with the nebula account gimmick and all that but please look into making one for the future

 ui could use some work specifically the vendor section i dunno who thought mixing the primary  secondary weapons  in the same place was a good idea but they gotta go back to the drawing board
same for the preplanning if youre into that sort of stuff youll find that pd3s pre planning is a major downgrade from even pd2s pre planning back on its launch really hope theyll also rework it entirely postlaunch

 the matchmaking system is a little scuffed theres no crimenet you simply pick a heist you wanna play a difficulty and the game will put you in any lobby that fits what you picked after the heist is done theres no option to stay with the randoms you were given kinda defeats the whole purpose of making your crew along the road

 whilst i love the overkill weapons only having two to pick from seems quite underwhelming dont get me wrong theyre great but please give us more options

 c stacks are a good concept but personally i have little to no use of them unless theres a preset you like youll never bat an eye to it especially when some of the charms cost a 100 of these which is uh a lot of dosh for just a lil trinket on your gun

 kinda associated with the ui issue again but why do we gotta buy favors from the vendors  why is it in the arms dealer category  who thought this was a good improvement  huh 

 this one is sort of a personal nitpick but i aint a fan of how the stickers look yeah thats it

 the challenges are great but we need more ways to know how to do them simply going to a menu and reading through hundreds of these most of them being just higher levels of previous ones is not a good way to incentivise people to care about them unless they really want to level up i get its the point of the new infamy system but please look into more options to make it more accessible to the more casual part of the playerbase

 why is the quit game option in the more section

 no more dodge builds personally i dont mind it but i know many people who will find it to be an issue

i know there are more cons than pros but im mainly being nitpicky because i want this game to perform to its expectations its meant to be a successor and i very much hope my review will help with that

i think thats pretty much all i gotta say about the game its got the potential to be a gem but its got some corners that need more polish and quite a bit of rework on certain aspects before it can get there i still very much recommend you buy this game whenever you can as im sure youll enjoy it a lot if youre into fps grounded coop experiences

my rating strike 010 cant climb in the back of the van anymore please fix now  strike 

810 i can definitely see this game as one ill put a good few hundred hours into if not a thousand

#####

online only nebula data error no word from starbreeze very much regretting the purchase

#####

please get rid of the forced online bs

its fun when it works but it still shouldnt be forced online

#####

pdth after lobotomy

#####

the first patch for pd3 was supposed to be available on october 5th starbreeze then postponed the patch to midoctober and now they have released a statement saying there is bno etab

the original patch date was already 3 weeks after the dumpster fire of a launch when it should have been earlier i look forward to seeing the devs recover from these issues but so far the game is a massive disappointment

#####

h3i teared up when dallas said iyou see i need my payday3i and then proceeded to payday all over the gold  sharke bank lobby truly a payday game of all timesh3

payday 3 is definitely a diamond in a rough after a decade of payday 2 3 feels incredibly fresh and yet at the same time it feels like its missing something i felt so mixed about it that considered getting a refund for now but ultimately decided not to despite its roughness i still have a lot of fun

h2the goodh2

 bcombat and movementb feel fresh you can ifeeli an impact weapons make movement is great you are no longer sliding along the floor sliding actually has practical use and i never realized how much i needed proper vaulting in a payday game you are no longer humping edges and not being able to hop over this or that object because of misaligned collision

 bstealth improvementsb much less punishing and way more rewarding if you are skilled enough youll be able to beat certain heists even without putting a mask on casing mode is no longer just well casing mode you can do plenty of objectives in it including hacking picking up and searching through key items lockpicking distracting a guard hacking cameras to assist your team carry bags without raising extra suspicions from security even if you are out of pagers you are given another chance in form of search mode in this mode guards derail from their usual patrol routes and will actively look for you all over the place

 crutch perk decks borderline stupid skills incredibly overpowered weapons like akimbo autoshotguns are gone bpayday 3 is as grounded as payday the heistb
if you loved payday 2 for its arcadish nature and are looking for more  payday 3 is not for you you are no longer a onemanarmy if youre looking to succeed on overkill teamplay is required

 bthe soundtrackb is chefs kiss gustavo proves yet again that he is worthy to walk in simons shoes 

 bdifficulty scalingb assaults getting increasingly hard first responders aka blue cops get replaced by swat units later on swat units get replaced by heavy swat units and after that assault becomes endless all units have same health pool across all difficulties which is a great improvement special units had a fair overhaul and gained plenty of new and interesting abilities some of them will catch you off guard 

 bstarting eight maps are greatb all but under the surphaze art gallery that is made with stealth in mind play well in both loud and stealth all eight payday 3s maps have something unique going on about them and all are replayable penthouse heist feels a bit too small in scale but its fine

 bits great to see some interesting familiar faces to returnb shayu from city of gold butcher keegan from texas campaign and also everyonesfavorite  vlad still played by ilia volok i love shade too actress did a great job no doubt i miss locke but i have a feeling that well see him soon enough no way they are killing him off in general it feels like everyone took acting more seriously this time around radio replies no longer feel like they are being read from the paper crew members are actually trying to come up with random nonsense

 thanks to bdedicated serversb nasty desync that is still plaguing payday 2 is no more connection across the board is excellent not even once i came across a network related issue so far i sure hope that i simply wasnt lucky

h2the badh2 consider this one a mixed section

 bpainfull lack of secondary contentb barely any weapons masks gloves and outfits most of the outfits and gloves available are recolors of one another 17 guns total plus two overkill weapons i remember that payday 2 had 9 assault rifles ialonei on launch i dont see a lot of cosmetic items that were leaked during beta in a release build either guess they are already sorted and packaged into pending dlc drops

 bnew leveling systemb definitely raises some eyebrows its a challenge system taken from payday the heist only in that game completing challenges granted you additional experience towards your normal progression but in payday 3 the entire leveling is bound to challenges alone it feels incredibly unrewarding when you barely finished a loud heist on overkill and gained zero progression towards your level

 bsimilar deal is with the weapons and unlockable skillsb all modifications and skill lines are locked behind experience only this time thankfully its tied to usual experience that you get after finishing a heist youll be spending a lot of time unlocking all mods for your favorite weapon skills on the other hand unlock rather quickly

 bnew rushgritedge mechanicb is questionable fullfilling certain conditions and having a specific perk on grants you one of these three temporary buffs a lot of new skills are tied to these and sometimes its quite tricky to proc these conditions rush gives you 10 extra speed grit  10 damage reduction and edge  10 extra damage not stackable

 bdrills are mostly gone butb payday 3 has introduced another obnoxious repetivite objective two in fact  looking around for bloody qr codes and the worst one  standing in wifi circle hotspots to boost the signal and progress the hack qr codes are one time use and some maps have tons of doors locked with these i got tired of this rather quickly

h2the uglyh2

 bno controlb over lobby you play in no kick option at all people can be all kinds of nasty and theres literally nothing you can do about it what were they thinking get a group of friends or pray for people to not be mean just because they can

 bthe uib is ugly im still trying to figure how to paint different weapon parts in different colors menuing is terrible in game you are not able to tell who has what deployable or gadget only in lobby

 bmicrotransactionsb not present in the game yet but thankfully premium currency that is planned was leaked even before release trailer its the usual thing  theyll wait out a review period like activision does and then will shove them in on top of selling dlc packs not a fan but as long as its cosmetic only and not another battlepass  fomo im fine with this

 bbot ai b is terrible they were good in beta but it feels like they were nerfed in release version it was fine when they couldnt face tank two dozers but now they are as fragile as wet toilet paper and on top of that they just love to ignore you on the ground and not revive you

 bno preplanning and confusing asset allocationb some players straight up dont know that these exist and how to actually get these because how much they are hidden of a vendor page some maps have unique assets that you can use but i still have no idea how these things work and how they appear

 this one is imo and very arguable but i strongly dislike bfixed rng seedsb whenever you restart the heist via voting all objectives items and codes remain the same meaning if you learned a code on your run a restart  and you can skip all the objectives you have to do to actually learn the code rng only reset properly on requeuing takes all the fun and surprise element out


and this is what i can recall as of now as you can see payday 3 is a mixed bag it has its fair share of problems right now but it looks like starbreeze are confident in what they are doing they have a plan for it roadmap says that apart from normal dlc content we are going to receive free updates and content as well so ill put my faith in them for this one despite its issues i still ilikei payday 3 a lot i would love to suggest you to try out payday 3 on gamepass before buying a full game

#####

imagine making everything including solo play online no wonder your servers crashed 

#####

to level up you are required to complete specific challenges which usually require you to go out of your way in order to complete them a premade team shouldnt have much problems completing them together but random players will love you if you decide to get your revolverkills while everyone else wants to escape 

customizing your character is a joke as well while it looks like the outfits youre able to choose from are numerous its just five outfits with the others simply being reskins of them

all in all it feels just like a giant cashgrab in comparison to payday 2

#####

with payday2 being my favourite game i was obviously very hyped for this to come out and now that i have played through all the available heists both on stealth and loud i think i have some kind of understanding of what the game has to offer so far

lets get what everyones here for out of the way i really didnt care much about the server issues during the first days ive seen it happening with game after game during the years regardless of how big the company behind was and i dont understand why everyone is surprised of it happening now yes it sucks to have spent money on a product that doesnt work right away but honestly its not that big of a deal having to wait a few days compared to launches like redfall or the gollum game where the game is straightout broken even months after their release this has been nothing but technical issues that have been fixed already

now the game plays wonderfully like its predecessor we have the choice to complete all heists but one either fully stealth loud or a combination of the two

the stealth experience got almost entirely reworked where theres much more emphasis on working your way through the building before masking up with a lot of new things to interact with that open up different routes that make for a more or less safe strategy
we lost the preplanning screen which was rather fun in payday2 even just to draw something silly before the actual heist or on a more serious note planning out where to place different resources or assets depending on what startegy you wanted to go for what we have now is a very basic preplanning which is extremely limited something that was reworked is the detection system which now is a set value regardless of equipment which encourages for more of a hybrid play rather than focussing entirely on either only stealth or only loud allowing players to grab whatever and play stealthy until they eventually get caught

for the loud side of the game the gunplay feel more dynamic but the difficulty spike on higher difficulties is more reminiscent of payday the heist where you gotta avoid the rungun style for a rather more tactical play focussing much more on positioning the game introduces to a third weapon in the form of the overkill gun which rewards the player for a high kill count with a powerful tool to kill even more at the cost of running to a very exposed side of the map
the movement feels much more intense with sliding and vaulting making for great tools in a shoot and retreat way of dealing with waves resources now are a bit weird where before medkits reigned supreme as the most essential equipment to bring now theyre sorta secondary since armor cannot be replenished other than using armor bags which playing without turns into a hopeless battle where any poke from cops turns into a deadly wound that quickly eats your health away

now for the uglies this game is really good but far from perfect

one thing that will make the most annoyed or even furious is the onlineonly policy this wouldnt be an issue if the servers were in optimal state butwe all saw how that turned out so even if i wanted to play solo im at the mercy of the servers
the friendly lobby system we were used to in the previous game turned into a barely noticeable counter for a party where you cant even check on your teams loadout until youve already queued for the heist and at that point you cant change skills nor modify your weapon to adjust to your teams demands
if youre playing with randoms forget about making new friends because once the heist is over the lobby will be disbanded and theres no way to trace back people youve heisted with and the host overall seems to have much less control over the lobby than before
the whole skills and weapon modification menus are now much simpler and as a result rather lacking what made payday2 such an enjoyable game was the freedom everyone had with their loadout where you could turn almost everything into something more or less available for whatever job under some criteria now its much more streamlined with less freedom since theres very little to choose from

overall i am having a blast playing the game but i am definitively looking for improvement hopefully the devs will listen to the objective criticism and give this gem some polishing

bad

#####

second time servers are down and all reviews are mostly negative but still developers dont want to put offline in the game to prevent piracy xd hahahahahha xd meanwhile our lovely pirates have already crack the game and play in their official servers xd

#####

if you love payday 2 you will not like payday 3

#####

this game had great potential wait untill its finished and deep silver gets their shit together for now dont support this game but dont be mean to the devs

#####

this game has these good things over payday 2
new engine is definitely a lot more modern movement is smoother and graphics look a decent bit betterdespite this the game is not optimized well at all so even though i have a beast of a gaming pc it doesnt even get good frames and has huge drops
the new stealth and armor mechanics are kinda cool and encourage a more team oriented playstylei actually dont really like the armor deterioration but i understand why they did it but it kinda feels like a chore sometimes but i can live with it

here is the bad
guns are terribly balanced you can stick a shotgun against a cops head and pull the trigger and he will stagger back and require an additional headshot to kill himmaybe this gets better with perks and attachments but even a base shotgun barrel stuffing a cop should kill them there is no excuse for that
every single heist is single day so even though there is 8 heists its like the equivalent of 4 heists in payday 2
the ui is boring as hell it reminds me of like netflix they lost all the character they had built into payday 2 they even removed crime net and made it so matchmaking is harder in every aspect
you can only play online which is probably contributing to the terrible server stability preventing everyone from playing tons of people just want to play solo and they could easily reduce the burden on the servers
they flipped what the g key does from payday 2 which is an ingrained muscle memory that every payday vet has to throw bags and now it throws grenadesyou can see how that might be an issue when you go to stealth for the first time
experience is now only earned by doing challenges rather than being rewarded for doing heists so you now have to play with guns and perks and do heists in styles you do not enjoy if you want to level past like 40 which honestly is bs nobody wants you telling them how they need to play no this does not promote replayability i played payday 2 a ton and this was never how it was
no safe house which was a huge hit in payday 2 and added some immersion to the whole heisting crew aspect of the game
no preplanning before heists which again added immersion to the game who would just go in without discussing entry points resource drops exit plans etc if they were trying to do a heist in real life nobody
you need to make an account before you can play but creating an account doesnt even work very well the email takes forever to come and will not come at all with certain email services 

honestly do not waste your time money or hope on this game buy a few pizzas or something at least youll get some dopamine i was so freakin excited for the next gen of heisting and this is what we got just so so dissapointed in the incompetence and greed from deepsilver and starbreeze hereyou have failed your community and you deserve to fail as a business if you dont listen to us and fix this game very quickly

#####

preface this game is fun but buntil the servers are fixed do not buy itb this review ignores the fact that the servers are down at the moment

its a decent iteration on the payday 2 formula when you look at the base gameplay and ignore the superflouous stuff people complain about which is like menu ui and xp systems or only 8 heists its a really good core game and those things are quite minor except the heist count which will most likely follow the payday 2 formula of being supplemented by long support of dlc releases

what i would love to see change 
list
offlinep2p modes so i can pause or host games for just me and my friends without using matchmaking
faster weapon leveling
improved vaulting its a real pain quite often
more responsive interactions involving civilians grabbing throwing moving and tying them up doesnt feel great
a more consistent way to generate grit in the skill tree that doesnt involve vaulting or stunning
option to rerandomize gameplay elements on restart but not forced sometimes i like it and sometimes i dont
remove the forced final assault if you go into loud when at the final phase of the mission let me use negotiation
list

what i love right now
list
heists feel fun stealth and loud are usually completely different approaches
combat is very satisfying and feels much better than payday 2
changes to builds mean that nearly any loud build can stealth just as well but stealth leaning builds still exist and are great for group play
negotation phase is a great addition that lets you regroup and recover when moving from stealth to loud
most of the heists loud transitions dont feel contrived like they did in payday 2 more often rewarding you for completing objectives in stealth
i like the customization systems more although there needs to be like 45x the mask patterns in the game i feel like they might have held some of these back to sell dlc or mtx which is unfortunate
list

#####

cant even play because it is online only and the online does not work as a long time payday fan this sucks

#####

there is no mixed type button on steam reviews but if there were id definitely give it a mixed rating this game has its highs and it has its lows its the perfect definition of mid

#####

all im gonna say is it took almost 6 months 5 months and change to get an unready option in lobbies

#####

i wanna start by saying i absolutely love the payday series with 4000 hours in payday 2

payday 3 is a game that took a little time to grow on me  i didnt love it at first but after getting some time in i really started to enjoy the game

the stealth is a total blast  heists can be completed with mask on or mask off with multiple ways to go about successfully finishing said heists  random generation of levels means it has a chance to be different each time you play

loud is pretty fun too  not a ton of weapons to choose from currently but a lot of them are fun to use and heists can be pretty intense on higher difficulties  movement feels good with the addition of vaulting and sliding

the skill system is interesting and similar to payday 2  they are skill lines instead of skill trees  you can build for loud or stealth and dont have to put points in order from beginning to end  the skills revolve around edge rush and grit  these 3 things are buffs to the player activated through the skills  i personally dont love this but it doesnt mean its a bad system

since the soundtrack was amazing for payday 2 i did want to mention i personally dont find the soundtrack to this game nearly as good compared to the previous game  well have to see what comes in the future

map design for the heists are pretty freaking sweet minus road rage  not that its a bad heist but it felt like the weakest out of all of them

customization for weapons and heisters is ok  not a ton of attachments per weapon but they do change the way it performs slightly  there are cosmetics like suits gloves and masks  theyre alright but nothing insane  

theres challenges that are directly tied to leveling up your character  heists career and weapons  youll need to be doing these to earn infamy to keep leveling at a consistent pace  its ok but i preferred the way it was in payday 2  most of these are just completing missions earn infamy and doing certain things with individual weapons

overall i do like this game  maybe not as much as payday 2 currently but that could change in the future  there isnt a ton of content right now but im sure that will change over time with only 8 missions  remember payday 2 didnt have all the heists that it has now at launch  pretty sure it didnt even have the fugitive skill tree in the beginning  the biggest problem is the online only like everyone is saying with no offline mode  as of writing this ive spent nearly half my time in the game trying to load into a heist  the servers arent working very good whatsoever  

the release of this was extremely rocky  negative reviews pouring in because people quite literally cant play the game they paid money for  i completely share the frustration a lot of others are having with the match making and nebula errors  i believe this will all be ironed out eventually but dont know when  as of writing this i cant even load into the game because of the nebula error

i do recommend the game but definitely would wait until starbreeze figures their server issues out

#####

the only heist was your wallet

#####

after almost 100 hours heres an update for my review its still negative no offline play no lobby browser no pregame planning no ability to kick players no voip in 2023 and probably wont be in 2024 theres only 2 or 3 sidearms worth using only 3 primaries worth using no variety of builds like in pd2 dont spend your money on payday 3 go get 2 or even payday the heist the 24 hour peak of pd2 is 45765 while pd3 is at 5177 and itll undoubtedly go back down to 1000 or less in acouple of days 

one of the bigger points for me is not having something like crimenet or a server browser to find games you search for a specific heist and a difficulty on that heist then hope 3 other people are looking for that same heist and with the game settling around 1000 people at peak times i doubt out of 10 heists and 4 difficulties that youll be able to get a full match so youll be playing with maybe one other dude and bots that were programmed by the new guy

i dont know whos making the decisions overkillstarbreeze or deep silver but they should be fired and replaced with someone who understands the player base and what the game needs 


old review no offline mode and the servers just got stolen ill change my review to positive once an offline mode comes around so when the servers get shut off in 10 years ill still be able to play it

#####

game good servers bad

sadge that people forget how barebones pdth and pd2 were on their launches

#####

h3where to beginh3

i normally only review games when i have great things to say however since ive got some spare time here we go

to me payday 2 was a stealth game not guns blazing although on the odd occasion it was nice to do once a month or so and there was some great stealth mission within payday 2 ecm rushing achievement hunting etc etc if you want a game where you run around shooting loads of people in the face there is better games out there

h3on to payday 3 the goodh3
olist
 graphics got a buff
 getting caught in stealth in a private area you get escorted off the premises and you continue stealth
 decent looking skill tree to make builds with
 lock picking is no longer a massive chore
 mini cameras and motion sensors are a great touch
 shooting taser batteries or grenade belts is great
 calling in an overkill weapon is sometimes fun
olist
h3on to payday 3 the badh3
olist
 the game is online only meaning you have to queue to play solo wtf
 there are only 8 missions meaning you have completed the campaign in about 1h 30mins wtf
 its pointless to stealth any missions because you dont get any ranking xp for it wtf
 the only way to gain xp is from doing mini challenges such as shoot 100 people throw 50 grenades yeah cause thats what you want to do in stealth wtf
 you can only take ammo med kit body armour sentry guns into a stealth run wtf
 you gain the same amount of cash from doing a run on normal or overkill mode wtf
 there are nearly 100 skills to choose from and only 10 of these are for stealthwtf 
 they made stealth way too difficult only 2 pagers one of these is on the camera man meaning only 1 other guard allowed no room for rng and if you kill the roaming guard your fed wtf
 levelling weapons which what the game wants you to do seems pointless the attachments all do next to nothing wtf
 the great thing was you could lure the camera guard out and he wouldnt go back to the cameras allowing you the extra pager else where apparently now they have fixed the issue making it worse wtf
 masks customisation is boring pointless and a waste of time
 outfits are boring pointless and a waste of time
 weapon customisation is boring pointless and a waste of time
 there are only about 20 achievements in the game i mean wtf i thought this was a payday game where you have to do a heist 50 times with a certain mask on
 currently you cant even play the game because online match making only is fed wtf wtf wtf wtf
 its almost like they remove a bunch of features purposely to then bring out as dlc to make the extra  yeah were not stupid of course they did that wtf
 once the heist is over you all get kicked out in separate directions meaning you actually cant find the people you just played with in payday 2 if everyone knew what they were doing you all stuck around together for a few hours then added each other on the friends list to play again with
olist

#####

a rough launch and the ui needs improving but the underlying game is a lot of fun

#####

to all the people that are not recommending payday 3 give the devs a chance they seriously underestimated how many people are going to play the game they are pulling all nighters just to get this stuff working and theyre getting hated for it dont do that

#####

for some reason they decided to use always online matchmaking players cannot create lobbies and must use matchmaking even for solo play of course this genius move led to the game literally being unplayable
to quote almir  responding to a question in a livestream what will happen if the servers go down they wont go down

whoever is making the networking changes at starbreeze for this and pd2s last update needs to be fired

#####

matchmaking simulator

#####

may be edited if these changes come soon

online only caused game to be unplayable at launch
online only forces solo players like me to matchmake for empty servers taking up even more space away from people who actually play randoms or with friends
performance issues
typical and bad modern boxy ui think of it like modern garbage ii ui and ux
no crimenet
no safehouse
lack of quality of life features which i am going to list

  stat bars instead of stat numbers
  no marking lobbies as loudstealthany
  no tracking challenges
  said challenges are not categorized into sections making the challenges tab cluttered and also messy 
 with no real category filter challenges are also not organized by order ie car4 challenges before 
 castigo challenges or challenge type before another challenge type
  you cant unready

clear balance issues such as standard lining armor lightest armor being completely redundant to heavy ballistic lining heaviest armor due to x4 less armor with negligible speed difference the sa a144 whatever its called i dont remember and the scar can also one shot headshot many enemies this can be improved even further with skills but of course the balance issue is that full auto rifles like the car4 or the northwest something cannot one shot headshot shotguns have that capability too albeit they reload too slow and also shoot too slow the mosconi is also a double barrel so much smaller mag capacity as well

skill lines require unlocking the higher tier skills not to mention some of these skills are garbage too i wouldve been fine if it was just research the main skill and then it unlocks all of whats in that skill line but those executive bastards need that player retention to go up or they bail on starbreeze

the medic skill line is useless and so are medic bags this game leans more into armor than your health dallas is now suffering from chronic depression because of this

thats all for now

live service is horrible and the developers are already making roadmaps on future dlcs  open and closed beta was to create hype and not actually fix or prepare for launch  payday 3 was built upon a foundation of greed and just another money maker to create multiple dlcs ensuring that no dlc unlockers would happen by sacrificing offline play or local play  maybe the true clowns and heisters were the developers robbing us for our money

#####

edit the october 5th patch is still mia

a prime example of online only games being a bad idea servers dont work and theres no back up plan so its unplayable the few times i got to play were good but its been a total of maybe 5 or 6 games

#####

i wanted to enjoy this i really did i played the closed beta and it worked the open beta to test servers did not work i could not get into the same lobby as my party nor could we find matches i had some doubt but did not refund at that time the ui and many other aspects of the game left much to be desired hell the menus look like a mobile game and in many ways is a massive step back from payday 2 if the servers are down you cannot play you need to queue in order to play solo you cannot play solo offline what is the point in paying 40 for a game i cant access huge disappointment from starbreeze hope this game works in the future but i cannot recommend it in its current state

#####

lets be real yall the heist was making people wait 2 hours on matchmaking so that they cant get a refund

#####

add sex

#####

how do you make payday 2 so good and then fuck it up with payday 3

if there is one thing you take away from this review is  never preorder games  no matter what

#####

had they just taken payday 2 upgraded the graphics and engine revamped the trees add a couple new mechanics this game would have been a blast

#####

between the launch issues always online bs and forgetting lessons learned in payday 2 like giving stats as numbers instead of the stupid bars dont buy this game i hope starbreeze fixes their problems but until then give this one a pass

#####

after supporting this title with many purchases for friends and all lame dlc they put out to help create the next game  i am convinced that the only positive takeaway for buying this  is that now i dont have to learn what its like to invest in some crappy shtc0in the hard way and end up losing my house instead of just 40 more dollars

this was like it was never tested by anyone who plays the game

game companies should be run and staffed by real avid gamers  people who love what they are making and not just what they are doing for a paycheck

7000 hours in pd2 thats just my online play time  up until the day they added epic service and made all lobbies trash or never showing up in crimenet

update to review

i have since learned that they are no longer removing bad reviews from refunders  so now i guess its only immediately after launch week  what a coincidence that they were removing them during launch  but now the policy is different

btw the game still sucks

february 2024 update

i heard the game was under 250 players online this week

#####

cant even play
theres like 2 servers tops hahaha

#####

as a payday 2 veteran and a week of playing the game this game has great potential but needs loads of polishing to be perfect


h2positivesh2
list
   combat feels great great difficulty balance new skills are fun to play around with and weapons feel and play well

   stealth is fun with new gimmicks to play around with which makes playing in stealth viable even if you plan on going loud either way

   the first 8 heist are very replayable as all except for one heist can be done in stealth and has just enough randomization in them to keep things interesting each run

   character and weapon customization is fantastic you can level up your weapons for new weapon mods and with your player level youll unlock new paints paint patterns mask suits and gloves

   visuals are great already even before the jump to ue5

   soundtracks a banger

   mentioned it earlier but the new skill system is super fun you are able to make skills synergize with each other to make some funky builds
list


h2negativesh2
list
   ualways onlineu even when going for solo runs or playing with friends you have to matchmake which we already have problems with

   ui looks slick but functionally is very rough no chatting on a partypreplanning screen your party screen is veery hidden gun store page has both primary and secondary weapons mixed together etc

   new challengebased xp system works on paper but comes out as annoying most of the time it is not very satisfying to finish out a heist to get absolutely no xp in the end

   combat is very well balanced as i said earlier but personal nitpick would be that it is a bit lame how meta armor is right now you are just shooting yourself on your foot if you dont bring in armor have the highest level armor on and get armor skills in your build if you go loud on very hard  overkill

   the fact the heist rng is locked on load meaning no matter how many times you restart the level stays the same is both a blessing and a curse on a good side of things it can save some time if you failed the heist but on the other side if you got really bad luck on a heist too bad bucko
list


the review may change in the future considering that the game is still on its first days of being out but besides the rough launch this game is excellent not perfect but if we let that seed grow it is gonna be fantastic

heres hoping that the ue5 transition goes smoothly and hopefully the game has a bright future

#####

bought this game as the gold edition  after a 6 year spell of no preordering ty agents of mayhem for being dogshit i decided this would be the one to change it given how much i fell in love with payday the heist and payday 2

the game itself is excellent the gunplay is rewarding the movement is slick and the previous engine issues have been completely done away with stealth is now actually a challenge and loud requires careful movements and good aim  a rewarding experience for someone who plays way too many fps games like myself
the storyline has gone back to a more gritty and serious tone which is a welcome shift  the end of payday 2 without any spoilers got wild but also pretty serious and its nice to see them follow on with that and make the story easily digestible with between heist cutscenes and to have a legible narrative the entire way through you know what youre doing and why youre doing it and even the lowest difficulty at normal provides a challenge thats fair but also enough to give you a real sense of accomplishment for beating it overkill is an absolute death run beating heists on that difficulty is enough to make you audibly shout in excitement upon managing to complete them

and now for the bad this game is unfairly review bombed quite frankly its getting a lot of flak and a lot of it is deserved  but not to the extent that it portrays the game as some slop thrown out by ea the always online is whats causing all the issues after community feedback about denuvo which starbreeze finally managed to get removed for the record  this was deep silvers decision to add it into the game denuvo is one of their standard revenue protection measures regardless of what it does to performance on systems after community feedback always online doesnt work its caused the servers to completely overload and its done away with the ability to play solo in offline theres no pause function and the ui is horribly minimal compared to the crimenet system we had in payday 2 those are the only issues with this game skills are a little unintuitive but its quite fun to play around with once you understand the system

so with those above flaws mentioned why am i still recommending this game
because its starbreezeoverkill

in the last 10 years of payday 2s reign as their prominent ip theres been a lot of incredible dlc releases and some really outstanding changes to the game the format and a wonderful level of support for the modding community and just allowing the game to remain as replayable as possible theres also been a lot of issues  like the loot box scandal like the promised drop in support to launch overkills the walking dead among other things after these two instances in particular it became clear these developers and their corresponding community outreach teams genuinely care about these games and their fanbases respectively they took responsibility and turned it around completely and thats why i recommend this game

out of the box it is a fantastic game and i think having some faith in that same team is worthwhile deep silver forced denuvo upon them and this nonsense with always online is probably related to their revenue protection in some way the ui and quick match system is flawed but i truly believe if they have given us what weve asked for in the past it cant hurt to have some trust in them and to push for the changes that weve asked for  like a return to p2p lobbies and an ability to pause and play offline

starbreezeoverkill the mistakes are made  we just want to see them put right regardless of whether it was a bad idea or more deep silver nonsense

#####

u237 payday 2 was better than this

#####

really enjoyed this beta cant wait for the full release

#####

i have to admit in its current payday 3 feels like b it is still in beta b
i was planning to delete payday 2 to have space for the payday 3 but i have to say payday 3 wasnt what i was expecting i even completed most of the achievements in payday 2 before payday 3 released but here it is another disappointment
let me tell you about its current state it is not pretty

h1 u b pros b u h1

h3 b the stealth and loud b h3
 the game feels amazing the combat weapons new enemy ai movement all of it 
 stealth has improved quite a lot instead of just avoiding guards now you build your own way of stealing needing to check civilians as well as guards is a good challenge 
 guards act more realistic so you dont reset in every mistake strike no more owl head guards strike 
 lock picking finally doesnt have to be staredown with the door handle 
 since concealment is not a problem you can prepare a hybrid build with or without your friends to be ready for loud
 it feels more alive with all the civilians and workers around maps
 police negotiation and swat attacking in groups such a nice touch

h3 b weapons b h3
 weapon level system is a good change it induce players to try new weapons
 customizing weapons being able to paint each part of weapon was a huge thing for me
 special enemies makes me jumpy again strike that sounds dirtier than i thought strike
 being able to buy full customized weapons with cstacks rework continental coins is a nice touch

b story b
 the story is there yeah it is the new contract explanations and ingame cut scenes between heists tell all you need to know

h1 u b cons b u h1

oh boy it is a diamond not even a rough one if i have to say it still needs to be dug out of a mine

h3  why they had to go with the serverbased lobbies h3

 not even able to play it without connection is the biggest mistake they could have done you have to search find and not lag in a server even in single player 
 payday 2 lived to this day because the community was there supporting the game the mods custom maps and content but payday 3 feels like a generic you have to go with whatever our marketing team decides type of game feels out of touch
b and i am scared that payday 3 will chose the company shareholders are hungry lets do impractical choices to earn money path b

h3  game feels more like a beta than a full released game h3

 the menu buttons invite prompts switching between menu too fast causing glitches invites not working etc the menu feels more like controller friendly rather than keyboardmouse
changing from heist to heist you can see it says overkill on the difficulty but when you try to start the heist it starts on normal difficulty because menu still shows you your previous chosen heists difficulty
 payday 3 has rewards for payday 2 achievements infamous rewards and one of the rewards is og american dream mask they made a whole page for this in the paydaythegame site but ingame when you receive the mask the icon it was supposed to be added by the developers right b they didnt add it there is no icon for the mask in the inventory there is just a place holder white box with white mask in middle which is not even fitting the inventory box b
 in the rock the cradle heist which i restarted multiple times to confirm there is a bug where you need to get certain item to enter a certain area but when you need to exchange item with its upgraded version b the game doesnt add the item to your inventory b so you have to choose route 2 to go for stealth at least they decided to do multiple routes in stealth 
 randomize is not a thing unless you join a new lobby
h3  skills and leveling h3

 skills feel overpowered and weak at the same time stealth skills can be abused easily you can even do heists without putting on masks but at the same time some of them makes you think why do they exist unlike payday 2 which had some broken builds that failed to save you in hardest difficulty dsod skill trees in the payday 3 feels out of balance

 the leveling is another matter to be honest i can understand skills to a certain point but for leveling i wonder what caused them decide to do it like as it is you have to level by completing challenges yes you read that right you cant earn exp from heist you have to complete heists in different difficulties playing overkill gives all other difficulty challenges based on stealth or loud killing enemies doing certain tasks etc you cant unlock weapons or gadgets unless you complete those challenges for me until level 20 it was easy to level up it is enough for core gameplay but still if you want to go loud overkill it is still not enough after that i was out of heists and difficulty tasks in stealth and they become more demanding nearly forcing me to go loud kill bulldozers snipers etc and it became a grinding game not a fun one

overall i think payday 3 has a huge potential the gameplay is fun new mechanics are fun map designs story graphics are good but game itself feels b rushed b i still believe they can correct what they had done wrong and we still have a long time to see updates to expand mostly fix i hope in payday 3 universe so i will wait patiently until next major update and see whether i will support or fly the helmets of starbreeze team

#####

i lagged out of a single player session due to the forced online thanks

edit i still love the game but it needs some work will recommend because it is fun

#####

i dont know if the game is good because i cant play it 

#####

potato server

#####

lets start with the biggest questions first
as of right now

is the game functional
yes its been on a very slow but fairly upward trend in terms of functionality the servers work and the bugs have been and continued to be ironed out as things move along

is the game worth the price
for base game yeah the price tag is pretty good and the 2 free heists so far sweeten the deal even more but the most recent single heist dlc is vastly overpriced and i wouldnt recommend getting it unless youve already got the season pass or its on sale
the season pass currently is only available for holders of the gold or silver edition and theyve not made good on their promise to allow players to purchase it postlaunch so im gonna give even further warning to either only buy base game for now or just wait for a sale
sale preferably

is the game fun
absolutely they have done a good job mechanically with the gunplay cooperation the stealth overhaul quite a lot under the hood honestly allinall id say its a good objective based horde shooter where it stands

how about the xp system
its still not that great theyve improved it a bit but its still far from satisfying to level up the guns and yourself it all becomes a mind numbing grind if youre aiming for some very specific level locked somethingorother

is the customization any good
the fact that some masks cant be customized at all is a huge bummer but ultimately not the biggest deal in the world at least to me personally the gun customization is different to payday 2s but also has its own bit of flair to it with weapon charms and stickers to go with the customizable paint jobs and those that fancied the tailor packs of payday 2 will like the return of clothing and glove choices as well although costing cstacks which brings me to

cstacks whats the deal with those
payday 2 had a problem with money it was too easy to have more than youll ever need so in come cstacks theyre a different form of currency thatre bought with your earned money and used to buy higher tier things cosmetics paints stickers gloves clothes masks weapon presets and for some reason specific weapon parts which do offer weapon stat changes

well what about the music no more simon right
yes simon is gone but gustavo has been doing a pretty solid job of picking up where simon has left off he had some experience doing the last several payday 2 tracks and has managed to create some pretty good stuff in what weve seen so far in payday 3

alright alright so then would you say the game is at least worth getting
if you have friends playing it 100 yes
its probably some of the most fun ive had recently coopping with friends
if youre looking for a solo purchase id say wait while you can play it solo id say the fun is far better with friends currently

#####

always online
has bad servers

is there anything else to say

#####

a spit to the face is what this game is

plethora of bugs and missing basic quality of life features that payday 2 had despite having a bunch of beta tests and beta testers not to mention 10 year long data from the previous title
trash servers there is no excuse like we couldnt foresee the influx of players for the simple reason that they have all the data about how many players bought the game which moves to the next point
online only this is not the same as requiring an internet connection to play because in that case it wouldve been not so bad you are entirely dependant on the status of their servers in a game the prequel of has been singleplayer and p2p that worked wonders for 10 years this is not an mmo you have to go into a matchmaking queue to start a singleplayer session if their servers experience an outage or crash your game will be affected you can lag in your own singleplayer session you can disconnect due to their servers error in a singleplayer session

this is not a singleplayer game

this is not a sequel to payday 2

this is not payday 3

#####

update 1042023  server issues aside the game is just trash it feels pointless and it goes too far away from what payday was on top of a plethora of terrible and lazy design choices

this game will be ported to mobile within the next year as was surely the plan all along 

do not waste your money on it not even if its 5e on sale

____________________________________________________________________

cant preload the game if you paid full price on steam instead of xbox

finally start the game you bought

be forced to go to nebula for a 3rd party account 

nebula cant handle the traffic because starbreeze are all pure professionals 

account creation loads forever until it expires

1010 its funny they call us heisters

#####

matchmaking error this review could not be loaded

#####

despite preordering cyberpunk 2077 and experiencing its launch i clearly didnt learn my lesson cause i preordered the gold edition for payday 3

donacdum like me and preorder games

#####

cant play day 3

#####

game looks nice but online only litteraly makes it unplayable

#####

play pd2 instead

#####

h1 foundationally flawed h1

iinstead of breaking down each gameplay component payday 3 is instead foundationally broken its progression systems actively incentivize you to play the game less or play in specific ways that actively hurt tactical choices the only way to level up is through completing challenges you can finish a heist and receive zero exp just because you didnt use a new gun or complete a specific action this is compounded with a lengthy grind for each gun luckily not involving challenges and also perk exp acting similarly the issue with this is that it means your team is not rewarded for doing the heist correctly only gaining money for your loot

this essentially means that there is no incentive to play the game bare the gameplay which is the vain of payday the heist not payday 2 is incredibly hard with a car4 no attachments on normal difficulty it takes three headshots to kill a normal cop this kind of bullet sponge and difficulty means that you are incentivized to progress to make it easier but due to the way you have to progress means that you have to actively hurt your team this culminates in making the game unplayable even while removing all the other flawed elements

as someone who has play payday the heist the payday 2 beta and payday 2 for years i do not understand how this dev team especially almir of all people who has worked on the games since the original could make such confusing and weird decisions for the game that is supposed to save your company from bankruptcy

#####

cloaker sound is the best

#####

this game had so much potential just to be ruined by poor leadership decisions credit to the developers for iterating on the gameplay side shame on the leadership for making this game online only

#####

always online ruins the game especially when you cant even manage to keep up the servers and decide to disconnect us 40 minutes into a solo heist

gaining xp through challenges instead of through completing heists is basically a collar and a leash guiding us through what the devs want rather than what we think is fun

the new skill tree feel like a huge downgrade from what payday 2 had to offer with less overall skills the horrible ui and the fact that only the first skill in a tree is able to be aced

#####

no

#####

worse than no mans skys launch at least that was somewhat playable fell asleep during a matchmaking cue and racked up a solid 9 hours of matchmaking playtime and now i cant refund 


#####

game had a rough start because of server problems and online only but theyre doing a solid job on keep us updated on all the the improvements theyre going to add soon daily update videos with questions and answers the game itself is really nice and im having a lot of fun

there are already 2 sources about an offline mode being added which is the major problem

#####

alright im not going to sit here and say this game is flawless by any means the game had a godawful launch servers were complete ass for the first few weeks i also absolutely despise the always online requirement that is my biggest gripe with the game at this point another issue is with the stupid stand in a circle and wait objectives 

however even with all of its flaws i still love the gameplay loop especially the new stealth allowing you to almost complete a job without having your mask on the game also maintains a relatively stable framerate and is very playable for instance i mostly play on the steam deck and the game always runs at a playable framerate the maps are designed well in my opinion and the music is absolutely fire 

to sum things up this game had a really shitty launch but 5 months later the game is actually really fun im probably going to get a mob of people who heavily disagree but this is my opinion after a little over 100 of gameplay and reaching level 85

#####

killing civilians no longer costs you money unless you complete the job



#####

been trying for hours to log into the game nebula data error cannot log in cannot play thanks for nothing

#####

at its core this is an incredibly solid game its totally worth its asking price even at release

the mostly negative reputation is because the game doesnt have a whole lot of content and because its lacking certain improvements from postlaunch pd2 people are rightly disappointed but this sentiment has devolved into a circlejerk so many of the negative reviews are just memes and oneliners

i remember how well the developers carried pd2 after release and im optimistic that theyll do the same for pd3


improvements from pd2

 the gameplay is super refined its much less janky and featurebloated than the last installment ive wasted countless hours in pd2 due to absurd glitches such as the van not showing up or ai getting stuck and i havent had those kinds of issues with this game

 the game is always online but ive had a very stable bugfree experience playing the game once you do the firsttime nebula setup it never comes back to haunt you even between devices i sometimes play the game with very high ping but i was pleasantly surprised with how stable it was

 the level design and game flow is unmatched the guardscamerascrowds have a procedurallygenerated predictable rhythm and higher difficulties offer justenough entropy to keep things interesting from beginning to end the jewelry store night club branch bank and the big bank and the best levels at release the art gallery is phenomenal each exhibit is a super compelling unique puzzle unfortunately i dont play it because the wifi signal puzzle is especially tedious on this map

 there are lots of new clever mechanics unmasked exploration and zonespecific security tiers encourage each team members to take on a special responsibility during the heist and it gives the game so much more nuance


solo play

 if you want to play solo you can still complete most heists however you want and have a good time doing it if you are using the correct items and skills and youve done a goodenough job of assessing a heists randomlygenerated layout you have a fair shot of completing it on overkill difficulty without any additional help there are only one or two levels which cannot reasonably be stealthed on overkill such as the penthouse

 the ai companions are quite good and theyll actually drop healthammo when necessary their pathfinding and game sense is also much better than pd2 and they actually stand a chance on higher difficulties

 the lead guard mechanic is a great addition but there are certain cases where he will arbitrarily enter a certain area and you will assuredly fail i actually quite like their unpredictable exploration but i think it should be relegated to certain predictable intervals where i know i might need to clear out of a particular room guard duty shouldnt be a team members sole responsibility


areas to improve

 this game simply needs more content more levels and more items the existing heists are super fun and replayable but now that im midlevel things are starting to feel a little bit stale moreover there are only a handful of masks and mask patterns for no good reason as it is you simply cant make a uniquelooking mask even though theyve added a cool new painting mechanic as a start they should copy over the mask pattern greyscales from pd2 to pd3 i work in aaa and ive spent a lot of time porting over similar textures because even if its old its better than nothing

 please scrap the wifi signal puzzle in its entirety its far too unpredictable it kills your team momentumgame flow and it needs to go for context it requires you to sit in a random spot for like 10 seconds 8 times in a row it takes an ungodly amount of time on higher difficulties because youre waiting for the guards to rotate running over and standing in the circle for 3 seconds and then hiding again rinse and repeat its incredibly tedious in comparison the phone hack puzzle is much better which requires you to lurk behind a particular character for x amount of time before doing so you need to assess what their likely route is going to be and perform some preliminary steps such as hacking any observing cameras tying up any intruding civilians and so on it feels like a heist in and of itself

 all of the cool paintjobs are gatekept to absurdly high levels i should be able to skip these requirements somehow even if i have to convert all of my dollars into cstacks as it is casual players cant make a coollooking weapon or mask

 the ui is incredibly broken i should not need to reopen the customization screens to update the item preview or click back and forth between menus to repopulate the submenus ive also had instances where i finish customizing my characterweapon and nothing has changed ingame or my customizations get reset this is probably the only unacceptable bug that ive encountered iirc i had to fully restart the game to resolve it

 armor penetration is the most important damage stat in the game but for some reason it isnt shown in the item menu this is incredibly confusing and it makes certain weapons appear to be far better than they really are and vice versa as it is the only good source for weapon stats is the datamined spreadsheet on reddit

 the sniper rifle should be able to penetrate shields the pump action shotgun needs a significant buff handguns shouldnt have an aim speed penalty when using iron sights and the car15 needs a spread reduction

#####

i feel like i should atleast get some xp from completing a mission not that it would force me to challenges do 15 times no rest for the wicked for 140 xp and you cannot host your own game gold edition seems like a scam now allways online is another bad thing the servers are not stable and even if i play solo i might have lags as im not the host so implement hosting and remove always online and fix so we can get xp for completing missions not doing only challenges then the reviews will change from bad to good
edit the pre order bonus items is now a dlc too great

#####

when the true heist all along was the game launch kek

while the gameplay of payday 3 is welcoming and fresh from payday 2 there is too many lacking features and content that can make me recommend it to others if youre fine with that and having to go through servers matchmaking every time you want to play including playing solo or wait invite only as its called then go for it its quite a nice experience if you can look away from the flaws

with that said i seriously hope the devs can turn this one around soon enough the game has a good load of potential and genuinely as i said feels fresh oh and please change the ui thank you

for those currently heisting i feel you heist well until we get our updates

#####

 always online constant server problem no offline mode as many has mentioned already
 too few weapons to choose from
 need a lobby browser the matchmaking is subpar at best
 random players could join my inviteonly game
 you cant unready in game lobby to edit stuff why
 you can only level up by doing challenges
 melee are nonexistent

i cant recommend this game at this state feels like a payday the heist 15 rather than payday3 will probably revisit this after a month or so

#####

she pay on my day till i 3

#####

cant even load into private games with friends due to servers pretty pathetic

#####

ifollowing ten long years of continued and briefly interrupted support some controversial decisions and a lot of helmets flying back in payday 2 payday 3 has some insanely big shoes to fill in order to live up to the legacy left by its predecessor but was it all worth the wait is the gang truly back do note that this review mostly comes from my playtime during the early access period for silver and gold preorders additionally this review does describe some gameplay mechanics that some players might prefer figuring out themselvesi

h2prosh2
 eight heists at release and they all feel pretty unique with multiple routes based on your chosen playstyle starbreeze stated that they aimed for quality over quantity and so far they have delivered for context payday the heist had six heists at release which although they were also all very unique from one another usually only offered one set route to complete them with some very minor variations while payday 2 launched with twelve heists a few of which were simply slight variations of one another

 the general gunplay which was already very much praised in payday 2 feels even better than before along with the new movement options the game offers weapons finally have different reload stages that you can resume from if an action interrupts your reloading weapon mods are permanently unlocked by playing with a particular weapon instead of randomly being obtained through rng throwing grenades feels much smoother than in payday 2 that being said i really want to know who at starbreeze decided to default the grenade button to g

 in terms of enemies payday 3 is still at its core a horde shooter however cops are a lot less mindless than they were in previous entries if a shield is present they will be accompanied by swat units using them as support if you have hostages they will swap to less lethal approaches in an attempt to rob you of those resources cloakers are once again terrifying and have quite a few ways to ambush heisters theres a couple new additions like the grenadier and in terms of normal enemies a sabotage squad will regularly be deployed with their main focus being on interrupting objectives

 stealth has been heavily revamped casing mode now allows a lot more freedom in terms of gameplay and some heists can be completed without any heister ever masking up each heist now has public private and secure areas allowing you varying degrees of freedom in terms of getting caught sneaking around while unmasked with guards escorting you out of private areas if you are found trespassing within a certain limit after which they will simply attempt to cuff you however being cuffed while unmasked doesnt always mean the end of your stealth run as guards will enter search phase patrolling the area more aggressively in search of your teammates on top of that skills and equipment have been reworked so that if you do go loud you can still continue and complete the heist without fear of being gunned down

 difficulty feels closer to payday the heist which in my opinion is a pretty good thing as payday 2 usually only had two extremes based on difficulty and build you were either an unstoppable killing machine or you were swiftly sent to the shadow realm payday 3 will attempt quite a few things to overwhelm your team even on the lower difficulties and each heist will have variations in spawns and obstacles as you increase the difficulty

 there is a lot more focus on the story than in previous games like how payday 2 did things towards the end of its own storyline each heist has purpose instead of simply robbing some place because someone asked you to do it for money the game also provides some fairly simple cutscenes in between each heist some of them managing to make the characters feel more human instead of looking like mindless killing machines that speak a couple of words every now and then with the occasional over the top live action scenes that payday 2 did

 gustavo coutinho remains as the main composer in payday 3 following simon viklunds departure from overkill and while the general direction and feel for the music seems to have changed since payday 2 at least for these few release heists the soundtrack is still pretty good

 crossplay along with the switch to unreal engine allowing starbreeze to ensure that the console versions receive proper support as the game gets updated unlike a certain other game running on a certain outdated racing game engine

h2consh2
 lets get the obvious one out of the way first online only in the hours following the full release the matchmaking servers inevitably went down from the sudden influx of players having bought the standard edition along with the game being available on xbox game pass that is nothing new when it comes to online game releases but the problem comes from the fact that payday 3 can very much be played singleplayer until the servers either crash or go down for maintenance this should not be an online only game and i sincerely hope that starbreeze can come up with a way to allow offline play in the future

 along with the above the matchmaking features are so far severely lacking there is no crimenet allowing you to have a view of which heists are being played on which difficulty you must pick the precise heist and difficulty you want to play and hope that other people are also looking for that specific combination there is no loud or stealth filter and if you end up with a group that wants to commit to a stealth run and restart as soon as they go loud while you just want to keep going guns blazing thats just tough luck for you or them if you refuse to leave or vote to restart you also can only chat with teammates during the heist itself once the heist ends the chat disappears and there is no option to group up

 while this is most likely a release thing customization feels lacking in the games current state masks only have a handful of pattern choices that you unlock as you level up and making a mask quickly feels limited

 team ai is a massive downgrade from how it was in the current state of vanilla payday 2 if they get caught in the open for too long with a sniper targeting them or if they run into a dozer they will inevitably go down they also firmly refuse to revive each other for some reason

 starbreeze plans on adding microtransactions for cosmetics while this in itself shouldnt matter all that much considering that this will be optional it does feel like theyre shoving one too many live service practices into one package when you consider the fact that the game is also online only comes with a season pass and will still have the same dlc model as payday 2

h1conclusionh1
is payday 3 a worthy sequel to the heisting game that everyone knows and loves at the moment that is difficult to say but there is no denying that the base is there and it is genuinely fun payday 2 was the same way back when it released in 2013 it was nothing too groundbreaking but it had potential and it eventually grew into what is today seen as one of the best coop games of all time starbreeze have also proven in the past that they are capable of listening to community feedback as long as they can do so without going against the wishes of their publisher or unless they buy the rights to their game off of them again

whatever you do just dont bring back h3h3

edit 930 removed the con about challenges seemingly being locked on restart that is apparently a bug

#####

hyped up this game to my gf based on payday 2 and how great it was and how 3 has amazing potential to be incredible she bought us both some steam on her own to gift me the game because i was so hype and she really wanted to hop into her first payday experience together with me now we are here with our money refunded and shes lost all interest at the moment bain would be disappointed we are disappointed

cant play have no friends make the game offline dumb online only bullshit

#####

plenty of titles to spend at least 40 on and actually be able to play

#####

back to pd 2

#####

i simply have to rewrite this review the release was catastrophic bare bone game felt like alpha version and what changed in these 4 months nothing okay they released one dlc which they dared to ask incredible price for and two heists but thats it the absolutely main features were still missing and now after two months of waiting for at least some bigger update what did we receive glorified hotfix

ive never wanted any game studio to fail but with starbreeze i really want it they spit on all fans the only thing that could make it at least a little bit better would be to return money to all players who want it there is no point in expecting some big changes because it has been months already since release and we are still waiting for the most basic features

go to hell starbreeze sell your studio to someone who cares about fans because you dont

#####

 gameplay is nice but it feels empty compared to payday 2
online play is kinda ass  
if they fix the server issues and add more maps  options for skills and guns then its a 1110

#####

robbing banks is really fun and playing payday is a great way to unwind afterwards

#####

payday its my birthday  ive been such a good boy this year  cant connect with my friends they had a surprise party ready for me on the heist no rest for the wicked hard but i cant connect 

#####

your servers fucking suck the decicion to go to a matchmake system based on separate servers instead of peer peer or dedicated was not the best idea

#####

the real heist was pricing this at 40

#####

always online
cant even get to the main menu without getting connection errors
voting for restart disconnects from server
optimization is trash tier
soundtrack is a downgrade to what pd2 had
user interface is disgusting to look at
user experience is also horrible navigating menus is terrible
graphically the models are higher quality than pd2
lighting is significantly worse
connection issues lots of connection issues
cant play solo without matchmaking first and actively connected to their own service online

#####

disclaimer written 1 day after launch  may delete once the state of the game changes
i have the biggest sympathy for the devs but 2 days in a row and the game still doesnt work managed to do a total of 4 heists in the few hours while the servers werent down but other than that theres still some issues

while i havent had any real time in payday 2 from the surface it seems pd3 has less content and less build depth possibilities theres no real way to tell for sure right now since nobody can get matches in to get all the skills equipment gun attachments etc but even the lack of the concealment mechanic from my perspective makes it seem like the way to play at all times is to just attempt stealth until it goes south and then go loud rather than it being a real choice in how you prep for heists my friend who has had a lot more time in 2 than me has told me pd2 launched with a lot more guns than 3 as well so theres less options when it comes to player expression in combat out the gate i dont know if it was there on launch for pd2 but even just the option to be the most obviously armoured you can be at the cost of low movement speed and being extremely suspicious to guards isnt in 3 and i have no idea why theyd leave that out when youre facing the bulldozer cops that are as armoured as i wish i could be

from what ive seen of reviewers videos there are more interesting objectives that force players to get out of safe spots and not turtle up like you could in pd2 and the environments of the later stage heists are extremely well done but i cant tell you for sure because the game doesnt work and im starting to wonder whether itll work in time to salvage its reputation to get friends to try it whilst its still on gamepass

also while i wouldnt expect or ask the bots that fill your squad when not playing with all players to just do the heist for you having them be fing useless during stealth and you cant tell them to interact with anything at any point is beyond frustrating so if you do like soloplay be prepared to have 3 useless knbheads do nothing and be unable to be told to do anything until something goes wrong at which point theyre just extra guns that dont do anywhere near enough damage to be useful and will just stand there not taking cover while they get lit up by the cops inevitably go down and you have to pick them up or face a reward money penalty at the end of the heist if you succeed

lastly to circle back to the server issues id understand if the servers were getting ddosd or the company they rent them from was trying to forcibly upsell them or tried to reneg on an agreement or something but we dont know whats going wrong so we just have to assume they have something wrong in the game thats causing this

the worst part is this wouldnt be anywhere near as much an issue if we could just play the game solo offline but we cant its an always online game with the only way to do solo heists is to set it to invite only but even then you have to be online because of that the only content thats playable right now is the tutorials which take no more than 5 minutes and you cant customise any part of them even multiplayer focused games should have a way to play it should the worst happen and the servers are brought offline forever this is why always online titles are seen as a scam because they can just take away your ability to play a game you paid money for and theres nothing you can do about it unless people are able to conjure together fanmade servers

dont buy this until its hard confirmed that you can actually play it for more than a day without getting into infinite matchmaking territory or if you prefer to play solo the confirmation that you can play the game offline

im just massively disappointed i cant play this as i missed the boat on pd2 a game my friends put hundreds of hours into and dont regret it meanwhile im stuck updating them whether or not the servers are up at any given point

#####

generally if i spend money to play a game i expect to be able to play it the game launched yesterday and when i attempted to find a match the online servers were still down 

pdth and pd2 both had offline support so theres no excuse for as to why pd3 doesnt feature an offline mode 

players shouldnt have to queue up for 20 minutes to find a solo lobby to play a solo game you cant even pause a solo game either

the pd community is the only reason why overkill didnt go under and its incredibly frustrating that overkill repaid the community with these anti consumer features

at the end of the day the real clowns are overkill 



#####

just buy payday 2 its usually on sale

#####

the servers were down for over 12 hours on launch day until they got them back up earlier this morning

the servers are now down again

save your money until they remove always online

#####

as someone who has sunk quite a few hours into payday 2 to the point of burnout i was very much looking forward to its sequel put pd3 on my wishlist checked out footage and commentary from those who played the game even prior to early access etc then there it is release day id not preordered given the general state of affairs when it comes to games just released tending to have issues more often than not i am a sap for some incentives eg cosmetics on occasion but did not get the impression that trusting the product to be ready to go upon release would be worth 40 let alone 70 or even 90 usd 

so early access passes its available to the general public and i lay down 40 for the standard version i know quite well how the pd2 gameplay loop and shooting aspects border on or are somewhat cartoonish and excessive though still enjoyable and lends itself to replayability the challenge with any steam game is doing the subjective mental math of trying to determine if the game youve purchased is worth the price all within the two hourtwo week refund window permitted by steam 

so i tried to get through the tutorials relatively quickly to understand new mechanics start to get a grasp on the new feel of movementgunplayetc during that portion alone i was feeling hesitant about it the weird slightly immersionbreaking counterstrikeesque pinpoint accurate always visible crosshair maybe you can disable it i did not want to spend additional time fidgeting through menus though moving onto matchmaking i of course ran into the same issue as mostevery other negative review poster want to play solo despite the alwaysonline bs via invite only fat chance enjoy watching the game attempt to find a match for who knows how long ok whatever public lobby it is i was able to enter one game with one other actual player who i dont think knew how to readyup as iwe sat there with the lobby timer being the thing that eventually kickstarted the heist 

now onto actual gameplay gripes my ping was inexplicably high if theres a way to chat ingame ive no clue how the mixture of necessary and optional objectives alongside being shot at left right and center even with a human shield made everything feel like a clusterf i didnt even realize my teammates had breached the vault until i started seeing loot bags with dyepack mist billowing out finding the getaway van amongst the other small deployableobjectobjective indicators was a nightmare once a cloaker is audible its already too late for your sorry clown arse the gunplay feltjustoff likely due to the starter weapons and their jankasheck iron sights as well as a very unwelcome bloom mechanic associated with accuracy or a lack thereof your heister is a bullet sponge on normal every single time i went down was due to a cloaker dropping from a vent immediately next to me and without the previously mentioned sufficient audio cue to be alert asf i could go on 

i decided to try a different heist maybe to change up the engagement distance from all close range to something with variety but nope matchmaking purgatory later in the day i could not even access the main menu nebula a company ive never before heard of that requires you to make an account prior to doing anything in the game presumably being down all the while i am keeping in mind that every second the game is open even if i just kept trying to get past the login screen is inching me closer to that two hour window for returning the game 

i understand that pd2 went through quite a few changes during its lifespan i only purchased the game years after its initial release so i was not around to experience what i assume are a lot of qol improvements that being said with the experience starbreeze has having worked on pd2 as long as they have i had certain expectations about how pd3 would perform out of the digital box having none of those expectations be met having to make an account with a company thats more than likely to profit off of my personal data having no offline alternative in the face of the always online barriers i refunded the game successfully

ill remain open to the idea of purchasing the game again in the future when there are improvements to most or all of these rather poor first impressions and studio decisions in addition to more content than is available at what starbreeze considers an acceptable state for launch in the meantime if you are able id highly suggest requesting a refund yeah the game isnt full price by 2023 standards if you purchase the base edition with content preemptively placed behind increasingly inane price walls yet for what the game wasis marketed to be akin to an aaa studio production its just silly 

as a long time fan of pd2 and someone who was genuinely looking forward to this next installment i am just kind of sad that this is what i was actually waiting for

#####

i need to queue to play by myself 

#####

had some server issues early onseem to be completely fixed now as well as some performance issuesstuttering and short freezes forgivable as my pc hasnt seen an upgrade in a good while now and there are definitely aspects of the game design that i dont agree with overall its a very solid game with enough to do

having said the above always online gameplay is awful and trash i hate having to wait to create a server to play with friends when i couldve just p2p in payday 2 
why is there a 5 minute timer on the preheist lobby that auto starts the heist just let us play at whatever speed we want
also hope you dont want to change your skills in a heist because then you have to go through waiting to remake the server again 
the forced preheist intro cutscenesunskippable are way too long and become very tiresome if you are restarting a heist basically at all

many weapons feel as though they scale very badly throughout a heist and a large amount of weapon mods feel pretty much completely redundant

the skills system is much simpler and more barebones than in payday 2 along with adjusting how the armor system works and removing dodge this has gutted alot of the build focused and theory crafting experience of the second game 
there are many skills which are almost mandatoryweapon dependant and many that are quite useless i found the engineer tree pretty awful as the sentry guns dont really seem to have much of an effect though this is likely the tradeoff for them not consuming your ammo as they did in 2

the gadgets that they have added are cute but very much limited to stealth it is unclear precisely what they do within the games descriptions which can make them difficult to rely on

if you liked the stealth in payday 2 its likely you will enjoy the stealth in this game much more as it has significantly greater depth and tactical gameplay to it

the almost complete removal of drills and timers along with the introduction of minigameslockpicking and alternate door openers more keycards qr codes has definitely made the game more interactive than payday 2 was at times in the current heists the number of bags seems to be less than in many payday 2 heists which i think is good as it is less of a bag moving simulator


overall i would say the game is a very solid base to build upon personally i hope to see balance patches for many of the weapons as well as an overhaul of most of the weapon attachments more indepth descriptions of what modifications and skills dothey can be very vague better telegraphing of wave stagesand final wave triggers further depth and choices to the build sideskill trees gadgets etc and of course more heists and enemiesheist specific like swat turrets and captain winters as well as general introductions like the medic hopefully some more interesting heists in future as there were some unique gameplay experiences in many payday 2 heists 

#####

payday 3 is abandonware at best i imagine the devs will finish the first year of dlc before declaring bankruptcy and disbanding just buy helldivers

#####

i love earning 0xp thanks to the lame progression system that doesnt let me play hoverever i want 

#####

no offline everything is online only including the tutorial
ui copy pasted from call of duty
no crimenet 
matchmaking split up for every heist on every difficulty meaning there are over 30 separate queues
exp system based only on completing challanges rather than just playing the game
servers still crash and burn on launch day stress tests were pointless
boring forgettable soundtrack
gunplay not as grounded and intense as pdth and not as arcadey and chaotic as pd2
no bain because a game about clowns robbing banks needs to take is storyline seriously for some reason

gonna wait for a hotfix in the next few days otherwise im just gonna refund and check it out again in a few years from now

#####

having played b 700 hours b of payday2 across platforms i have a legitimate mandate to not recommend its successor in its current state

b dallas i need ammo bag b


#####

the only heist this game offers is the heist on your wallet

#####

the real dead game

#####

game is online only no singleplayer but the online servers dont work matchmaking doesnt work cant even get into a single mission tried for over 30mins so basically the game doesnt work besides the title menu screen therefore this game does not work how does this even pass quality inspection

#####

ah yes the always single player experience in an always online game 

#####

biggest heist was the money they stole from supporters lmao

#####

the servers are down at launch and they did not include an offline mode i was only able to play during the 3 day early release

#####

poor remake of one armed robber

#####

hahah 6 hours play hahah i still cant join one singel match

#####

aside from the horrible release the game itself is quite fun and the stealth gameplay has drastically improved
on the other note thought i dont like how there is no armor regeneration at all in louds that mostly forces the player to always equip a armor bag otherwise youll go down in a matter of seconds
the negativity comes from the non existent day one patch which has been consistenly delayed since a month and by the time of this writing still hasnt released
its a shame for both preorder buyers and players since apparently some of them still miss the bonuses that were guaranteed with the preorder of the silver and gold edition
its legit disgraceful to leave the community with radio silence from the developers the past month and on no communication or any date for anything and mind you this is anonline game only with constant connection required and no offline mode or solo mode at all
speaking of which the game lacks everything the predecessor added after launch and with updates such as the ability to customize your crew member bots the already mentioned solo mode an hostage counter in the hudui chat text in lobbyvoice chat ingame and not having the possibility to play with random players at all again after the end of anheist
for the time being ill leave the review like this 
should the devs ever release a bloody update or anything of the like ill update it

#####

i shouldve bought winrar

#####

bthe game is fun but everything around it is flawed those beingb
list
    always online leading to server issues and also giving the possibility of overkillstarbreeze shutting the servers down once the game stops making profit
    lobbies are pretty bad since the host cant kick people that dont ready up so people have to wait 5 minutes for the counter to finish strikealso you dont get to use text chat while in a lobbystrike and the game doesnt even create a new one with the same people after you finish a heist
     strikethe new levelling system as interesting as it may be currently feels really grindy weapon levelling feels slow and people are having issues unlocking challenges leading to some players including myself  missing out on important xp as levels slows down a lot later on strike note as of the 12 update they have added xp gained per heist this has helped but you only get bonus xp for getting all the bags instead of being based off the amount of bags you get which so far has been my only issue with the new system
list
ill still continue to play the game as i enjoy the gameplay a lot but everything else outside of that is really annoying to deal with and shouldnt be issues in the first place

tldr gameplay good everything else bad

#####

just play payday 2

game released barely playable always online with no servers working barely any content buggy as hell and a grindy slosh for a progression system
in 6 months since launch they have ported 2 old payday 2 maps they revamped the progression system a bit fixed a good amount of bugs but still buggy and a nearly 30aud dlc pack for 1 map a weapon pack and a cosmetic pack
their big start to their comeback update had an unready button as a major feature
the game is still buggy theres barely any content even if you pay for the over priced dlc pack the meta still sucks making armour focus the only thing viable and it just sucks in general

just buy payday 2 its actually a good game

#####

payday 3 is soulless
on record i have 1013 hours of play time on payday 2 playing every new mission that was released buying almost every dlc spending minutes waiting in place for guards to be in the perfect position retrying heists over and over to complete them on the hardest difficulty in total stealth solo spending hours just in the menus brainstorming new load out ideas opening lotto safes and customizing my in game music playlists and i spent all that time with payday 2 because not only was i invested but i could literally feel the games appreciation for my time remember the live action trailers the cross overs with other games remember how excited the game devs were to share all of these new additions with us there was passion all of that is absent with payday 3 the game doesnt appreciate us being there it doesnt want to take us on a wild adventure theres no passion anymore theres plenty of game play and graphical upgrades and to the current devs thats all thats needed but theyre wrong the game needs a soul too

#####

just needs more content

#####

payday2 is better than payday3

#####

servers r horrid


#####

game no work 

#####

surprisingly the game servers are fine in south korea hope to come back to the usa after my korea deployment and be even more disappointed with the servers back home

#####

give me back my money

#####

piece of shit game disconnected me from my solo lobby after spending 30min on my perfect stealth run

on the last fucking bag

the last fucking bag do you know how it feels to press q to throw the last bag and the game freezes my bots go through the walls then you are shown a god damn matchmaking dc message 5 seconds away from a payout

do as my friend said and use ur 40 for another aws instance
