omori is the most powerful game ive ever played 
there is no game like omori

#####

for as long as i can remember i have been playing games despite having 13 years of games played across consoles and pc i genuinely cannot remember my favorite game everytime i am asked that it actually takes me a minute or two to come up with an answer that i really do not care for sure i have played an endless amount of good engaging games across all genres but the truth is that ive never really had a alltime favorite game a game that i could truly stand by with all my passion no game has ever really affected me deeply enough on a emotional and entertaining level to make me say this is truly a masterpiece and i am glad that i got to play it there has only always been good bad or mediocre 

i was gifted omori as a christmas present from a good friend and being a fan of lisa and undertale while being unaware of what this game was i was sure that this game would just be in the  good category but i was dead wrong off from the first two hours i knew that something about this game was special just from the music and the amazingly drawn art style and when i thought i knew i was going to happen or how something was going to play out i was only a victim of constant surprisal and fear when i thought the game would hit a peak it only kept showing me that there was more of the mountain to hike that each time my expectations were broken and i set new ones they were only continuously destroyed again and again for the 36 hours i played of this game i was emotionally invested for all of it which is something i cannot say about most games that come out nowadays you really get invested into the protagonists situation and you start feeling for the characters that are with you on this journey the more you understand them while the constant repression of fear and the dread of what is going to come next is in the back of your mind until the game prompts you to start being afraid a masterful craft and use of psychological horror

the last time i have truly b i felt i b something let alone emotions formed and fueled by a video game other than small entertainment with or without friends is utterly beyond me i do not remember if i ever have even maybe it is because i have been dealing with depression anxiety and a history of suicidal thoughtsattempts when i was younger from cancer and it still lingers on today maybe it is the themes of the game itself relating to my childhood but a game that has had this much of an effect on me and has maybe even changed my views on somethings is definitely worthy of being called a masterpiece

i would wholeheartedly recommend this game to other players

#####

omori is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story it tackles dark topics which include depression anxiety and suicide as per warnings as such this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game but i would highly recommend playing the game yourself first

what omori does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up you know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression anxiety and suicide but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story while everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side which recurs throughout the game this leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you however a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup

as a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game omori does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to they all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated which fits in with the grand scheme of things you will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another and how they change throughout the story given the situation one big thing omori hits home on is if you can relate to the main character through its portrayal of depression anxiety and suicide the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact that is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love omori but it can be extremely relatable to those who have

the story and characters in omori are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts all the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard they are definitely memorable especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future as for the artstyle the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in omori it was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes

omoris combat is in the form of a turnbased rpg which was a genre i was not the biggest fan of that being said i found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it there are emotion states for your characters and enemies which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around this is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game rewarding you for exploring the world one thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see especially when they were at different emotional levels the attacks you have were also great in that sense like the headbutts animation

if there was one thing to criticize about the game omori it is the pacing issue it has oftentimes i found areas to be drawn out a bit too long especially when trying to interact with everything in the game it can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story but i was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks this will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings andor going for a full completion as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues

i really enjoyed playing through omori and it is a game i will be remembering for a long time it has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers and i have been thinking about it the past few days this was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters i would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat thank you for reading my review

#####

i laughed i cried i laughed i cried i cried i cried

#####

please play this game blind

do not spoil this for yourself and do not skip out on this this is a mustplay game

#####

the reward for getting all the achievements is a mental illness

#####

ruined my life would buy again

#####

didnt help my declining mental health at all but introduced me to a banger soundtrack

1010 not coping but vibing

#####

i never go out of my way to write reviews on games but this one just hit me differently i cannot remember the last time a game made me want to 100 it over 100 hours in getting every achievement there is still content that i havent even touched because the story characters gameplay world building art music are all 1010 in my eyes i call this game a piece of art i could go on and on gushing about this game but doing that wont do this game justice just buy it and experience it yourself this is coming from someone who never heard of the game until watching the first 30 min of it on yt second day of its release falling in love with the art style i had 0 knowledge of the omocat teamcompany this games kickstarter or anything prior to its release i went in blind through my entire experience

since its release the devs have released 3 free updates addressing bugs glitches and even added additional items and features a fourth update is incoming which i wager will come in a week from the posting of this review it would be an understatement to say this is the next big indie game it handles itself and its subjects so damn well its really beyond just an indie game this is an experience one that will shake you make you laugh make you cry make you feel a spectrum of emotions no other game least for me has ever come close to achieving 

if i had to put this game on a top 10 from 2020 list this goes in my personal top 3 greatest video game experiences of all time its easily the number 1 2020 goty for me topping got hades and other games that would appear in others goty lists 
thank you omocat team for making this work of art an experience that i will never forget one that i will cherish and compare future games to for a very long time

#####

pain

#####

i will probably never be happy again

#####

i wish i could forget this game so i could play for the first time again

#####

get in loser were going to therapy

#####

my therapist will be hearing about this

#####

this game has made my mental health decline severely

#####

bi usually never review games and if i do they are ironic reviews but this one just hit me so differently that i felt the need to it truly deserves it and i sincerely thank my friend for gifting me this gameb

i want to make one thing clear immediately omori is absolutely not a game for everyone both because of the themes it touches and for some moments of the game that seem to flow apparently a bit slowly
that being said omori is a game that captures those who want to be carried away by a well curated non trivial story
i think this is the only game that has given me unique emotions in a way i feel like ive changed after playing it and im really glad

bplot there are no spoilersb
omori deals with the story of a deep friendship between a group of friends where you will enter the shoes of 2 characters omori and sunny going as previously mentioned to gradually touch darker and mysterious themes
the exploratory component and the multiple interactions of the characters with the world around them in order to join the pieces of what is happening and grasp all the aftertaste of the story will prove to be particularly important

bgameplayb
in addition to the exploratory component with secret roads events for which you will also have to often retrace the steps of the character to return to places already visited environmental puzzles the game has a fighting system that takes up that of the earthbound series

bconclusionsb
unfortunately to avoid spoilers i had to omit several strengths of the game but i can venture to say that if you are players who are not in a hurry to rush a game but on the contrary prefer to continue calmly exploring interacting with the world created and appreciating the small details and if you are not afraid of more old style graphics then i think this game will not leave you disappointed at all

i wish i could forget this game so i could get to play it again and go through all of what it has to offer

what a journey this was

#####

wow omori is so cool i wish i had friends

#####

cured my depression and then gave it back and made it worse would recommend 1010

#####

alright 84 hours and 84 achievements i do believe its my time to say something

omori is my favorite game at this point in my life from start to finish the story mechanics and art were all perfect is the game itself perfect no of course not nothing is perfect i even cherrypicked a bunch of flaws just for this review such as some menus being clunky plutos spaceline being a slog some battles especially earlygame ones not being balanced as they should and mr jawsums entire fight

my favorite part about omori is that the events are very real and might have happened to someone on this earth at one point in time i dont like calling the characters characters in this game because they are written so realistically it feels like i knew them at one point in time ive never been that social of a person and even now as im finishing up college im starting to feel like sunny unsure of what to do with a notsobright past

im not one to express my emotions much while playing games but this game has brought a few tears to my eyes and a few chills down my spine after the fifth playthrough theyre not as prevalent anymore but i still remember the first time i heard it means everything and omori those two tracks and the scenes theyre associated with are my reminders of why this game is perfect to me at least

omocat if youre reading this which you probably arent and i dont mind but thank you for making this game ive always been interested in game development from a young age and ive dabbled in it for a large portion of my life but omori was finally the thing that got me to get off my ass and start making something in rpg maker mz its not big its only a fangame of a certain franchise i like but im pulling out all the stops for it i got artists musicians programmers everyone i wish i could do it all myself but id probably be dead before i even get the script started tldr i love omori i love you you inspired me a lot

im excited to see if youll make more games and thanks again

100 straight depression   

#####

a life ruining game experience

#####

omor

#####

its difficult to play the game if you cant see through your tears

#####

game hits too close to home
except the part where he has friends

#####

my hours in this game cant accurately portray how many hours of pain it has caused me

#####

relatable experience i know how it feels to eat cold steak and fight inner demons on the stairs at 3 am

#####

play if you want to be more mentally ill than you already are

#####

people are talking how they got depressed after playing this game
jokes on you i was already depressed so now im miserable

#####

this might sound hilarious and pathetic but this game literally sent me to get a therapy appointment lately for a couple of years i have been neglecting my life engaging in too much escapism doing stuff like playing video games all day including omori to ignore my mental issues afterwhile going through heavy grief but this beautiful ending ithe good onei made me realize that even though its not easy at all and it requires a lot of strength its better to try to face your traumas head on rather than pretending they dont exist and everything is fine well its not like i was stupid enough to not realize that before but its hard to get out of that loop and ask for help yet omori managed to slap me so hard that i thought okay thats it im getting help i cant keep going at it like sunny because i saw too much of my own behavior in the main characters storydecisionsrelationships ihell a couple of times i also havent gotten out of my house for several months iand it did not look good from an outsider perspective that was quite uncomfortable for me spoileri too accidentally damaged my friendships because i had fallen too deep into my own sulking and isolated myself without realizing that the extent of my self hatred ended up affecting my friends too and they didnt deserve that but i guess its not easy to be a good friend when your mind is too busy creating a parallel reality where time doesnt pass and also trying to convince you to end your lifespoiler hopefully this time with the help of my therapist my life might get better 3
ok enough venting on steam wtf what a loser sorry but this game is important to me now heres an actual review 

bpros beautiful artstyle compelling story lovely characters some better than others fun gameplay well im a rpg fan so i might be biased 

cons omocat didnt milk her beautiful artstyle in this platform by adding trading cardspoints shop items so i cant buy and wear an animated kel avatar like god intended me to that sucks b


strikeps btw a considerable part of the fandom is toxic as hell if you love this game interact with fans at your own riskstrike

#####

i will never recover from this 1010

#####

spoiler free

im not sure how many people will read this review but after playing this game i knew i had to write one

ive played earthbound mother 3 undertale oneshot yume nikki corpse party and other indie rpg maker games but this game tops all of them for me i love all of the games i listed previously deeply but despite them being as great as they are this game has managed to become my favorite of all time

this game does a great job at hiding whats to come at the beginning and i thankfully experienced it completely blind because wow is it insane it really reminds me of earthbound because of how crazy the ending is but it keeps you guessing at when youve reached it because once you think youre almost there it surprises you and keeps making things interesting without going into detail the ending and the parts leading up to it manage to top all of the rpgs ive played before it hitting you with an insane mindfuck that had me completely shocked again imagine the fight with giygas from earthbound but much much much worse or better in a way then assuming you are on the true ending it literally hits you dead in the heart pun intended and had me on the verge of tears

this game is a lot longer than i thought it would be and i have yet to complete the secret ending and get all the achievements but its been an absolute pleasure to play the entire time since you never know what youll encounter next you can really tell how this game was influenced by earthbound undertale and yume nikki and thats gotta be one of my favorite parts about it because i love all of those games

this game deserves your attention and if after all ive said youre still not convinced that you should experience this masterpiece of a game for yourself then by all means watch a lets play on it even though you should experience it for yourself by actually playing it if thats what works for you then do it i dont care how you do it but please dont sleep on this game or give up on it i promise you that this game is worth it

tldr the game is good buy it and youll see what i mean

i am insanely mentally ill but yeah play the game

omori is a wonderfully written and directed rpg in the vain of a motheresque experience with fun colourful characters on top of a more dark and serious narrative while this game is described as a psychological horror game it certainly doesnt feel at odds with the settings and environment and the overarching narrative weaves the more bright and cheery aspects of the game with the significantly less so

i would preface my review of this game with this if you are at all sensitive to depressing topics or themes i would not recommend this game to you flat out this game absolutely explores depression anxiety and suicide to a length that i personally enjoy as it is thematically interesting and engaging but is certainly not an experience for everyone if you are comfortable with media exploring those topics  i would highly recommend this experience from a writing and art direction omori nails these topics is quite a way i dont think ive seen done before at least not to this degree

omori also is very much so a traditional turnbased rpg however it introduces some fairly fresh mechanics to not make it ridiculously stale fitting in with the ideas of the game the main combat mechanic is that of emotions its a fire emblem type triangle with happy beating angry angry beating sad and sad beating happy but in addition to this these emotions arent fixed things all members of your partys emotions can be changed during battle as well as your opponents this opens a very unique box of strategy of knowing how and when to set emotions in battle to get good hits emotions also have the unique effect of having additional effects on top of just a triangle effect  such as sad having you drain your mp or juice when youre hit by an opponent theres even more emotions beyond the base 3 but you get the core idea this combat system is actually quite good its engaging and it does keep you on your toes as enemies react in different ways to keep it fresh the menuing and item management systems are a bit lacking but they dont actively inhibit the gameplay experience 

i feel like im going to see this game compared a lot to undertale and mother 3 i cannot feel as if this is more wrong than people think yes all 3 are quite zany and omori has references to both games littered throughout for those with a keen eye but the core theming and premises of the three could not be more different setting aside that all 3 actually have quite different gameplay and combat mechanics though omori and mother 3 are quite a bit more similar than any of them to undertale these games serve entirely different purposes with their stories and all stand independent of one another and without getting too spoilerheavy even omoris zany world isnt quite as it may seem in the trailers and certainly is not at all similar to the worlds of the other two games

overall omori is an exceptional game  a depressing game for sure but a fantastic one nonetheless omocat and the omori team clearly put an immense amount of heart and care into this game and i really applaud them for that this game came out after 6 years of development because they wanted to make sure it was good  and it didnt it came out incredible

note i do have one iminori complaint which is that fullscreen mode is currently broken for the game it has a terrible effect on the sidebars with steam overlay i hope this is patched out in future versions but i also understand this may in part be due to this being a modified rpg maker mv game

post completion edit yeah this game slaps hard cannot recommend enough

a profound journey into the depths of what it means to be human

in an era of consciousness where people have forgotten what it means to really be alive and romanticizeglamorize mental illness omori is a shining example of baring the harmful effects of inner toxicity guilt  disassociation it is also a surprisingly poignant commentary on the friend dynamic how fragile it is  how easy it is for things to change in your life before you even realize it i wont touch too much on the gameplay because while i enjoy it i found it tedious at times and the pacing of this game is its own issue but in the end it didnt matter it is a vehicle for the writing omori is competent as an rpg has fun and deep mechanics but again overall youre not going to be playing this cuz of its addicting gameplay loop this is a much more heavy piece of art than it is an engine for fun

omori starts out quaint enough giving you just enough information to believe you know what it might be about the game does a great job at doing this throughout as it thoroughly changed my beliefs on what the game really was several times throughout the game i dont think it was being deceitful either i think it truly just has a lot to say about a lot of things societal pressure anxiety troubled home lifeits all in here its all done in a way that is truly surprisingly well written with all of the subtext symbolism  metaphors you could want from any good piece of art omori gives you tons and asks only from you that you observe it and give it some thought

there are a lot of troubling things going on in the world of omori the characters clearly need some therapy these characters all represent different perspectives and dynamics from a mostly realistic depiction of a friend group its realistic that bonds break down over time that things change before you can say your real feelings that some feel the isolation hard and most people cope in different ways the clever part of the game is that in a meta way you cope with the events of the game in your own real life and your reaction and feelings effect how the game effectively pans out i was shocked horrified and confused at several points in this story and i think it will affect many people differently and that is the intended purpose of the game some might reject it all and never try to see the game as it is some might accept it all at face value some may even make their own art as a result of the games overall journey  ending being unsatisfying to them and thats okay

omori got under my skin at many points of the story i cried at parts that wouldnt even be considered sad and felt no sadness at parts where i knew i should cry it is as complex as the ocean and i have not even explored the games other optional route i encourage everyone to buy this game open your mind and your heart and let everything wash over you given enough time away from this game i dont know if it will ever leave my mind but if it does i think ill never forget the things i learned about myself along the way

h1introductionh1
bomorib is a very unique kind of game and in some aspects i dont know how to fully describe it without spoiling things this review will be spoilerfree and i recommend playing this 100 blind to get the best experience it has a unique combat system with an emotionbased system tied into it that i found very interesting to utilize

h1pros and consh1
bprosb
list
an interesting story that goes through things like depression anxiety and loneliness
bosses have character development to them in battle
a unique combat system that has emotional status effects with characters interactions during battle
followup attacks that have their own uses to utilize in combat
each party member has a certain skill to use outside of combat
the art style is full of color that makes the areas you explore shine
great soundtrack
list

bconsb
list
the emotion system is not used as much as i would have liked it to be
list

h1storyh1
welcome to bwhite spaceb you play the character bomorib who has been living there for as long as he can remember there are no walls all you see is white space and a black lightbulb hanging from the roof  the floor is always cold with your laptop and blankets keeping you warm  a box of tissues and a sketchbook lays nearby

h3charactersh3
bomorib has a few friends baubreyb bkelb and bherob who will be the central focus of the story they are looking for their best friend bbasilb who has gone missing bomorib also has a sister name bmarib who keeps the group supplied with food to fully heal the party when they need it

you will be playing with emotions throughout your journey and interacting with the environment the characters you play are young and dont really know the world around them and this i found very unique as they are growing up in this world

the story will tackle themes of depression anxiety and loneliness and what it feels like to live with these emotions it does a great job showing how people deal with each and how to overcome these things when someone is feeling down i liked how it was done showing us the suffering that people have to go with their struggles

i really loved how some of the bosses also had character development attached to them while you are in a battle it adds more charm to the bosses and it fits with their corresponding theme of the areas they are in

there is a lot i want to say about the story but i would just end up spoiling it its really well done and i just loved every aspect of it i should mention that the story does get dark at times so when you are in a happy moment i recommend you treasure them as things will get serious especially as you approach the end of the story

h1gameplayh1
bomorib is a turnedbased rpg where you will use a variety of skills in combat there is a normal attack and skills to utilize in battle to help take out enemies skills require a certain amount of juice to be used similar to mana in a traditional rpg  skills have a variety of uses and some will inflict bemotionb ill explain a little more on this feature in a bit at the end of every battle you will get rewarded experience points and you will level up when you collect a certain amount 
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2446392402
you may learn a new move from leveling up which can help you as you progress through the story  they vary in terms of enjoyment so it is best to experiment with them once you obtain new moves

during the course of the battle your party will build up energy which can be used to perform followup attacks these attacks will always cost at least three energy however if you get a max of ten energy you can perform a special attack where the whole party will attack the enemy this method is really good for taking out bosses as it will do a big chunk of damage to them and will probably save you in a pinch some followup attacks are not as useful so it has a bit of strategy

party members also have abilities outside of battle that will help you access other parts of an area or to find items bomorib can use his knife to cut certain objects like cones webs or small trees baubreyb can smash objects with her trusty bat bkelb can throw his ball to activate switches and bherob can use his charm to talk to certain people to assist the party 

h3emotionsh3
bemotionsb can determine how characters are affected there are a total of three emotions that you have access to in the game bhappyb will make your characters luck and speed increase but your hit rate will decrease bangryb will make your attack go up however your defense will be lowered in the process the last one is bsadb your defense will increase but your damage will decrease and damage to your juice meter will also be inflected as well these emotions can also be further increased such as the emotion bhappyb can turn into bexcitedb and it can go further than that the emotions work in a traditional combat triangle bhappyb beats bangryb bangryb beats bsadb and bsadb beats bhappyb so keep these emotions in mind while fighting
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2446392899
this bemotionb mechanic is a very interesting feature of the game however its not really used much and does not seem to matter for most fights the only time it was really an issue was for one boss fight if you have farmed enough levels you could most likely defeat the boss with regular attacks negating any reasons to use the bemotionsb present this is disappointing as the bemotionb mechanic was something i really enjoyed and would have loved to get more use out of

h1art style performance and soundtrackh1
the art style is handdrawn it looks very nice to the eyes and i liked how each area was presented each area is crafted very well and the character models fit with the world and the themes i tested the game with an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 3gb amd ryzen 5 1500x quadcore processor 350 and 16 gb of ram the game runs really well and can run on lower spec computers the soundtrack is very good with each song fitting with the areas of the game  it is really nice to listen to justifying the optional dlc soundtrack
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2446446335
h1final verdicth1
bomorib is a really unique rpg i liked how it tackled the themes and showed how people learn to cope with them it displays moments of happiness and then moments of very serious situations where everything may seem ok but its not i recommend bomorib to anyone who wants to experience a unique rpg as its just that bomorib is not just a game its an experience that is worth remembering

#####

the quirky

#####

can you recall the scariest media experience of your life ill take a guess and say that it probably wasnt something that was meant to be scary eg horror rather its probably either something that was unintentionally scary or kids entertainment something that at its core is not horror whatsoever thats where the purest most potent fears are created

in other words the best way to create horror is to not create horror and thats exactly that omocat did when she made omori a huge childish innocent game which bseemsb to only exist to deliver its true emotional payload with maximum force 

mind the game doesnt hide the fact that at its very core it is in fact horror both the trailer and the screenshots show you glimpses of the darkness that awaits you at the bottom of the staircase but thats the thing it iawaitsi you know its there all the while you play a normal game about a kid hanging out with his friends in a childhood fantasy land for just about long enough to iforgeti and then it reminds you of its existence looks you straight in the eye and leaves you alone again until you forget again but your subconsciousness wont forget it will constantly whisper this dissonant song of quiet anxiety which becomes the background radiation of omoris universe

so for the most part you play a kiddy jrpg but uhoh thats also not quite true to avoid spoilers lets just say its not a kids dream land as much as its a kids dream land thats significantly distorted by nostalgia fading memories and trauma remember when i said that this part of the main game bseemsb only to exist to strengthen the horror yes seems in the grand scheme of things it also establishes the world the characters the events of the past and  perhaps most importantly  serves as a snapshot of sorts snapshot of what the world seemed like back then you know how that big plushie from your childhood seemed like this lumbering giant but when you look at the photographs you can see that it was in fact quite small this is what im talking about here

this is important because the general theme of the game is dealing with your past  in more ways than one but thats all im going to say on that topic

oh and if youve been playing indie games long enough to believe that games designed by visual artists tend to be pretty but boring shallow and generally not very thought through dont you worry this is a rare exception the game design is not only fun its also quite fresh  for example instead of elements the battle system revolves around a mood system anger sadness happiness happiness is strong against anger anger is strong against sadness sadness is strong against happiness many midandlate game fights revolve around cleverly managing and exploiting the moods of not only your party but also the opponents ive never seen anything like that and ive seen quite a bit

if theres one thing that bothers me about the game its the portrayal of some elements of depression omori the character clearly suffers from some kind of emotional deficiency not only his face barely changes expressions hes also drained of colour unlike literally everything else so far so good this is a pretty good representation but the problem is that in spite of this hes loved and surrounded by friends like how does that work anyone whos suffered from even a minor depressive episode knows that when the 𝙱𝙻𝙰𝙲𝙺 𝙵𝙾𝙶 takes over people tend to see you as a drag a bore uninteresting and often unattractive due to your lowered ability to care for your looks mentally ill people usually end up alone and not by choice  theyre abandoned by their friends and family maybe my experience has something to do with the different way society reacts to depression in men and women or maybe this is in fact intentional and this inconsistency is meant to be a clue that something is very wrong here

there are other things about this game that i could write about such as the fact that the soundtrack contains 170 tracks 4 hours in total or the sheer volume of handdrawn art this game has but in such an emotionally potent game as omori these things pretty much dont matter theyre the background only helping to bring the games emotionality front and center if youve decided to descend the staircase of this game as i believe you should a small reminder just in case

at the bottom that darkness is still there

i have severe depression 

#####

ill start off by talking about the gameplay im not exactly a big fan of rpgs and to be honest with my bias its usually because im not the best at them andor it requires too much brainpower for me to think about what my next strategy is going to be with that being said ive immensely enjoyed this game from start to finish and there are so so many things id love to talk about mainly going into the storyrich details of this somber yet bittersweet experience 

so about the gameplay its your standard rpg turnbased fighting style with a very unique mechanic and that involves this buffnerf system for your characters spoiler your characters can become angry happy or sad with each emotion having its perks and cons for example if your character is angry they can dish out more damage but they become much more vulnerable to attacks also certain emotions have an advantage over others spoiler

this kind of mechanic is something ive never seen before in terms of its artistic style and it becomes very obvious as it relates storywise as to why this is in place otherwise you kill enemies and you level up just as you would in any other rpgs you can collect items acquire new skills as you level up equip different types of weapons and items called charms that can boost or lower certain stats for your characters its your bread and butter gameplay from most rpgs that if youre familiar with youll be able to immediately pick up on it without any issues

thats a majority of the game in a nutshell however its not necessarily the gameplay that makes omori so special the storytelling characters artistic hand drawn environments and the general themes and emotions that youll go through as you venture on this remarkable indie rpg is what drew me in immediately and of course it was recommended by one of my friends

ive enjoyed every second of this experience which is where i want to bring up the mature content descriptionwarning from the developers the game heavily deals with themes and depictions of clinical depression and anxiety and suicide its something that the game deals with i believe very carefully and yet keeps the poignant theme of it wellbalanced enough for the player to enjoy at least it did for me

as im sure you can already tell from the games steam page and from what ive written so far this is not just a happy colorful game with everything about rainbows sunshine and butterflies it not only deals with themes of revolving around mental illness but of also feelings of loneliness abandonment hopelessness and a general loss of energy and interest in activities that were once found enjoyable all of these are very real depictions of clinical depression and its symptomatology including anxiety and suicide or thoughts of suicide indeed the tag of psychological horror should be taken quite literally when talking about omori

the characters are absolutely adorable and ive grown severely attached to all of them what makes them so charming is the fact that their emotions the things that they say especially in regards to the mental illness elements of this game is real in fact you may already know these characters in your own life thats because the events that these video game characters have gone through someone that you may know and love and care for have gone through the very same thing though im sure not exactly the same i should hope so

what pierced my heart the most about this game is that ive been through many things similar that are shown in omori it struck a personal nerve with me though in a bittersweet way the developers did a fantastic job in leaving an impact on the player even if youve never had mental illness or have faced it from a friend or loved one in any shape or form you feel empathy in trying to comfort these characters and again i do believe it was carefully done to place this throughout the game

in terms of any negatives i have to give about this game it just comes down to my bias for rpgs there is eventually a point in the game at least later on where it becomes very grindy and instead of trying to fight off the enemies youll run into youll end up running away from their encounter in an attempt to just progress the story already but honestly that comes from my personal behavior on these types of games eventually i got burnt out towards the end and just wanted to see the conclusion 

in terms of the horror elements of the game as i said before they mainly revolve around very real depictions and clinical and social impact of mental illness and its effects on ones quality of life granted there are a few spooky moments in the game but other than that its nothing really heavy to the point where youll be jumping out of your seat

the music was awesome to listen to though thats highly dependent on where you are in the game spoiler if you are in headspace as omori a majority of the music especially when fighting bosses is upbeat and gets your blood pumping when you play as sunny in the real world it can sometimes become more melancholy and haunting though thats dependent on what youre doing in the game spoiler

if youve made it this far in reading my wall of text congratulations i could continue prattling on and on about the characters and more and more about other features and elements of the game including wrapping more spoiler tags here and there but i do want to wrap it up here and talk a little more on the takehome message that this game sends

omori involves those heavy depictions of mental illness and its impact on ones life yes but it also is about how it affects your community and more especially your friends and family there were many times in this game where i cried because of how much they reminded me about how i had great times with my friends when i was a child and then the pains and angst of growing up from teenage years to now as an adult there many moments in my life where i had experienced traumatic events that tore friendships asunder only for them to come back again and unfortunately there have been moments where ive lost those that i once called friends either by my decision in separating myself from them for personal reasons or by their own hands

this game as bittersweet as it was in its message made me appreciate all the friends and people ive had in my life along the way ive been fortunate enough to have been loved by my friends and family and i hope if anyone is reading this youll have that same fortune and if not now maybe one day

i strongly strongly recommend playing this game yourself and i want to mention something else if you know someone in your life that you care fora friend family member or whomeveris struggling with horrible thoughts and feelings please reach out to them as soon as you can and if you yourself are in a bind as well i want to you know that there is absolutely no shame in seeking professional help in my short existence in life so far ive learned that its better to have friends and family that love you in tackling these issues than to go at it alone

spoiler the game does feature multiple endings though i did get what is considered the best ending i may do another playthrough on the other runs but after what ive read about them i dont think i have the heart to do so even though they are fictional characters i enjoy stories with the happiest outcomes as possible spoiler

now to finally end it on this note from a melody that was sung to me as a child make new friends but keep the old one is silver and the other gold

take care of yourselves and keep your friends and family close to you because in the end thats all we have

ulike my reviews go follow my urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator33012112gandhitalksgamescurator pageurlu

bthis review is mostly spoiler free only one mild spoiler is mentioned and it is covered by a spoiler tagb

iomorii is a fascinating game its one that caught my attention almost immediately as the reviews are almost unanimously positive and had that quirky earthboundesque feel going for it and yet none of the reviews actually do anything other than say get it now go in spoiler free amazing game which yes id agree that its an absolutely amazing game that you should experience as blindly as possible but iomorii is also a game that should warrant a little discussion to make sure its for you because it idefinitelyi isnt going to click with everyone this is my attempt at trying to sell you on one of the most creative rpgs in years with actual information about the game but without spoiling anything

h1graphicsh1

the key defining feature of iomorisi visuals is in its handdrawn style which i loved almost immediately i was worried that the drawings were going to look a little too crude at times or perhaps thered be too much happening on the screen for me to follow it however none of these fears ended up being the case as iomorii used color in a very brilliant manner to help distinguish things from one another and you arent often fighting more than one enemy at a time unless i just got lucky with my enemy encounters so i ended up growing to really appreciate the art style im not too keen on the ui personally and got lost in the menus a few more times than id like to admit but thats more of a nitpick than anything and not something that id really hold against the game otherwise i enjoyed the game visually it wouldve been cool to see it totally lean into the handdrawn style but im still very pleased with whats here either way

h1gameplayh1

while not as impressive overall as the visuals the gameplay still works very well overall first and most importantly while psychological horror is the most popular tag for this game id say that iomorii is still an rpg first and foremost the rpg and horror segments tend to be pretty separate from one another overall but do a good job of transitioning between one or the other the overworld segments are pretty much your standard rpg affair and the combat mostly is the same way however this game has an emotion system they bring to the table which i quite like overall this emotion system functions like rockpaperscissors but what makes this system interesting is that youre able to control the emotions of both your party and the enemy while the enemy can do the same thing its a pretty fun system overall but it is a little too shallow i wish it was expanded upon a little bit at least with the bosses theres a lot of potential in a system like that but i think most of the bosses are too similar mechanically as they often just boil down to countering whatever emotion theyre stuck as since youre unable to change it the major exception to this from my one playthrough was spoilersweetheartspoiler who ended up being my favorite fight in the game because i felt they had a lot more control in the battle because they would change my partys emotions far more frequently than the others i wouldve liked to see more of that or perhaps more fights that rely on neutral emotions as far as everything else goes its still just your typical rpg stuff the side quests mostly boil down to fetch quests but the appeal in those lies more in the writing and charm which usually made them worthwhile overall iomorii plays more like an rpg than a horror game but its still pretty fun either way

h1storyh1

but make no mistake iomorii may be an rpg but theres still a good reason why that psychological horror tag is as popular as it is this game is iincrediblyi dark it makes me think of ibojack horsemani in that its a story that will absolutely wreck you and even if you think it wont do much youll end up thinking about it for days if not weeks afterwards the main cast of characters are all extremely wellwritten to a point where i liked every single one of them i also need to commend iomorii for doing a fantastic job of using the games mechanics to help tell its story which i think significantly helped drive home its themes its a game that really finds its stride at the end providing such an emotional payoff that its no wonder that this game has gotten as much praise as it has however in backloading most of the story like this i discovered one of my only major issues with this game the pacing some people will tell you that you need to get through the first few hours of the game others will tell you its the middle part of the game that isnt as interesting with the way the story is laid out the story doesnt really make much actual progress at least overtly until the end so the game is banking on you being sold on the quirky world and silly writing more than anything while things happen the story doesnt really move forward until that last act if that makes sense i understand why that is the case but i think the game couldve benefited from hinting at the revelations of the finale a little earlier and a little more often in order to give just enough the player enough breadcrumbs to keep them asking questions i wish i could expand upon this further but i wouldnt be able to do so without spoiling the story overall though the story is still amazing barring the odd pacing and the ending will still make the game worthwhile no matter how you look at it

h1audioh1

the sound design isnt really relevant here as the voice acting is nonexistent and its still an rpgmaker game at its core however the music in this game is absolutely incredible it was pretty good from the getgo but it just gets better and better and better each area gets its own overworld music battle music and most of the bosses have their own themes as well i love the variety and it absolutely nailed whatever mood they were trying to establish it rivals iundertalei in terms of quality and it wouldnt be hyperbole for most to say that iundertalei has one of the best video game soundtracks of all time the music is one of the best things about the game

h1content valueh1

while ive only put a little under 17 hours into this game dont be fooled you can get significantly more playtime out of this game and theres a lot of secrets and side content to experience there are quite a few major things that i missed in my playthrough and its honestly very impressive to see just how much content is hidden in this game on top of this the ending will stick with you one way or another so on top of actually having a lot of bang for your buck the story is definitely not one youll be forgetting any time soon 

h1verdicth1

theres so much more id love to talk about but i know i cant in order to avoid spoilers but regardless iomorii is an absolutely amazing rpg that while not quite a masterpiece does come fairly close its very much worth your time and money as long as you know what youre getting into i highly recommend this game but be sure to keep some tissues nearby to wipe your sorrows away

before i actually played omori myself i heard positive words about it but at the time i didnt really want to try it out due to my laziness until recently to be honest when i was buying this game i thought id just try it out for an hour or two and then not proceed further how foolish i was back then on my very first game session i was stuck in the game for 4 hours straight and liked it totally not expecting that the point of no return for me though had become the junkyard area with the track playing in this location and thats when i literally fell in love with the game

i managed to finish omori within 40 hours for the first time while most people finish it within around 20 hours but it was all about taking my time and sticking nose in every corner i notice interact with everything thats interactable and immerse into the story actually everything about this piece of art is brilliant making it hard for me to talk about anything specific because all of the aspects of omori are intertwined and each of them plays a significant role gameplay characters story visuals and of course music with caps yes all combined i somehow felt nostalgic for something i never really had i felt familiar with locations as if i was actually there spending my summer vacations and characters felt like theyre my friends or siblings this is pure magic

this game is one of the prime examples of why storybased games are valuable for players and for the game industry overall they are unlike online session or grinding kind of games in which you can spend hundreds or thousands of hours its not necessarily a bad thing to spend that much time for a game but something storybased which might not even take 50 hours to finish can end up being much more memorable and make you feel alive refreshing from routine carry you through a roller coaster of emotions ending with a thought what a blast it has been in case of omori youll additionally have so much to think about afterwards look up at discussion forums come up with certain ideas and most likely tear up or cry fun fact no piece of media has ever drained so many tears from me even though i wasnt ugly crying haha

a couple of important parts about the game it does contain psyschological horror elements it covers quite sensitive topics and it demonstrates some things which might be hard to take for certain players be advised about it and if you decided to play this game or started playing it and youre determined to finish it try to avoid spoilers it is important

this is the first time im writing an actual review for a game i really dont have expreience in writing those p but i got this inspiration to deliver my feelings and some points about omori as it felt important to me maybe i really needed to get through such expreience for a long time and i hadnt even known about it until recently

for anyone who reads this thank you for your time

#####

me  yeah im good just a little tired haha



　　

　　　
　　　　
　　
　　　
　　　

#####

its like pokemon but with more depression and worse parenting

#####

i usually write a goofy review after i finish a game usually just a small joke or something but this time i believe i want to leave a more serious one without getting into any of the actual games content i can say that this may very well be one of the best games ive ever played in my life going into this game i didnt really know what to expect and im so glad for that this is a game that is best played completely blind but even if you know the spoilers its still 100 worth it the soundtrack and ever changing atmosphere work together to create an absolute wonder of game design 

i would also like to say that i believe this is the first game ever to actually get me to cry real tears during it ive felt sad over games in the past but ive never actually cried during one a beautiful game with a message that will stick with you for a lifetime and one i believe everyone deserves to experience in their lifetimes i find that when a video game tells a story it is much more heartfelt than any book or movie because you are completely immersed and all the choices feel like they are yours 

all in all 1010 even going into this game with a critical mindset i simply could not see it as anything short of a masterpiece thank you omori

#####

its like undertale but for mentally ill people

#####

im now officially traumatized by stairs

#####

when i flex i feel my best

#####

pain agony even

#####















#####

very cute and adorable
if youre feeling sad it will make you feel depressed and if youre already depressed it will make you miserable 1010 would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys depression

#####

note dont play this game during depression or when youre in a weak mental headspace or this game can overwhelm you beyond your soul play it when youre happy or in a good headspace

anyway this game has ruined my life and i had to stop playing it for a while but i have to say this is the best game ive played in my entire life what the protagonist goes through is similar to what im going through and i felt like i was there the game deals with realistic problems in a very realistic way  and with very original and unique interpretations of the problems

best game ive ever played made me wanna commit ruined my life and made me depressed
1010 play it

#####

the most emotionally impactful game ive ever played

i have played many video games in the past but there has never been one that could close the gap to my heart as effortlessly as omori has the first hour or so of this game is misleading probably intentionally so i thought this was going to be a cute lofi aesthetic rpg with some quite frankly sluggish combat or something along these lines but as i progressed through the game and the first major plot point i realized i wasnt playing omori for the gameplay no there are clearly better rpgs than this but the story the world the characters now this is something worth exploring and believe me when i tell you that in the end of it all i regret even thinking of doubting this game at the beginning

i cant say much without getting into spoiler territory but i can tell you this omori has so so many powerful ways of gripping your heart tightly so one moment youll find yourself with a glowing grin and watery eyes then moments later youll be feeling the painful chills down on you as you slowly explore the horrible truth you care about what is happening without the game making you do so it is the most meaningful game ive ever played in terms of presentation the world building is meaningful the horror aspects of this game are meaningful everything matters and this game will make you realize this thoroughly

what is even more astounding is that such a brilliant game was made in rpg maker it just shows that a bold vision can shine adamantly even on restricted environments five years of rough development that paid off tremendously a tiny group of individuals that wanted to create something beautiful even on rpg maker this game looks amazing the little details in every level the gorgeous pencildrawn animations the expressive character portraits complementing each other to deliver a bizarre colorful world the soundtrack is very beautiful and very well achieved

omori is sad it is happy it is terrifying it is a macabre ode for young people it is a message of love and forgiveness omori is a warm smile in the cold fog in the endless void it is a reminder a reminder to look ahead past the overwhelming darkness there somewhere youll find the smiles and love of the ones waiting for you so dont keep them waiting

because of this game now my life is miserable 1010

since i havent seen many others mention this its worth to note that the trigger warning should be taken pretty seriously and while i recommend the game to everyone because its phenomenal  maybe wait until you are in a good mindset before playing it through

the game is still fantastic in every single way though art the music characters gameplay the story
easily one of my favorite games of all time

#####

i believe in kel supremacy

#####

this game made me cry i dont remember the last game that actually made me straight up cry some games can make me feel emotions yes  i can and do get emotional but this game man i cried like a baby to this game i dont want to give this game a review like i do for other games mainly because i feel like if i talk about my thoughts on certain things i cannot review it without spoiling and this game is best experienced blind i truthfully mean it blind and no other way

if you want to know whether or not i recommend the game refer to the blue thumbs up on the review sale or no sale this game is worth it either way please play omori

a few words of advice though  remember to water the plants when your friends need you  be there for them dont leave them behind

andplease remember to actually level up and dont treat this like undertale otherwise youll be like me and force yourself to do unnecessary side activities just to continue playing

thats everything play omori i wont say any more than this

#####

omori generally succeeds in making you bond with a earnest likable cast of kids and does tremendous effort in order to ensure a consistency of letting gameplay tell as much of the story as the dialogue itself 
its a shame that i find the pacing to actively hurt progression of the narrative and the meat of the turn based combat is too simplistic to let it be as engaging as it could be

at initial glance its apparent there is a gigantic amount of love and heart poured in here not just on the cute drawings or fantastic use of audio and music there is a lot of care put in the sense stimulation in the game to provide contrast levity and make the points where things get serious actually hit the mark but at the same time there are many moments where i dont think the game utilized its biggest strengths to the fullest

for the most part the visuals and interactions tell as much as the conversations and there is room for you to actively care about the characters aside of the game doing everything it can to make them likable and relatable in some way the problem is more on how the overall pacing of the game becomes a constant loop of burnt bridges and when youre desperate to know more having to travel a new area blind can be frustrating and discouraging its not that the areas and encounters arent good its that they are placed in manners that feel like a mean tease after progress was just made in the plot

this said the story itself is a ride the balance of symbolism on your nose showdonttell and just outright saying is very healthy and eased equally to ensure you dont feel aggravated by a constant info dump or the usual indie storytelling 101 and most of the revelations respect your intelligence to figure things out for yourself which is already more than most video games even bother to try 

combat wise its a mixed bag the rps approach to emotional manipulation is fitting to the themes and kids using toys and their personality just as much as their weapons is a nice carryover of narrative enhancement helps there is a nice variety of encounters bosses and battles sadly much like inreallife rps is quite limited so unless you constantly experiment with skills and change playstyle all fights will become very repetitive halfway into the game not to be a deal breaker but it can make some great bosses loose their edge didnt stop them from being exciting and full of personality with great theme songs and tricky situations to manage the sheer level of new things in every area is commendable and its great how fresh every segment is in the game and its undeniably satisfying to overcome hard encounters

i am being harsh but my issues didnt stop omori from being an overall genuinely great experience with a level of maturity regarding its subject matter that you rarely find nowadays some ironing could have improved it as a whole but it wasnt that much of a deal to let it ruin what probably is one of the most resonant intimate journeys that have come out in recent memory

#####

i love kel

#####

this game changed my life in a positive way i really love all the characters and the story
before omori i was in a really bad place mentally this game helped me realize how much i love life itself bc being alive is really beautiful if you have good friends or what i like to called it our choosen family after omori i reached for help finally and now im in a better place so yeah this game saved my life

soooooo thanks omocat

play the game yourself before reading any reviews

no other games story has genuinely changed my perspective on life before and ive played heard and seen many other stories in my life

sure the pacing of the game might be a tad strange here and there but this has easily taken the spot as the most memorable game i have ever played and probably will play the story is so twisted and heart wrenching yet i can relate to it very well 

many might dismiss this game as just another game about anxiety and depression and while sure it does go over these topics it delivers them in such a way where they are not forced upon you rather you begin to realize everything yourself you find everything nothing comes to you that is the strongest aspect of this game and why it delivers its many messages so well

also the ost for this game is a banger i recommend checking it out and i also recommend taking your time by playing this banger of a game

#####

hes just like me fr

#####

 made me love my friends even more
 made me sad
 made me buy a ton of omori merch

just play the game and cry with everyone else


#####

i dont really write reviews much but this game deserves one in all my 20 years of life this was the first game to make me cry i love the colorful art style which is what initially drew me in and the soundtrack is amazing too it really is a phenomenal game one of the best ive played in a long while if you have struggled with suicidal thoughts and depression this game is something you absolutely have to experience

#####

do not read reviews just play the game please enjoy it before it becomes the streamers turn it into something known by everybody enjoy it before you get spoiled

oh boy do i have a story to tell to my therapist
edit wow this comment sorta blew up

#####

this is not a perfect game the pacing is a little wonky at times it is fairly tedious and full of busy work the game isnt terribly well balanced there are probably thousands of little negatives anyone can come up with

however make i no i mistake this game is a masterpiece a game dripping with undeniable amounts of passion i have i never i seen a game have the story is phenomenal the horror elements expertly contrasted with a carefree façade the soundtrack brilliantly balanced between emotional and gamey every inch of this game flaws and all comes together to create one of the most beautiful and haunting games i have ever played 

you will laugh cheer smile worry cry

b fear b

all in the first few hours then the cycle repeats until you stop laughing cheering smiling until all you can do while playing the game is fear or cry 

dont worry the positive moments take up just as much screentime if not moreso

or worry because it only accentuates the pain


anyway this game i deserves i your money it is a slow burn it might bore you at first i beg you and everyone else to play it through even if you need to drag your feet through it it will be worth it for the story alone

#####

аfter playing this game im no longer straight
and i will never recover from that

tldr this is a crying simulator it rips your heart out of your chest throws it into a blender and then puts the minced meat back into your rib cage sprinkling a bucket of salt on it



holy crap what a rollercoaster that was i played this completely blind i bought omori because of its aesthetics i saw in trailers and psychological horror rpg and story rich tags i was expecting this to be one of those artsy games you play for ten hours max and then leave it maybe come back later for a couple of achievements but thats it instead i ended up finding a new favorite game going straight up to my top list playing for almost thirty hours and also found out theres multiple endings and even new areas and bosses depending on your choices like holy shit this world is massive

omori is work of geniuses characters are realistic and humane and have lots of depth nothing is revealed too much too early i was totally not expecting that and i can only imagine what kind of mindfuck moments theres going to be when i start a new game and do things differently also all that foreshadowing you have no clue about during your first playthrough ouch spoileri love how the contrast between headspace and faraway is portrayed ive also had my own imagination world and even had some moments i wouldve rather stayed there instead returning to the real world so this hits me hard although you know the place isnt real it still has its nostalgic charm you dont want to let go ofspoiler

also the games message is probably the most important one out there forgiveness our world is unfortunately full of trauma grudge and hatred  both towards ourselves and others  and i think the most natural and fastest way out of this collective misery would be forgiveness not the wrong kind of forgiveness most people seem to think it is just being like eh shit happens no big deal im tough this doesnt affect me and wiping it under carpet only to grow something bigger and uglier and causing even more suffering its not even forgiveness its denial and belittling of both what happened and the suffering it caused

true forgiveness is accepting the thing happened but not letting it drag you down for the rest of your life understanding that most bad things we cause to ourselves and others arent intentional but nevertheless they still happen because we cant predict the future or were in a situation where we have no clue of what were doing coulda woulda shoulda we forget were all human not gods and yet we keep subconsciously demanding we should possess knowledge and powers of a god and unreasonably punish ourselves and each other for having neither

soundtrack is also pure gold one of the best ones ive heard and includes so many earworms

the only downside i can come up with omori is the absence of steam backgrounds avatars emojis and stickers this games aesthetic is so rad id gladly decorate my entire profile with it

this is my game of the year you know those special games that youve played where once you finish you cant help but think you wont be able to experience this again but youre so happy you did well omori is one of those games for me
i have never ever been so emotionally wrecked and inspired at the same time mother 3 had me in shambles at its end and got to me emotionally a few times outside that but omori does it one better in my opinion this game teaches you in unorthadox ways to make unpleasant things something you have to do it brings you into the experience its not just your character overcoming these challenges you do as well you have to face your fears face your conscience at times and you cant just wait for something to happen
 
from someone who horror is genuinely not an experience i enjoy feeling here it felt necessary not cheap and the things in between it were so wildly rewarding and engaging it was worth it to challenge my fears and come out on top it was worth the anxiety to see my digital friends get closer to what they hope for 
the main cast in this game never break immersion of what you expect from them they have character and they will probably make you reflect on people you once knew and had grown apart from they made me feel nostalgia for characters i was just getting to know theyll give you reasons to like them they feel like they belong together nobody is some third wheel who has no input or you could do without this is probably one of the biggest sells to omori its fantastically written characters

the battle system is somewhat what you would expect from an rpg turn based each character is somewhat classed into their own thing like dps healer tank speedster and each with their own pool of moves what shakes things up is the emotions system so like rock paper scissors each emotion beats one and is trumped by another sad beats happy happy beats angry and angry beats sad with a few nuances like happy making crits occur more often while sacrificing accuracy or anger and sadness making sacrifices between your offense and defense these statuses can be inflicted on your own party and enemies to control the flow of super effective attacks and strategies and usually not one strategy can work forever so youll have to experiment to maximise your efforts battles also have follow up attacks each character can bounce off one of the others to do team up attacks for example if kel looks to hero for a follow up theyll perform an attack that targets all enemies if aubrey looks to omori shell do another attack trying to get him to notice her everyone bounces well off eachother in the story but its reflected in the battles too its a great system and i never felt the need to grind in the normal run through the game

the music is perfect it balances those bouncy joyful tones of a colorful rpg and its darker undertones honestly its so well done any horror or unease you just felt will probably be undone by the next great battle theme its memorable the music always compliments whats happening the soothing notes of maris theme sells who she is it reinforces the safety she provides while the battle theme of otherworld instils that spacey pop vibe that keeps things upbeat and nostalgic while you fight tape decks and dial up for a soundtrack that incorporates horror its weird that id still listen to it outside the game

the story of omori well to put it spoiler free its about travelling the world of headspace to look for your friend whos missing you get to meet them and get an idea of who they are and why you would want to find themrescue them all the while dealing with instances that make you feel something isnt right this game will go into some very heavy themes of suicide trauma anxiety and depression    
   this is not for everyone       
but i feel its worth overcoming and im glad it isnt a tale of malice its very human its about mistakes and the trauma that follows its about the climb back up and facing the hard truths
omori is a beautiful game worth so much to me and i just want this experience to reach more people 

id recommend this to anyone who likes rpgs and good battle systems strong characters and story maybe even to those looking for a genuine perspective into some hardships of mental health

#####

i remembered to be patient

but i also remembered to cherish

thanks for the experience

#####

this is the best game i have ever played

i cannot stress how important it is to go into this game blind any spoilers whatsoever could completely shatter the experience the story of omori is brilliant and i still think about it and let it live rent free in my head ever since i finished it and ive wanted to replay it time and time again to get every single ending every secret anything something i have never cared about in a videogame

its 20 hours long on average this game is a masterpiece the story the music the characters everything about it

review
omori won the environment of the year award for a reason without going into too much depth it puts you into two places at once but you can only stay on one path heavy emphasis on the differences between these worlds and how their puzzles are solved is present very well written narrative

extra notes please note that this game is not just a cutesy game but also a horror game i personally enjoyed it a lot and it is a shame that this isnt yet getting the fame it deserves truly a hidden gem if you liked undertale you will most probably like this game

#####

im like four rooms into the game and i already had a mandatory cutscene where i viewed feet pics

#####

one of the best games ive ever played with an amazing portrayal of trauma this game will break you also the sound track is phenomenal

#####

a wonderful game ive waited 6 years and nearly turned 18 by the time it released
ive had a blast playing it i spent months delaying finishing it because i didnt want to rush but the ending was more emotional than i could have ever expected i suggest playing it blind on my first run i got the true ending with the secret cutscene at the end once youve done a full run i totally recommend going to the other endings and route

omoris endings are def well done as theyre able to make you feel the full weight of what youve done and how your choices led you to what ending you got i also love how it also gives you enough room to think about your own ending when it comes to the true ending

but one thing is clear omori is a game about traumaguiltfriendshipslove and forgiveness
omori is most certainly a game about how forgiveness isnt always easy that forgiveness towards yourself is probably the most difficult and perhaps the hardest thing to dohow no matter if someone else forgives you or not all you can do is ask for it and accept what happens in hope of finding peace

a game about how mistakes can turn a persons life aroundhow mistakes can burden you and warp your mind a game about how sometimes you have to face the truth if you want to find peace
and most certainly a game about how doing something bad does not make you a bad person and that no one can punish you more than you already punish yourself


spoilers from this point onwards be warned

the true ending is a painful reminder that even the best ending isnt the happiest in some stories the way it cuts off right as youre about to cut offand lets you think would you forgive sunny and basil would you forgive yourself and after all the time youve spent with everyone how would they react the way guiltfearsand trauma are tied in together so well the plot twist wasnt what at all i might have expectedbasils role was also a surprise to me

the fact also that you cannot avoid uncomfortable tasks like stabbing yourselfor cant run away from battles that make you uncomfortable are all ways to really allow us to connect with sunnyomori and relate to him weve all been in uncomfortable positions that we couldnt escape from and had to face head on

as someone with ptsd and trauma a lot of what sunny experienced hit home which is also what made my experience so much more emotional never have i played a game that had my emotionally invested the entire time while making me feel like i was in the protagonists shoes

i also have to add the fact that the title screen changes during certain points is what i love games that force you to come face to face with whats going on no matter what is really another way to drive home that you cant escape 

the true ending with blue skies and sunny the sunny bad ending where omori has sunny jump off the roof with nothing but blue skies if you open the game the sunny ending where basil possibly kills himself because if you fought him he wounds sunnys eye with a gardening tool which can be seen on his fight sprite he was probably gonna use it on himself and you walk out with something guilt of maris death following you causing omori to reappear on the title screen being in black space causing the white background to turn black and red its all a reminder of the choices you made and the guilt he feels



it was worth every day of waiting

#####

i close your eyes youll be here soon i

ive been waiting for omori for almost 7 years while i regretfully was not a kickstarter backer i followed along with high hopes and great interest a few years into waiting my hopes began to fall and aside from an occasional checkup i wasnt nearly as invested come december 2020 imagine my shock when i hear that the game i actually came out i after all these years i waited a few days to buy it afraid that the years despite the past few not actively being as hyped of waiting would be met with disappointment b i have never been so wrong in my life b

i close your eyes and youll leave this dream i

omori is quite easily one of my favorite games of all time already theres so much to love about it the art is absolutely adorable the battle system is really fun the music is phenomenal the writing is some of the best ive read in any game sometimes its heartwarming other times its hilarious plenty of times its depressing and so forth the story is incredibly gripping as someone who has had a hard time sitting down and playing single player games for months now i had to force myself to close omori once i finally got started i could barely stop until i completed it as of typing this ive completed the good and bad endings and plan to start the hikikiomori route once this has been posted i just absolutely adore the story and everything else about the game im going to cut off the review here to prevent myself from gushing for too long and potentially spoiling it but i please i play this game 

b everything is going to be okay b

#####

wait i thought the developers were joking when saying that they would release the game i wasnt actually thinking they were serious

#####

this happened to my buddy eric

#####

this is the story i am not going to tell anyone but a few anonymous people on the steam webpage the writing i did has only one goal to make a conclusion of my own thoughts and emotions that came up in my mind throughout playing this game

i came to omori as a normal mentally stable fellow without that many sad and depressing thoughts before playing i consider myself a person who will never complain to somebody about my emotions and thoughts ill never cry to anyone and will never say how bad im feeling thats okay for me i never had depression and expected nothing from this game a month ago i decided to finally quit video games because of the intensive studies that are going to begin this september ill have to move to a completely new country for me alone i will work hard and there is no way i could spend my free time in front of a computer i considered omori as my last singleplayer video game of my teenage years and for the foreseeable future

my first play was at night being completely alone helped me understand this game correctly my first session lasted for six nonstop hours and ive never felt what i felt during this play there is no other video game that is able to make you feel that blank postgaming syndrome constantly like omori did i felt it from the beginning until the end whether i was in front of a computer or not im still wondering if this hollow feeling will ever fully leave me when i decided that this is enough for today i went to the bathroom and spent almost an hour there thinking the main subject was my childhood

the thoughts of my childhood became a sad ghost that follows me every night and day i think about it every time i have to solve some task about my university admission or studies every time i walk through a place that was special only for you and a few people you knew back then do they still remember it as i do do they still cherish it as i do will they ever come back here with a desperate hope of seeing some of us or just to see it again

that night i felt completely miserable there is no way to get back there there is no way i could ever talk to all my good old friends again no way we could gather again and do the things that kids like us usually did some part of them is lost in a big city with their own troubles im sure that they have forgotten how great it was together some have left the country forever and some are even dead money wasnt a concern in my childhood there was no war and i wasnt afraid that id never see my parents again due to a russian rocket attack when i was 12 my only worry was spending another summer with my friends with a stash of snacks prohibited by my mother and that limited version of cocacola that is no longer produced i never thought about all of this before playing omori i never missed my childhood times and never dreamed about those times omoris headspace is a mirror of our infantile times we all had and miss

this masterpiece is not about gameplay graphics or storyline there is no way you can rate it separately from your own mind and the changes that occur in it during the play this game is about nostalgic infantile pure emotions that emerge from the hidden part of your soul and will never leave you until your death

there is a theory of the last dream which means that when you die your brain will produce a last long dreamsome even call it heaven i am sure that this heaven will be some kind of headspace but with your own friends games and troubles i hope that ill be able to feel these emotions of a little kid who just minds his own business playing games with friends and dreaming again wait for me my friends ill play with you once again someday even if i have to die for this itll be a worthy reward 1010 the best game ive ever played

#####

im speechless i think this has somehow managed to reach up to my top three games of all time while that might not mean much to you please read this review to understand why ive come to this conclusion after finishing the game

this game grabbed my attention around two years ago it looked interesting it had a really weird visual style and art and it was an rpgmaker game and that engine had some really really incredible games like off home ib oneshot etc of course this was right up my alley when i looked at the trailer of the game i really thought it was going to be more of an exploratory game with a bit of psychological horror into it almost like yume nikki but it also reminded me of more grounded surreal games an oxymoron in and of itself like earthbound fast forward two years and it turned out that this was actually a turnbased rpg and theyre really hit and miss but this one i think really smacks it out of the park im not afraid to admit i sometimes spent upwards to 8 hours consecutively on the game it really captivated me that much

for a start visually this game is really something else there are so many artstyles incorporated into the game beautiful and imaginative landscapes with pastel colors and somehow simultaneously ebbs a sense of idyllicism and foreboding the game has the psychological horror tag for a reason and just when youre comfortable the game will creep up on you there were definitely a few moments which caught me offguard 

the story too follows up with a similar style of being idyllic honestly this was probably what i thought was the strongest point of the game yes people have complained that the beginning is slow and a bit childish and honestly for the first few hours understandable but please if youre somewhat interested try to get through it if its really bogging you down honestly there were more than a few times where i genuinely laughed but good god paying close attention to the little breadcrumbs the game drops about the themes of guilt depression and acceptance it really slapped me out of left field hard sometimes as well i dont generally emote to a lot of media but this game genuinely had me ugly crying quite a few times now im not sure as to whether this is because some of these details were accentuated by me going through similarly tough events previously and me empathically relating to similar moments in the game or if this is something thats surprisingly more generalized but overall it made the game more enjoyable and relatable to me 

tying this review to a final draw for a turnbased rpg the combat is rather captivating in my opinion combat is relegated to an emotion system with three main statuses happy angry and sad that sort of go against eachother in a rockpaperscissor sort of fashion while this isnt really intriguing in itself what was more enjoyable was inflicting this cycle on both my party and enemies i think the game strikes a good balance overall with how powerful enemies are and how you can play around them using the emotion system the game develops on this system a slight amount and changes it up but not to the extent where it gets super convoluted 

overall id highly get this game just for the story alone honestly that really was a strong point for me and i think other reviewers are mentioning this as well i really enjoyed the time i had with playing this game it was very bittersweet i dont think there were necessarily any major complaints i had with the game i might actually replay it which i dont tend to do with games 




#####

the first thing you might notice when checking out this game is the black and white image of the protagonist with some colors being shown in other screenshots and videos however i recommend you to get into this game blindly without checking any image nor video at all if possible

omori is a game that seems made with love when you first play comparing it to similar products in the genre from the more recent undertale to classics like earthbound mother 3 and even yume nikki and off is something that comes naturally if you have experienced those games already it all begins in a very uneventful way and quickly changes toward showing you many smiles many colors lots of cutely and wellmade drawn action and characters there is a lot of care put into everything the enemies have their own personalities the gameplay is characterized by a special emotion system that subtly makes you relate with what happens onscreen think for example about pestering flies that make you angry when you dont kill them on your first try youd slowly go from upset to outright enraged and if you have a keen eye and a good memory you will notice many references to characters and situations that you will meet or that you have met and can now followup after progressing into the game

the story revolves around the titular character omori and you will control him while exploring the curious world he and his friends live in the more you delve into it the more you will see elements of love the first time i tagged someone else to be able to proceed seeing the pictures with the background of the environment they were in i felt like i was there with them and the companionship and camaraderie grew on me you will get affectionate to at least a few of the characters you will control or meet on this journey

however and this is the part where you should stop reading if you dont want any further spoilers there is much more than a simple lighthearted adventure with your friends in this game which can quickly feel like it becomes more and more vast in contrast with the initial white space that welcomes you

something unsettling happens from time to time revolving on the fears that omori has and needs to overcome to further proceed into the story but labeling them as simple fears really discredits the importance of what is truly behind them and what the journey of the character entails 

i cannot bring myself to tell you more than this as i want to avoid detailed spoilers but i can tell you how the game made me feel when it made me realize that a choice i would make could bring great disaster or great benefit to a small populace confirming that being attentive of your decision will pay off in accepting the result when i came out of a certain location and saw how things developed and how i wanted to change them fully relating with the difficulty of overcoming ones fears when i found myself on a long highway in the middle of the night the music accompanying me having understood more of the game while enjoying what was happening as if i were on the journey myself when against all odds i faced a dire enemy and could withstand its blows when i found myself drifting further in darkness feeling betrayed struggling to get out of it i felt joyful happy comforted sad shocked betrayed annoyed angered resolute 

the game isnt shy at throwing you darkness among all the happiness and your behavior will influence how you will face this darkness and what results your decisions will bring to it is an exemplary representation of fears depression sadness trauma inability or difficulty to move on mental health family problems social struggle beyond the surface of uneasiness there is substantial confirmation of what you will expect to find and much more against all expectations of dark moments in ones live

and even then with all the darkness inside this game this is a game of love we all have been in very dark moments where an abyss seemed more welcoming than the world around us where it was easier to dismiss and feel sad because it felt comforting due to our situation the developers must have put ideas and thoughts from those times they faced as well and in doing so they created something which can be both scary and encouraging for people that are undergoing a journey to overcome their own fears and improve their well being something for all of those that are able to easily relate with characters that while fictional give us as many emotions if not more as the real people that are around us characters that accompany us while we help them walking their path growing strong facing their fears overcoming what we ourselves have been through or want to overcome whether we dislike them or appreciate them in the end

the game is a meaningful work of love made for everyone that both needs and wants to overcome an escape from a life that is restrictive demanding and incapable of understanding how much more goes on in the minds and lives of people that arent just bound by societal rules and work duties how much more peoples existences amount to compared to how little importance and focus the world provides them back if you have played celeste you know that there is depth beyond the intense platformer that is presented to you and much love and care that surrounds the whole game where madeline overcomes the difficult task against the comfort of her current unhelpful life ultimately we are all desirous of feeling happy in a world where we can be accepted by ourselves and by others where we want to focus on the things that matters and that we love beyond what we are i supposed to like and do i and resign to as the norm

i wish nothing but the very best to omocat and all the team that was behind a game that is for all of those that felt understood and capable of relating with the silliness and seriousness of earthbound and undertale with the detachment and depth of yume nikki and simply put for all of those that are undergoing this journey called life and can benefit from a reminder that beyond everydays struggle and constant routine beyond times of dark and difficulties there is always someone and something out there be it friends pieces of media like books movies videogames art and many other forms that understand you and reminds what truly matters how you can influence what is around you beyond what society and others expects you to do and how there is a meaningful world of experiences and memories both wonderful and terrible within you

#####

i really really love omori but man is it hard to recommend it to friends 

to elaborate this is the horror i love the most or reasons why stuff like ib crooked man the witchs house and countless other rpgmaker horror games are some of my favorite theres this sense of wonder and mystery combined with characters that you feel real to the extent to where youi actually icare if something horrible happens to them sometimes all you really need is a good cast a great story and something lurking behind them 

so why is it hard to recommend it i went into the game blind when it came out not knowing a single thing about it the game easily became the best experience out of 2020 for me yet it was also somehow one of the worsts the isolation from covid19 was getting to me and by the end of the game i couldnt get it off my mind there were certain endgame scenes that stuck with me and i remember that sinking feeling in my chest that came at the drop of a hat i thought long about those scenes and if they were needed before ultimately deciding yes 

in the end

bit is something to be experienced but only your in peak state of mindb 

if youre not feeling your best i highly encourage flexing until you feel otherwise

i got nothing left to say i think im done now

spoiler you need to accept the something behind you that has been there for as long as you can remember no matter how much the truth hurts  you need to forgive yourself and accept it as it is nothing you do can change the past you can only change the future  or alternatively you can daydream about the good days when everything was much simpler  when time was your friend and not your enemy thus ceasing the opportunity at redemption and forgiveness repressing the truth somewhere deep where every thought becomes a fragment of what it once was only showing up at the worst times to remind you of your guilt and failure to remind you what your life couldve been if you wouldve forgiven yourself mocking you for choosing to live inside your own safe space instead of taking responsibility for your actions spoiler that is what omori taught me

before reading i should first make it clear that i am not rating thumbs down because i didnt like this game 200 hours mightve already given that part away omori is one of my favorite games of all time in fact and i am going to refrain as much as possible from leaving any story based spoilers in this review because this game is and i cant stress this enough best experienced as blind as possible and when you experience this game for the first time theres no going back afterwards

that being said there comes the reason i rate this game negatively bthis game is not for everyoneb and this review is primarily for people reading through the negative reviews before buying the game out of skepticism for its overwhelmingly positive feedback i dont blame anyone who does this because some people want to know if a game is right for them before buying

 i will run through the demographics who i dont recommend omori to descending from most to least dealbreaking

1 its just another quirky earthbound inspired indie jrpg about depression

im certain that there are a few people who think this way about games that draw similarities to undertale a game that exploded into the mainstream around the time that indie games really started to make an impact around 2015 though this is up to debate if the thought of there being a subgenre of earthboundinspired indie jrpgs or games that discuss depression as a central theme keeps you awake at night because there is a supposed epidemic of these games that are lazy halfbaked excuses for finished products being overrated by weebs then id stay as far away from this game as possible omori inspires itself greatly on earthbound and yume nikki with its wacky scenarios and themes about depression respectively traits that it wears on its sleeve to many thats not a big deal its a means to draw inspiration to a new product that does things differently in its own way in my opinion i think that classifying a game as a ripoff and sign of laziness from the developer based off of surface level aspects is in and of itself a halfassed excuse to not play a game while simultaneously disliking it because i just know its gonna be like every other xxyyzz clone out there i know that the people who think this sort of thing are in the thankful minority but my opinions are not here to change anyones mind on purpose and are only here as a warning for those who are predisposed to dislike games like omori to give it a skip 

2 you have little tolerance for quirky or weird humor

this game like i said earlier is heavily inspired by earthbound make of that what you will it uses a lot of weird cutesy and quirky humor throughout the game that while i found it nice enough and funny for the most part other people may find it tiring and quirky may have some negative connotations depending on the person its true that i did find some of the humor a little stale at times but it was not very often thankfully the game never tries to be edgy and use its themes for shock humor and the humor reserves itself to the more lighthearted moments of the game additionally there are many moments throughout that elicit feelings other than haha funny that are thoroughly enjoyable however the quirk factor is a prevalent part of the game and those who may find it tiring probably wouldnt feel too at home playing this game

3 you are unwilling to take the game as seriously as it takes itself

this one might sound a little pretentious but i felt it necessary to bring this up too this game takes itself seriously and rightfully so it covers serious topics that are not to be danced around lightly so if you might be inclined to believe that the game might not be in the right to take itself seriously in tandem with all of the goofy stuff that happens in the background then the game might not leave a super great impression on you as this game is at its best when it is serious and when these moments are taken seriously

4 you are expecting high level and complex gameplay

this games main purpose for existing is first and foremost to tell a story through the medium of a game not to be a game that also happens to tell a story this was stated by omocat herself at the beginning of the project and it still rings true in the final game now the gameplay is not ibadi by any means but some who love games primarily based on gameplay and not story may come away with a few complaints with good reason this game is very easy save for a few fights that are completely optional or impossible to access in the main route of the game the games main combat system revolving around 3 emotions in a rockpaperscissors type effectiveness that gets the job done alongside this is the typical turnbased rpg aspects deal damage use items buffdebuff you get the idea and when you put it all together its pretty enjoyable but not anything particularly groundbreaking save for a few fights where you actually need to use your brain in addition to this there are no random encounters in the overworld and no grinding is required to get past bosses which relieves a lot of annoying aspects many turn based rpgs share however some may see this as underutilization of the games elements which is fair enough it iisi a game after all i would only see this as a reason to not buy the game if you do not care about the story in games like this at all

5 you are impatient

i am not looking to criticize anyone for being impatient as most people do not have ample time to play video games this is probably the most difficult argument to make and also the one i see the most often in criticisms of this game because what constitutes poor pacing and a game that is too long varies incredibly widely from person to person if you were to run through the game doing a few side activities reading the dialogue not a whole lot of sidetracking this game takes about 25 hours to complete to me 25 hours is not a long game but a decent length without overstaying its welcome playing through persona 3  4 may have desensitized me to proper game length seeing how long those games are however to a lot of people that length of a game is too long many would prefer to squeeze a game that can be completed in a shorter time into their busy schedules and for many thats a deal breaker in addition to this there is the pacing of the game that is a little weird shifting between 2 settings throughout the game with the majority of development occurring in one part while the other has noticeably less i see the most criticism toward this aspect of the game and many will feel a bit unsatisfied or bored by the pacing at first i personally had very little issue with the pacing while playing and even came to appreciate it by the end due to the design and context within the game but thats just the kind of thing that i like not everybody has to and thats okay if you think of yourself as someone who likes to see the end of things quickly but still want to see omori through to the end i recommend you go into this game with patience in mind if you are uncertain about how patient you are with a game as long as omori but all other aspects of the game interest you id recommend playing through lisa the painful beforehand as it possesses many similar traits to omori while many other ones distinguish the two greatly but its half as long if you liked lisa then i think youd like omori too and if you didnt like lisa because it felt too long then you probably wouldnt like omori either keep in mind that i compared these games because they test the players patience differently and there are plenty of people whod love lisa but not omori for different reasons and vice versa 

tldr love this game but not for everyone play lisa the painful if you are on the fence

b i am in a lot of pain b

i have played this game in its entirety 
b 120hours b is what it took to complete this game twice and receive b all of its achievements b
if you have not played this game yet get away from the reviews and any community posts
just play the game and open the door when kel knocks

if you are still reading this review and you have not completed the game
i 142190240109 i

the true route is the first route i have played
my initial opinion was what a cute game
then it put me through all stages of grief 5 times and then gave me a phobia for stairs

the hikikomori route portrayed my depression in great detail a constant state of emptiness

i cannot explain how much misery this game has brought me but damn
its beautiful this is my favourite game of all time by far

of course every game has its downsides but ingame the downsides are very insignificant
most struggles ive experienced ingame were when i was replaying it so upon your first playthrough you probably wont notice any
outside of the game i have noticed a big downside of playing omori
this game sets your expectations for video games very high to the point that i cannot enjoy most games like i have enjoyed omori
this game is very well made written and executed and most modern games compared to this are just nothing like that

that sums up all my thoughts about the game if you still read this whilst not having played the game and you are interested in playing it please do its definitely worth it
and because i knew there would be someone that was still going to read this i tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum

thank you for reading my review have a nice day
strike i will now cry whilst holding a mr plantegg plushie strike

some games are not worth the price
this price is not worth the game

kel turned me gay

#####

this game ruined my life

#####

finally named my character sunny and now to actually play the game

#####

edit finished the game added some info at the end after the tldr

a wonderful story of heartbreak and isolation make sure to read the content warnings and dont be afraid to take a break and spend time with someone you love im not finished yet but its really engaging for me in terms of the mystery behind these characters who are they and what do they mean to each other what is this fantastical world why can i blow an air horn and make all my friends angry at me

the combat is fun but the emotion system is not as indepth as i would have liked you can usually get by with just rushing down your enemies using attacks and a few special moves but the emotions mainly play out as intended during boss fights think of the emotions as a pokemon starter trio happy beats angry angry beats sad sad beats happy and then use the emotions to exploit weaknesses its fun but the random encounters are too short to use them because both you and the enemy are fairly fragile

art and music are fantastic writing is great with a lot of jokes and pretty hard moments to swallow if you liked the roadblocks in earthbound or the ants in mother 3 there are plenty of little jokes about sections of the game that are gated off for progression the looming darkness of the game is present but not so much that you cant enjoy the funny and cute moments itll show up to remind you that this is not a happy game but usually in short manageable segments

jumpscares are in the game but for the most part they didnt get on my nerves too much the first major jumpscare i found involved a door being cracked open just enough to look outside and it really got me and didnt feel cheap or fake

overall the game is solid other games in this genre perform better in many regards but omoris particular niche and artstyle is amazing i recommend it for the initial release price of 1999 but if youre on the fence you can wait for a sale its not so amazing or important to play as a game like undertale was but i think the developers deserve praise for trying new ideas and doing a decent job at translating them to an original project with great visuals and sound

tldr  not the best rpgmaker horror rpg out there but definitely one of the better ones easily a top 10 choice

postcredits thoughts
okay then that was certainly an experience i legitimately did not see where the story was going up until the moment it dropped into my lap but i was able to guess some minor details there were times where i didnt know if my choices would change the outcome of the story and got anxious over picking the wrong thing but the game has a message about that crafted into the narrative in a way all i can really say without giving away spoilers is that actions cant be undone but you can rely on others to guide you through your sorrows

if you have family that youve lost there are some tough segments i got upset and teary eyed in the climax especially involving some of the more striking scenes i felt so awful once i learned the main twist i needed to step away and get some water your personal reaction may vary but it got me good

definitely my favorite storybased game this year please give it a chance i have heard some drama about the kickstarter and other people disliking the games opening segments but i think the game came out better with this massive delay i got 20 hours logged on this save file but some of that extra time is due to leaving it running while doing other things 1 per hour of enjoyment is great and i think that i might go through and play it again in a few months

#####

this game made me realise that i need therapy 

#####

i have no words im writing this review so that the game has more positive reviews lol

#####

when i flexxxxx i feeeeel myyy bessttttttt

#####

this game has changed me in ways that i simply can not say i became infatuated with every character the story left me on verge of actual tears of both joy and sorrow and i dare say that it is as amazing if not more than undertale which was my all time favorite rpg and made me feel the same as i described earlier i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story and thats not mentioning the innovative mechanics and amazing and unique art style both visually and musically so far i only finished one of the endings but from what i know there are multiple so do yourself a huge favor and play this game

#####

ayo the pizza here

#####

#####

i omor

#####

good game loved it when aubrey accidentally became racist 1010

#####

the game is 20 but the all the omori merch i bought after cost 200

update 425 

update too much and planning on spending more at least the basil shirt is nice 

#####

the slime girls are hot

#####

a mustplay play it blind and experience it for the first time by yourself

it is definitely worth its price

a twisted impactful plot with stylish emotional storytelling like no other

if there is anything else to add its that the world is charming filled with wacky characters the soundtrack is great and there is a fun combat system which neatlessly utilizes emotions to top off the storytelling versatility and fun gameplay twists in your usual rpgmakergameplay

there is simply something about it it hits differently and in a unique way rising all the way to my top spot past my favorites in its genre such as off oneshot undertale earthbound and ib

1010 and i will cherish it for a long time to come

omori took me around 30 hours to play many tears searching reddit for information because of being invested in the games lore however i have no regrets im glad my attention was brought to omori and playing it was definitely worth it and heres why

the game has an amazing portrayal of mental health and its issues including how emotions have an impact on people that was definitely a difficult topic to make a video game about but the result turned out to be excellent characters had their own personalities who were all moved by one huge event in all of their lives that changed them forever they all had their own way of dealing with those difficult times  some healthier other not really  and it was all portrayed in omori

the lore itself begins slowly planting curiosity in players heart when we finally realize what has been happening with characters it makes us think about both the game and our lives as everything in the game can be relatable on a close level  doesnt matter if its about the mental issues of characters or just their daily ordinary struggles 

when it comes to graphics  it gives you an effect of a friendly and relaxing game which is why is lore hits you even harder when you realize it music in omori is amazing and perfectly matched to every situation which is also what made the game even better

fighting system was something i personally enjoyed a lot to win a battle defeat a boss or just a regular monster you had to focus and pay attention and most importantly  actually use all the knowledge youve already had

in the end omori is one of the greatest game ive ever played im willing to continue my adventure with it as there are many secrets and routes i havent discovered yet playing it will always be worth it for me personally wish you all the best
