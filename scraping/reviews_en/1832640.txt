under the pretext of a full refund the game directs users to use the development teams own thirdparty website for refunds which requires players to provide relevant receipts and also requires players to fill in their steam account password and alipay account  filling in their the reason for this is to obtain the players purchase information through the steam interface
the receipt already proves that the player has actually purchased the game in question and checking whether the game exists in the players library does not require a password only that the player provides an account and does not hide their library information at the same time the development team could have communicated with steam and asked for a refund therefore it can be concluded that the game development team is suspected of collecting sensitive information from players

please let others know
because project x has gotten such bad reviews after basically scamming people into buying a game that turned out different than originally advertised these scumbags have changed the name of project z to novastella island published by nova studio
also for those who dont know why the game has gotten such bad reviews
1 the game was originally advertised to be 18 game
2 the studio suddenly changed the course of the game to be a nonadult content game
3 the ones who purchased the game demanded a refund only to hear that refund will be done only through alipay or paypal

警惕赛博骗局aaaa


to engligh users

dont buy it
the negative reviews are not just complaining about noh scenes

it is like ruining our gamers trust and the expectation of this project

if you dont know imirror 1i i can tell you

mirror 1 which is an ur18u match 3 game is a boom few years ago

and imirror 2 project xi seems like a bcontinuationb of mirror 1 and when imirror 2i ea released it did contain some u r179 uscene at that time it was consuming the imirror 1is public praise and get so many money

then bafter 1 yearb of the ea released the game developer announced that this game wont contain any r18

why dont they just announce this thing right at the ea released

and it will be good if gamers can just get the refund easily but the website of refund bcollects your private message such as phone number home address etcb 

then the negative booms
dont buy it it is literally a shell game

mirror 1 is a really nice game with lots of 18 contents therefore fans of mirror 1 including me bought mirror 2 in feb without hesitation back at that time the game only had one chapter and we thought that we should give the developers some extra time so that they can add 18 contents later and what do we get a late announcement that this game is 16 released in sept  its definitely a fraud
whats worse they offered a website for players to to gave a refund yet this website requires an vpn to browse in china while personal use of vpn is illegal in china but it is developed by a chinese company yet thats not all this website has an extreme terms for players to refund such as requiring the receipt steam accountto log in the alipay account phone number etc so why dont they just give refunds through steam and there seems no guarantee of the safety of personal information
just dont buy it dont give these toxic behaviors any chance to thrive again

我考虑了很久还是决定给出差评
i thought long and hard about it and decided to give a bad review

让我们把话说清诚然作为6块钱小游戏mirror 2 project x已经做到了物超所值在我看来单拎出建模和cg值至少两倍的定价
lets get this straight admittedly for a little 1 game mirror 2 project x has done an excellent job of getting value for money in my opinion the modeling and cg alone are worth at least twice the pricing

但问题是我是冲着色色买的我对三消不感兴趣倘若只是美少女三消那么即使是6块的低价即使是这样精美的制作我也一定不会买
however the thing is i was paying my money for the adult contents not the match3 little game if it was merely beautiful anime girl  match3 then even at the low price of 1 with such a beautiful production i definitely would not have bought it in the first place

色色才是驱动我进行消费的原动力此时将原动力掐断性质就变了怪在我头上就变成了我冲动消费了花了不必要的钱被营销了怪在制作组头上就是欺诈此处制作组的动机不重要因为其欺诈的行为带来了欺诈的结果
the adult contents is what drives me to purchase when the driving force is cut off at this point the nature of the matter changes blame it on me and it becomes a case of me being marketed and spending unnecessary money on impulse blame it on the developer and it is fraud the intention of the producer is not so important here as their fraudulent behaviour resulted in fraudulent consequence

我不理解制作组为何如此我很伤心看在性价比高的份上款我不退了但你们要是敢再欺骗我一次我将不再为你们的游戏多花任何一分钱
i do not understand why the developer is doing this i am very sad because of it i am not refunding the game because of the value for money but if you dare cheat me once more i will not spend one more penny on your game 

多说不宜希望制作组好自为之
à bon entendeur salut

h1show bobs and veganah1

bon a serious note i expected this whole game to be like that because the first game was all about shagging girls this game isnt like the first one not at all am i dissapointed nopeb
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3zzxoai_gtc
what i meant with this there are no doki doki scenes and you are not doing doki doki with the girls the gameplay is still the same tho it is a bejeweled clone you match 3 gems together and activate their effects you can either heal yourself attack magicmelee or regenerate mana to use special abilities when you finish a level you get money which you can use to buy stronger abilities or level up your character 

like i said still the same as the old one in these regards

what really blew me away tho was the fact that the storytelling has become so much better the story for each girl feels shorter but there are more than only 2 endings for each unlike the first one replayability is given each story arcs are as heartbreaking and enjoyable as you might know from the first game rollercoaster of emotions the graphics 3dg is also really impressive even the expressions are on point

another reason to get into this might be the home mode it is a small island you can walk around with your favourite girl dress her as you like and do photos the photo mode is impressive and has lots of options you can even make your own poses there is even mod support to add custom 3d models so dont forget to check out the workshop
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2825774065
codeall in all this game is really nice and totally worth the price it is still not completed and far from it they add things with regular updates but it will take some time to get to the final release so far there are only 3 girls there also might be a r18 patch someday but who knows i can assure that the game is already worth the asked pricecode

#####

plz buy game to support seggs content

#####

cheaper than real women 1010

#####

this review is very late but maybe i can change a few minds and maybe give a minuscule of hope to any of the devs 
tldr please just give the game a chance

this game is very well done the graphics and animation are amazing and there is voice acting as well stories are fascinating each girl has their own story and world to learn about as you clear each match 3 level 

why all the negative reviews then
well the first mirror game contained a lot of 18 content  scenes or any nudity for that matter are nowhere to be seen in the sequel and naturally people are confused and frustrated as to why they did this i remember in the very early stages of development like the first chapter wasnt even done this game had nsfw stuff though it was a very long time ago hopefully my memory is right im not entirely sure why either but another review said that the new publisher they are with would not allow the game to have 18 content they certainly did switch publishers but not sure how true the rest is as i dont have any source due to this misunderstanding they offered refunds through their own site they quickly made which many people found sketchy and people started calling it a scam which wasnt true at all 

so whos to blame here
well i think both sides messed up in a way the developers honestly should have just used a different name imagine buying a game called uno 2 but it turns out its not a card game its a fps yes mirror 2 is still a match3 game but they know dam well thats not the main reason people bought the first game
the gamers buying the game are to blame as well though this game did not include the adult warning tag that every nsfw game on steam has so it does have a clear indication that theres no adult content 

i think people bmassivelyb overreacted to this whole thing though the game is by no means bad in fact i think its actually incredibly good and definitely worth the measly 2 it asks for but because it doesnt have nsfw content people demand refunds and are reviewbombing it 
first off if youre willing to spend money on an nsfw game you almost positively have money to spend and 2 is like nothing to you
second off an initial review bomb is understandable but why is it ustillu getting mass negative reviews the people who left negative reviews in the past several months either dont look at the store page at all or just want to hop on the hate train for funsies

i was honestly shocked and a bit saddened when i heard the dev company went bankrupt if this happened to ea or ubisoft id be cheering but a small indie company nah you guys are f up the company 100 could have made more nsfw games after this or hell they maybe could have made a nsfw patch for this game after they completed it now the chances of them making a comeback are slim and would probably take years if they could 

feel free to comment if im missing vital information or something is incorrect

#####

its funny in their new dev update they try to relate themselves to triple aaa developers or at least aspire towards that yet this is a damn connect 3 game no one is playing a connect 3 game for the game we all know why we are here just make the game we are asking for not some call of duty modern warfare meets connect 3

no hentai on my hentai game

#####

pls add sex 

#####

𝐀𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞

this game is the fruit of fraud and theft the developers raised money to create it under the pretext of continuing the famous hentai game and later said that there would be no hentai in mirror 2 which means that they simply stole all the money collected and what they left was enough only to create this boring squalor more like an extremely strippeddown demo version with no plot
and if you want to get your money back then you need to fuck on their website properly and at the same time provide them with your personal data including the password from your steam account but since the price of mirror 2 is small few principled people will bother to get their own back  its easier to give up and wish the thievesdevelopers to be punished fairly

𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭

do not buy this garbage do not sponsor thieves and scammers its better to spend money on hell girls story of eve  a heros study hentai crush or any of the games in the seek girl series or on games from peach beach gspot master how to punish a witch and regals panic theres a decent style and decent hentai

bcheap enough to make you inoti regret your decisionb

at the moment it is very ibarei like textures loading up in front of you but it was warned that it is early access on the front page so theres that to account for after all

gameplay is just about the same as the last mirror with a u3d reskinu nothing super impressive really

main focal point of this whole review and the reason that we all purchased is for bseggsb

h1there is no seeeeggs iyetih1

for now we wait i have a good feeling that this game will be great

edit forward progress additions of new mode and story are nice and you can look under skirts in new mode very nice

shut up women im trying to solve the puzzle

#####

update on review 9302022 devs just posted an announcement confirming this game will not have 18 content they offer a refund but said refund requires you to log your steam account into a third party website 

just eat the loss a buck after all and prioritize account safety this whole thing is sketch



despite the fact the first mirror had a ton of hscenes theres zero to be found in mirror 2 its a shame as the 3d could have been a good upgrade

talk is cheap show me the tits

#####

if i wanted to play a good match 3 game i would play candy crush saga this one is just meaningless why you ask well let me answer you
1no nsfw mirror was good because it had good gameplay plus some h stuff but this one has neither of them
2whats even the point this is literally candy crush with a story yeah read that again and tell me how stupid it sounds if this was for mobile i wouldnt complain but it actually needs a decent pc to run

3if i ever need good characters to satisfy me on a deeper level why would i choose this while there are other games with better gameplay im not saying match 3 gameplay is bad but noone is gonna play it to see fully clothed maybe partially clothed girls nudity and nsfw  stuff make us do crazy stuff like play match 3 and actually enjoy it since we know there is a reward at the end but this time its an uninteresting character  with a story i dont even care about

#####

no sex 
buy mirror 1

#####

misleading i understand if the developers wanted to go a different direction but there are probably better ways to go said direction first of which would be not titling this as the sequel to a game without having the main element of the first game

came for tiddies stayed for plot and cute girls i call this an absolute win

a scam is what this game are
while mirror 1 still having 18 contact  everyone loves it  and then mirror 2project x trailer came out so i thought that they were making a new 18 game  however  after a few update later  they just pop back up and said nope  it was a 16 game  and then they also went dark after that  what a scam even selling dlc for the home costumes for more money

the weird thing is that they did try to add r18 on the game the free costumes dlc  and then they just said they were making it 16 game after that

#####

only the first chapters is unlocked 1 for 30 mins gameplay
i give the positive review for the music

please add sex to the game please

#####

      its all about the story 






























#####

mirror 2 project x is the sequel to the truly excellent mirror the latter had charm wit fun gameplay and of utmost importance bouncy boobs guess what mirror 2 does not have right i dont blame the developer for this although they never mention why they cut out the nubile nummies a bit of googling paints the picture mirror was published by a japanese company and those guys let just about anything go mirror 2 was published by a chinese company those guyswellthe commie boot is always on their throats so no juicy jubblies for you being that that the milky mammies is the whole point of the game  the carrot for succeeding at those matching puzzle games  without them the game is boring pointless and not what was reasonably expected after the first game featured fantastic funbags

#####

took too long to announce that it is not an r18 game

#####

they launched this game off the back of a very popular adult game and slighted their entire fanbase by not disclosing until significantly later that they were not going to include the adult content their previous titles success was defined by what instead happened was a subpar and boring game with the deliberate exclusion of the main thing the previous title was known for its really no wonder things turned out this way

#####

seggs when


#####

boobs

#####

these devs are the scum of the earth as far as im concerned they have segued not once but twice on content while adding dlc to an early access game that had multiple avenues of monetization including a kickstarter then changed the studio name presumably for legal protection then refused traditional refunds outside of alipay and paypal you have to be a special kind of stupid to trust refunds from paypal these days in my book i do not want to see the next chapter of this saga simply remove this game before it can do any further damage to consumers steam

#####

where booba

#####

yes i play nsfw games

 so what





























#####

ass and not the good kind

#####

h3i backed this game and i was let downh3

i wanted to give this game time to get to the state it was originally suggested it was going to be but thats never going to happen i ubackedu mirror 2 because it was described as a bigger and better mirror 1 with a longer story upgraded graphics more voice acting truly great h scenes etc etc it was meant to be mirror 1 on a bigger budget with all the bells and whistles they could afford then they took the game in a different direction and completely ruined any and all goodwill and support they had with the community

ithis game by any other name might have been a successi the match 3 gameplay isnt bad with some novel ideas and the graphics are decent enough and the animations are fine but they promised an h game and then stabbed their core audience in the back

im saddened to hear that the dev company went bankrupt i would have much rather they stuck it out changed the name of this game and eventually just made the mirror 2 that was promised or even take the blb on this and develop a new game with the promised content either way they werent going to appease all of the people they disappointed but they may have recovered some of their lost reputation over time

as it stands this is an unfinished game with barely an hours worth of content and little to no replayability value dlc for an early access title that doesnt incorporate anything meaningful to the game a lot of which are just colour variations of the same items so no bi cant recommend this gameb as it is and it will never be completed to a standard that will change that 

all thats left is a subpar game a company ruined a potential wasted and a dream unfulfilled

rip mirror 2 and everything you bcouldb have been

#####

dudenot cool 

#####

no seggs no fun


#####

okay so im waiting for the second mirror game for a year or two now i was so hyped when i saw it on steam and its beta state bcs we can test it before going live i have high hopes for it and i can see the potential in it the two lil stories are cliché but enjoyable i liked them but one question where the fck is my usual mirror content that ive been looking for   18 patch when 

#####

this is all just really sad we have all been deceived and disappointed but does the studio deserve to go bankrupt over this no 

really everything here aside from the gameplay is top notch the models are very detailed and beautiful the same goes for the environment there is love and work put into this the future looked really bright for the studio they should have been upfront about their decision on adult content or simply detached themselves from the mirror franchise with this but whats done is done now

they have done everything in their power to allow refunds for everyone which is quite the generosity but even this attempt has been met with hate and misinformation they took a lot more shit than they deserve hopefully they will have a chance to return someday but that seems very unlikely 

how can one grow from their mistakes if they never get the chance to do so

#####

 really nice fully voiced 3d vn review bombed into the ground so hard the dev refunded everything and declared bankruptcy im really sad things turned out like this

#####

still waiting for the sex update

#####

its a match 3 game with a story 
my first challenge was to switch to the english language globe symbol in the settings
its in early access and looks very promising
at the actual low price 1 you dont risk anything

#####

first of all i like the first game and the adult content mirror 2 gets announced with 3d characters and i expected it have adult content after the game became purchasable i immediately bought the game expecting it to be similar to the first game but it was early access so i gave it time after many months it did not uphold my expectation i wanted to refund it but i do not trust their thirdparty websites refund page as to why they decided to use thirdparty website for refund most likely they are collecting information about you

this game is a fraud and the devs destroyed their own reputation

#####

we actually played baseball inside the bedroom

#####

sex isnt added in yet

with the elephant out of the room i think this game is certainly a game mirror 2 is certainly trying to pull a fate here but whether it works on you or not  thats on you as it stands the game has a lot of potential the flowchart system could be used in many ways corruption blackmail ntr deviancy or other forms of sexual whatnots could be explored easily via the flowchart system you could plant the seed early and see that pay off on the bottom of the flowchart  

do wait for the porn update to drop tho if youre just here to jerk yer gerkin

#####

imagine a game company that went bankrupt because the devs would not show bare chests and crotches

well folks thats exactly what happened here rip mirror 2 project x you will be missed

#####

lol dlcs already with an unfinished early access game do not buy do not buy

#####

looks fantastic for early access even though its quite different from the previous game in terms of well lack of nsfw content 
however one thing i should point out is that the game will absolutely melt you pc as its poorly optimized in its current state hopefully the developers will address this

#####

no sex

#####

run now 
dont ever come back 
dont even think of buying this game
i am serious
if you really really really want to try it out just pirate it though i would say pirating this game is a waste of time and your free wifi or data
the explanation the developers are just bunch of scammers now at first their first game is indeed what you think a r18 game and when they first put this second game up for sale they advertised it as a r18 game too however just a few update bam they said this game will be r16 game and when the players questioned them about it they say something like oh we are going to make a great game or something like that and went silent and as for now the updates are not bringing them closer to what they promised and the game itself is not even something revolutionary or very great they didnt become better at making their games system and content and they cant even make this game back to being a r18 so it is just a mediocre matching game with some ok looking characters that you cant really interact with and no hopes in becoming better in a foreseeable future and no r18 content

#####

good game no hentai content 

#####

the women in this game have very large personalities great game

#####

with my gt 710 i love to watch these cute anime girls moving in 15 fps

#####

i was hoping for some fun when i got this game but what i was an emotional roller coaster from the story and waiting on more at the time of righting this buying everything game and the dlc cost less the 6 the developer and publisher are underselling this its priced like shovelwear but is made like it wants to be a triple a game

to the developer publisher and everyone else involved making mirror 2 project x
thank you all for the work you have put into this so far you could have just made a halfassed hentai game with some puzzle elements but you wanted to give us degen some substance with your game even if you dont add the 18 elements to this i would still have a satisfying game to play thank you again for all the hard work put in so far

#####

just get part 1

#####

no r18 no success

scam project f guess what f stands for

the problem is not that it does not worth the price it does the problem is  the game is miles away from what was promised and dont listen those few positive trolls who try to shugarcoat the situation or shame you it is not about 1 it is about 1 b stolen b  on top of that they are selling bunch of dlcs for this game and they already raised more than million  with such false marketing 

really why stealing a million from a bank when you can steal few bucks from million people instead thats exactly what they did and now they are cynically offering refunds via shady site which will endanger your accounts security thus if youve already bought it  do not refund it 1 does not worth the risk but also do not stand aside doing nothing spread a good word about this developer as well overall avoid this game this ip and this developer

#####

avoid this developer turned back on their fans

#####
















#####

this game is insanely high effort for what ive paid for it
its a nice little game for a single euro everything about it screams high quality it just doesnt have much content yet even if this game would never get 18 content id still play it cause the animation gameplay and story are superb for its pricing

cant wait to see what the future holds

#####




































#####

this game feels like its gone through or is currently going through an identity crisis on the one hand it feels like it wants to be a faithful sequel to mirror on the other it feels like it wants to move away from it which ends up creating a product that satisfies no one fans of the original feel cheated and lied toand they re not wrong because up until september 30th the developers were completely fine with letting people think it was the true 18 sequel mirror fans had been waiting for new players who pick this up will probably be confused as to why this visual novel wastes their time with match three game play to continue the the story
      so all i can say is this the developers should probably decide what it is they want to be do they want to be h game makers tied to the legacy and expectations of the original mirror or do they want to try other things im down for either they just have to actually make that decision commit and be honest with their customers moving forward
        that being said i would like to congratulate the devs for making a genuinely good looking game if they had just cut out the match three stuffalso if the had been more honest with their consumers i could easily recommend this game as one of the best looking visual novels on steam

#####

no tits

#####

no boobs

#####

best 1 i ever spent

#####

just buy mirror 1

#####

i really tried to enjoy this game besides all the scam thingy everyonr yelling about

lets be honest game is pretty cheap in steam games with hentai stuff for the same price offer you puzzles in most cases
this one beign a child of mirror 1 does not include sexual content and instead offers just interactive stories with 3 in a row segments and minor storylines choices

i will describe the game based on these factors

so as the 3 in a row game it is good has some strategy build into it not as much as in mirror 1 this one caught me with gameplay rather than porn

as interactive story i cant say it is good strange i will say things just hapen cuz they hapen any sort of dissagreament leads to fighting with woman opponent everyday stuff i guess

what i found really cringy is that devs said that it was not intended to make zorgen hapen in game but i can clearly see some moments that it was intended at the begining like constant moans in close interactions and really open costumes
which just make no sense otherwise click the mouse in the right place like it was in the mirror 1 snu snu moments paid bikini dlcs

if i could i would rate this game grey like middle but this is not possible

game have some issues but its not awfull at all


#####


















#####

its a fun matching game but its not like the first one with the p0rn theres none in this one but it is still in early access im unsure if there will be nudity in the future but for now there is none sad face

h1early access review feb 2021h1
the match3 part is what i will call traditional style if you have played bejewelled candy crush or the old puzzle quest games then you will feel right at home although making a line based match4 or match5 doesnt clear the whole line your primary focus in this part of the game will be creating radiant gems via match5 lines l or t shape although counted as a match are not treated the same as a match5 line and without the whole line clearing this is actually a lot harder to do

in other parts of the game theres qtes quick time events as well they seem out of place because the match3 games are completely turn based with no time restraints at all whereas the qtes are purely action reflex based within a number of seconds i was able to get through them but i know a lot of people would struggle or they may even be game ruining for them

apart from that its about 50 a visual novel but the story and how it plays out is quite intriguing its not your usual start to end story its heavily based on replaying it over and over making different choices etc in fact the game even has a built in story path tree so you can plan where and when to make different choices to go down a different path for a different ending

with ingame resources you can purchase upgrades for your characters skills purchase better equipment and also purchase single use consumables to aid in the match3 events

visually this game was a surprise the amount of attention to detail is awesome even the match3 game board is stunning the story was also quite interesting to me with twists that come out of nowhere it had me hooked to make me want to see how all the different endings played out

the content here is quite small though it really does feel like a prologue i was hoping there would have been more to it but will see what the future brings theres no nudity in the game there is a free dlc that adds adult themes but not nudity

low on quantity but high on quality a taste test of what the full game might offer for 1 or 2 you get 1 or 2 hours of story to play through

h1update nov 2022h1
not really an update just had to do this for a steam event badge

#####

you probably want to buy this game because you think youll see anime tits fucking cumming lewd nasty hentai like the first game but ive got bad news for you brother this one has none of that

#####

this is quite sad it dosnt have sex or tittys like the first game 
but i dont think they deserve the hate and the bankrupcy

#####

bialexander the greati was right in the end when its over all that matters is what youve doneb

#####

i bought it on may and now looking at reviews steam should implement a kind of system to prevent these kind of developers from collecting such private information about players because they could have access to your steam account

#####

what a scam dont buy this game the developed lied about this being an r18 game in a post a half year later  forget these guys

#####

context
i bought this a long time ago and decided to just let it cook while the devs worked on it i was surprised to come back and see it  had overwhelmingly negative reviews and that the development company apparently went bankrupt a lot of people called it a scam and so i figured id give it a look after so long and see what the fuss was all about

this review is from a brief look into just one chapter of the campaign since i wanted to see what made it a scam
review
this game is  a match3 battler where you attack heal get mana and overall try to match 3 to win in each match you can buy upgrades between chapters and overall its just good fun the presentation is pretty to look at the gameplay is solid the story while brief was nice to run through with multiple endings depending on the choices made throughout the game encouraging replayability
overall yes you are getting more than 2 bucks worth of value out of it

edit it also has a pretty good slay the spire inspired challenge mode

controversy
so why all the negative reviews if the game is just 2 bucks and is fun on its own as far as i can tell there are 2 reasons
reason 1 a sequel to an adult game which drops the adult only stuff
this is just a dumb complaint the game does not have an ao tag a lot of people are pissy about the 2 dollar stupidtax they had to pay for not connecting the dots thats on them some people might argue that they could reasonably expect a sequel to an ao game to have ao content but the tag isnt there everything else is a dumb excuse
reason 2 shady company practices
idk what to think about this refunds on a 3rd party site some claims about giveaways that might have been fake claims that the company is collecting and selling player information which theyve outright denied making it a he said she said kind of deal it does seem like someone handling the company wears a dunce cap on the regular if theyve gone bankrupt and itd be interesting to hear the story from a developers point of view and not just someone on the forum whose source is trust me bro i was totally on the dev team
as it stands we have the final post from the devs and if nothing else they admit to being stupid take from that what you will but my understanding is that most of the controversy and hate comes from people wanting an ao game and throwing a collective tantrum when they didnt get it

overall
for 2 bucks yeah get it im enjoying it so far and will continue to play some more i hope the devs land on their feet and continue with a different project under a different name with similar concepts the game is fun the aesthetic is good for 2 bucks this is a steal

#####

  this game is the sequel of mirror which is a 18 gameand the development group never deny mirror2 will be a 18 game at early development ageuntil now they suddenly announce  players misunderstoodmirror2 is only a 16 game  and use unofficial website to refund
  the game uses the full refund as an excuse to direct users to use the thirdparty website to makes a refund and that thirdparty website asks to provides relevant receipts and players are required to fill out the steam account password code and alipay account  fill in the reason is through the steam interface to obtain the players purchase information
the receipt can already prove that the player really purchased mirror2 checking if the game exists in the players library is also not necessary for passwords only players need to provide accounts and do not hide their library
  at the same time the development team can fully use the steam official ways of communication asking steam officials to provide refunds for players therefore it can be determined that the game development team is suspected of taking advantage of the opportunity to collect sensitive information from players

#####

its debatable in certain areas its great but in others its a nosedive

let me just get one thing straight as of april 28th the game is still in early access and still will be for months maybe even the next year and it b does not have any hcontent b this means exactly what you think no birds and the bees the closest you get is spending time with the girls which is just screwing about with them but not actually well screwing them

that alone will probably turn you away and i completely understand as its doing the same with me i bought mirror 1 because of very obvious reasons and it was an enjoyable match3 puzzle game with rpg elements while this game is basically the same as the first but with 3d elements it doesnt have the stuff that youre there for

now dont get me wrong the game itself is pretty well made other than the obvious bugs and glitches and weird stuttering along with the heavy usage of cpu and gpu which is a tad worrying but as its in early access you have to look past that the game has full on cutscenes and choices with different endings and it seems wellmade for what it is especially for the price

all in all if youre looking for a very simple and currently barebones puzzle game id skip as the devs are extremely untrustworthy but for anyone like me clearly wanting the hcontent youre sht outta luck go find something else

edit strikeafter talking with someone in the comments of this review its come to my attention that the games hcontent does actually exist and might come in the future most likely at its full release but until then im keeping this review negative as the hcontent is still the big factor in why i dont recommend it for people like myselfstrike

edit 2 so that was a fcking lie screw these devs do not buy this game even if its 2 bucks its not even worth that especially considering weve been lied to lol

#####

imagine being salty over a 2 game and then try to get your 2 back then complain when the devs use a service you dont like youre all broke and i hope the girls in the hentai games you play dont even want you

#####

honestly understand the fan backlash big shame the devs are no longer a company though the game is a simple match game all the r18 content is missing from this game and i mean that in a sense that all the ecchi content and innuendos seem to have a place holder in them for r18 content while the first game is truly amazing this one isnt toooo far off from being a good game the art style and mini stories are really good completing certain paths unlock nice wallpapers there is a mini challenge mode within the game the missing r18 content doesnt bother me too much while i enjoyed teh game it is a shame its canceled and short its cheap provides some hours of fun provided you dont skip the story low challenge in the match games and only really had slight trouble on caiyuns route

#####

game development ended because of bankruptcy

#####

has nothing to do with the original mirror just leeching off the name for sales played all the possible dialogues and endings for now and none of them were worth it

at the moment only one of the characters is available and the whole story is quite bad gameplaywise its just a boring visual novel with some candy crush action here and there

#####

four months passed and the refund is still not being processed a total scam

#####

no segs

no segs

#####

i loved mirror 1
i like this game
but it just dont feel the same
its such a shame it could have been a good game
all the fake promises are the fuel of my tears  im in pain

for everyone that dont get the negativ reviews this game was kinda a scam cause they collected money over other plattforms promoting this game as the same nsfw game like mirror after people wanted they money back they also scammed those people

its a good game just a mod or a patch is missing to fix this

#####

they made a sequel to a effin pon game
mirror 2 electric boogaloo

#####

3match gameplay 3d anime graphic jp voice acting only 05 on sale what a steal
joke aside launcher ux is bad chinese is default language no detailed graphic setting
use mirror title but without seg straight bad
devs abandoned the game thats kind of sad
that is it keep your money

#####

backed the kickstarter with high hopes and was not disappointed 3d animtaions are great story feels fluid and characters look great feels like the original

#####

dishonest about the 18
disappointing to say the least 
mirror 1 was better by far 
this is not review bombing this is honest reviews from actual people 
5 stars

#####

wheres the porn

#####

dont buy this game maker is liar

#####

you think im matching jewels just to listen to these anime bimbos tell me their problems wheres the bangin

#####

its pretty fun hope they release 18 patch in the future

#####

nice scam

#####

in the moment of writing this review the game is very short there is only 1 finished chapter from like 6 locked but things that ive seen so far are extremely good gameplay and full animations voice acting for both girls hell even last thing i expected from this to have engaging story and choices it has that too

its hard to believe that the same people made the previous game from the 1 hentai game into 1 breathtaking gem looking forward to full release like no way in hell i am missing this

#####

i thought it was weird they were playing baseball inside of a lab

i am too innocent for this world

#####

i miss her so much

#####

this game was good it had good stories it was cheap they kept releasing despite the hate now theyre bankrupt i hope this is remembered as a studio that was betrayed by their players rather than the other way round

#####

well i would say its a good game

graphics is good gameplay and story is fine
i do understand why people upset about nsfw 18 stuff as i am also upset about it but nonetheless it is a good game at least game dev studio shoudnt go bancrupt just because of this
not to mention  they actually planned to add nsfw stuff but publisher rejected it

overall  decent match 3 game with no ingame purchases hello ea
for 2  its a steal

edit just finished vampire story thats the reason why i bought the game the ivy chapter is sooo good 
for this price  it is really a steal of a deal 

#####

ngl succ story was nice still wait for boobas

#####

boobs


#####

this was so much more than just a small game with so much talent time and effort put into it if you want to follow a story play a match game enjoy some art walk around and enjoy the 3d environment and more just give it a shot no this game isnt 18 plus but that wasnt the reason for me to get it in the first place 

ive had a fun experience just taking it all in and enjoy all the things the game had to offer hope maybe one day we can even walk around in vr or for the game to be finished in itself all together best wished to the developers

#####

i might need my dollar back

why you might buy this game
list
youre into match 3 games no matter what the theme
youre looking for an easy 100 achievement
youre compelled to buy any game with a cat girl in it
youre into anime girls changing out costumes and taking photos the home mode is for you
you mistakenly thought all of those overwhelming positive reviews were real
list

#####

early access review

even though it is a one character for the time being it is pretty good considering how the budget allotted for this game though there are still some bugs here and there but as an early access title its pretty polished  but theres one thing missing the sex where is thy sex mirror 1 has the sex but where is the sex here but it is le fine

dlc review
cg is pretty darn good id say its even better than the first one
cosplayer is pretty good the costumes are pog and keep up the good work dddd
i dont really care much for the emoji and ringtone but good bonuses otherwise

conclusion
overall its a pretty strong start and hopefully its stays that way until early access ends and cant wait for more

#####

honestly even without the hentai it would a pretty solid game 
now i am still disappointing my parents and it would probably be worse since i say im playing it for the story but the game creator has done a good job writing and always has 
in all aspects this game is an upgrade from the last 
good or bad ends are no longer influenced by the way you touch them in those scenes but is tied into the story
solid voice acting and soundtrack
characters no longer seem like just a moving image thanks to the 3d and physics upgrade
the game in its current state is worth the price and when its finished the dev has no plans on increasing the price 
not sure if it was a mistake or not but i got all dlc except for the songs one with only purchasing the game

so yes dad i am winning but the cost of any respect you may have had for me

update changed review to negative because dev changed the rating of the game middevelopment

#####

how the fuck you want me to fill my steam account on third party website  and want me to fill my password in pretext to obtain the players purchase information through the steam interface no you dont need my account password no you dont need my phone number my steam receipt should be good enough as proof that im buying your game 

just communicate with steam ffs

#####

0 adult content keep your money thank me later 
史上最騙錢黃油 別浪費錢了

#####

watching the trailer for this game on the store page i realize theres pretty much none of that content in the game as of yet  its currently just two characters was just one character when i bought it and theyre adding to it as time goes by   the base game is very cheap and the dlc theyre currently selling is not needed to enjoy the game  you might want to buy the dlc anyway as a means to support the developers who are still working on this game though

so for those who dont know maybe you didnt play the original game this is basically a story with some match3 battle modes in it  if you played the first game you know what to expect but so far the content is much tamer as far as sex is concerned im ok with that  theres still pretty much the same system as the first game a physical attack a magic attack a heal for yourself and some matches increase your power to allow you to use special tools to do additional damage or heals 

this time the story branches out due to choices you make as you play and the challenges may be different depending on those choices  of course youll want to go back and experience all branches of the story and it doesnt take long to go back through and play another game till you can make the other choice you didnt take the animation and voice acting is pretty good and in some cases you have a minute or two of watching the cutscene before you can even play  they are skippable if all you want is to match some symbols and get points but you should probably watch them at least once so you have an idea of whats going on

so far the challenge is pretty light  maybe itll get more difficult later but from my experience so far its been fairly easy though there is a challenge mode now where you take on some random enemies and that is harder  if all you care is to find out more about the story then the difficulty probably suits you fine  if youre looking for a serious challenge or lots of fun then maybe you will want to wait for the games full release at which time ill revisit this review and edit it if i remember 

the graphics are actually pretty good the story could be a bit more fleshed out but its somewhat interesting  i think some of the writing suffers from the developers having to think of how to fit in another combat session in some of the story bits  maybe they can rework the story a bit later

overall id say that for 2 or less on sale its worth that much at least im still looking forward to the rest of the game being finished but im glad theyre not trying to release it all at once and instead are just adding more levels to it as they go along   if the idea of buying an unfinished game bothers you then wait  otherwise the price isnt so much that youre being ripped off  theres at least 2 worth of content in it now and itll only get better as they add to it


#####

seggs steamhappy

#####

hentai plz 

#####

the developers of mirror 2 kagami ⅱ works sakuragame have now fully stated they have stopped development of this game until further notice what baffles me is why couldnt you dumb devs just release the content people have been screaming for instead of pulling the oh hey were sorry we screwed up so bad that we chickend out and went broke smoge and to the crazies that went after theses guys irl  was that really needed to get a point across 

#####

devs forgot that this is a sequel to a game and not a new ip

#####

not what i expected no good updates mirror 1 is a lot better

#####

the content that is here is good the game really showed great promise while it lasted
a damn shame about the devs

yes it is very much worth experiencing while you can if you loved mirror 1

#####

not a sequel just a new game

#####

mirror 2 with no sex content this is a bad joke

#####

cant believe people really ruined a promising game and company over some nudity yall are insane this game showed so much promise without nudity the music is relaxing the models and emotions are better than most triple a anime games on the market you could see the love and dedication the team had for this game and now its dead i hope that one day it somehow rises from the grave so sad to see people as soulless as this community

#####

i didnt know it was a sequel to a porn game so i came in with no expectations
so without that knowledge its actually a fun and good match 3 game

#####

they said we would see tits
but tits we never saw

#####

do not buy no nsfw found unlike first one

#####

scammer studio changed the game then changed their name

#####

i dunno i played it because some rando on discord i was in a vc with gifted it to me
for me personally the game play seemed fine i think ill just get a real girlfriend instead

#####

scammer developer

#####

be aware ladsno booba were harmed in this game

#####

its got some good stories its basically bejewled but with waifus and some skills you could use to make the game easier its also got animated cutscenes which are nice to watch if you aret too into bejewled type games but wanna give it a look try here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvw1i_go8fu3mlistplkajc8xnkb1gjzyvtsxjvfjrfasqjxbnppgaqb im not 100 sure what they did thats got people mad at them but i do look forward to when they can continue working on this game

#####

i dont want to be horny anymore i just want to be happy but the game give me both no horny because no nsfw content and no happy because no nsfw content

#####

the game has stopped in development the developers are bankrupted as theyve claimed do not buy the game i repeat do not buy it 

if you wanna know what was the drama there go to the forum

#####

cringe no sex

#####

leah honey

#####

if you come here because of mirror 1 dont buy this game
 this is not about have r18 or  etc its about dev dont keep their word and breaking their own promise if they didnt said that at first no one gonna get angry

#####

i fucking loved the first mirror game but this is just disappointing

i still highly recommend the first mirror game it is very interactive and the lore is extremely deep after playing and getting the good endings you look at the happy and somewhat nostalgic pictures and you would feel your heart tremble 
first game easily 1210 wonderful writing exquisite dlcs but the cosplay ones are slightly overpriced for no nsfw and overall amazing experience

this game although i had high hopes i was disappointed it just feels like a strict board game with not much freedom even though there isnt nsfw the requirements for this game is extremely high you need to get a quite decent computer for this to run nicely with good graphics yet it still runs poorly second it isnt what the first mirror game players would expect as everyone knows sex sells this is like if riley reid suddenly started making anti abortion fundraisers finally and the most important thing is that yesterday the developers sent a message talking about a full refund and many other reviews also explained that the website makes you fill in your steam login information and payment information under the reason contacting steam for refund which could be done simply within steam this just made me mad because i felt sorry for the small dev team that they have who worked hard on this but this news just made me turn my feelings to disgust


tldr first game is great second game kinda ass developers tries to scam people

mirror 2 just a casual connect 3

#####

english

this review gonna be painful but i feel like i need to do it

i can not recommend this game at the moment even the game is amazing to be honest because i feel like is betraying the essence of the original one

to me mirror was a game about matching 3 but with the goal of advancing a relationship with a cute character and have some intimate time with them but this one should called mirror 2 blueball project because you are interacting with some beautiful and sexy character but they just blue ball you and at the moment there is no way of having intimate time with any of them not even nudes at the moment which is so dissapointing considering the first mirror had all of that

so yeah i really hope the developers add some r18 patch because if they do it this game will be simply perfect i will change my review if they add it

spanish 

me duele mucho hacer este analisis porque el juego es una pasada

pero desgraciadamente no puedo recomendar el juego en su estado actual porque me da la impresion de que traiciona el espiritu y la esencia del juego original el primer mirror

que era hacer un conecta3 pero con la motivacion de avanzar la relacion y la historia de varios personajes con los que puedes tener luego momentos intimos pero en este juego lo unico que hacen es ponerte los dientes largos con personajes superatractivos para luego dejarte con las ganas porque en este juego ni siquiera hay desnudos cuando en el juego anterior ademas de desnudos tambien habia sexo

para mi ha sido un evidente paso para atras y ademas una oportunidad perdida para hacer un juego del genero absolutamente perfecto ya que el juego tiene muchisima calidad

espero que los desarrolladores implementes un parche 18 con el paso del tiempo cambiare mi reseña en caso de que lo hagan pero de momento reitero que en mi opinion no lo recomiendo

#####

you get a great value for just 2 fully animated story cutscenes that you can tell a lot of work was put into right now there is only 1 small campaign to play through but that alone has 4 different endings

where are the spread legs lusty boobs open pussies
what the grief is this after mirror 1
but really

#####

this game became candy crush without sex feature the version

#####

i never played mirror 1 so idc about any lack of pornographic content in this game i absolutely love this game for the gameplay and cute characters it does suck for a lot of the folks who bought this game expecting 18 content to only learn a couple years later it wont have it still its only 3 bucks at most and seems to go on sale often its really not much of a loss in my eyes especially if you just enjoy this genre of games puzzlers like bejeweled and candy crush i like the devs as well and am really excited for project z overall id still recommend this game especially if youve never played the first mirror

#####

do not refund they will take your information and use it for their chinese market scheme

we all know why we bought this game and they continued to lie and withhold information from us they than proceeded to claim cdprojectred is an amazing company and that is the path they wish to take congratulations you guys have taken the right path into being a misleading distrusting and downright lying corporation just like cdpr

#####

the game is still under development and has many to improve yet looking very promising no h contents not even the censored ones yet but i would love to support the dev

#####

even in early access with only 1 story line this game is well worth the low price 

high quality models and animated cut scenes voice acting interesting story line well balance game play

currently there is no nudity hopefully there will be a patch in the future


#####

if youre expecting this to be like mirror youll be disappointed

#####

pretty sure 9999 of the buyer expected h game but it seem like there will be no adult content for this game most misleading game ever considering what the first game is famously know for

not me though i just want to play some match three

#####



#####

after an hour playing this game that i have been intrigued on the choice the first chapter delivers as the fun small activities to the pleasurable 3 piece puzzle game that has me electrified throughout leahs story that drives me to further be attach to the characters as well as the charming appeal of the the artwork and style that brings a lovable set of colours that make this game a sensation of a game dont forget the dlc that delivers the beauty of the extra content in it even when it from a small emoji pack or the cosplay photo album still allows any players to enjoy this moment to realise you come back to reality to find out that you only came for the fictional boobas anime waifu what i can truly say is that this is the best gift to give on valentines day when you single and should recommend this to anyone if you want a waifu the story or just wanna challenge the puzzle that is presented in the game after playing leahs storyline and now want her as my waifu 9510 came for the puzzle but got distracted by the boobs thats all i got to say

edit oh damn bankruptcy oh no anyways lets celebrate

#####

no sex

#####

overwhelmingly bad and not worth it gameplay too tedious storyline uninteresting

this never shouldve been made

#####

i bought the game because of lani
i like short haired girls p 

interesting game but it needs more b00ty and b00bs lol





































edit its a negative review now censorship is bad

#####

i lost my wallet and all my item because this studio use third party page for giveaway and refund do not trust this developer again

#####

an odd little story based bubble popper game where you are a supernatural investigator the story is neat the art style is lovely and the pop game part is rather entertaining

#####

mirror 2 project no tiddies

#####

considering the 3 negative reviews complain the lack of honkers this is 100 positive reviews 


update lack of honkers

#####

tbh was enjoying it but its nothing like the first game and also no nsfw its fully sfw

#####

010 no sex

#####

scam and lier developers  dont buy the game

#####

where segs

#####

why did i pay for this 

the game doesnt even have hentai like in the first one and the studio went bankrupt

a disastrous ending i must say


#####

nice game for kids not for adults

#####

misleading

#####

games ok with story and game play is your average match game but this name got attention from the first as an 18 game and without 18 content i cannot recommend


edit
devs realeased a statement that 18 content will never come within this news they also give the option to refund this scam while comparing themselves to aaa dev lmfao the refund itself is a scam they request your steam login a recipt and an account name for a chinese payment app no ones heard of the makers of this game went from a good 18 company to a complete scam cant reccomend supporting this company in any way

#####

this product tricked and lured buyers by using the name of its previous adult game without notifying buyers that this new product is a 16 game without any adult content the producer did not release this news until a few months after ea was released before that a series of dlcs that are not free were also released it is no different than cheating consumers for money 
besides  the game uses full refund as an excuse to direct users to use the development teams own thirdparty website for refunds which requires players to provide relevant receipts and also requires players to fill in their steam account password and alipay account  filling in their the reason is to get the players purchase information through the steam interface
the receipt already proves that the player really bought the game in question and checking whether the game exists in the players library does not require a password but only that the player provide the account and not hide his library information at the same time the development team can communicate with the steam official and ask the steam official to provide refund service for the player therefore it can be concluded that the game development group has the suspicion of collecting players sensitive information through this opportunity

a good game to pass the time though that has nothing revolutionary the characters are very good and the game is fully realized with fully animated scenes which is very pleasant to see

for the moment the game offers us a story mode with the 3 characters currently available a challenge mode which corresponds to a series of fights and finally a subsidiary mode which allows you to control the characters of the game or the workshop according to your desires

the game is not a musthave for the moment due to its content but considering the frequency of updates and its price do not hesitate to buy it

a fun game with a really good foundation and a promising future

mirror 2 is a match 3 style game with narrative driven visual novel elements in between the game has you play as a government agent working at a top secret research lab where supernatural entities are held among them is a beautiful blond succubus named leah who is the first and currently only story chapter for the game 

the visual novel segments for the game are both fully animated as well as voiced the animation quality is honestly very impressive for the games low price point occasionally you will be able to make decisions during the visual novel segments which can lead to different outcomes which include different match 3 battles and even different endings including bad ones unfortunately there is no way to save before making a choice and a bad ending results in a game over that forces you to restart the entire game this can make finding all the different endings very tedious

as for the match 3 game play it should be familiar to most fans of the genres each tile has a different effect on the game with certain tiles healing you and others dealing damage you also have several skills that both you and your enemy can use throughout the match the match 3 segments are also fully animated and voice acted with honestly some of the best animations ive seen in a match 3 game

as for the games h contentwell there isnt any at the moment this is probably the biggest deal breaker for the game right now especially for fans of the original mirror it is unclear whether h scenes will be added in the future but for now all the game has is slightly fan servicey hangout events where you can spend time with either your research partner or the succubus the hang out is basically an osu style mini game where you click around as the girl talks

overall the game has a really good foundation currently but is extremely early access its without a doubt a fun and well made game and is definitely worth its low price but for those looking for something with h content you might want to wait and see

if youd like to see a closer look at what the game has to offer i have a short video review over on youtube

from what ive seen this was a great improvement over mirror despite perverts who cant get their brains out of their crotches the focus away from porn only enhances the potential for characters and story

good luck with your future works

我是sb

seriously what a dick move

this is a sequel to a really good porn game i got a lot of enjoyment out of the original so it was an instabuy for me when they announced the early access for this game it was so cheap that i also decided to buy almost every single piece of dlc that came out after to support the devs only for them to announce now that it will be a 16 game no porn way to betray the people that made the original and this one such a success guys excellent business move

now they did announce a refund program however it is through a 3rd party website that requires you to log in with your steam credentials now its probably fine apparently this is somehow done through steam and your credentials are not leaked i think protondb does the same but im not savvy enough to know for sure and the money lost is not really worth the risk so i guess ill stick around and see what the 12 stories are about writing is not awful but nothing that great either what i do promise is that im never buying anything else from these devs again unless this becomes what 99 of people bought it for an 18 porn game

im editing this cause i realized what the worst part of this is there are several interactive scenes especially in the first  story that are clearly meant to be sex scenes but have placeholder scenes instead theres a thermometer scene thats obviously meant to be a blowjob a back massage that is obviously meant to be doggy style and a foot massage that is obviously meant to be a footjob seriously you can even see some suspicious stains on the girls clothes appear after the foot massage this being an 18 game was obviously the plan from the start if they had come out and said something like hey our government is cracking down on adult content sorry change of plans i would totally get it and still stand behind the devs but thats not what happened now is it they released a statement implying that 16 was always the plan and arrogantly compared themselves to cdpr or well aspired to be you the devs have demonstrated great talent at making porn games this game was clearly meant to be one too and thats what people are buying your games for you dont need to make the next witcher 3 to be successful game devs you just need to not screw over the fanbase you made hell had you named this something different than mirror 2 and made it clear it wasnt an h game id probably still have bought it again just to be clear either make this game what it was always meant to be dont lie those scenes are clearly supposed to be sex scenes or you are never getting another cent from me and i hope most people you screwed over do the same

with that being said if you dont care about any of the 18 stuff this is actually a lot of content for very little money if you want simple match 3 and cute anime girls if you do actually want great 18 content just buy mirror and its extra content dlc best content is in the dlc imo

#####

no hentai noooooooooooooooooooooooooo

#####

a very disapointing sequel to an otherwise great first entry but the game being fully safe for work along with the gameplay being less fleshed out and overall not being quite as good this game just falls flat the graphics had a fantastic upgrade but apart from that it doesnt have any redeeming qualities

#####

   ʖ 

#####

a thank you letter to devs
it really saddens me to see this game go down in flames the first one was really bad with smut being its only selling point this one however is so so much better i find myself enjoying playing it a lot such a step up in every aspect plot visuals cutscenes voiceacting gameplay such a pity it didnt get to full release
reasons being reasons a good game is still a good game hope to see more from you keep up

#####

this is a good game but wheres my hentai

#####

垃圾游戏

#####

ill just go play a hentai game that has hentai

edit
welp yall done fucked up
the first game was such a hit and was way better than it had any right to be all yall had to do was just give us more of that and you decided to remove one of the main things made people a fan of the game in the first place let me know how that goes cause right now that 2 positive rating aint looking too hot

#####

not really faithfull to the old game edit
this game has me on edge for hdevelopers this feels like a shit show they threw shit at the first game and put a fucking 3 legged chair to balance the shit coverd game and called it mirror 2 mirror 2 is not a sequel but a sticker for a match3 game that has cute anime girls but if u played the first game then u know they tried to be an actual game that has content they fucking releasted this shit with minimum content i bought this the month this came out but was expecting a good game that has hscenes since the first game had one but no this game had to stray away from the first like i said this is a cover up the title of the game is just a title that is a shell of its former self the content is disgusting dlc has been the main content farm of this game on the plus side idiots like me that bought the game without checking if it is good and bought bc of the title should feel like an idiot that has a fucking migrain every 6 seconds bc i deserve feeling like an idiot bc i didnt check if this game had content

#####

actually great would make a great full game with the characters stories music and overall graphics sadly it is barred behind a set up of candy crush if developers realize the potential this holds and maybe increase price and budget we could have a game on par with many upcoming anime games either way it still is enjoyable for a story similar to an interactive show where your input matters a system of branches allow you to go back and finish all the different endings and possibilities rewards are art and items for you progress through the candy crush like minigame much like the previous game same mechanics with minor alterations the story is heavily entertaining too me at least and i find all the characters having a personality you can either relate to or connectempathize so far have only finished two but have loved it if you came for r18 because of previous game not here maybe once it comes out of early access they might add it but so far for a cheap price hella nice there is also a challenge mode that is in the main game that i have yet to try but if it is worth mentioning i will come back and edit this review to share a quick summary i did just mention a main game and that is because there is a second game which is a sort of photo taking island you can change outfits do poses go in or near certain objects personally i dont really care to much for it but others might there are mods and the capability for mods in this second game if one wishes for some customcustom experiences for the dlcs they are cheap and support the devs which does not hurt i got them all and they seem not necessary but a nice cheap add on

tldr good game with great graphics writing cinematic characters and music some slight ecchi in some certain areas multiple game modesgames
horny wait for full release to see if added or try it out in the first bit and refund its like 2 bucks and the content is worth imo 
not horny get it and enjoy the few stories added so far obviously not finished so there is much more to come might have even been some early hints in the leahs story of what to expect 

edit challenge mode is pretty neat its a simple what im assuming endless branchlike board game set up like you would find in a mobile gacha game you have 13 options of a path to go to that offer different scenarios a heal maybe an item event and of course the funny candy crush is it top tier game play preference really but if you love the game enough and cannot wait for more story its perfect for wasting away time from the short bit i played i did not notice any immediate rewards other than items and passivesskills for further challenge progression there must be something a player earns from playing though whether its a cosmetic for the little house game or items for the main stories idk maybe later this is how you unlock scenes if you know what i mean  again though no one knows if they will ever add those so dont cope too hard just try it yourself if you want more info on it really

#####

babe listen it was a gift from my friends ok i didnt buy it i swear look it was just a practical joke by the lads please dont hang up

#####

you get what you paid for an unfinished but good early early release of mirror 2 it was very high quality despite me using up 100 percent gpu 128mb of vram can somehow run this dont listen to the very high spec requirements your laptop may beg for its life though all things aside i liked the game cant wait for its full release also i recommend you get the outfits dlc its free and suits the needs of the cultured person

#####

please add hentai content ass dls

#####

game developers intentionally mislead players about the real features of the game

6块钱一个100成就游戏其实已经赢了

#####

this is an early access review so things might be a little or quite different if you play this in the future

ill start off by saying the game so far has nothing to do with the first mirror other than the name and that the waifus are from alternate universes  the story characters setting and overall atmosphere are very different from mirror but this game also improves upon the concepts introduced in the original and polishes everything further

storyline
the story feels more fluid complex and generally higher quality theres only one issue i can currently complain about  the length there are choices which lead to different endings so each heroine is replayable more than once with a very different outcome but i still feel like the length is a bit lacking and couldve been longer i reached the first ending of leahs story within 30 minutes including passing all the puzzles the stories feel and go much faster than the length in mirror which is probably due to the fact that all the stories are mostly cutscenes with minimal text as opposed to mirror being in a more classic vnlike format if you enjoy watching over reading this will be a great improvement to you but if youre an avid vn reader who prefers the classic format this will likely be a less appealing change

graphics
i think its one of the greatest improvements so far the graphics are now 3dcgi and feel like watching an actual anime during the cutscenes the character designs introduced so far are better than mirrors in my personal opinion and the 3d models are high quality and polished at the time of writing this review i was having slight texture glitches textures fading in too slowly during the cutscenes but this will likely get resolved in the near future one thing that bothered me is that in the settings i couldnt find my monitors resolution im using an ultrawide monitor and had to play in a windowed mode to avoid having black bars on the sides  so if your resolution is unusual youd have to stick with black bars or windowed mode  there are currently only 4 resolution settings

characters
only two characters were available as of writing this review  leah and rita and only leah had a story i think so far the characters are well written leahs design personality and overall appeal is quite nice i prefer her over most of mirrors original heroines so far its basically a waifu game over a proper playable game so characters are probably the most important aspect of it and i think theyre going in a good direction with them so far

sound
the soundtrack is pretty chill doesnt get tiring too fast and as opposed to the original mirror  more modernsounding as theyre going with a scifi theme instead of the genre mess the first mirror had so its pretty solid and keeps the same theme over the game instead of radically changing genres and style i think they nailed the voice acting pretty great the game currently has japanese voice acting only as of writing this review

gameplay
honestly not much changed in this regard this is fairly similar to the original mirror there are four gem types you just match them to trigger skillscombos and occasionally activate the skills you chose before starting the round the new 3d graphics give it a more polished and modern feel the difficulty is more or less the same as the original the heroines skill attacks against you are cute and well animated some of the heroine attacks are very adorable such as leah drawing on your monitor from inside of it rita has an entire short cutscene dedicated to one of her skills so i think this was a nice touch there is a flowchart that lets you view the endings you unlocked and which paths youve yet to unlock this makes reaching endings more comfy and lets you replay certain cutscenes there is some sort of a rhythm game style touching minigame which felt out of place but leahs reactions during it were cute so i think its its okay that it exists just feels like they couldve used it for a different purpose  also yes its not lewd at all you just touch randomly appearing hearts on the screen as the heroine covers one of her eyes or floats on a hoverboard so youre basically just clicking the wall behind her

to sum it up mirror 2 project x feels like a more polished version of the original mirror  has a better structured storyline better characters so far at least much improved graphics and interesting new mechanics a rhythm game the flowchart etc but currently suffers from early access issues such as textures glitching during cutscenes massive lack of content only one heroine very short storylines and it didnt feel as immersive as the first one did the cutscenes also felt rushed instead of having a properly written story in a vn format this is basically an interactive 3dcgi anime so if thats your kind of thing and you enjoy match3 gameplay this is an amazing deal for its price

#####

seeggsss when

#####

candy crush but like you know without the candy and stuff uu

#####

shame but due to stupidity on both parts developer and others this game will not see any real progress for some timethe game is ea which means give it some time to become what it is going to be heck the main game is still in japanese and i hate that the most since i have to get there by trial and error i love match 3 games and the match 3 is really good and the walking around on the island with the girls is really nice as well even though it is far from done since you can walk right threw most objects also nice to see that there are some mods to it that add the subject that got this game in so much trouble well i hope this game get more help by getting a better rating so it can become what it was meant to be and only patients is going to get it there

#####

its a shame well likely never see this game fully realized but whats been made so far is a solid match 3 with high production value and good gameplay mechanics i get some are upset devs couldnt fulfill on the nsfw content but imo its fine as is without it seems people wanted yet another fap game but what was delivered was an actual game even if not my preferred genre i found it engaging and enjoyed my time with it

best of luck to the devs on their future endeavors

#####

我很难想象一个精神状态正常的游戏玩家会做出不玩命运2这样的选择命运2优秀的题材与充实有趣的游戏内容可以说目前所有rpg游戏中最优秀的没有之一没有玩过命运2的朋友失去的不仅仅是一次游戏的体验而是一种最基本的对游戏的理解与精神信仰命运2明明可以在将大家的游戏体验带入一个全新的高度可是你竟然放弃了那今后提起游戏你必将会坠入冰冷的深渊体验绝望的后悔与没落感玩游戏不玩命运2就像四大名著不看红楼梦说明这个人文学造诣和自我修养不足他理解不了这种内在的阳春白雪的高雅艺术他只能看到外表的辞藻堆砌参不透其中深奥的精神内核他整个人的层次就卡在这里了 只能度过一个相对失败的人生

#####

if you want a game with cute girls and waifu kind of things this game is just cute it doesnt have hentai

the creators are good creating characters that are magnetic in my opinion and mirror has enough following for someone to be working in a 18 mod in my opinion who knows

regardless this game isnt as bad as virgins make it to be it isnt a flawless gem but come on it is cheap af for what you are paying it is more than worth it

so summarizing not as fun as the first mirror in my opinion not as good writing either but good art and music as always and the writing is just in pair with the average moe so

#####

this was a great game with a lot of people involved hope you are happy now with your saved 2 pajeros

review concerns first early access build i may come back to update it when further content is added

h1prefaceh1
i backed this on uurlhttpswwwkickstartercomprojectsindieworldmirror20descriptionkickstarterurlu a couple of years ago  as many will know the kickstarter didnt reach its goal and so the developer continued with their own funding they were very generous and gave us backers free steam keys for the game and honestly im glad i didnt pay for it because the 20 i backed was for what seems to have been a completely different game to what has been given to us i actually had to doublecheck that i hadnt missed some spinoff between a real mirror 2 and mirror 2 project x and im honestly not a fan of it at all

h1overview and storyh1
instead of the lush fantasy setting from the campaign material we have a strange scifi setting that seems to be trying very hard to imitate scp monsters with various powers investigation and containment artifacts etc all told inside some depressinglooking metal bunker through the medium of a very poor visual novel  and by god is it poor
i understand this is ultimately a hgame aside from the distinct lack of any h in this build but this has to be one of the most bewilderingly incoherent and melodramatic stories i have ever had to sit through no skips on the first runthrough and i can honestly see it getting in the way of the gameplayhscenes more than anything i imagine the translation doesnt do it any help as some of the sentences give off that notquiteenglish vibe but even fixing it would serve only to make slightly shinier the turd underneath

h1gameplayh1
the gameplay is okay a serviceable match3 with a little extra sprinkle of player choice through special item usage
theres also a qtebased something mode with the girls where you click the l or r mouse button inside a circle before it times out not really sure what it adds to the game and as an osu player its comically easy but its there _ツ_

h1graphics and musich1
these are the more agreeable features of the game the graphics are that nice clean 3danime style we all know from the other 100 games that share it and the soundtrack is pretty pleasing to listen to

h1conclusionh1
all in all pretty disappointed in how this turned out after the very promising previews in the kickstarter and even accepting this as its own game its a far cry from being worth spending time on perhaps the addition of the hscenes and more characters in the future will improve things but so long as were trapped within the same awful setting and storywriting i highly doubt it

boverall ratingb
210

#####

the first game was very nsfw and a very good game this game has no nsfw content so idk why i bothered

#####

i definitely recommend this game 

im well aware of the controversies surrounding this game but i mainly care about the quality of the actual game not the unfortunate circumstances that ultimately led to its mostly negative review score in my opinion i believe the largest business mistake they made that ultimately led to them going bankrupt was underpricing the game i know thats not gonna be a popular take but the truth is that game development is expensive and when you consider the high quality polished end product even if its not technically finished and the fact that they sold over 4 million copies and could only cover a little over a third of their operating costs according to their bankruptcy statement the price being charged wasnt high enough ive paid much more money for lower quality games

ive played mirror 1  and to 200 completion on all the waifus loved that game and highly recommend it as well while ill admit i do miss the h content from that game i still believe that mirror 2 stands on its own merits 

the match three puzzle game is as addicting and fun as it was in the first game and i do like how they have different icons based on the setting and story you are playing

i believe the quality of the stories has improved from the first game the stories in the first game mostly felt similar to each other which i guess kinda makes sense when the end goal is the same have sex with the waifu

the graphical quality is wonderful i also liked how good the animations for some of the bigger flashier moves played out when your opponent used a signature moveability during the match three puzzle game

island waifu dressup picture taking free exploration simulator was a very nice addition you play the story mode of the main game to learn about the character and then you can go the mirror 2 home portion of the game with that character


i have only two negatives with the game

the lack of h content but we do live in a world where mods exist so

that the game will not be officially developed any further

#####

you know why im here












#####

the devs really did a bad fiancial decision by removing the thing people liked the most about the original game talk about being tonedeaf with your clientsfansfollowers i heard they went bankrupt its quite sad but they made this decision they could have made this game an call it legacy of union or whatever but if the creators of mirror 1 makes mirror 2 you can only expect to be a inmpovement or at least a continuation of mirror 1

the buyers are not here to blame the devs really did a bad decision here and dug their own grave hope they learnt from it and in prove on the future

tldr devs didnt learnt what people liked from the sequel and made this almostcompletely different game and went bankrupcy if you come from mirror 1 do not buy it its too late for me to ask for a refund

#####

i am appalled by the behavior of my fellow gamers the gameplay is simple yes and the story is a little confusing but the character design was good and of all the worst rated steam games this was by far my favorite 

we dont always need full nudity we dont always need quintuple penetration with kaiju tentacle creatures sometimes the bandages that hang on to lanis right breast are all we need to remind us that even when all seems lost we can still hold on and carry on thank you

#####

this is one of the most underrared games on steam a hidden gem
all of the negative reviews based on 18 content that this game not has
but it has so much more beautiful characters and a stellar presentation
a really good story mode i recommend this game every gamer who has a heart for cute anime girls
i completed 100 of the ps5 version also a good buy

#####

good game for the price on sale  bc ye to suru hote hi khatam hogayi re

#####

if you had played the first game than this game is a must buy

#####

no segs no fun

#####

what do i have to say more about this sequel of the original bejeweled with porn 

now with fully 3d animation and deep lore 

1010

#####

i sacrificed my girlfriend so i can enjoy this masterpiece to the fullest

#####

今天是牛子节点赞这段话牛子精灵就会在你睡着的时候偷偷给你的牛子加长1cm 快说谢谢牛子精灵

#####

plenty of deserved gushing in this thread so how about i bring some critique to the party 
1 obviously only 1 character storyline available right now it is my understanding that buying today at the current price should grandfather you in as the other 85 of the content gets finished
2 2 hot chicks in this storyline adorable and mildly provocative but no nudity or h content as of yet we expect that those improvements will also come later steam doesnt make distributing that very straightforward after all
3 dont press start until youve fiddled in the upper right of the launcher to get your preferred subtitle language setup or else everything will default to chinese subtitles you can set the language during game as well but its much easier from the launcher and that way you wont miss any of the exposition
4 the story is fun but may be confusing on first playthrough due to some odd storytelling choices eg consequences of a choice not always very clear until after its been made there are a bunch of endings to explore so you ought to play through multiple times anyway and that will shed enough light on things to make sense of everything

primary organization fbrp seems indistinguishable to my untrained eye to scp documents full of redaction staff treated indistinguishably from containment subjects etc i see that as positive the reason that scp is as popular as it is is because its a rich platform to tell stories from in this case it might allow the varied character story lines to have a stronger binding framework than they did in mirror 1 while each maintains the freedom to be different and take place in different settings

#####

#####

they released this game as a sequel to an 18 game without any warning that it wouldnt have any of it
not cool man

besides that kick in the nuts its a simple candy crush type game

#####

it is different from what they promise
the gameplay is inherited from mirror but more enhanced and optimized

httpswwwkickstartercomprojectsindieworldmirror20description

#####

it says its nudity but theres no nude i need seggs  no seggs no life im going to dai
but meanwhile theres no seggs i highly recommend this game it has a genshin graphic style

#####

nice animations but no segs

#####

the game recently cancelled the original promised content and under the pretext of full refund users were directed to the development teams own thirdparty website for refund which required players to provide relevant receipts as well as fill in the steam account password and alipay account


#####

a dissapointment so far zero nsfw content unlike the previous game very unbalanced in many ways gameplay again especially compared to previous game very short chapters with abrupt writing lack of english translation and proper cgs for many unlockables the only good parts are art of both characters and locations and music but they are not enough to make a good game hopefully it will be improved in future updates

even worse this has to be the shadiest attempt of refund ive seen in my life using a thirdparty website and asking for steam account password and alipay account data instead of contacting steam support and asking them to issue refunds dont feel like losing my whole account sorry

#####

no plan for r18

#####

nothing to bust a nut to  

#####

yes its not the devs fault that the sequel to mirror will not have any r18 content its because they live in a creep country 
but that is not the problem the problem is that instead of being honest and just giving a new name or making clear that this will never be nsfw they are just silent about that and named it mirror 2 they know people will buy it expecting it to be like the first game but 3d 
also of all things you could keep from the first game why choose the weird woman in pain minigame the first story was ok closest thing to a hscene in the game but the other two have us treat some halfnaked girl in pain how the hell i am supposed to be turned on by that
if the devs ever decide to give up in this simple but cheap concept and hire a real translator this may actually turn into a good puzzle game

#####

cute graphics but thats about it its a fairly confusing and pretty boring match 3 game at the end of things glad i didnt spend that much on it

#####

where sex

#####

no booba or vagini

#####

this looks very promising
im a huge fan of the first mirror game
i cant wait for more characters to be added  as well as the sex

#####

where sex

#####

fk

#####

in order to request a refund the user is asked to input a lot of pii which is suspicious steam should check whether the refund site is legitimate and if not urge the game developer to change

i myself will not request a refund the game itself still has enough content more than star citizen its just disappointing to mislead players with a false expectation

#####

absolute scam using the first game as bait to sell this garbage

#####

i dont want to see a real woman anymore

#####

best bejeweled

#####

bought for the r18 they might add like the first game now i discover they just wont be doing any at least i only wasted a dollar

#####

where segg 

#####

no sex  sad

#####

lewd content and armor piercingenrage mechanic as well as dialogue options having tactical modifiers on combat and there is little of them that made the original mirror so great are missing so far
    but knowing the dedication of devs to their projects and after seeing the polish given to everything added so far i would recommend supporting this project there is huge potential for a great finished game come on its a cheap game and people should remember that the dev team is very small

tldr needs more lewds

this game saved my life

i am 46

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i have only played this game for half an hour with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5  minutes to the soundtrack long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

#####

game has no more updates for now
hey guys were sorry to have to tell you thisdue to the devastating effects of the incident that we caused on september 30th 2022 the development studio has gone bankrupt and the development of the subsequent chapters of mirror 2 project x will also have to be suspended indefinitely we hope that in the future when we have the opportunity we will complete the development of the subsequent chapters and the game will remain in the current early access state until development is completed were also unable to continue the development of novastella island and dancingsim

the gods are pleased with your early access

fraud advertisement when publish and illegally collecting personal information via 3rd party website i would suggest to get the full refund via steam by selecting fraud you can copy the following text and report it

under the pretext of a full refund the game directs users to use the development teams own thirdparty website for refunds which requires players to provide relevant receipts and also requires players to fill in their steam account password and alipay account  filling in their the reason for this is to obtain the players purchase information through the steam interface

the receipt already proves that the player has actually purchased the game in question and checking whether the game exists in the players library does not require a password only that the player provides an account and does not hide their library information at the same time the development team could have communicated with steam and asked for a refund therefore it can be concluded that the game development team is suspected of collecting sensitive information from players

steam requires 15 mins of my playtime to review a game

so this is the first time ive given a negative review to a game i havent played when its finished i wanna play unfortunately it will never be finished

#####

you brazen hussy

#####

so as a person who played mirror 1 for over 10 hours i must say that im pretty disappointed wheres the sex ive been waiting for that for so long

#####

11182022 edit at this point the developer has been silent and there has been no update for longer than any other point since the game hit steam  this goes from a qualified thumbsdown to an unqualified do not buy this until the developer comes back and shows theyre still working on the game  original review follows below

this game is still in early access quite a while after i initially purchased it  in that time it has slowly released new characters but each character is the same

list
    slightly branched but ultimately linear flow chart as you work through levels
    match three game play that feels slower and slightly less balanced than the original mirror
    enough risque and suggestive content that you wouldnt play it anywhere you wouldnt play an 18 game but no 18 content
    a relatively unengaging story with colorful characters and adequate japanese voice acting
list

i was excited about mirror 2 because mirror was a great match3 game that had great gameplay great art great balance and great characters  it wasnt shakespeare but it was a great match3 game with adult content that was fun to play

this game originally was supposed to be a kickstarter project that from the kickstarter page was the same classic combination of love simulator and match3 but the developers have just come out and said this sequel is a 16 not 18 game and so you now get the classic combination of a match3 game with some cheesy 3d beach house mode where you can snap photos of your 3d girls but only with skimpy clothing on never anything that would be worse than 16

the developers investment of time and money into home mode and selling dlcs for additional outfits instead of staying true to mirror as a sequel that builds on the first game is a frustrating turn of events and creates at best an adequate match3 game with an uncomfortable amount of almost 18 panty shots and near nipslips content without ever actually having any nudity  its annoying cheesecake that im not sure who its for but thats the content this ea game is shaping into

if the idea of a match 3 that looks like an 18 game but doesnt actually ever cross the line into 18 sounds like a good ideawait a year or so for the additional characters and stages to be added the gameplay to be tuned and maybe youll have a pale imitation of mirror to consider purchasing  for now id say get mirror without the 18 pack and youve got a much better game thats fully baked  if you want the 18 content that also exists for mirror now and makes the original mirror one of the best 18 games ive ever played

this  this game is a game that could have potential if the developers werent foolish enough to decide that 16 was the direction to go

their decisions around mirror home mirror project y and z and shutting down the workshop all prove that the developers are out of touch with and dont care about their audience

maybe this game can save itself over timethe recent reviews for the game are 
strike97 overwhelmingly negative 35155
strike 98 overwhelmingly negative 54848 as i strikewritestrike update this reviewso maybe the developers can see how badly they are handling things  but i dont have much hope  i spent a decent number of hours trying to find something worth my purchase price herebut i cannot recommend this game in its current form

note  i have not spent as many hours in the game as the review suggests one additional weakness mirror 2 has over mirror is a separate launcher to open either the match3 game or the mirror home world from a separate launcher  forget to close the launcher after closing the game and steam will keep adding hours played while the launcher is open

trash game
beware of internet fraud
