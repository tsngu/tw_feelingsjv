fun and relaxing game always something to do and the updates keep it interesting i am 72 have tried to play other games but they cannot compete with stardew so i only play stardew thank you concerned ape

#####

i play a lot of games you would call rage inducing i love the hack and slash thrill from dmc the gore fest from doom eternal the unbearable challenges of soulslike games 
my wife introduced me to this game and its a game i didnt know i needed i deal with a lot of anxiety and ptsd from my military service and other stressors in my life but theres something about harvesting crops and petting your duck named howard that just feels so relaxing this game is an escape from the everyday stress and i cant recommend it enough and it was developed by a one man army like damn this man earned his flowers

#####

this game got me through a really dark place in my life i lost my job spouse and home in less than a year i would chop wood and fish when i couldnt find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music ive put thousands of hours into stardew valley the little successes i had were the catalyst i needed to think maybe i could have little successes again in life too highly recommend thank you for making this game

ok so far from my game this is what i got
 farming for first week
 mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk
 decide to talk to random people
 lots of talking
 finally think i met everyone
 try to interact with trashcan
 find a salad in trash untouched
 girl sees me digging in trash
 girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
 get mad decide to follow her
 catch her walking towards lake
 turns out shes pretty
 want to know how to marry her
 find out that i can gift people
 dont know what to gift
 remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
 give salad to her
 she loves it
 advance a year or two later
 me and girl are married

is this how true love works

1010 would dig in trash again

i remember buying this game for my brother a few years back didnt think much of it at the time but i thought it would be a nice gift for him i remember seeing him playing it from time to time the message indicating that hed started playing it popping up on the corner of my screen there was always a certain small pride in seeing that because to me it meant that he was enjoying my gift
last september he committed suicide
after everything had more or less settled down from that i sat down and booted up his computer all that was on there was chrome steam word and a few games one of them of course was stardew valley
he had played this game to pieces clocking over 170 hours and owning practically everything the game had to offer he had used every square inch to its maximum potential and was making ridiculous amounts of cash it was only then did i see just how much he loved his present no other game he played quite captured his affection as much as this one none of his friends really knew about it however it seems like he preferred to keep it to himself like it was his own little bit of heaven he could turn to whenever he wanted

and because of that i cant help but smile whenever i play this game

i cannot recommend it enough every bit of hard work the developer put into this masterpiece shows in every single aspect the music is catchy and memorable ill ofetn find myself humming certain tunes from it the world feels livedin and natural and the gameplay is incredibly laid back and enjoyable its hard to stop once i get invested in the game minutes can easily turn into several hours and now with the multiplayer beta i play for even longer with my friends each of us dedicated to our desired jobs most of all however were all just happy to be together

#####

i ask my crush to dance she replies ew no

1010 just like in real life


#####

i play this when im sad

#####

horse can wear hat
1010 game

#####

this game is dangerous i would recommend not playing it unless you want to be completely incapacitated for the first 2 weeks you own it

#####

it takes away the emptiness inside of you

#####

you can have a girlfriend

#####

one thing i never realized until i finished the game is that you shouldnt rush it i got everything done 8 years in game found all the secrets got 100 completionist on the tracker found all the secret cutscenes collected every hats accessories rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content but when the credit starts rolling all i feel is emptiness and a void that i can no longer fill up this is a wonderful game thats just so inviting and calming to play whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over 

if you have got the time to spare take my advice and enjoy the slow ride dont rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on because all there is at the end is the credits

#####

great buy for coronavirus quarantine

#####

i forget im depressed when playing

#####

this game lets me pretend i have everything i want in life stable income and a husband

#####

you play this game every night on your bed when you imagine fake scenarios like having your own house money and a wife

#####

if i could kiss this game on the mouth i would thats it thats the whole review buy it

#####

this game lets me pretend i have everything i want in life stable income and a husband

#####

i grew up playing harvest moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories she would always buy me the new one for christmas and we would play it all day filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry although stardew valley has unmistakable similarities to harvest moon it is a masterpiece in its own right one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum 

stardew valley is complex and simple heartwarming and detailed its complicated enough that so many hours later i still havent completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk but its simple and easy enough that i play it almost every night on the couch after work 

concerned ape has programmed a masterpiece his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created i anticipate each new release and i cant wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game i rarely give games a perfect score but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten

#####

play this game with the characters wiki open because nothing will hurt more than putting all ur hard work into growing a cauliflower and then picking the person u like the most for this special gift and them just saying ew

#####

college make me

this game has been a great distraction since i lost my ability to walk sustained a work injury in january that leaves me permanently bedridden its so calming to build a farm and watch it thrive i love the interactions with all the townfolk and theres so many cool secrets in this game i cant even begin wish my wife couldve played this game with me 

#####

the closest thing to touching grass ive done

#####

bgive a man a fish and he will eat for a day give solo developer eric barone four years and they will make openended countrylife rpg stardew valleyb

#####

i farm potat

#####

there isnt much to be said that hasnt already been said for this amazing game if you enjoyed the classic harvest moon type games you will absolutely 100 enjoy this the game play seems fresh and fun even after clocking in over 60 hours you wont want to quit just 1 more day then you realize that turned into 5 days and its 4am and you have to sleep sometime 

this game takes the old harvest moon concepts and tosses in a bit of rune factory and a sprinkle of animal crossing leaving you with a sensational experience each day brings something fresh there is over 25 different npcs to interact with each day and each one brings their own charm and dialogue options depending on if you take the time to build up your friendships

your farm can be whatever you make it you design what it looks like how it runs what you plant and what animals you choose to raise the fishing can be a bit difficult to begin with but very rewarding and relaxing once you get the hang of it on days you want something a bit different you can hop into the mine and find some rare gems ores and minerals some that you can donate to the games huge museum or use to upgrade your tools 

i cant praise this game enough if your on the fence about purchasing this game or you think you should wait for a sale dont wait this game was made by a single developer who deserves every single penny for all the obvious hard work and dedication so go and farm your butt off

#####

this game provided the comfort and love that my father didnt 1210

#####

if youre looking for a wholesome game that destroys your irl health bar look no further the regularly satisfying hits of dopamine will cause addiction youll lose sleep due to the just one more day factor youll strain your eyes your most visited website will change the existential crisis that will awaken in you for enjoying a pixelated 2d world more than your reality will send you down a path of reflection and in most cases enlightenment probably

#####

i play this game when im sad

#####

i have mental illness and the game makes me forget about that for a little while

so yeah play the game

#####

h1thank youh1
i really hope the developers are able to find this review somehow

iwe all have difficult times in our livesi

i started playing stardew valley in april 2021 which was not an easy moment in my life apart from the covid pandemic i was struggling with high anxietydepression college was online and the pressure both from the university and myself never stopped it was hard i cried a lot but somehow i got through this
i never played this kind of game before sort of harvest moonlike i guess but i wanted to try something that i could just relax enjoy take a deep breath and calm my mind relieve the tension chill

stardew valley for me was kind of a life saver
im still playing it 100h and counting and the game still do what it did in the beginning its an incredibly charming and relaxing game its fun and it has likable characters so far it has been an experience that i am very happy i gave it a shot
its one of my favorite indie games ever now right beside bastion hollow knight and shovel knight other favorites of mine

stardew valley calmed me when i needed most and i will not forget that
again b thank youb



edit thanks a lot for the steam points everyone didnt expect this review to be that popular 
16 will happen lets gooooooooo

#####

its ok gets kind of boring after 2500 hours

#####

i have cancer the game didnt cure it but im now counting my days in stardew valley and not irl would recommend

#####

this game saved me from depression

#####

dont give away the rainbow stone

#####

amazing it fix depression

#####

this is a game that i have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years i have wanted to have a game on the pc that had the elements of harvest moon for the little bit i played of it animal crossing 3 and rune factory i was super excited when i was approached by leth publishing manager at chucklefish at the beginning of december to help him and concernedape developer of the game with bug testing and qa 400 hours later off steam and on steam i still love the game 

bfarmingb the farming is fantastic it is to me one of the main elements of the game and its just a joy being able to design your farm any way you want it yes please planning out what to buy every season where to plant them on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold its so enjoyable and addictive 

bfishingb the fishing is outstanding from playing wow and runescape or any game with fishing the fishing in stardew valley is so much fun at first the fishing is challenging but as you progress your skill you become a pro in no time

bmining and combatb mining and combat is incredible going deeper into the mines can be tough but if youre prepared with your food and weapon in hand you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet oremineralsgems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard hi im bexy and im a hoarder 

bsocialb social interactions are great being able to become friends with the people in the town  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them whats not to like about that and whats great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses the backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out you will be silly if you dont shed a tear maybe once or twice 

bmain storyb the actual main story is well rewarding and once you complete it you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems hell you might even discover new things afterwards i sure as hell did 

yes i was a tester for the game yes i have played for ridiculous amounts of hours it may feel like im being a bit overzealous with this however you have to remember i was a tester i tested the crap out of every aspect with this game even though there were massive game breaking bugs errors glitches crashes i still love this game i reported many a bug and concernedape was quick to fix them 

and thats the thing not only is the game amazing the developer is too concernedape works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game and thats true the experience that you have with this game is amazing 

minutes playing turn into hours hours turn into oh no its time to sleep
you will forget about time you will forget about sleep you will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldnt remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back 

so yes i without a shadow of a doubt 150 recommend this game to anyone that wants to escape for days on end with what i am classifying as my #1 game of 2016

#####

after one thousand hours
i decided it was time
to honor my favorite game
with a review disguised in rhyme

stardew valley is the best
you should give it a try
like a warm cozy blanket
or home baked apple pie

relaxation at its finest
a quiet life on the farm
baby animals bring smiles
a lovely garden adds some charm

if adventure is your thing
there are monsters in the mine
or travel to a far off land
either one is totally fine

for those who feel more social
the town is chatty and populated
pick up a cutie at the saloon
maybe a wedding will be fated

you should definitely check it out
whether with some friends or alone
either way you cant go wrong
also thank you mr barone

#####

if you look at the playtime above this review you might be thinking to yourself how on earth does one person invest 400 hours of their life into a game about farming well its a lot easier than you think

stardew valley opens with our disillusioned protagonist slaving away at a corporate job only to be reminded of a promise that they had made with their grandfather so many years ago a promise of something to brighten the shadows when life becomes too dreary for them our stalwart protagonist waves goodbye to the grey walls of their office to board a train to stardew valley an unknown paradise far away from the city and it is here where their life truly begins

i can only wish that we all find our stardew valley someday yeehaw

#####

stardew valley cured my depression

#####

im genuinely impressed an indie game of this scale made by one guy isnt stuck in an eternal early access but is instead provided as the full package right off the bat this is how it was done a decade ago and this is how it should still be done

#####

barely played but pretty good

#####

i convinced my brother to help me buy our mom a ps4 last christmas so she could play stardew valley she was playing the same animal crossing game on wii for years so getting her to try something new was risky 

after my brother showed her the tv apps mom humored me and let me teach her how to play she made a farm and sort of caught on to using tools 

its august now shes logged over 500 hours into that farm her cellar is packed with kegs the seashore is red with crab pots she wields a flashy return scepter that ive never even gotten

1010 turns mothers into elite gaming machines

#####

this game didnt cure my depression but it got closer than anything else

h1introductionh1

stardew valley

ive heard a lot of things about this game a lot of extremely ipositivei things

and i was doubtful was stardew valley ireallyi that good i was afraid that people were just giving it attention because they didnt actually know what a good game was and as insulting as it may sound in my defense uhhm 

before buying the game i hadnt really seen what it looked like or knew what it was about i just knew that it was published by the same company chucklefish that had developed starbound i had loved starbound so i was playing completely spoiler free havent watched any videos no tips  tricks just the information of a billion recommended reviews stuffed into my head

so i bought stardew valley and had pretty high expectations if a game received that much popularity it should be seriously good right


h1what stardew valley ish1

plop into the world of stardew valley 

you completely start from the bottom trailing after a tragedy and responsibility thats struck a farm barely any money and the mystery of a town left in your hands whew thats really a lot when you think about it


 boy did i not know what i was getting myself into


at first i was mesmorized or maybe lost is a better word the beginnings all new and immersive and the middle kind of leaves you stuck but this is because i was impatient with the game i went in wanting to finish it asap however i realized this game is not simply for you to buy and finish its something else entirely

the thing with stardew valley its all about exploration and management discovering and figuring out secrets and a beautiful story was amazing creative mechanics and powerful creativity had combined to produce a fabulous wellformed game that leaves a sweet taste in your mouth and im going to tell you right now its totally addicting 

i bought the game a few days ago and literally have played it all day since ive never done that with a game before i found myself as a kid in a candy shop gaping at all the different flavors and being able to savor them all and now in year 3 of the game i still have a lot more to discover 


h1playingh1

compared to others ive only played around 130 hours of the game thus far buy stardew valley you really wont regret it this game is beautiful the music is whimsically lifting and the soundtrack is wonderful its a work of art you will find yourself falling in love with the characters and the daily routine of being a farmer who restores the life around people and who changes everyone for the better its so relaxing so addicting and so much fun i have played games for years played games with far more hours than i have with stardew valley and yet i always turn to stardew valley first why its amazing it offers something to everyone

the game rewards for the hardworking stardew valley is a game where you really have to manage things yet it allows you to explore the whole art of it work hard as you play the game and there are sweet rewards and im talking about rewards sweeter than all the candy in that candy shop

heres the thing you can take two routes with stardew valley you can either take the money route and become rich and miss half the game or you can immerse yourself in exploring the town and what the game has to offer but with also missing the point that stardew is a management farming game

or you can successfully find the balance between both but how

stardew valley allows you to store multiple accounts which is fantastic i recommend exploring with your first account and learning the ropes you seriously wont know anything yet and will be like omfg when you figure out theres a way that makes things one hundred times easier after that create a second account and start figuring out farm management and what the game has to offer this is a game in which you learn from your mistakes

and now im left in a spot where i can successfully thrive and only continue to grow


h1the prosh1

 enchanting music that sings as you play

 a simple yet fun art design that you cant help but fall in love with

 characters whom capture your heart

 a shambled town that begins to thrive

 hidden secrets that you cant help but want to keep discovering

 amazing challenges that leave you wanting more

 brilliant originality which is incredibly difficult to find

 a storyline that changes your perspective beautifully

 lots of fun and i mean ilotsi

 mods created by the community to make your game more fun and immersive however i play without mods

 it finally has multiplayer


h1the consh1

 as i said the game rewards you for hard work but only for hard work it can be a grueling process but it is extremely profitable those who dont like putting effort into a game wont enjoy stardew valley as much as other games

 time stardew valley takes a lot of time to play through its a game you thoroughly have to enjoy and adventure out on

 repetitive the game can be grueling to reach certain goals you have to go through processes that you will seriously hate but in the end its definitely worth the labor


h1places to improveh1


 i wish there would be more characters once you go through the storyline with everyone theres not much lore left

 more secrets and new areas of course 


h1why its just stellarh1 

stardew valley offers a lot of things and has changed the lives of many people perhaps in peace wonder openmindedness the game gives a lot but i have one thing thats been bothering me for a long time how in the damn world did one single person spit out a freaking awesome game

even though its a farming game which is commonly found everywhere its original with its own spins its extremely difficult to find a game that has such a captivating message thats been developed so well stardew valley is a lot of fun and awe and it really draws a blank in your mind

buy stardew valley at first it might seem mediocre but keep playing trust me the candies are still sweet and they really only get sweeter

#####

its a great game that my boyfriend and i have spent hours and hours playing
hes been on a secret mission looking for iridium and prismatic shards but i know hes trying to craft a wedding ring

edit were married now

#####

this game simulates the happiness that i will never find in real life

#####

who put these farming mechanics in my dating sim

#####

stardew valley lets you live the millennial fantasy of having more than three friends in your twenties owning property and having a stable income

#####

h1spoiler free review with a short and a longer versionh1

buy this game if

 youre interested in farming even though youre allowed to make that it isnt 100 of the core gameplay
 you were looking for a long yet various and easy to be resumed game
 youre fond of pixelated indie games
 you can bear resource hunting and you have some patience as there are some rpg and crafting gameplay
 you love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself update 15  see longer review part down below 

dont buy the game if those above points arent significant for you

 bverdict 9  an indie masterpiece  which now includes also the december update called  15 update 

time required to get to the grown up part of the game 50 hours depending on players choicesskill and luck
time required to get all the achievements around 100 hours just the achievements i mean i havent completed the whole new updateas this is my third gameplay b

longer version
lets see now the most important points including the dlc described in the 6th bullet point

1 bthe simple yet deep premiseb
your grandpa who lived the last part of his life is stardew valley has passed away and you as his nephewniece have inherited a plot of land in stardew valley itself bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that youre spending working in a big firm feel free to imagine it as amazonnestlè you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure

2 bthe core gameplay is based on farming but you can drop it or leave it aside after a while youre free to design your gameplayb
even though clearing debris pruning weeds killing evil monsters and  cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point youre not forced to keep farming 247 as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun such as
 tending to animals
 mining
 foraging
 fishing
 more

3 b the customization has a external and a deeper sideb
this means that besides customizing your own home buildings and clothes there is a skill system which can shape and improve the way on how youve decided to play the game

4 bstardew valley is a living community its people are likable and your activities make a differenceb
the npcs are actually interesting and theyre worth your time socializing with them helping them and confronting them on events quests is always a good distraction and worth your time as theyll be quite rewarding in terms of money items and story progression in general even though youre not forced to follow any particular path your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city

5 b theres a strong and thriving mod community and the game allows multiplayer gameplayb
i personally recommend stardew valley expanded as a mod to be installed feel free to check it on nexusmods

6 b the 15 update is extremely good and needed b
my biggest gripe with sv ubeforeu this free massive update from december 2020 was that there wasnt enough endgameplay elements or goals to be reached this update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area distant from stardew valley by adding new minerals animals crops quests weekly quests npcs and much more including many quality of life changes which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid

thanks for reading and for bearing up with me leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations have an amazing daynight feel free to follow my other reviews at httpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator32344423

#####

the closest ive ever come to touching grass

#####

i spent three years building up hype and i was still blown away

if you enjoyed harvest moon rune factory or animal crossing  then get this it captures all the same things that made those games great and its the perfect game to play either casually or seriously there are so many different ways to earn money and theyre all developed and fun the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing

the progression curve in the game is fantastic too every day youll feel like youre making progress but theres still always something to work towards and you wont beat it after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible as theres always something to spend your money on even after 20 hours of playing i feel like im nowhere near the endgame and i could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently im even doing a playthrough on youtube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages

im easily disappointed by games so you can imagine my surprise when i was so impressed by a game made by one person congratulations concernedape youve made one of the best games ive ever played

#####

very fun good for autism

wouldnt mind wasting my retirement years inside this games reality  alas  recommended

you have little to no idea what youre missing out on until you actually purchase and play stardew valley for yourselves  it is one of the most fantastic relaxing open world gameplay experiences you will ever play in your life  and one wouldnt know that by simply looking at the games graphics alone  stardew valley is how a game should be made

after dedicating 250 hours of my blood sweat and tears i have finally succeeded in world domination now i have a husband who wont kiss me unwanted useless children and a crush on someone who lives in a sewer

#####

h1 overview h1 

stardew valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the harvest moon series you start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables the game is simple in its understanding build a farm make profits live your life what the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered youre left with the freedom to explore the town its residence mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time sure there are events to attend festivals to see menwomen to romance and marry kids to have buildings to construct fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay dragon warrior anyone but how and when you do those things is up to you 

in essence the game offers you very similar things to do as a harvest moon game does build and upgrade your farm plant crops upgrade tools mine in the neverending dungeon for precious ore go fishing romance and get marriedetc while some of your old favorites are back new aspects have been introduced as well but i wont spoil those in this review lets just say theres a nice story that evolves over time

the freedom to do as you please is what makes this game and harvest moon in general so enjoyable its a chance to mellow out play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer what stardew valley does it does right its charming cute and feels rewarding even when all youre doing is cuttings weeds it doesnt pull any punches or try to be something its not the developer had a goal in mind and stardew valley is a reflection of just that you can feel the effort the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years stardew valley is a gem and worth looking at if you loved harvest moon youll love stardew valley

to date stardew valley is a single player game though the developer as mentioned some form of coop or multiplayer availability in the future


h1 pros h1 

list
 character customization  always good always wanted 
 visuals  in the style of the snes theyre colorful detailed and a delight
 game pace  fast slow or somewhere in the middle its your call to make
 content  there is a lot more to do than i first imagined there are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline 
list

h1 cons h1 

list 
 combat  its a tad basic since that isnt the core of the gameplay a single hackn slash mechanic
 citizens  id love to see more citizens even temporary ones during the year come and go to make the town feel more alive
list


overall stardew valley is a pleasure i havent put a ton of time into it yet but i easily see that happening its fun lighthearted and addictive as i said earlier in this review if youve ever played harvest moon youll enjoy stardew valley its worth checking out and i highly recommend it this will easily become one of my most played games on my list you wont be disappointed so check it out

#####

i was never interested in farming games ive never played a harvest moon game or an animal crossing game and never had any interest in them the closest thing to a farming game ive ever played was minecraft i definitely would have never tried stardew valley if i wasnt an achievement hunter and it didnt have achievements 

but now i see what all the hype was about

stardew valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into there are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life especially the games premise youre stuck at a soulcrushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when youve reached your absolute limit and need something new after a particularly bad day at work you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfathers farm on a faroff island so you take the plunge and decide to move there it is a very strong analogy to the game itself where you the player are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game not knowing what else to expect

in stardew valley you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land as the days go by you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what youve been given from buying seeds and planting crops to raising animals to fishing by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event to foraging for wild food and even to exploring a few combatcentric zeldastyle dungeons but youre not making money for its own sake  there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land each with significant and gamechanging rewards at the end and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all the game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first although youll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can

years consist of four months each month being 28day season some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons and almost no crops grow in winter so youll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when each day lasts about five minutes and youve got to make sure youre back in your house by 2am or else youll pass out and lose some money the biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the istarti of a day  so if youre eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops it wont mean anything unless you play the whole day through a vicious cycle i clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing thats how bad it is

another one of the games strengths is the cozy little community you live beside with a population of about 25 people the game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations youll really get to know and love them you can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards you can even date some of them you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want no joke relationships are genderindiscriminate and then marry the character of your choice the social aspect is sometimes a bit too real  youll feel the pain of rejection all too often  but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming

as for complaints surprisingly the game has some strange and baffling bugs most of which are visual like iceskating horses but some which affect gameplay and a few known savecorruption bugs i also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls if youre using the mouse your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character or else youll only aim at the tile in front of you making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working and if you accidentally click the wrong tile your character will turn to face it changing the default direction you aim compounding the problem it can be infuriating especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops also i dont like how you can only talk to npcs if you have a tool selected and how youll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected the controls could definitely use some additional polish 

then there are the inventory controls if you click on an inventory item you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot if you click on an inventory item with a storage box open you will immediately transfer the item into or out of the box thus it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open if you click on an inventory item while in a shop iyou immediately sell the item with no confirmationi i cant tell you the amount of times i purchased 200 seeds then immediately sold them again just because i tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot

also i cant help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does  perhaps more dungeons a bigger map and the ability to run more than one farm but as of this writing the game is still in active development including a coop multiplayer patch in the works and a lively modding community

i give this game an 810 a wonderful example of what all those crappy farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls its some simply wonderful escapism and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game it does get stale in time but not before offering a huge amount of joy for achievement hunting itll easily take about 200 hours especially blind but if youre like me youll have it over with in a month or two a huge thumbsup

#####

originally when i was younger and inconsiderate i pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours once i had my own money i bought this game on steam when the multiplayer update came out i played a lot with my girlfriend at the time and when we broke up i stopped playing for a while and deleted the save a few months later i was in a low place so i bought this game on switch and completed the story and got married and had kids so i sunk in a fair amount of hours 200 it was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as i wanted to keep playing as i recovered from that dark part of my life i played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me so now ive been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown this game as a whole has helped me through a lot and has given me a bunch of great memories i recommend stardew valley to anyone that likes harvest moon farming sims in general or just having a great time the music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game generally a great experience

#####

#####

one of the best games to exist 
you will not regret buying this game and the creator of this game is so kind 
 he listens to the games fans for new ideas it is a great farm game 1010

#####

okay so imagine if you loved your job it provided you with enough money to live and buy luxuries and still afforded you time to do other things you loved now imagine all that but in a fun lil town with people that told you exactly how to befriend them and eventually build a loving committed relationship with sounds great no well on top of that theres a cool soundtrack and everything makes lil bloop noises when you interact with it 

stardew is kindness and relaxation in a video game that has adventure exploration crafting cooking relationships and special events as well its how you would want real life to be 100000010


#####

do you see this play time and i still havent 100 percented this thing there is so much content here and you get it all with one purchase no dlc nothin concerned ape do you have some aversion to money

all joking aside this is a fantastic game hundreds of hours of content in this little pixel art game about farming and bringing a dying town back to life the most recent update just added a bunch of new late game content which was the only gripe i had with this game up until this point you can play this for years and not run out of stuff to do and i have

ive picked up this game several times and it didnt click in the way i thought it would i got too caught up in the i must do everything every day mentality which like in real life doesnt work out very well

once i learned that theres no time limit in terms of years you can play infinitely i was able to settle into a relaxed ill worry about that next year mentality and now cant stop playing

i grew up playing harvest moon on the snes my parents probably rented the game a dozen times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game my brother and i dumped hours and hours and hours into that game beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings 


a few years ago for the first time a game was released that bested the original harvest moon that game is obviously fortnite jk


stardew valley is such a good spiritual successor that it beats the original hand over fist its entirely its own game while nodding its head to what i assume is its source inspiration it exceeded my expectations by a lot and it continues to be improved on again and again b for free b


this game has a lot of replayability just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now between different relationships different focuses different game altering choices and different property layouts and designs theres enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time 


it might seem minor but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best if not the best out there chrono cross was my former favorite but only stardew valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases okay one of those was a gift it keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it might otherwise get sometimes its similar to the tetris song after enough playing the music is ingrained in my soul lmao


gorgeous pixel graphics amazing variety and loads of charm the creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way


this game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets 


1110  stop fucking around and buy the game already i dont care if you find farming boring

ps  shout out to my brother he never got to experience this masterpiece but at least we had good times on harvest moon he would have loved it rip 19872007

#####

can i just say thankyou to the developer of this game i suffer with depression and stardew valley gives me a reason to do somethng other than sleep it makes me feel like i have an impact of peoples lives even if its only in game people i have played 200 hours playing this game thats 200 hours distracted from my real life problems i have opedsp in to be a beta tester this is the first game ive ever done this with thanks to the developer for saying how to do that i really admire him for creating such a good game and hope he goes far in his career and he never loses the magic thankyou

#####

this game is dangerous 

when i first started playing i was like its cool farming is fun but i dont really see the hype around it 

then i kept playing

its gotten so bad that i have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game i open the game and blink and two hours have passed and while i feel sad that i just lost so much time i look at the progress i made on my farm and think worth 

this is one of the most fun games ive ever played

its designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive  optimizationoriented players to have a blast with this game there is so much to do in this game and theres so much to offer you can spend your days farming fishing mining foraging talking to the villagers etc the game is made in a way in which you dont have to hyperoptimize every little detail like minmaxing profit time management etc because theres no time limit for things unless you count seasons but theres always another year and theres no stakes but if you want to you definitely can 

talking to the villagers is fun as well theyre welldesigned and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules theres a lot of details in this game

i havent tried the multiplayer but from what ive seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends but playing solo is extremely fun as well

my only gripe with the game is that its a huge time sink i waited until my semester was over to get into it because i heard about the time sink beforehand and i was glad i waited because all i can think about now is what crops am i going to plant next season where i should place them how much money am i making from these should i fish or mine did i feed my animals today did i talk to robin today 

and of course robin is best girl no discussion there

#####

this game does an amazing job of drowning out the sound of my parents getting a divorce

#####

this game literally saves me every winter through my severe seasonal depression i cant thank concernedape enough this game gives me purpose and joy in november when pretty much nothing else does its also the most wholesome thing ive ever been addicted to

there are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high getting the highest score in a lobby of some fps for example 

there are plenty of games that will give you a lower low seeing your companion die in some rpg for example

but in over 15 years of playing video games of every shape and size no game has ever made me as happy as stardew valley 

just happy i love stardew valley and i highly reccomend anybody play it

#####

this game is nothing short of straight beauty i have never played a farming sim before this and honestly i thought i wouldnt like it because it was so different from the games i usually played at the time fps as soon as i cracked it open i felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a pvp match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and timetaking beauty of stardew valley the amazing 16bit design of the character portraits freshly tilled ground and dont get me started on the fishing without any guides i made 15000 gold before winter and even with watching guides you never feel like youre cheating yourself because theres just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about spoiler and spoiler i was amazed to learn that this was created by one guy mr eric barone may whatever god he believe in bless his soul as he has blessed mine with this amazing game

tldr  great mind blowing 1010 no complaints

#####

as you can see from my hours played i adore this game

 whenever i search for a new game i go to the reviews and i make sure that the majority of the reviewers have played for more than 100 hours amount of hours played gives a game credibility in my opinion 

 i have played and played and played stardew valley in many ways

 i have tried all of the maps explored every inch and grew to know every character 

tonight my hubby and i are delving into the multiplayer beta and i still feel thrilled as if it was my first time playing 

the music is relaxing the atmosphere is enjoyable really everything about this game is made for one such as me
 i have a four year old and at night after bedtime i hop on my computer to calm down after the day i nearly always go for stardew valley to really destress though recently i have been attached to my time at portia lol but still i come back to stardew

 every new time i play i try to knock out another steam challenge or two 

i try to woo new characters 

i try to keep it fresh

 and thus far i still love this game as much as i did the first time i opened it

#####

this is the gameequivalent to a longtime best friend for introverts

you may have some questions at first may have doubts but the more time you spend with it the more you attach yourself the more it becomes a part of you and part of the things you cherish  its the game you always come back to the game that helps you relax when you get anxious the game that is there with open arms when you are ready

do yourself a favor get this game  just trust me

#####

i am a 53 year old mother probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a widow and a single mother to my son who is now 14 years old my son has recently started playing stardew valley in less than a week he has already played over 20 hoursit was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always with his friends or watching youtube videos so i decided to create a steam account to play with my son i started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 2000s so i was pretty lost i asked my son for help and we spent a few hours playing together i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my husband died playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son close again and now we actually spend time together

#####

by admission of the dev himself this game is harvest moon at its core a formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell 

but there is something stardew valley has over harvest moon and thats a heart the intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable i sympathized with my character right off the bat i think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind and in a funny kind of way this game does that 

a moment i felt that the game truly had a soul was when i was walking to the mines on a rainy day when suddenly i was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon abigail my romance interest playing a flute next to the lake its a very quiet scene with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing after some dialog my character who is a silent protagonist by the way pulls out a mini harp and joins abby in a duet something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene it was a bonding experience and it felt incredibly real memorable and touching ill always remember it 

and when you realize that there are ten love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them man thats an intimidating amount of content 

maybe i shouldnt be saying that harvest moon doesnt have any heart at all but when it comes down to it this is the game that im going to remember more fondly in the end i made memories with harvest moon as a child now im making memories with stardew valley as an adult you should too the game is worth full price and then some

910 stardew valley is a fantastic casual game for anyone that can enjoy a more relaxed pace of things this games simple premise of rebuilding the family farm in a particularly quaint village with an array of fun characters to interact with never feels old much of the game is spent trying to make your farm plot perfect to your liking while attempting to maintain relationships with the townfolk stardew plays at any pace you want to play at and that is especially rewarding you will find yourself prioritizing and making chore lists and juggling all of your other duties but you will do so in a natural rhythym of your own pace and comfort i am highly awaiting the arrival of the multiplayer update as currently im playing with my significant other using a mod for multiplayer  while the mod works the legitimate update will be much more welcomed i cant recommend this game enough and once multiplayer is released i dare say this will be a mustown game for gaming couples

edit multiplayer has been released and is as amazing as wed all hoped this game is an absolute must for all gaming couples while the multiplayer adds additional player cabins to your property that act as your guests home they can still sleep in the hosts bed and use the main house as if it were their own

#####

ducks swim im happy

#####

do not buy this game you will buy it thinking theres no harm in trying it because its only 15 then you wall fall in love with it one day you will want to play it while on the bus so you will buy it on your tablet then your tablet will die and you will buy it on your phone then your switch then your xbox then you buy it for your sister so she can play online with you then you realize you can have 4 online players so you buy it for your boyfriend and then your sisters boyfriend and then you realize you have spent 200 and 500 hours on this 15 game 


zero regrets

#####

the fact that concernedape is still creating new content for this incredible game more than 7 years later that will cost you nothing should be reason enough to celebrate this game top to bottom stardew is a labor of love i cannot overstate that this game is perhaps one of the greatest indie video games ever created i will be playing this for years to come

1110 because a scale of 10 isnt big enough for stardew valley

#####

#####

i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

thanks stardew valley

aaand its 5am and i have to go to work in 2 hours

#####

sex is nothing compared to this


#####

this is quite possibly my favorite game of all time

#####

i didnt like this game at first and only played it to satisfy my gf 

now im asking her if were gonna play it before we even get off of work it has honestly earned its place in my heart and im so glad i gave it a chance 

i didnt think i could love a farming sim  coming from a fps dark souls background  over 1k hrs on console
but thus i write this if you have a gffriendsondaughterwifehusband and you havent got a game in common this will become that game this game has improved our ability to communicate and plan things together and were both getting so hyped with every bundle we completevery satisfying oh crap  i just noticed its only 15 honestly shocked about that

give it a shot i think im gonna start my own solo farm


the graphics may not be ultra hd 4k but when you have a beautiful gameplay loop and a town that actually feels alive all that crap just falls away and you can then see that graphics dont make a game heart does and this game has a mine 1010

a little awesome history i learned this was made by one person and he has put 10 years of his life into making it
 thank you concerned ape

#####

i started playing this with a girl i had a crush on for ages shes now my girlfriend

#####

bthis game is just fantastic obviously you can see that from the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on steam so i will keep this short and try to focus on negatives and things you may overlook in generalb

istardew valleyi is what pc gamers have been looking for to scratch that iharvest moonanimal crossingi itch if you like that type of gameplay just buy this dont overthink it it does it all and more what puts it overthetop is the customization level and modular building ability a la iminecraftterrariai style and oh boy is there depth

bplus multiplayer is comingb

bprosb
i mean this was made by one guy
beautiful artwork that has attention to details i mean it even changes dramatically with the seasons its incredible
music is absolutely a treat and once again changes with the seasons
controller support works ok im just glad it exists
character customization malefemale sliders for colors your appearance changes with different gear etc
you have a large farm to work with the world in general is a good size there are 28 npcs all with their own schedules and agendas the pixel art for their faces is outstanding
you can have a pet and get married i havent even done anything with the latter yet
there is mining and fighting monsters although the fighting is casual and isnt even completely necessary
i could go on and on here really

bconsb
sometimes the controller support part feels glitchy until you learn how to use it mainly the part with the right stick nine hours in and im still figuring out nuances
it would be great if the hotbar were longer so to minimize going into the pause button to juggle things
the bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its contents why not allow the player to retract items put in right up until they go to bed its not a dumpster so things dont get tainted

blongstoryshort  this is beyond excellent i cant get enoughb if you like this genre this is a no brainer

#####

this game has so much thought and detail put into it from the little kiss you can give your spouse in the morning to finding the mayors underwear in a special someones home or a little flying witch that could bring you gifts if you are lucky as a person with very intense anxiety this game helps to calm me down and relax 

soundtrack and music  the soundtrack is very calming and peaceful its very comforting to listen to as you water crops or mine in the cave there is always a different song for different events giving it a nice feel good vibe 

art and graphics  the game is so beautiful the art is very adorable and indie with each different season and each new event or festival you have more quests and more to explore and it all is so stunning

characters  the characters are so in depth they all have a different back story to why they are who they are they also are mostly kind and sweet once they get used to you and you get used to them

this game is so much fun and it really goes in depth this game is one that you can lose track of real time because of how enticing it is once you start to get the hang of it there is no putting it down then you discover mods which add more game time because they add more to explore 

overall the is very fun and beautiful if you want a good quality and long lasting game this is the game for you

down side  there isnt much to say about this game that is bad especially since mods help make it better i would love to see working multiplayer to enjoy in game expierence with friends one other thing is there is not much of a tutorial for a new player it can be very confusing it can be confusing on what to do or how important birthdays are and such can be but besides these small things the game is amazing

#####

so i have over 500 hours of gameplay on this thing itsa really good game it has a calming atmosphere its colors are beautiful the music is like a lullaby ive played this game when i was going through horrible shit and it kept me going i highly recommend this if youre depressed or anxious about how youre doing in your life this game helps you relax

#####

if you havent played or seen this game before then i really think you should try it its truly excellent and very wholesome

h1 playtime and timemoney h1
at the time of writing this ive put in about 60 hours and the game is 15 thats 25 cents per hour of enjoyment if you compare that to 15 1 tacos youll quickly see that this is well worth your time and will give you more enjoyment plus you can come back to it and get more and more out of it the game can be modded and plenty of people are more addicted to this game format than i

h1 exactly what is this game h1
this is a farming simulator rpg with romance and combat with a heavier emphasis on the role playing part of the game its very enjoyable to get into and it can be played with your friends to make it even more interesting the only person worthy of my love is krobus be sure to give them a pumpkin from me 3

 i invite haley to dance with me
 she responds with  ew no 
 my heart is broken

very realistic just like real life i love it 

1010

#####

absolutely incredible game i love it to bits and it was a blast going for 100 achievements except for the minigame one screw that overall its a 910 for me dirt cheap for the amount of content it has i especially enjoyed the social aspects of the game

gameplay 810 combat drags it down a bit
music 1110 you wont get them out of your head
visuals 810
price 1010 too cheap honestly

#####

everything was fine until the dreaded spring festival i had given one girl all my precious geodes and copper ingots almost every day time passes until the spring festival flower dance i go up and ask her to dance and what does she say ew gross ok thats ok what about the other girls that ive given my valuable gems tooturned down by every single one of those gold diggers alright fine ill just dance with the chubby alcoholic fishermannope i sat there in silence as i watched everyone in town have a nice little time at the flower dance i am now planning my revenge starting by giving everyone in town trash and broken cds as presents next i shall breed an army of attack chickens and pillage their homes i will get my revenge

#####

i love this game with all my heart i was depressed after a major incident basically turned my life up side down and tbh it was stardew that got me through it letting me take one day at a time

#####

1010 if ur going through depression

#####

i was not interested in stardew valley at first because farming doesnt seem to be my thing i bought the game for the new multiplayer feature to play it with a couple of friends

i tried it in singleplayer mode just to learn the basics and for the next two weeks playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on i didnt know if i spent so much time in stardew valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game but now i know its both

i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in stardew valley there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered and you have all the time you need to discover all of them you can forage and dig up things everywhere you can socialize with townsfolks  each with unique personalities likes and dislikes  and fall in love with them you can mine the heck out of the local mines and then mine the heck out of a limitless mine elsewhere you can play the game however you want and pelican town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless

i recommend this game i know my recommendation is just another one in a sea of positive reviews but hey it deserves my recognition still thank you concernedape and chucklefish for stardew valley this game is a good time 

#####

great game makes me forget about my crippling depression

#####

i bought this game and found it to be pretty fun on one random occassion i was on a train headed back to uni when i noticed a person playing stardew valley on board the train her partner sitting beside watching i couldnt help but strike up a conversation with them and we immediately bonded over the game which eventually led to really interesting discussions on life we were headed to different cities at the time but we met up again eventually now theyre back in their hometown halfway across the world kyle and chloe you guys have been nothing short of stellar 


tldr bought game got free friends 1010 experience

#####

this game cured my depression

#####

every time somebody here likes this review i will drink a shot glass of baking soda and water

stardew valley is awesome id totally recommend it

#####

this game is great i gave my girlfriend a cool rock i found and she said thanks how did you know i was hungry and ate it on the spot

#####


















#####

this game is like a wonderful mix of the best of animal crossing zelda and terraria you dont realize how long youve been playing until its too late very worth it even at full price would recommend

#####

before i played stardew valley i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

bstardew valleyb  is a fantastic game and it deserves to be played for an infinite number of hours
i will recommend this game to anyone without any doubt and in this review i will try to explain why this game should be played and enjoyed

urlhttpiimgurcomrxcezntpngmy progressurl

b1 storyb
well the story is quite simple  you are a hardworking person who is employed by a big corporate firm but you are starting to get flooded with work your grandpa has recently died and left you a typed letter which you can open when you are most in need you think this is the time and you open the letter whereby your grandpa tells you that when a certain part of life comes you need a change in order to feel normal again in this case he invites you to go to his farm in the valley which is now unattended 

b2 gameplayb
the game offers a huge amount of gameplay mechanics which are very nicely implemented into the game you have chiefly 6 gameplay mechanics farming fishing mining foraging combat and seasons in my opinion farming is the main focus of the game you can plant crops water protect and harvest them they are your main source of income the variety of crops is huge and since the game has 4 seasons there are crops which only grow in particular season while other crops can grow for consecutive seasons

url httpiimgurcompz07187pngpicture of the farm durring autumnurl

 b fishingb  is quite hard depending on how much time you want to invest in it again affect the types of fish you can catch catching fish was my main priority in my first hours in the game and my main source of money its quite hard to make money out of fishing but i found out  how to later you can find treasures while fishing so keep that in mind
b miningb  is good for when you get bored of fishing or doing stuff on your farm its very interesting and after couple of visits to the mines you will be planning how many levels you are going to do in 1 day in the mines you are going to find all kind of items like minerals geodes iwhich can be opened by the local blacksmith and stones which can be used in crafting other items  there are quite a few types of monsters located in the mines depending on how deep you are in the mines monsters differ in damage done to you and how long you need to attack them to defeat them

b foragingb  is focused on chopping down wood and harvesting wild fruits and foraging items of course im not covering the other gameplay mechanics in detail because theres really  a lot its like trying to explain how life works to someone from another planet and doesnt know how planet earth is like there are more mechanics like cooking crafting various items the valleys own social community quest lines which are quite large in number community center which needs to be rebuilt iby youi local museum which needs  new artifacts books and minerals to be donated  there is a ton of stuff to be done in the game in order to become even remotely close of completing the game you need to invest a lot of hours into the game which is nice 

b3 character customization  and selecting farm typeb
before the game starts you need to icreatei your character by selecting a vast amount of characteristics skin colour type of clothes colour of the clothes facial hair ifor malesi hair type etc the game offers a lot of variety for your character  you can create a pretty normal character or a very strange looking one  
there are also a couple of farm types or layouts you need to choose from each has its own pros and cons i went with the forest type which offers more wood but it limits the space of your farm where you can plant crops i think there is a farm type which is very hardcore but i cant speak from experience

b4 soundtrackb
the game has a spectacular soundtrack and i absolutely adore it its more than 2 hours long which is quite long for an indie game the music is always right on spot and gives you a relaxing feeling while playing i always love when the game and the soundtrack are actually italkingi to each other and complement one another perfectly

b5 secrets ino spoilersib
this game starts slow with you working at the farm but thats just the tip of the iceberg you will be amazed at how many things you can do and find in this game

urlhttpiimgurcomp1cbnlzjpgsuper rare secret eventurl

b6 stardew valleys wiki page and look up anything modb
wiki page is your best friend in this game its a life saver it helped me so many times when looking for things i could never learn inside the game i honestly dont know how you are supposed to find anything without this wiki page now while i was play stardew i had like 20 tabs open on my browser and all of them were wiki pages and i was constantly alt tabbing it was getting frustrating after 80 hours of doing it one day i looked at stardews subreddit  and saw a guy sharing a similar experience with 20 tabs open and another dude sharing about a mod where you can do all the wiki related stuff without alt tabbing well the mod is awesome you simply click f1 when you are hovering over something with your cursor and a window with info pops up its very useful but some people are calling it a icheati though i dont think so there are also mods for finding artifacts but then thats really cheating

 urlhttpwwwnexusmodscomstardewvalleymods541link for the modurl

b7 collectablesb
they are hard really hard you have a special section in your ingame menu dedicated to tracking your progress and seeing what have you collected so far one tab for the general items icrops foraged items monster loot crops and animal productsi which shows you the types and quantities of crops you have sold another tab for fishing shows all types of fish ingame a tab for minerals that can be obtained from opening geodes and breaking stones in the mines or by unlocking treasures while fishing one tab for artifacts  they are probably the hardest part of the game since they are kind of randomly generated the grind for them is real final tab is for cooking which shows every recipe youve cooked even if you somehow found a complete meal you will need to actually cook it in order for it to pop up in the list

bsadly ive reach steams review maximum characters and i cant post the whole reveiw at once i even try to split it in half the first half here and the rest in the comments but its not going to work so ive used external site where i post reviews as well and i will kindly ask you to go there and see the rest there are like 3 more points remaining of the reveiw which are very interesting in my opinion also there you will see how screenshots are implemented in the review way better than steam again im very devastated by that i cant post the whole reveiw here and i probably will lose many readers like that sorry t_tb link httpswwwbacklogassassinsnetpostsobnonjl

#####

the most wholesome game ever created and is still nurtured by the developer after five years my nomination for steam labor of love award 2021

stardew valley is not just a farming sim its a life sim its not just a video game its an experience and one of the most immersive ones ever existed unlike some other harvest moon clones that either forces you to grind hard or have tedious progression stardew lets you relax set your own goals choose your preferred pace and tell your own story there is so much to do in the game that cant be written in just words and it just gets better the more hours you put in it

only a few games make you feel the love the developers put into them stardew is definitely one of them best wishes to concernedape for his upcoming game

#####

great game to play when your sad and jobless

#####

this game has cured my depression

#####

so this is a fantasy farming town life sim in the ilk of harvest moon so rather then beat around the bush how does it compare

farming on par with harvest moon hm some extra details need for scarecrows fencing etc but its also missing features like the ability to selectively breed superior levels of crops over multiple generations there are some balance concerns but being a pc game those can actually be patched
livestock lacks variety and some complexity but is more realistic in some respects for example theres no animal taming just purchasing breeding is in but you dont breed better livestock it just replenishes numbers and is gender blind grooming is more detailed but less hands on the one noteworthy improvement is conceptually allowing and rewarding field rotation

relationships superior to hm and its a fantasy life fl but inferior to rune factory rf i say superior to hm but really its about on par in terms of the mechanics but with more romance options including same sex it falls behind in terms of character variety depth and interaction compared to the rf series but updates could easily catch up 

note rf improved on the hm formula is pretty much every way so will be comparing primarily to it now

mining on par with rf behind fl one area it is behind in both respects is variety of ores divided by regions stardew valley has 2 locations you can really go mining they have a lot of levels which are divided into different biomes and theres some rng in ore availability on any given trip into the mines but its still overall more simplistic terms of layout and progression where it really lags behind is the actual mining interaction its just click on the rock it breaks rng loot

lumberjacking this ones complicated as its been mixed with the concept of foraging lumberjacking by itself it close but still behind rf and way behind fl foraging also adds features such as getting tree seeds off trees for immediate replanting finding seasonal wild plants which you can in turn get seeds for and farm eliminating the wild foraging once youve completed that seasons set and at certain times of the year collecting berries the other titles has these features coloured grasses and fruit trees etc but they werent tied to a skill you could improve much room to improve here especially in terms of the mechanics

fishing ahead of rf close but still behind fl something that must immediately be pointed out is fishing difficulty isnt staggered so theres an easy progression curve where as in the other games the seasonal fish in the locations you have access to at the start are easy to catch  get harder as you unlock more areas and progress to later seasons stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill plus the rng will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again  again practising the skill and improving equipment alleviates this over time but a lot of people think fishing is impossible starting out as although there are easy fish to catch to start you arent directed to them and rng can still screw you the mechanics themselves work well once you are on top of them but still more depth that could be added to compare to fl but otherwise quite good

combat behind rf and fl theres no real depth to the combat 3 noteworthy weapon types and youll mostly just use swords plus bombs which you wont use in combat no spells no special moves right click does do an alternate thing like block or ground slam but its not effective and you will never do it no companions no real footwork just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy dies the only tactical considerations are more frustration with the controls then strategy enemy variety is lacking compared to the others first 80 levels theres only 3 varieties of enemies those who passively stand there ones that charge you grounded or flying and ones that charge you but occasionally block one that burrows to do so for all the above the strategy is pretty much the same maybe dodge hit them before they hit you keep hitting then they add enemies that shoot at you same deal much room for improvement that said the rng nature of the dungeons leaves a lot or potential open for this to be developed further if the dev decided to so

crafting way behind rf and fl no weaponarmour crafting at all equipment upgrades handled by a shop cooking and deco pieces are just click to create super simplistic and uninteractive that said there is one area of it where it is ahead of both rf and fl
decoration in addition to the ability to lay fences paths etc you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm buildings rather then the usual fixed locations when you unlock them except your house  greenhouse you are free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both craftable  collectable largely anywhere you want on the farm  to some extent all over the town as well doesnt compare with say ultima or a minecraftterraria clone omission intentional but its a big step up within this genre 

festivals far behind rf once youve seen them once most the time you want to skip festivals in stardew they are mostly just low interaction cut scenes that waste your entire day even when the festival says it will end at 2pm youll get home at 10pm day over you cant give gifts go shopping or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival days and very few of the festivals will attending offer any kind of benefit the townsfolk dont really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attended at all or not

story behind rf  fl the story is very simple and very lightly applied the one interesting aspect of it is it seems to make a social commentary on small town independents vs corporate growth culture but its doesnt seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour it just complements two different playstyles respectively
the plot really boils down to if your characters presence improves the lives of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of 2 years or not the hands off approach is great if you dont want the game jamming plot events down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim but it means when you are looking for context it is relying entire on the depth of its character interactions where it is sadly lacking compared to its rivals 
these arent shallow characters but the arcs are short and arbitrary and there is very little individual interaction throughout some scripted events are cool but like the festivals the characters have no real self awareness of how they went down after the fact

collection on par or better then rffl behind animal crossing p
good potential here museum collection will be expanded in updates too

artmusic subjective but good quality regardless

overall if you are looking for a story based game with more interactive gameplay mechanics its a fantasy life is a better choice as far as farming sim specifically goes rune factory has more depth and still stands as personal best in genre i havent mentioned polish until now as although stardew is behind all competitors this is day 4 since release and there have been no less then 4 patches fixing most major issues and many smaller ones when you consider this game was made by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive qa its unsurprising launch has been a little shaky but regular patching will fix this edit  largely has an advantage of a pc release do i recommend it absolutely it might not be best in genre but its a solid entry has the potential to improve and is definitely already the best on the pc platform and by extension steam

if the genre appeals to you get it easily worth the money

you can marry people to make up for how lonely you are in real life so like thats cool and stuff

when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss gazes also into you  friedrich nietzsche 

some people may have told you that stardew valley is a chill game about farming and making friends someone might have told you that this is an easy going relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone even those who dont normally play video games those people were wrong for me stardew valley is not really a game at all it is a mirror reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition and my own inability to escape it 

at the time of this review i have logged 114 hours into this game i have completed the community center in its entirety and i have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency i make millions of dollars each season and for no good reason i continue pushing just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become i have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily if you asked i would likely only be able to name 5 npcs at best i almost never go to the town events and have often found them to simply be obstacles or annoyances in my personal quest for power  this game may be relaxed for some but for me it is war  there shall be no item left unpurchased no crop left ungrown and no slime left unslain i am become death destroyer of worlds

if you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power this game is for you conversely if you just want to have a cute little farm and roleplay a simple but idyllic rural fantasy this game is probably also for you either way if you value your mental health or maintaining actual productivity the abyss is best left ungazed upon

#####

the new update promises to improve the quality of your marriage doesnt work my wife is still pretty upset i play stardew valley so much

#####

at first ive added this game to my wishlist because it got really popular so i got interested in it
later during christmas i got it as a gift from a close friend and it stayed untouched for a while as i was simply playing other games but lately my depression have taken turn for the worse and ive lost any will to play games
one day when i was feeling especially bad ive decide to try this game only because it seemed easy and i needed something to make my mind busy 
to my surprise this game helped without realising ive spent several hours taking care of my virtual farm and and for the first time in weeks i felt calm happy even since then it has become my safe place i go to when i feel really down
in short i really recommend this game if youre looking for something relaxing and if you know anyone who is going through hard times show them this game it might also help them

tldr  1010  great for anyone feeling depressed

#####

this game saved my life

i am 27

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side 

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as 

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

edit

a lot of people were upset i didnt share the things i enjoyed about the game in detail below you will find my personal experience in the short amount of time i spent playing

i spent most of my time fighting slimes with a sword and mining the ore in the dungeon haha but i also made some money off plants i didnt spend much time getting to know the townsfolk i got irritated that weeds kept growing in my garden but i kept plucking them and it was sort of rewarding to keep my map weed free thats about all i can say other than digging up treasures that would show up in the dirt i had just planted some plant that cost me like 1000 gold and i built a water irrigation system around that and my other plants it was struck by lightning shortly after lol my best friend actually played for several hours with me which was unexpected and since we shared gold he and i kept screwing each other over for fun i just saw an update that may be fixing that issue however and either way i intend to pick up the game again and play it much more in depth when my winter season comes and work slows down my 20 hours of enjoyment

#####

this game took my soul oh yeah play stardew valley a cute little farming simulator the event that occurred next nobody could have predicted an event of great magnitude and catastrophic cost i have dedicated the past month to achieving all 40 achievements this game throws at you it starts out easy oh yeah get 50000 gold oh nice cook 25 recipes however what they dont tell you is the majority of the achievements are only gained at the end and i dont use the word end lightly it took me 3 in game years to achieve this feat yes it can be done in two but at this point 2 years 3 years 10 years it all feels the same the monotonous tasks of filling casks with fruit to make wine grinding for the mythic prismatic shards it takes so long and none of these tasks are boring or unfun the entire time i was thrilled but i lost a part of myself somewhere along the journey something that i will never get back maybe it was when i accidentally spent all my qi gems on 250 qi seasoning or maybe it was the time i misclicked a mega bomb after finishing designing a part of my farm wherever whenever i lost that part of myself doesnt matter its gone for good all we can do now is look to the future keep our heads up and keep on marching maybe one day i may wake up and it will all feel like a bad dream and only then will i be able to rejoin society as a normal person once more someone not scarred by the wound only stardew valley could inflict maybe i will feel okay again maybe

1010 would play again

#####

ok so far from my game this is what i got
 farming for first week
 mayor tells me to socialize with the townfolk
 decide to talk to random people
 lots of talking
 finally think i met everyone
 try to interact with trashcan
 find a salad in trash untouched
 girl sees me digging in trash
 girl gets grossed out from me digging in the trash
 get mad decide to follow her
 catch her walking towards lake
 turns out shes pretty
 want to know how to marry her
 find out that i can gift people
 dont know what to gift
 remembered i had salad from the trash that she saw me grab
 give salad to her
 she loves it
 advance a year or two later
 me and girl are married

is this how true love works

1010 would dig in trash again

#####

farm


#####

literally the best cozy game ever made i recommend it to literally everyone i know who plays video games

#####

a game about being closer to nature and your neighbors but is highly addictive and is keeping me indoors and alone the irony is not lost on me

#####

to start off by saying that i avoided this game for years is an understatement  i thought this would not be enjoyable for me at all and the saddest part of that comes when i say i was judging this game based on its name  when i got it i began playing it reluctantly but found it an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience  now im 1000 addicted  its got a fun dynamic and interesting storyline

#####

just one more day and im off to bed

okay tomorrow is abigails birthday i should give her a present and then im really going to bed

wait a minute my pumpkins are almost ripe i should probably wait a couple of days so i can sell them for a nice profit

those pumpkins were worth a lot of money i think its about time i upgrade my pickaxe and then i can go explore the mines for a bit just gotta wait a couple of days so i can pick it up from the blacksmith

got the pickaxe time to go into the mine hm i made it to level 25 today i bet i can go way deeper if i bring a bunch of food with me tomorrow

got to level 60 sweet found some gold ore down there as well just one more day

i made some gold bars now i can upgrade my pickaxe to gold okay one more day

wow mining is way faster now just one more day

oh fuck its 6am

bshort review versionb
this is what i did for thousands of hours in stardew valley
i worked on this guide since the first release
ive tested 477 items for 15741 times to 33 villagers
ive chopped tons of woods
ive smashed tons of stones
ive reset the game for hundreds of times
and i almost lost this guide because my hard disk corrupted
in case of another disaster
so ive to release this halfway works
whatever i currently have

i believe wikis info are slightly inaccurate thats why i make my own data references you can still refer to wiki if some info is missing in this guide this guide will be continuously updated when i have free time i may be busy at life but ill try to push updates to this guide as multiplayer mode rolling up soon i will include that as well

once i played harvest moon back to nature on playstation 1 and harvest moon friends of mineral town in gameboy advance then i continued to play hmfomt in visualboy advance in pc gba4ios for ios and gameboid for android i went for plantations mining fishing feeding animals wooing all the cute girls unlimited fun hours

dude which girl are you chasing
elli
just pass your game cartridge to me for a day ill make her grow to red heart in no time
then help me to get 999999999g for vacation house

we swapped gba game cartridges grinding it all the time after school hours that was my childhood memories

it all began when a friend of mine told me about stardew valley which arrives into steam store a game that packs most of harvest moon features which i played back from ten years time i went on checking at steam store apparently it looks similar as harvest moon but i doubt how fun it is all the while the only farming simulator i loved was harvest moon none other than that thankfully my friend borrowed his steam library to me for the first two hours i was surprised that finally finally a real farming simulator on pc platform we do no longer running on emulators

so the first month as usual i cleared my land planting parsnips and then went hunting for extra berries and grasses but alas what i noticed inside was totally blew my mind no grasses but with different loots and proper item names dandelion daffodil spring onion leek grapes hazelnuts and then theres bus stop an overhauled open town that doesnt vertically or horizontally aligned compared to old harvest moon quests fresh storylines tons of letters and goodies in my mailbox combat mode in mines and minecarts

this stardew valley is a new fresh farming simulator at first im at lost but since im an exharvest moon addict i still can keep up with the crops however challenges turn in which you have to defend your crops from overgrown weeds or crow attacks something new you can feel it in my first run i used to be a monopolist spent all my money on seeds and gained maximum profits but then the funny part i placed almost more than 20 scarecrows to protect my crops

ive no idea how far a scarecrow range can cover how to simultaneously plant and harvest crops how to organise items and much more in my thoughts there might be steam guide that helps players to play better it took me few minutes to load a whole guide with heavy images images are wonderful but still a lack of some details and much to my disappointment lots of guides in steam community are heavily plagiarised with the assistance from wiki

ten years ago as far as i remembered game guides for wiki hardly existed or maybe theres one remember how we used cc cheat codes ign walkthroughs gamefaqscom and many more old sites veteran players are very wellversed at this most guides are solely written in text format the tradition of writing text guide is fading no comprehensive steam guide for stardew valley community ever had done this

i stopped my game in the middle of winter year 1 over the months i compiled all items and complete gifting day by day data by data is being added to my works one day my portable disk went corrupted and thankfully my only backup still resided in my local disk thus ive made my final decision to post my works in gamefaqscom and steam community as what youve seen right now

i as a fan of harvest moon and stardew valley would like to thank all of the public contributors who had spent years to compile and posted detailed online walkthroughs for everyone to enjoy hm games and now were moving on to stardew valley i wanted to do the same extensive guide for stardew valley also not forget to thank all my close friends who had helped me to test and verify game data too as i continue to compile the remaining data your feedbacks are greatly appreciated

feels like im relieving back some good ol memories soon ill have my own printed stardew valley guidebook on my bookshelf for my collection maybe ill be playing this for another ten years thanks stardew valley

#####

this game resonated deep within my psyche and awoke ancestral memories from uncountable past generations of farmers time immemorial 

the feeling was so strong that i completely altered my life plans bought a small farm in the middle of diddledo nowhere and am more or less living the game irl however i am so busy learning how to farm that i dont have time to play stardew valley anymore

thank you concernedape your little pixel game literally changed my life and now i wont starve while western civilization collapses

#####

you know what game doesnt need my review stardew valley theres nothing i could possibly say about it that other people have not said yet but its criminally unfair to have played so much of it without rating it so im going to rate it

if you enjoy resource scarcity games without strict deadlines a charming colorful world with thoughtful characters logistical planning and minmaxing strategy  i mean its all here if youve played graveyard keeper or littlewood or harvest moon from back in the day and liked them at all  you owe it to yourself to play stardew valley it is insanely cheap for the amount of value concernedape has packed into it and he continues to develop interesting fun new wrinkles in regular updates every time i start over i find things i missed before

#####

would you recommend this game to other players

i would threaten coax and even pay people off to play this game and i am confident that theyll admire it just as much as i do to its very core the only emotion i feel for this game is complete and unreserved admiration therefore if you ever find yourself unsure about whether to purchase this game or not rest assured you have my word that it will undoubtedly be one of the best decisions of your life

so dont delay experiencing the greatness of this game any longer join me in embracing this extraordinary game
