wow i honestly dont even know where to start with this review i have not been blown away by a game on this level in such a long time and i feel somewhere in my heart i wont find another game to match this feeling at all i had high expectations for nierautotmata but it surpassed it in every single way the story was told beautifully and was very complex and deep the music for the game was absolutely stunning and easily one of the best ost i have heard in a game i dont believe there was a single piece of music from this game that i didnt like im going to try and keep this review fair with my pros and cons with it as well as avoid any major spoilers as much as possible

h1storyh1

i cant delve too far into the story without spoiling anything but i can give a little insight on it nierautomata is a sequel from the original nier game but its not connected where you have to play the original nier to understand this game from what ive read as i did not play the original nier this game takes place thousands of years after the original there are a few tidbits that will make reference to the original and a few characters from the original do make a return but nothing that will hamper you from playing the game the story starts off about a war between androids and machines  who were created by aliens humanity had to escape to the moon in order to survive and sent androids to rid the machines and aliens so life on earth can resume once again as you progress through the game you will see how deep it really begins to hit how little things that seemed insignificant at first actually play a deeper role in the meaning of the story taro yoko did a fantastic job at a story that really toys with the what does it mean to be human aspect and that made the story that much stronger and hold a bigger connection with it
 
h1graphicsh1

the graphics for this game were absolutely beautiful from the crisp feel of the grassland to how clear the water looks excellent lens flair from the sun and overall textures of your surroundings i will admit which i will touch more in the cons there are some areas that look lackluster graphic wise however the overall world of nier has beautiful graphics that really set the mood for what is happening at that moment 

h1soundtrackh1

this soundtrack was phenomenal as i said before i cant think of a single piece of music from this game that i didnt like i am honestly one of the people who hate vocals in game music except for maybe credits or a cutscene but then i played this game and the vocals with the music blew me away i really love the idea they did with the music where it will change based on the mood of the game whether its a scripted event or just completing a quest a quest or scripted event will change based on the mood of that moment its fantastic and it makes the game have a stronger connection as during those moments you see how music can quickly change your overall mood within the game and whats going to happen next

h1gameplayh1

very interesting with how this game has played out its a hack and slash game but also carries aspects of bullet hell open world exploration and of course an rpgjrpg a few of my friends have compared aspects with the game having a feel of dark souls and metal gear rising revengeance which i wont argue their points with that

one thing i really liked is the network system that was added in basically if you choose to connect to that any player who has died in a certain spot in the world you will find their body which you can choose to retrieve and in turn will give you a certain amount of gold and a temporary boost to 3 stats you can also choose to revive them and have them as a temporary ally to help you fight until they either die or blow up from being alive for too long or you leaving them behind by dashing faster than they can hope to keep up with you

h1consh1

onto the cons which i know can either break a deal for people but i want to be fair with this review

 the game had a bumpy launch i wont even try to deny that it was bumpy as it there were some users who couldnt play the game on a 960m 960 970 rx 480 and even the pascal gpus people were mentioning either really low fps white screens or flat out crashes this had me worried as i was planning to play the game on 4k while most of these people were on 1080p and having these issues thankfully this was not an issue for me and 4k ran without any issues some people in the community have made their own little fixes for now that can help you play the game or get the desired fps if youre playing on a lowerend system the devs are working on their own patches on this game to get everything up and running for everyone

 cut scenes are capped to 30 fps capped fps is a word that will turn a lot of people off and i dont blame you the cut scenes would look absolutely stellar if they were uncapped even with the cap i love how the graphics look for cut scenes i can only wait until theyre uncapped some users have mentioned the audio isnt fully correct in the cut scenes and that fps can also tank i have not had any of those happen to me but i want to mention it just as a small heads up

 apparently the game was locked at 900 resolution for users even if you had a monitor with a much higher resolution this wasnt the case for me but others have to use 3rd party programs such as borderless window in order to have the max resolution of their monitor

 earlier i mentioned there were some parts of the game that had poor graphic spots most of the time i noticed this by windows where the sun was showing in where the glare from the sun would look a little blurry andor pixelated the spoilercastle in the forestspoiler is the best example i can think of with this issue other than that ive only really seen it a few times when near water and at a weird camera angle

 this personally isnt a con for me but i know it will be a con to others this game can be tedious at the start you will be doing a lot of back tracking until you progress far enough into the story where you can freely transport between places you have discovered quests will have you running back and forth item collection will require you to grind enemies to further increase your level and give you items to survive at the later levels if youre someone who enjoys this stuff it wont be a con at all for you but i know some people prefer to play games as quickly as possible without having to grind or backtrack a lot

h1summaryh1

 fantastic story that has a deep meaning behind it and really sucks you into the world of nier a very serious touching and at times has its funny moments

 music that keeps the mood and setting of the game which further delivers the experience to you and makes the moment feel more alive that it would be without the music

 beautiful graphics that really shine no matter where youre at in the world giving you a whole new outlook on what is around you at those times and scenery you wont forget

 gameplay was a perfect mix of adventure attacking and of course story telling enemies scale with your level and the world around you changes as time goes on

 spoiler2bs thighs thospoiler

h1conclusionh1 

nier was the perfect game for me honestly it messed me up after finishing what routes ive finished already because i feel in my heart i wont find a game to match this story i have never felt connected to a story at all especially on an emotional level but nier honestly went above and beyond my exceptions with everything that came with it it has easily become one of if not my favourite game its a game i will always cherish to own and be a part of the story gameplay music 1010

i honestly cannot recommend a game more than nierautomata and i hope taro yoko gets the recognition he deserves from this masterpiece

just some tips before you buy and play on pc

1 must install far mod to make the game run smoother without frame drops and stuttering doesnt matter how highend is your setup square enix did a bad pc port of this game

2 play with a controller


h1 24th december 2020 edit h1  in case someone is getting confused on how to install and configure far mod properly id strongly suggest you to read the following guide u thoroughly u  urlhttpswwwnexusmodscomnierautomatamods29 httpswwwnexusmodscomnierautomatamods29 url 

im personally using far v 7014 and it has helped me fix all of the above issues that ive had before

#####

lets get this out of the way first the game itself is great but the port is terrible the vanilla client makes everything lag beyond point of comfort and causes all sorts of issues luckily for us pc users urlhttpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid914437196the far modurl does wonders i wouldnt advise playing without it ive spent an hour just tweaking the graphical settings but it was worth it i managed to achieve smooth  fluid gameplay and played 93 hours without a single hitch no thanks to square enix

as for the game nierautomata is at its core a jrpg but it incorporates several other genres like a platformer bullet hell spectacle fighter shootem up etc and it blends everything surprisingly well camera perspective will often shift between 3rd person view top down view and a 25d leftright platformer view core gameplay consist of following the story doing side quests exploring the world to find secrets or extra loot collecting and upgrading weapons fighting multiple enemies at once  impressive bosses and adjusting character loadouts where you slot plugin chips granting you wide variety of enhancements

overall the game is absolutely mindblowing the visuals are beautiful the music is epic  astounding gameplay is amazingly varied  feels fresh it positively surprises at every corner after just an hour it managed to both awe me and make me tear up but the overarching narrative is not stellar if you read scifi  cyberpunk you probably already read many vastly better stories than niera if you read philosophy youll find it quite shallow in comparison basically the game just glances over some concepts as well as keeps most of its characters a bit onenote however what nierautomata does exceptionally well is that it strings together series of emotionally loaded segments each story segment lasts probably around 12h and it has everything self contained and well executed with a new objective you go somewhere are greeted with breathtaking vistas and motivated to act by one of the most invigorating soundtracks ive ever heard usually there is urgency andor intrigue and everything wraps up in a satisfying minifinale so even though the main narrative is on the weaker side is not a serious detriment because the flow was designed with gaming sessions in mind which for a game is a good thing since youll experience enjoyment and payout every time you sit down to play

the gameplay is fluid the characters are animated really well  their mobility is off the charts its a pleasure to control them you attack the enemies both with melee weapons and fire ranged pod at the same time the dodge mechanic is a bit overpowered it is instant interrupts whatever animation the character was doing the iframes are quite long and there is no stamina bar meaning you can just dodge constantly and will avoid pretty much everything as long as youre pressing the button there are plenty of plugin chips that expand your options like time slowing on dodge cutting through bullets to make them explode countering sends portion of damage back to the attacker taunting risk reward glass cannon system where damage output increases both for the protagonist and the enemy etc there is a limit of what you can slot the upgraded chips take more space so youll find yourself constantly tinkering with the system as you cant just slot all the best ones not too mention there is just too many of them you can swap them out on the fly as well as create different loadouts for different situations things like auto item pickup or showing chests on the map are plugin chips too as well as displaying minimap hp bars or cooldown timers so youre not only optimizing combat capabilities but also balancing them out with utility and convenience

on top of customizing the gameplay via plugins there are 3 different characters to play as protagonists 2b is a combat type that can use 2 weapons  many combos and is your starting character 9s is hacking oriented he still can fight but is slower and less effective than 2b or a2 his hacking capabilities are overpowered though if youre good at the hacking minigame you can basically one shot miniboss enemies and take large chunks of boss hp in a single hacking blow not to mention remote control enemies or make them fight for you a2 is also a combat type with one of attacks replaced by a convenient taunt she has the longest and best looking dash as well as unique berserk mode which allows dishing out large amount of damage while her hp constantly drains its fun to try to build her with various hp enhancing and regenerating chips for uninterrupted berserk mode as long as there are enemies around 

to play through all the content some side quests intel or activities are tied to a character or particular point of the main story you need to experience 3 routes route a where you control 2b is just a bit less than half of the game and while route b retells that same initial part of the story but from 9s perspective you get access to additional cutscenes  more data providing better insight and filling some of the blanks in the sections where 2b  9s were split apart you get new content mostly revolving around 9s unique playstyle route c is the continuation to the events that happened to 2b  9s in ab is vital to the plot and provides most explanations from the c ending you just need to reload the save and pick different option for remaining canon endings de also after route c you unlock chapter select so you can go back to any point of the game and finish up either quests you missed or your collection

i had a blast definitely worth playing

this game is a masterpiece yes its imperfect and has defaults but if it reaches you it goes deep and youre not likely to forget it ever on that somewhat random chance i recommand this game

now lets talk about perfection and imperfection starting by imperfection to act as a fair warning 

 the technical aspect of the game seems not quite on par with whats expected nowadays and by that i mean that many people have reported technical issues going from annoying to making the game unplayable myself i stumbled unto two main problems  white screen of death when starting the game solved by updating my graphic drivers and a couple random crashes so i guess i was lucky to get into the just annoyed gang
 the game is not accessible many people state that it can be played whitout having played the first nier and while it is kinda true the worlds background is awesome and knowing at least the synopsis of the previous game increases the overall experience a lot in the same spirit the game has no autosave feature but a hard and old savepoints system that unlocks only after the first 45 minutes yes it means that you have to sit and play 45 minutes nonstop before saving the tutorial is minimal and thus you can easily die during those 45 minutes before having the chance to learn how to control the game however this questionnable decision is in fact deeply rooted in the core design of the game its one clear exemple of immersion over practicality while i criticize it i also encourage you to accept it and push through as it is really worth it

to sum it up  yes this game will require some efforts from your side perhaps more than what it should and certainly not what were accustomed to nowadays even so its worth it because now ill talk about maybe not perfection but greatness

 graphically i always place art design and coherence above technical prowess you can criticize the graphics all you want but the art design is topnotch and im not only talking about the fanservicy first look of the game but about the quality of pretty much everything else from character design to animations the style is welldefine and brings something special an identity to the title
 but that identity wouldnt be complete without the beautiful soundtrack one of the best ive ever heard one that will stick with you for a long time akin to the legendary ghost in the shell theme if you happen to know it thats the kind of soundtrack you have here
 after the look and the sound we have the gameplay and let me tell you that its a stunning achievement nier automata provides one of the most customizable experience i know combined with thematic reflexions about the video game medium just that yes you can overlevel and make the game incredibly easybut you can also just select a harder difficulty andor not use certain core interface element like showing your life bar platinium games has a very good reputation for crafting action combat and they do deliver here with a very satisfying amount of weapon and skills that you can combine in different playstyles and just watching your character fight is a feast for the eyes now just let me ramble a bit about people complaining about the difficulty  at any point of the game there is no difficulty achievement with the amount of care this game has been made its not an oversight its just that you the player have to choose how you are playing ill admit there is no ingame guide about it it comes from tweaks you have to make will i go for all the sidequests will i farm the best items will i play in very hard only one answer  try it until you find your style and if youre not happy push through and make your own rules so rarely have you that amount of freedom over your experience
 and finally the story while it may not be the best the narration in itself is very well done and is articulated around twists and revelations and yes it may seem artificial and even weak at times but thats not even whats the most important about it because this story touches philosophy not the kind you find in books but the kind you stumble on when you stop your everyday life to think a bit about your life and your place in the universe sure there are references to known philosophers but the philosophic and metaphysics thoughts and concepts presented are not dry and complex theyre intertwined in the narrative making them much more accessible and engaging this imho is the biggest achievement of nier automata its showing that entertainment can be thoughtprovoking that video games and games in general are important and have a rightful place alongside other forms of arts like literature or filmmaking

so yes i genuinely think this is a masterpiece and hope it will have a big impact on the gaming industry because there have already been incredible video games in the past but never with that amount of selfawareness this game is a weird case of fulfilled ambition without pretense and one last time i encourage you to look past the imperfections yes its worth it

#####

1010 would existential crisis again

in longer yes the pc port is absolutely below mediocre you need to install 2 mods to make this game work on pc far aka special k and naiom that is the nier automata input overhaul mod which is 100 mandatory if you play this game with mouse and keyboard

edit after the latest upgrade patch both mods still work tho you may have to update them to the latest version also make sure the prerequisites are all installed properly

once youve got those 2 up and running which is childs play easy you can strap yourself in for a ride this game explores existentialism to a tee from nietzsche over hegel to de beauvoir it does not shy away from referencing big players in the philosophical branch that concerns itself with the question of human existence plus its just a fun game to boot

and that e ending if this whole experience is worth anything its that whatever you do avoid reading about it before youve reached that part of the game even if youre normally someone who doesnt care for spoilers

in conclusion buy it this game is absolutely worth supporting with your money no matter what you think of square enix as a publisher show the industry that we need more games like this

heres some insight for anyone looking to buy this game on pc

i highly advise anyone that downloads this game to immediately download the far fix automata resolution patch alongside the game it fixes many graphical issues that can arise during gameplay which can include whitescreen crashes framerate drops fullscreen issues etc the only issues ive had with the game include fps drops in certain locations and the inability to force the game to run fullscreen
guide to the entire patch can be found urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid914437196hereurl 

if you simply cannot get the game to run even with the far patch steam refund policy states
  you can refund a game within 14 days after it is purchased
  you can refund a game with less than 2 hours of playtime
full steam policy statement urlhttpssupportsteampoweredcomkb_catphpsc003529141c6e69949098f403c0f387eid60hereurl

also the pc controls are shit i highly recommend a controller to play this game if youre looking for something inexpensive i recommend buying a logitech f310 or some cheap chinese knockoff controller


on to the actual review

all of that out of the way the game was fantastic a lengthy story with a good amount of playtime to put into the game the dialog and characters were wellmade however one problem i had was that there was not always a lot of backstory to some of the side characters in the game for instancespoileradam and eve dont have much covered in their backstory nothing on what happened to them in the past besides them killing off their creatorsspoilerthe same applied withspoilerdevola and popola where the only actual backstory was a textfilled story only stating about what had happened to their fellow unitsspoilerall of that being said the backstory on some of the characters either lacked or had no content at all a bit disappointing for a game considered istory richi

the combat was pretty damn smooth there are a good number of weapon types to choose from the includes light swords heavy swords spears and even fists chipsets are well designed and can make you very op chipsets give you passive abilities that can affect health damage and even hacking abilities during gameplay you can even combine chips to design much more powerful ones to equip

most if not all of the enemies ingame are too easy to face besides bosses theres not a single enemy that hard to face both early and late into the game the bosses themselves usually can only be fought using your ranged gatling gun theres barely any closeranged combat with the bosses which can get pretty boring once you can avoid all of their attacks a good way to get a challenge would probably be to tune up the difficulty to something like hard which really isnt that great with hard mode you lose your autoaim ability which i would consider necessary considering to camera angles in this game are a pain sometimes and the fact that you dont deal more damage or get more loot when on a higher difficulty there is no good middle ground

there is somewhat decent content once you complete the main endings a b c d all the other ending are merely parody endings and really arent that detailed there are some hidden bosses such asspoileremil fucking level 99 requiring a constant grind and the ceos of both square enix and platinum games which you can only get through the dlcspoilerbut thats about it side quests can be interesting and somewhat tedious at times but have some really interesting small stories to them at times

overall id say the game was worth the paythrough though it was clever and still managed to bring a lot of different mechanics the story was well done and the combat was fluid and offered a lot of different choices i would recommend it to at least experience once

#####

came for the thighs left with the cries

#####

brought some tissues but never thought id use them for tears

#####

start playing because the main character is kinda hot leave with depression and an existential crisis

1010 would reccomend

also for the love of god play past the first two endings if you want to see the actual game please

#####

came for the thighs left with the cries

#####

i dont do reviews probably going to be my only steam review ever i estimate exactly 4 people will ever read this but just putting it out there this is one of the most beautiful experiences in life ive had so far literally nothing ive read watched or played has actually made me cry truly but after finshing ending e i cried simply for how beautiful this work of art was

h1porting issuesh1
as pretty much everyone already knows its not a good pc port there are several issues with the port the most commonly mentioned being the full screen resolution bug but theres several other issues like nonnative resolution for ao and bloom ps2 quality potato textures and the mouse lingering on the screen at all times even when using a controller thankfully urlhttpsgithubcomkaldaienfarreleases kaldaiens far mod urlfixes the vast majority of those issues while the urlhttpswwwpcgamingwikicomwikinier_automata pcgw url and urlhttpswwwnexusmodscomnierautomatamods5 gpunitys texture pack url resolve the rest once youve put a bit of effort into fixing the pc port its probably the definitive edition of the game its just a shame its not that out of the box

h1story lore and quest designh1
the story is absolutely phenomenal its one of the most unique techniques of storytelling that ive ever experienced in a video game the story is told throughout multiple playthroughs from the perspectives of different characters the first and second playthroughs are very similar and can feel a tad bit repetitive but the third playthrough is substantially different and effectively the second half of the story 

unfortunately i dont have many positive remarks about the side quests theres a fuckton of side quests in this game most of them narratively contribute to worldbuilding but gameplaywise are just fetch quests so they felt mostly like a chore to me i did practically all of them leaving only the arenas incomplete i honestly dont feel that most of the side content was a great use of my time 

the nier universe is pretty fascinating ive never played the original nier game but ive read through urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikinier_video_game the wikipedia summary url and watched several urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvenweboho7aw recapanalysis videos url and i feel like i have a decent grasp on the story now automata takes place thousands of years after the original game so its more akin to a spinoff or spiritual successor than a direct sequel but theres still plenty of references and several characters from the original game that i wouldnt have recognized were it not for reading up on the previous game 

h1gameplayh1
the moment to moment gameplay is so fucking good i went into it expecting a character action game that necessitated learning combos like bayonetta but its not that type of game its more of a hacknslash than it is character action that said the combat is amazing especially after expanding your deck of plugin chips character upgrades each character controls differently as well which kept combat feeling moderately  fresh throughout the multiple playthroughs 

h1soundtrackh1
holy fuck this game has a godtier soundtrack the tracks tie in so well to the storytelling and emotional beats of the game its just so fucking good its hard to pick a favorite track but since im putting myself on the spot to do just that im going to have to go with urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3wdpikiaqqc the sound of the end url

h1conclusionh1
i spent far more time with this game than i expected to a great portion of my time was spent doing side quests that i dont think were a valuable use of time but every time i came back to the main quest i just fell in love with the game the world and the characters ultimately im walking away from this game sincerely hoping that square enix and yoko taro can put together a sequel thats even bigger and better

you can dodge the bullets but you cant dodge the tears

come for booba and leave with sorrow

#####

where to even start with this game i just finished 100ing it after 68 hours and i am in a state of pure awe of what i just witnessed playing through this game

this will be a different type of review than my other ones because i have a lot of things to get off my chest after going through this it will have procons at the end but it will be a very personal review

i will start by saying that i havent played a yoko taro directed game before but i have heard a lot of great things about his weird world that he has created that links between multiple games and franchises nierdrakengard respectively so i was really excited when i heard that square decided to give him a good budget and a very well known studio for their character action games platinum to make a sequel to the original nier from the previous generation so without any doubt and after hearing that it got a pc release i instantly purchased it because i was fascinated by what yoko taro could do

and what a fantastic job he and his team at platinum games have done a game that shouldnt be passed on by anyone because it does something that i personally havent encountered in a game before which i wont spoil here because you have to experience it yourself

imagine a platinum game that has exquisite combat a director that is so masterful in how he presents the story giving small information and tidbits as you go along and a soundrack by a composer that is well known keiichi okabe that you take a few moments from playing the game just to listen to the musicits that good

i wont go much into the story of the game because its very easy to spoil but the story and overarching plot is so well done and it makes you question a lot of things about humanity emotions life itself and many other things

now onto the more technical side of things i will go for proconsconclusion and a small ps at the end of it

pro

 unforgettable story yoko taro at his finest
 outstanding soundtrack keiichi okabe
 fluid combat gameplay a la bayonettametal gear rising revengeance
 multiple weaponscombination alongside a robust rpg system that includes crafting leveling skills etc
 good cast of main characters and npcs
 multiple endings  true ending
 good pc port turn off aa if you want performance boostmsaa ruins your framerate
 open world
 side quests some of them are worth doingfor the rest see cons
 arbitrary resolution support
 60fps albeit still locked and cant go higher
 the color palette of this game although it looks a bit washed out it fits with the setting
 multiple difficulty settings for both casuals and hardcore players that want to test their mettle
 codex for enemiesweaponsitemsstory for weapons that unlock via upgrading them

cons

 side quests that include a lot of backtracking i think this was intentional so you can keep your focus on the main narrative
 30fps cutscenes that are locked at 900p and they sometimes also drop in framerate they are jarring when transitioning from a 60fps in game scene to a 30fps with drops in a cutscene
 a few technical bugs regarding fullscreen that can be patched
 grinding for materials and chips aka bonuses is required if you want to play at higher difficulty levels

conclusion and overall thoughts

this has been an eye opening experience that i will never forget from the amazing soundtrack by keiichi okabe to the wonderful directing and story by yoko taro and the combat by platinum gamesthey all mesh together to create one of the best action rpgs that i have ever played yes the fetch quests can be tedious and grinding can be a pain at times to achieve everything this game has to offer but i did not waver and was fascinated by this world 

i really hope this game sells well enough so that square greenlits a remaster of nier 1 on pc 

ps thank you square enix yoko taro keiichi okabe platinum games  everyone involved for creating this amazing game 

pps if youve read until this point i want to thank you for doing so and urge you to go and buy this game because its one of those games that doesnt deserve to be forgotten in a slew of big releases horizon zelda mass effect andromeda and the reason why its going to be my goty this year

i will now post a quote from jim sterlings review that resonated with me so much that i cannot state it better as an ending to this lenghty review

nier itself is important it is as far as im concerned historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story if i had my way every budding game developer would play this game to the point of acquiring endings a b c d and e before acquiescing to its final and alarmingly direct request

few games are able to showcase the power of the medium like nier automata

if history forgets this game then fuck history

#####

you ever finish a game and feel empty inside sitting there staring at your computer screen thinking did i beat the game or did the game beat me i have never been so emotionally invested in a game and i dont think i ever will again  or at least not to this level yoko taro and his teams games have always been thoughtful but often broken and underfunded automata is neither of those things

yes the game has some issues out of the box  namely clunky mousekeyboard controls if you dont have a controller and the mediocreps4portquality crashing and such neither of these is a problem which is absolutely gamebreaking  if you have the patience to spend maybe an hour before you start playing to fix both things with the means quite readily available online then they shouldnt really be issues at all as such if you look past the couple fixable problems and spend the time to play the game all the way through youll be rewarded with nothing short of a gotyworthy masterpiece

first the good nothing that im going to gush about but good enough to warrant mentioning

the graphics and scenery are the right balance between looks and performance  nothing to gawk at but more than enough to make you appreciate the games setting while still giving you more than enough fps to play comfortably i really loved the overall aesthetic of the game even if some of the visuals were lacking at times the amusement park might just be one of my favorite locations in any game ever  the overall ambience of the place combined with my favorite song from the ost is fantastic the first time you head to the park is a really memorable moment  its really a sight to behold

gameplaywise the game israther unique while the combat is pretty straight forward for the most parts the podspod programs and the entire chips concept is a really cool mechanic which can really adapt to the playstyle of the player the amount of chips available and the variety of pod skills combined with the variety in weapons spread across four types means you can go in so many different directions with your setup depending on the character and the way you want to play them 

where the game shines however iswell basically everything else 

ill preface my spiel by saying that more than one person i know who bought this game thought it was over by the end of route a andor b its not route a sets the stage for the story route b builds on it via a different perspective and hints at what is to come and route c rips your goddamn heart out and smashes it with a sledgehammer you dont just play through the story of this game you experience it  it draws you in plays with your emotions and spits you out unceremoniously its almost as if taro speaks to you on a visceral level  the androids dont have the luxury of mercy  why should you

the androids you take control of arent unaware of their fate they know they were built solely to fight to protect humanity from the scourge of the aliens and the machines  theyre soldiers after all so how does one live when their lifes path is predetermined how can someone possibly make meaning out of their existence with that cloud of inevitability hanging over their head nier automata  and the android trio you play as  confronts these questions with a somber poignant and at times downright tragic storyline  a story which is as a whole next to none taro spins an eloquently heartbreaking tale which only gets more emotional and heartwrenching the further in you go as aforementioned there is no way you will ever understand the full impact of the story if you dont play through the game the full three times at the very least and even then theres still more to learn about the world the machines and the androids by doing sidequests and gathering data via items scattered around the world and by exploring the backstories of some of the major npcs 

as an extension of the story with the game evolving through each playthrough so do the characters on an abandoned planet now overrun by the enemy the androids grapple with the truth that they must live with minimal guidance from the human creators they have been tasked with protecting all while the machines they fight begin to emulate the humans of past  forming religions governments relationships families concepts so foreign to the androids that they often fail to understand why the machines hold on to such foreign concepts on a planet which has long forgotten its previous inhabitants and yet in the midst of the endless fighting operator 6o 2bs mission control is able to almost seamlessly transition from giving 2b all kinds of dangerous missions to talking about her horoscopes and the crush she has on one of the other operators one of the side quests involves finding flowers to take a picture of to show this spacebunkerconfined girl the wonders of the world below 

its a strikingly idyllic quest which is in a sense a microcosm of the game as a whole nier automata juxtaposes both the pain of an endless mindless war with the playfulness and fleeting moments of joy  few and far between as they may be  and compresses them into a highly personal emotional story about a trio of nameless androids forbidden to express emotion who are struggling to understand themselves their purpose the ruined world theyre fighting to save and the continually evolving enemies they must hack to bits at every turn in the cruel cycle of life and death no one is safe  not from the enemy not from fear not from the unknown and especially not from themselves

but of course for all ive said about the story this game would be nothing without the powerful stirring soundtrack to accompany it every song in the soundtrack is masterfully crafted perfectly fitting for the situation or location in question enhancing the overall feel of the game at any given time in any given location emi evans use of chaos language is fantastic as ever  in case youre not familiar taro told her to predict how human language would have evolved 9000 years into the future as morgan freeman once said in shawshank redemption i have no idea to this day what they were singing about truth is i dont want to know some things are best left unsaid id like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it cant be expressed in words and makes your heart ache because of it i tell you those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream you dont always have to know the meaning of the words in a song to appreciate the song sometimes its even better to not know the meaning and let your imagination make of it what it will the music of automata will run you through the full gamut of emotions  uplifiting and cheery to dark and depressing and everything in between weight of the world is far and away my favorite song in the soundtrack and the one which will never fail to make me emotional if youve finished route c youll understand why the music is beautifully composed and its so magnificently intertwined with the game the locations the story  you cant ask for anything more from an ost 

nier automata weaves an intricate web of hope despair failure the cruelty of life the inevitability of death and rebirth it is at its essence is at its worst a maddeningly depressing tragedy that somehow improbably manages to go beyond tragedy into something much better it dramatizes the terrible cyclical nature of life while simultaneously breaking from that focus to find fleeting moments of joy and pathos within a seemingly hopeless situation in my eyes it is next to none it is the pinnacle of storytelling through the video game medium 

i implore you to see this masterpiece of a game through to its bitter end you will not regret it

glory to mankind

update no3 lol
for people who already own standard 2017 version you will be locked out from the new additional dlc that comes with 2019 game of the yohra edition
valve character accessory retro red pot skin
cardboard pod skin	grimoire weiss pod
retro grey pod skin	machine mask accessory
and 2 wallpapers

if you own only the game 2017 and didnt purchase dlc 3c3c1d119440927 for some reason and planning to buy dlc 3c3c1d119440927 for your game2017
dont expect to get new additional content as i mentioned above that comes with 2019 game of the yohra edition its a different build

you will probably never receive new dlc for free even you have paid for the previous dlc 3c3c1d119440927 right now there is no way you can buy that new dlc that comes with 2019 version unless you find a way to delete nier automata from your library and rebuy the game2019 again classic square enix

square enix didnt bother to separate the game to 2 version so it is still shown as nier automata the only thing that changed is banner or picture of this game on the right of the main page on steam

try to add new 2019 in your cart it should be mentioned that you already own game of the yohra edition but not completely 

its sad to see the lack of support from square enix 

disclaimer this is my experience as an owner of 2017 version as far as i know they are the same game that just got renamed and reduced the price so that means no performance and bugs fixing patch from 2017 to 2019 version

update it seems that if you are already owned a 2017 version its will automatically upgrade to 2019 game of the yohra edition not sure if this is a correct term anymore 

update 2 buying at your own risk 
its 2019 yohra edition and everything stays the same since day one also the game isnt working properly



i wish they could release a single patch that can improve performance issue on this game especially a game that is 2 years old after release around march 2017 its like square enix doesnt know how to handle their pc port ff13 for example was a joke i like the game btw d i mean metal gear rising bayonetta and vanquish used similar or probably the same engine and they all run very smooth on my pc and to be honest platinums engine isnt really well known for pushing your pc so hard like this game sega and konami did a great job on their pc ports

the game itself is also full of bugs i have to save and restart the game frequently
for instance resolution problem some enemies items npcs and your vehicle didnt show up during the mission at all you can fix those bugs by complete side quests in the same area to force the game to reset its main mission reload your previous save or even close the game you can complete the game for sure right now im already unlocked all main ending but you might encounter with bugs while playing the game and i mean a lotlol

do you really need to deal with this kind of stuff with this very high price game from 2017
im from thailand and its cost me 2190 and plus 490 bath on dlc or about 7015 dollar
i wish i live in america update 2019 yohra version cost about 399 us dollar

all and all i really enjoy playing it with far mod at 1024x768 a great deal lol its like the only resolution that can hit high 5060 fps pls send help oh well lets see what they will do with the 2019 yohra edition update as far as i know its the same game with a cheaper price and all dlcs were included

if you have a highend pc you shouldnt have any problem at all except for bugs 
if you are a type of person who doesnt want to associate with installing mod to boost game performance or willing to deal with this extremely buggy game by running around the maps or closing it so many times then im not sure whether i would recommend this game for you either upgrade your pc and dealing with bugs get a ps4 or xbox one version instead

for people who are looking to buy 2019 game of the yohra edition i think you should be fine everything was includedbugs as well if you are really planning to play this game on pc 
i highly recommend installing far mod to increase your frame rate and reduce a lot of issues significantly 

i not sure square enix will give platinum dev any budget to fix this port anymore its been 2 years already they must move to a new project right just people from se who are working on this pc port its like they run on their pc company like i9gtx 2080ti and think the game runs smoothly no need further improvement at alllol
i dont think console player would have any problem like this at all its just pc port that

im sure you can decide whether you gonna buy this pc port or not

i would recommend this game if you are a fan of yoko taros works

for me this pc port is barely functional but i want to support yoko taro his team as well as platinum game to create this masterpiece anyway so i will let it slide but too bad its a square enix port tt sorry for my english

#####

please dont stop playing after seeing the credits for the first time the game is literally just starting after ending a

#####

this is easily one of the best games ive played the story is a true masterpiece that takes place over 3 play throughs each from a different characters perspective the game has 26 different endings one of them being the 1 true ending which will leave those who are deeply invested in the story a shocking end one thing that really surprised me was how awesome the soundtrack is im not someone who cares about soundtracks in games but this one is definitely an exception its amazing the combat system on all 3 characters i enjoyed a lot and while i didnt really care at first for the hacking feature in play through 2 i ended up really enjoying it as there was more to it than i originally thought

while i am giving this game well deserved praise i need to mention that there is an issue with the resolution when you start up the game but it always corrects itself for me after a few minutes and the other con is unfortunately cut scenes only run at 30fps there is a well know mod that fixes both these issues which you can find pretty easily with a google search

as a fan of drakengard on the ps2 this was an epic conclusion to the series i really hope that they port over the rest of the series to steam this is by far one of the easiest recommends ive ever given

 one of those weird and perfect stories written by kojima and thatll blows your mind make you think about it a while

 summary 

this is one of the greatest games ive ever played be prepared for one hell of a story through multiple playthroughs and 26 endings ae being the main story and fz being secrets the game has 4 difficulties easy normal hard and very hard ranging from im here for the story to one hit kill with some features such as camera lock on only available in easy and normal i personally would recommend hard for a good balance of challenging combat to story

if you care about graphics or shaders those are options for you with the far mod and reshade
for the best experience id recommend playing with a controller

my final conclusion no mom i wasnt looking up the girls skirt

#####

i didnt think i would enjoy this arpg as much as i did i couldnt stop playing it till id seen and done everything its incredibly good fun to play the combat is fast and fluid the backstory is different and interesting the art design is top notch and the soundtrack alone is worth admission 
there are so many unique and well thought out ideas its clear to see just how much real effort the developers put in even the end credits has more care put into them than some entire games ive played in the past seriously

i highly recommend nier automata even at full price

h1 why do i recommend this game spoiler freeh1

b about the story and its writing b

i am typing this right after finishing the game with all major endings i have no words for what i have just experienced sure there are great games with great stories and eventually those stories reach the tv screen due to netflix or whatever but you cannot experience nier automata in any other medium apart from gaming it is something you have to live through to understand and appreciate 

the character development is a huge part of the story you need to get all the major endings to understand their psychology and motives but it is not a grind in any way infact every route is unique with unique cutscenes and storytelling and they all beautifully tie up at the end of the game by that i mean the true ending youll have to play it to find out

i can talk about the story all day but alas its a review and i must stay brief


b the mechanics and combatb

strikethe bootystrike the body physics in this game is really smooth and natural along with dynamic hair movement there are a considerable amount of weapons in this game each one is unique in design but most bigger swords have similar animations same goes for smaller swords but the different types of pod programs are what make the combat unique in my experience starting from gatling gun and missiles all the way to electric shock and force field

you can run you can dash you can jump down a building and let your pod gently glide you down you can also catch fish there are also many other things you can do but this is a spoiler free review so

some of the bosses are kinda tough even at easy difficulty especially in route c but the battles are satisfying and so worth it maybe its only difficult for me maybe because hand holding in aaa games these days has ruined me lol

so yeah the combat is really satisfying  the effects are gorgeous and each boss is unique in everyway except for the things they fire which are red and magenta orbs of energy they fire it in different unique ways and that what makes them stand out from eachother aside from their different body types

you will be controlling multiple characters at some point in the game and each character has its own unique sets of abilities and combat styles


b about the camera anglesb

the camera angle will change throughout the game and even during bossfights it is not wonky in any way but i think youll be having a great time with a controller but kb and m also works fine 
at times the perspective changes from 3d to a platformer and i just love it how you can see the actual scsle of things in 25d and appreciate the scale of the game even more


b musicb

brilliant just fing fantastic  muaah
its like a chefs kiss on his favourite dish 

the vocals and the chorus send chills up my spine during combat sometimes brings tears to my eyes while digging deep in the lore

it doesnt touch my soul it hugs it


h1 about the post patch performanceh1

i did try the game before the july patch on a different account and it was laggy and stuttery asf at times so uninstalled but i recently installed this version and noticed that many improvements have been made it still needs one more patch in my opinion but currently the performance is acceptable i still get stuuters while entering newer areas that is because i have lots of texture mods and reshade installed

if you wanna play the game and have the best experience possible far mod is still recommended i need it for my texture mods i have a laptop with a gtx 1650 and an i5 9300h i was getting 5860fps on all high settings except anti aliasing i get about 5060fps with all texture mods installed with far mod and a couple of stutters while entering new areas so its completely upto you whether you want more graphical fidelity or more performance of course decide acccording to your rig

its a shame tho that this patch took 4 years should have taken 4 weeks at max for a company like square enix in my opinion but anyways we have it now and i completely recommend this game for people with 1050ti and above


h1 about the modsh1

im using lots of texture and reshade mods along with far mod so its hard to list all of them but theres this mod helper that lets you search and install various mods with a very cute ui and animation of 2b

link  httpswwwnexusmodscomnierautomatamods140


h1 some gameplay tips h1

b1b save whenever possible

b2b  explore the map and do side quests to unlock fast travel to different zones and level up levelling up is important especially for the beginning of route c

b3b  invest or gather lots of small and medium recoveries you may need these a lot during boss battles large recovery isnt necessary if you have a lot of these and these come by easier

b4b  use pod more in combat so that you can focus on dodging when the enemies stop firing dash and slash

b5b  explore theres a lot of stuff and lore in this game itll not only let you uncover a lotta stuff but also reward you with credits and lots of other cool stuff that you can use in combat like the e drug that basically drives you mad during combat

b6b do not engage non hostile enemies unless absolutely necessary if you get stuck youll just be burning lotta recoveries and meds trying to win 

and theyre kinda cuteso nopleaseim begging you


b7b  there are 26 endings in total most of them are silly jokes but endings a b c d and e  are the actual endings ending e is the final closure providing ending to the story


now one more thing about those pods

if you want to be crushed by 2b remember she weights about 150 kg be prepared

nierautomata is a masterpiece unfortunately in order to play it on steam youre going to need to jump through a few hoops due to a terrible pc port

if you ever decide to buy the game ensure you download the far mod and go through its guide to ensure the game can run the best it can the port is pretty awful without it

once you get past the initial troubleshooting youll find yourself with one of the best experiences released today 
the combat is fluid and never gets old cmon its by platinum games animation is fluid and you are always in control the game is beautiful despite the shakey port the story is engaging throughout and has quite a lot to say this game truly keeps pumping out the emotions even after the final credits its staggering how much passion was put into this game

give nierautomata a chance when you can you wont regret it

h1 preface h1

lets first get a few things out of the way the many bad reviews you see on here they are probably justified not because nier automata  the game is bad but because nier automata  the pc port is quite notoriously horrendous the game still has not received a single update since release yet square enix had the gall to push out dlc while ignoring every single complaint regarding the pc port i was lucky enough not to run into issues so i wont go into detail here but be warned that this is by no means true for everyone

also square enix took the piss when it came to the asian region the pc version was region locked and totally unavailable for several weeks for those in asia game wouldnt even show up in steam searches then when they finally released it for asia they decided to jack the price up by about 30 in my local currency a few hours right after the release which offset the benefits of steam having regional stores and pricing this was a complete dick move on their part normally i wouldnt even bother with a game after seeing such shitty practises but the rampant positivity on ps4 reviews and my own interest in the game got to me for once i am glad i ignored my gut instinct

btldrb this game is extremely good so exceptional in fact that i am almost willing to forgive all the aforementioned issues final warning there will be minor spoilers so dont read if you want to go in completely blind


h1 visuals h1
probably the first thing people will notice about this game is the character designs i will admit this is mostly up to personal taste but to me the main cast both male and female are some of the most jawdroppingly beautiful characters ever brought to the medium besides the gorgeous designs they have really realisticdetailed movements and animations i pretty much never got tired of staring at them 

the visuals for the rest of the game are also absolutely stellar the simple and dirty look of most things is fitting for a postapocalyptic world but that doesnt stop the game from throwing you painting like environments one after another there is nothing much else to say here


h1 sound h1
probably nier automatas strongest point which is an amazing feat given that everything else is already awesome almost all music tracks in this game are spectacular easily matching the music of previous rpg greats like the witcher 3 and skyrim special mention goes towards the prologue theme alien manifestation and the amusement park theme both i have put on repeat for hours on end while doing other things 

what elevates the music in this game to a level above most other games though is their dynamic nature think another platinum title metal gear rising ie rules of nature where the same track changes dynamically depending on the situation this game takes it a step further than even mgr each track has multiple versions some with strongsoft vocals some with more instruments some including the chorus and even 8bit versions used when hacking all of them are used in different situations making the music seem to resonate with the current mood or context 

other than music voice acting in both japaneses and english is also phenomenal and effects all sound like they should all in all your ears will be in for a feast


h1 gameplay h1
if i were to describe it using common genres this game is a semi open world action rpg environments are big and there is free roam to a certain extent but not all areas are immediately open with one of them changing really drastically as the game progresses the game plays like you would expect from a platinum title really flashy combat ala mgrbayonettadmc yet it has rpg elements due to the open world having myriads of quests and a leveling system plus really indepth character customization 

of course this is not all the game offers to list more of them there is also

list
    sidescrollingplatforming
    shootemupbullethell segments
    an extremely well integrated hacking minigame
    multiple playable characters perspectives and endings more on this later
list

all of this blends together to create an extremely enjoyable and constantly fresh experience where the combat is tight and epic setpieces are abound like you would find in the uncharted series yet there is no sense of choking from a long restrictive and repetitive corridor that you would usually get from that 

things are not flawless however one complaint i have is for one of the playable characters who is limited in terms of direct combat but gets the ability to hack hacking is no doubt a well thought out experience and as mentioned it integrates into the story really well yet too much of something and it starts getting stale which is what i felt towards the end 

the world that you explore also largely stays the same and the initial wow for the various areas starts wearing off really fast as time goes on the world itself isnt too big yet still feels empty most of the time i felt the witcher 3 handled this aspect much better but thats not to say what we have here is bad just not the best it could be

another thing of note is the very clever and for lack of a better word meta nature of the game this is hard to describe without spoling anything but suffice to say the 4th wall here is thinner than most other games to give some broad examples the usual gameplay and interface elements like death or the ui are addressed and sometimes directly messed with and you are oftentimes able to do things that you wouldnt expect to be able to with predictably bad results

gameplay might not be the best thing ever but its certainly jam packed and a solid package overall 

h1 story h1
i really wasnt expecting something this good to come out of a game of this nature one thing first if you do decide to buy the game the first time you see the end credits roll and you think thats the end dont be fooled youve only played through a little over 13 of it im not talking about some bullshit newgame here im talking about fresh content and differentnew perspectives with few repeats you have to trust me and the thousands of others spouting the same message here load that save file and start the game again at least twice youll get what i mean

minor spoilers for the nature of the story to know what youre getting yourself into spoilerthis is a full on tragedy the start of the game till the first ending is hopeful enough but things get really really screwed towards the last 13spoiler the tale being told is a gripping one and the way the plot and overarching themes are handled is more intelligent than what youd usually get from an action game there is a lot to think about here in terms of philosophy and the game doesnt just posture either it doesnt shy away from addressing some really tough or uncomfortable issues in its own way you might not agree with the game but you cant deny an effort was made  


h1 conclusion h1
its quite rare that a game manages to end well a large majority of them start strong and fizzle out due to scheduling and budget issues and you slog through just for closure not the case here this game just keeps getting better and better in both story and gameplay the true ending is literally the best in video game history no exaggeration you must experience it to get it

nier automata alone is a 9510 must buy but due to the issues mentioned in the preface it is understadable to abstain for technical reasons or even on priciple alone the game is unfortunately going to be overshadowed by titles like persona 5 and zelda botw this year especially because they released so close but it is still easily my goty

please install the far mod if you do buy the game it provides a lot of fixes that will improve the experience significantly

#####

imagine devil may cry but instead of hunting demons you hunt for a purpose in life

#####

nier automata finally received an update to remove denuvo and fix the ports many issues its a great time to experience this amazing story

#####

what to expect from this game
  a story as complex as mgs but you dont have to buy multiple games
  hack n slash gameplay mixed with shooting
  perspective changes from traditional third person to side scrolling and topdown
  bullet hell segments
  levelling and quests
  fishing
  a general sense of competent game design

overall one of the best games ive played this year you might have a lesser experience if you dont care much about stories in games though

tip after completing the game relaunch your save you can thank me later

edit almost forgot but you can sell the ui and the hardest difficulty allows enemies to kill you in one hit

#####

this game ruined my life

#####

we need more nier prequels and sequels anything related
ever since ive played this out im in a empty void and not a single game could make me feel like nier made me feel
so well that kinda sucks therefor we need more nier

#####

i bought this expecting hot anime chicks and funny robots instead i got existential dread and even more depression great expirience for anyone would recommend

#####













#####

you might buy this game just to look at 2b but youre not leaving without a philosophy degree

#####












#####

2b is so cool i wish women were real

#####

i dont type long reviews i type short reviews game is good

#####

i wont bother with simple hacking tasks for the real ending

h1introductionh1
remember when games were released in a finished state no seasonpass no crazy preorder bullshit no micro transactions of any sort while nier automata had some minor release problems the pc release is still the best version between the two on offer the customization in the options menu is enough to satisfy people with fully rebindable controller layouts extensive camera adjustment and if you have a rather good rig then youre ready to enjoy the game how its meant 2b

h1technical things  negativesh1
lets look at the bad things first which i think can be fixed later down the line the  game launched with a fullscreen bug that caused the game to render at a resolution lower than the one set while in true fullscreen mode which was fixed with solutions from borderless gaming and a number of modders apart from that textureobject popin is equivalent to the ps4 version with grass and trees often appearing abruptly in the city area though monsters arent affected oddly the prerendered cutscenes are locked at 900p 30fps a shame but the story remains gripping nonetheless

h1gameplayh1
now lets talk about some points that make this game my new favorite game ever nier automatas combat system is a perfect mix of action rpg bullet hell and shmup as well as many other genres the hack and slash combat feels just fluid thanks to every button press having an actual impact on what your character does as well as the well done combo system the game seamlessly transitions between theses different genres and camera angles in a really interesting way

the difficulty has some flaws but is overall well done normal feels too easy at some points and hard basically twoshots you in every situation and requires you really get the dodge down other players corpses are a good indicator when something challenging is coming up and they can even be revived to fight alongside you just like the soulsseries you drop a corpse at the point of death which can be retrieved to collect some xp as well as some of your skill chips die twice without collecting it and you can say goodbye to some of your skill chips other then leveling up through battle you can equip passive skill chips that further enhance your gameplay regenerating health outside of battles increased evade distance or even a certain chance to reflect damage back at the attacker there are many ways to individualize your playstyle

h1graphicsh1
in terms of graphics the game is mighty fine but some could say it looks outdated while it is clearly not the fantastic looking postapocalyptic world design just adds to that fact that this game can be very pretty at some points enemies might look the same early on but theres quite a bit of diversity across the 60 enemies youll find across your journey

h1technicalh1
to talk about some positive technical aspects of the game it runs well at a capped 60fps with a decent rig with only minor drops for some in areas have large amounts of enemies performance can be improved substantially by lowering the global illumination samples with the help of a certain mod a notable bump with almost zero visual difference there are no loading times between the different areas of the game only when using the fast travel system no more than 510 seconds

h1voiceoverh1
as well as the nicely done english voiceover they also provide the option of using the original japanese vo something not every game coming to the west does and is very welcome in my opinion japanese voice with english subtitles is the way to go for this one as they manage to make the game feel much more impactful and emotional than english will ever be able to achieve

h1musich1
and now for one of the best aspects the magnificent soundtrack the game often shifts dynamically between 7 different variations instrumental vocal 8bit etc of each song to suit different scenarios in a way that ive never experienced in a videogame its just beautiful there are even special songs for every completed sidequest based on your choices how cool is that

h1storyh1
the real meat of the game however lies in the story put simply planet earth is overrun by machines that made the last of mankind flee to the moon they then build androids to combat and ultimately rid the earth of those machines and return home working for the project known as yorha you play as the android 2b who is supposed to be calm and composed and fight alongside your companion 9s a reconnaissance android with a much more emotional personality

while i cant go into details at the risk of spoiling it i urge you to try to experience all 26 endings az or at least the first five ae the game does a bad job of letting people know that there is much more beyond just the first playthrough if you dont have any questions after your first run then i really dont know what you were doing each playthrough changes various aspects of the game and story and you dont even get to see 7 of the games 17 chapters unless you stick around till at least the third playthrough a reasonable ask as i genuinely dont think youll be bored of it at that point just dont spend too much time on the crazy sidequests as youll get the chapter select after the third run to go back and do everything you forgot plus achievement hunting

h1conclusionh1
while having some minor flaws all of this combined makes this one of the greatest games ever made its easy to ignore this game if you dont think youll be good at action rpgs bullet hell and shmups or if you think it looks outdated but theres so much more to it than that so just try to get over the little problems and play this masterpiece

nier automata is absolutely a mustplay for anyone that considers themselves a gamer theres just so much here to enjoy

ill end this with a fitting quote from jim sterling

nier itself is important it is as far as im concerned historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story

if history forgets this game then fuck history

came for anime thighs left with emotional damage and an existential crisis 1010












#####

nierautomatathis is definitely one of a good example on how action rpg games should strive to be minus the poor port optimization ofcourse that being said action rpg is not usually my thing but this one check all the right boxes for me plus this game offer one of the best boo er i meant story this game have one of the most amazing story ive seen in a while anyways here are the breakdown for the game

h1 the pros h1
 b mindblowing storyb
thisthis for me is one of the main selling point of this game the story is made of 3 parts where each segment shows a different pov on the situation surrounding our main characters not only the main story is good hol up good is understatement its brilliant not only the main story is brilliant even the side stories are great so as you progress the main story i highly recommend you to try to complete the sidestories as well

as despairing as the story seems the whole point of the story is about over coming despair while sort of drowning in the process and they did a wonderful job in telling it

 b powerful soundtrackb
i cant stress enough on how good the ost is im pretty sure they could make millions just by selling the ost itself exaggeration aside the soundtrack is great hands down my favorite part is how they twist emils happy go lucky song into a song with eerie and dark feel about it oh and the 8bit version from minigames are a cute addition

 b intriguing gameplayb
the hacking minigame aside which is pretty okay for me the game is mix between action and bullet hell game which is very interesting and the great thing about it is that instead of creating an abomination they actually did it right and made it one of the great element this game has to offer

 b sweet sweet character developmentb
 b beautiful level design of a postapocalyptic worldb
 b ending eb

h1 the cons h1
now despite all the great things i said about nierautomata the game comes with one major flaw and its the poor optimization now i dont know if theres a fix for this out there do let me know if there is what the said problem does is it does not allow nier to run smoothly even on highend pcs other than that i have no problem with the game whatsoever or maybe it was so small it doesnt really affect my gameplay

oh and one more thing i highly recommend playing with a controller instead of keyboard cause it felt awkward on keyboard well atleast it did for me

h1 verdict h1
sodid i enjoy the game yes i most definitely enjoy the game very much even with the porting problem i still enjoy the game very much totally recommended if youre looking for a game with solid gameplay and superb story writing do give it a try

so i just beat the game ending e its almost 1 am
im uhim gonna go to bed tomorrow im going to try to contemplate everything i have just experienced and the idea that somewhere out there in the world is someone else that ive helped

if you have a computer that is capable of running this game at all or if you have a ps4 you have to play it you just have to

#####

nier automata is an example of why video games are art the way this game is made every little detail in the world and how it changes throughout the game to offer an new experience in the exact same place that was peaceful not long before the way it tells its story but learning more and more throughout each characters perspective

masterpiece 1010

#####

so after 90 hours of gameplay i have completed 25 endings of 26
yes there are multiple endings most of which are funny jokes ofc but still you havent played the game unless youve seen abcd endings those are core story parts you have to see

when finishing the story first time it looked like the plot is weak and open world is too small
when doing the second walkthrough new game mechanics are introduced and new characters rise this game to new level
when continuing with third route it feels like that two previous were just a tutorial frankly

and at the time you reach final credits youll know its finals i promise d oh lets say we all cry sometimes okay

 games music is one of the best ive heard so far
 plot feels like classic anime story at some points watch your jaw when starting route c
 optimization is okay for my phenom ii x4  7870 potato could have 40 fps most of the time
 awesome rpglike chip system
 bullet hell is on point cool mix of genres
 combat system is a step up comparing to mgrr previous platinums game

 ballance feels a bit off sometimes i wish enemies were always constant  strongerweaker depending on difficulty
 graphics is okay for a console port but still its 2017
 you wouldnt like playing without a gamepad

its definitely a goty for me 

ps i would also nominate it for the best ending credits might be even better then portals hehe d

h2a wild contradictory masterpieceh2

inier automatai blends the highlypolished thirdperson action combat weve come to expect from platinum games with the bizarre very niche and sometimes controversial storytelling and direction of yoko taro he is perhaps the most idiosyncratic games auteur this side of hideo kohima you likely already knew that in the years since release inier automatai became something of a surprise hit resonating with a broad swath of players the world over it may not quite have broken into the nebulous realm of the mainstream i suspect such a feat will prove impossible for any yoko taro game but its come astonishingly close with this explosion of popularity has come a great deal of idiscoursei leaving precious little left for someone like me to talk about here so keeping in mind just how much has already been said of the game id like to use this opportunity to delve into some of the aspects of inier automatai that in my experience are not as often discussed

but first briefly lets go over what you already know inier automatai is a slick stylish postapocalyptice action rpg that miraculously manages to combine bullet hellstyle shooting with fastpaced melee combat and light platforming in a small but evocative open world crafted with a quirky though sometimes opaque sense of humor a keen knack for surrealism and a deep fascination with existentialism and nihilism iautomatai depicts one of the most fascinating striking and unforgettable worlds in the history of the medium there also also many different elaborate endings for players to discover as they venture through iautomatasi mysterious broken world learning more about both it and the many odd characters who dwell within it

thats all true but its also nonsense heres what you may not know

there arent really any multiple endings  that was a boldfaced lie oh the credits roll many times but theres really just the one ending whats the deal yoko taro being yoko taro iautomatai is structured very weirdly basically the narrative is composed of two acts separated by a time skip much like the original inieri youll see ending a at the halfway point after which you must then play through the first act again from the perspective of another character  which plays out almost identically to many players great frustration culminating in ending b at this point i must note that the first act of the game is not terribly compelling or engaging and youll very likely be tempted to stop playing each time the credits roll but please dont once youve played through the lesser half of the game twice you get access to the second act or final half of the game and this is where the story gets substantially more interesting at the end of act 2 youll be presented with a choice that will lead into ending c or ending d and unlock a chapterselection menu replay the last part of act 2 again but make the other choice and youll see the other side of the games ending plus an extended true ending which is you guessed it ending e thats it the game may proudly insists that there are 21 other endings but theyre really just nonstandard gameover screens consisting of no more than a fadetoblack and a single line of sometimes humorous sometimes not text  usually as a consequence of turning right when you were supposed to turn left

the other thing to know about inier automatai is that the storytelling is pretty lacking if you launch the game expecting a sophisticated script compelling characters an engaging plot or even a coherent setting you iwilli be disappointed to an even greater extent than other yoko taro games iautomatai relies very heavily on subtext implication and deliberate contradiction to evoke players emotions and consideration this is a narrative less about telling a specific story than establishing an often hauntingly beautiful mood what you get out of iautomatasi story will depend very much on what you put in  read between the lines so to speak and you may well laugh and weep with these character dont and youll idly wonder what all the fuss is about

in some ways this is a failing of the game unlike its predecessor inier automatai does not bother to put in the legwork to make a more casual consumption of the narrative especially rewarding as a conventinoal narrative iautomatai is startlingly threadbare theres precious little dialog and even less exposition going out of your way to complete sidequests and obsessively reading through ingame lore texts will do little to imbue the story with any real sense of coherence this isnt a story where what the characters think feel or do matters its a story where what the iplayeri thinks feels and does matters its a kind of dreamlike story relishing in unreasoning chaos and compulsion  something that would only ever be possible in the games medium this approach to storytelling is easily iautomatasi greatest weakness as well as its greatest strength

thats all also nonsense its also true too thats part of the paradox of inieri its both more and less than youd expect simultaneously deep and shallow superficial and complex dull and engaging gorgeous and ugly sophisticated and simplistic reductive and nuanced thoughtprovoking and irredeemably horny

key to iautomatasi tone is perspective the characters whose actions you control onscreen are deeply ignorant of the world around them and often incurious and the game makes little effort to enlighten them in perhaps yoko taros signature move there is also a clear distinction between the characters onscreen and the player  we do not know these people what they think what they feel where theyve been where they hope to go  thats theirs not ours we merely accompany them on their journey by upholding these boundaries iautomatai constructs a strikingly believable world despite the absurdities contained therein we run through the game as ignorant of iautomatasi postapocalyptic world as we often are of our own midapocalyptic world like our own friends we know of these characters no more than what they allow us to know  and often less than that this is the foundation of iautomatasi profundity i think the deliberate withholding of information both crucial and inconsequential this narrative reticence prevents players from asserting any sort of sense of ownership over the game world as we typically do in other spaces it forces us to respect iautomatasi world in all of its alien and grotesque beauty for much the same reason taht we must respect our own world  it is something too big and too great to ever be fully knowable

this review wont contain any spoilers the first part of this review is after my first play through further below are my thoughts on the rest of the gameafter i have another existential crisis there are multiple

 tldr section

pros 
best soundtrack i have ever heard
fluid combat 
beautiful environment
amazing characters
a huge amount of content 
replayability
2b yep idc she is a pro on her own 
philosophical

cons
makes you think about our sorry ass lives
no other game will feel the same again
listening to the games soundtrack will make you emotionally breakdown

 meaty review section

i have only completed the first ending and yet it was the most emotional roller coaster i have ever witnessed no other game has come close to this it genuinely is a masterpiece i am for now putting it at joint top of my favourite games of all time due to how much this game has affected me beating childhood games that hold tremendous sentimental value

if you havent already bought it yet then how about this fact i rarely get emotional about anything except in extreme circumstances
i cried at the first ending


update after original review 


here is my thoughts on endings b to e

 play through b i really enjoyed playing from a different perspective here it gives you extra cut scenes and you start to learn a little bit more about each character the ending was just as good as a a few tears did flow 

 play through c oh boy well to not spoil there is a certain scene in this play through as 9s that you wont expect i didnt hit me like a train 5 minutes later that scene really hit me i cried and i literally had to pause the game for a whole houri couldnt play it anymore due to emotions i eventually went through and did the c ending first really loved it slight existential crisis again

 ending d this isnt so much a play through as much as i just used chapter select to see this straight away feels hit with the same weight


note before ending e i chose to go back and do one mission called gathering keepsakes anyone who has played you know what im talking about those who dont when you play and you will please do this mission i had another emotional breakdown there are too many of these


 ending e help me i need emotional support after you finish c and d in any order you get to e i might actually need medication at this point i went through all the way to the end of e the track that plays weight of the world is amazing and you hear each version of it where you slowly get to the choir being introduced at a certain important part of the ending where some people kindly helped me to any who ask yes i sacrificed what it asked of me i only hope that what i lost can enable someone else to experience this game 

i will be playing again all the way through to 100 it also reading up on some hidden clever things the devs added etc really adds to it the introduction of the choir in ending es weight of the world is just immense read up about it 

 final verdict i am not an emotional person i was very emotional i am now an emotional person i now need medication and some help it is also my favourite game of all time pushing childhood favourites down i will now give you some time to buy the game and play while i stare into space crying


for the glory of mankind

ia note for potential buyers if youre going to buy it keep in mind despite numerous problems of the game theres been exactly bzero technical fixb by square enix given the ps4 version still left with dropping framerates and other hitches i doubt the pc version would get better treatment as sad as it sounds but the most likely scenario is that bthere wont be official patch anytime soonb or at all this isnt me defending square enix but noticing the pattern of their steam releases theres big chance of that being the case anyway theres always the excellent urlhttpssteamcommunitycomgroupsspecialk_modsdiscussions31334600128973500691u far mod uurl thoughi

以下有剧透请自行选择是否看我的测评
尼尔机械纪元通关了但是这游戏带给我的感受千言万语我却不知道从何说起                     我第一次玩是在21年下当时我在pdd上买的离线号虽然最后偷偷在线玩打完了e结局但是内心得不到满足终于在一年多以后23年三月份我自己入正了尼尔机械纪元开始早已熟悉的剧情体验不一样的感觉重温当初的那一份感动在21年下的那个秋天我暗暗立下誓言一定要自己买一份从那一刻起彷佛就注定了今天的这一刻的测评                      
 尼尔在我心目中当之无愧为神作他没有3a宏大的体量没有特别惊艳的风景战斗也没有动作游戏的巅峰但是他的音乐剧情绝对是no1的任何一款游戏都没能使我感触这么深尼尔做到了看过我主页的都知道我从来不玩2d视角或者是那种小游戏假如尼尔就是一款以平面视角弹幕射击为主打的游戏那我绝对不会玩可能当种种不涉及的元素组合起来的时候我却能接受那个自己不喜欢的样子   正片开始                
   2b说我们不能有情感可是当她看到9s被击飞疯狂喊他名字后到失踪焦急万分的寻找最后得知自己感染夺取9s的机甲让他先撤离2b不愿叫奈兹最终在临走前说了出来2b在自己机甲上的留言真的我心里万分难过不知道9s心里是何等的悲伤其实2b比谁都有感情为什么总是这样2b知道自己真实代号是2e处决型她不得不亲手杀死身边跟自己最亲近的人正如a2所说2b十分痛苦2b线最刀的地方就是眼睁睁看着她一点点被感染走向生命的终点主角的死亡放在整个游戏圈都是相当炸裂的游戏的转折点就在这里2b把自己承载着记忆的太刀继承给了a2这一幕刚好被9s看到于是就造成了之后的误会和结局      
              同样9s也是个很悲催的角色犹记得刚开始他是一个活泼阳光的男孩子他的声音充满活力和磁性乐观我听到他的声音很酥充斥着我的耳朵我的心仿佛要融化了他性格的突变就是发生在2b死之后从那一刻开始他眼里只有仇恨和杀戮然而之后9s遭受的打击更是精神层次的先是目睹自己的通讯员21o被感染不得与之展开战斗21o似乎还保留着依稀的意识她渴望有家庭希望能和9s组建一个家可是这一切已经成为了泡影之后波波拉和迪瓦拉牺牲自己让9s进入塔这两姐妹救过自己现在又为了自己丧命再次打击9s的心灵进入塔看到2b的复制体9s这时已经接近疯狂能在这里见到你真的是太好了哭没用了哭的尽头是无可奈何的痴笑杀完所有复制体9s深情抚摸着2b的脸那一刻我的心也碎了最后9s看到了寄叶的计划的真相明白了自己最后的归宿就是死亡寄叶部队只不过是弃子他们的存在毫无意义战斗的理由也是虚假的看到这里9s的精神状态已经是完全崩溃了与其说崩溃倒不如说绝望他已经完全变成了杀人机器他现在只想毁了一切我觉得9s比2b更悲催是因为9s所经历的痛苦是精神层面的接二连三的目睹最亲近的人死亡得知残酷的事实被复仇充斥的头脑近乎发狂的战斗种种因素加起来这些事使9s性格发生了质的变化再回到开头看到那个温柔的9s这是最初的自己吗最后与a2的决战似乎已经下定了决心太刀刺穿身体同归于尽之余二人倒在血泊中伴随着9s撕心裂肺的呻吟逐渐变成微弱无力的抽泣我们看到了他仅存的记忆原来他都没有忘都记得空白的屏幕上落下的黑字成为了9s最美好的回忆他会忘记自己的名字但不会忘了2b的名字原来你也在那里啊2b9s和2b之间有类似情侣的暧昧感正是因为有这种感觉9s会觉得2b就是自己的全部夏娃对他哥哥亚当也是这种情感以至于2b不能被任何人占有只能为自己所有发展到后来就变成了一种强烈的占有欲使得9s愈发极端化                                                
a2的故事我不是很了解只知道她明白寄叶计划的真相从此背叛了司令官a2虽然外表冷酷但是内心却很善良嘴上说着pod吵但是pod的话她都听从一边吐槽要对机械生物保持敌意但是帕斯卡的村子被屠杀时a2立马过去支援温柔的人2b希望你做一个温柔的人却被丧失理智的9s骂道你没有资格提起2b面对9s的满腔怒火和复仇欲望d结局两人展开决斗9s就拜托你了最后一刻a2脑海中浮现出2b的声音她的刀停留在了半空内心的仁慈战胜了挥砍的冲动正所谓犹豫就会败北惨遭反杀c结局中a2割下了9s那条感染的手臂成功骇入对方记忆空间接着愿意牺牲自己来帮助9s清除体内的病毒这个世界如此美好可是我却没有好好欣赏它大家我来了善良的大姐姐a2在倒下之际如是说道她的侧脸是那么动人随着塔的轰然倒塌a2挥手说再见永远倒在了废墟之下                                                          
      the end of yorhae结局直接将游戏带入到了一个新高度你认为这区区只是个游戏吗你承认自己已经战败吗你想在这里放弃吗你认为这个世界是毫无意义的吗来自世界各地的玩家组成僚机共同对抗制作组pod也产生了情感似乎要和玩家一起对抗这不公平的命运他们愿意贡献出自己微薄的那一份力量去帮助另一个素不相识的你看到真结局这才是人类荣光永存吧伴随着三语合唱的主题曲weight of the world的结束9s和2b静静地躺在地上放佛是睡着了镜头一转窗外几只海鸥飞过a2依偎在窗边欣赏着这个美好的世界 这首主题曲是我最喜欢的音乐之一这首歌给人的意境感也是和浓郁的  在最后的镜头的最后出现了一句引人深思的话语未来不是被赠与的而是要去获取的东西对啊我们无法控制自己的命运也无法预测未来我们不知道故事的结局也不知道最后的宿命只有把握当下珍惜当下才能去迎接美好的未来尼尔的这句话可以作为我的座右铭我觉得很有哲理也是一种对生活的态度                       
     故事到这里也就告一段落了写到这里我同样也emo了尼尔机械纪元是我玩过所有游戏里给我感触最深的一部我是第一次为虚拟的游戏人物的命运感慨万分也是第一次为一个游戏写这么真挚的测评或许这就是第九艺术的魅力给我们带来的与众不同由于尼尔带给我过于强大的震撼我贫瘠的语言描绘不出它的波澜壮阔我只能抒发自己最真实的感受一款游戏好在哪里是在于他有没有使我们引起共鸣有所触动不知道大家有没有看过一部漫画叫猫箱反转个人觉得里面有一部分内容和尼尔的世界观十分接近巴尔泽萨家族被称为星之眷族是人类灭亡后世界的守护者素不知巴尔泽萨家族也是为了死亡而存在他们通过自我感染来拯救世界和寄叶计划一样都是可笑的谎言两者都是弃子活着的意义就是最后的自我毁灭这样还有什么意思呢第一批巴尔泽萨族人发动了叛变最后被修改了记忆寄叶部队得知真相的被处决型机种一次次地重置最后却已经全军覆没了不知道我理解的对不对但是我就是能把两者联系到一起可能有异曲同工之妙吧 地堡一直是黑白色调似乎象征着终点就是死亡                  
 最后我最讨厌听到有人说这是个卖肉的游戏啥的尼尔是艺术品是有一定主旨的不要只盯着表面不放还有退一万步来讲就算尼尔真的卖肉那市面上擦边的游戏多着了怎么就抓着这个不放了卖肉也要有资本起码尼尔音乐剧情双一流思想内涵更是一般擦边游戏无法触及的不要为了黑而黑不喜欢可以不玩不买但没必要恶意诋毁要客观事实说话更何况 尼尔并没有很暴露好吧                                   
目前先写这么多后期还想到一些会陆续补充有别的想法的朋友也可以留个言哦    最后感谢各位的点赞和奖励

nier automata is the best and saddest game ive ever played and kinda makes me sad also 2bs ass make it even greater and i cant stop thinking of 2bs ass

#####

noparsenierautomata what can i say about this game that hasnt been said already if youve ever heard anything about nier before and have high expectations let me just say you will get everything you were hoping for and more much much more this game is a beautifully crafted masterpiece of storytelling and gameplay that will leave you questioning your own existence and what it means to be alive 

this was my first experience with a game by yoko taro and let me just say i was fascinated by the way nier is constantly changing one moment youre playing a topdown space invaders type shooter the next your in a sidescrolling platformer and then what you really end up getting is a fairly large open world action rpg thats seamlessly interconnected between its many map segments not only that but you also have a change in perspective after youve finished the game for the first time replaying the story through the eyes of someone else this change in perspective gives you a whole new take on what you previously thought was the story but in reality was just a piece of the puzzle to unravel the true story these changes along with the 26 endings that the game has for you to discover kept the game feel fresh and helped reduce some of that repetitiveness that these games tend to have

graphicswise the game itself is beautiful to look at if you know what i mean from the moment you enter the ruined city you are treated to a spectacular postapocalyptic world filled with rundown architecture overgrown vegetation and stunning waterfalls as you progress in the story youll discover more and more areas like a castle in the middle of a lush forest sand dunes in the desert and my favorite a disnleyand style amusement park each one of them just as stunning as the one before this on its own is already great but when you pair it with the soundtrack it just takes thing to a whole new level which takes me to my next point

another thing that kept me mesmerized throughout my entire experience with nier was its soundtrack which i can only describe it as nothing short of amazing the ost is composed almost entirely in chaos language which is a madeup language created by emi evans that tries to imagine how many languages combined into one would sound like a thousand years from now and let me just say that the result is incredible the only thing i can think to say to try to describe the ost is that this is not music that you hear this is music that you feel and not only that but in some boss fights the music is so perfectly synced with the battle that it actually forms part of the fight as well making it feel more alive

however no game is perfect and there are a few things that i would have liked to see fixed the biggest issue that i had wasnt so much about the game itself but rather its port to pc it took me more then a few hours to find a custom keybind that felt comfortable while playing and even then i had the constant strain on my pinky because of the shift button for the pod fire action i had this issue mainly because you cant customize the mouse buttons at all in fact the mouse is never even referenced in any of the setting another thing that kept bugging me was the fact that every time i alttabbed out of the game the screen setting would default back to windowed mode this was especially annoying because every time i went back into the game i had to go into the setting and manually switch it back to fullscreen like i said though this is more about the port and not the game itself in the end i dont feel like i enjoyed the game any less because of this

long story short if you havent given nierautomata a shot then i strongly urge you to this is one of those games that transcends beyond being just a game and really makes you think about life in ways that maybe you wouldnt have thought of before if and when you reach the true ending you will be faced with an very difficult decision the likes of which i had never seen in a game that affects not only yourself but also other people playing this game around the world this decision is not only closely tied to the story and philosophy of the game but also on how you perceive human interaction as an individual so give yourself a chance and live the experience of nierautomatanoparse

h1genre story richjrpghack  slashh1

nier automata timeline is set many thousands of years after the events of the first nier game in a postapocalyptic world where mankind is almost extinct and living on the moon because aliens invaded planet earth and released machines the story revolves around androids built by humans fighting against machines so humans can come back to their homeworld the story is pretty emotional and unique and has such an interesting concepts but some are reskinned from nier replicant its a pretty good story even though it is not perfect and got some plotholes

gameplaywise its pretty fun its not the best gameplay you will ever see but its pretty good when you play the game the first time you will play it from the perspective of the female android 2b 2b has 2 weapon slots and you can switch between those weapons all the time or use them together for combos weapons types are swords small large ones spears  aside from this you also have a machine pod flying around you which helps you with mission objectives and also you can shoot with it its pretty useful and you will use it as much as your weapons once you beat the game you unlock the story from the perspective of the male android 9s 9s is support android not really made for combat he is scanner and while you can fight with him his combat abilities are far slower and weaker but he is able to hack things and hacking is pretty op overall 9s gameplay is way safer cause you can hack enemies all the time and avoid unnecessary combat important role in gameplay of this game are chips once you start getting better chips game gets easier you can increase hp increase evade distance etc most important mechanic in this game is dodging if you want to become good in this game keep dodging like crazy and you can pretty much dodge through anything especially with right chip but be warned every time you die you will lose all your chips and you gotta retrieve the body so my advice is to load the game once you die unless you are sure that you will retrieve the body because if you die before that all your hard work will be pointless aside from standard gameplay big part of this game are bullet hell sequences because you are able to operate with robots that can fly you cant choose when you will fly with them its just a part of the main story bullet hell sequences can be tough for beginners so just keep dodging once you learn to dodge like a maniac game becomes way easier one big problem i have with difficulty in this game is the fact that normal is easy which it should be i guess but hard is extremly hard if you dont play side quests you will die in 12 shots from all enemies so i guess play on normal if you dont want to grind and do side quests and if you play on hard do side quests because if you are underleveled you will have problems i beat the game first time on normal and second time on hard but i did most of the side quests

now to explain routes route a is you playing as 2b route b is unlocked after beating the game like i already said and its same story but from different perspective of 9s but its totally different experience its really necessary addition to the story but cause of 9s hacking abilities its easily beaten once you beat route b you will unlock route c and thats when game really starts its necessary to beat all routes because if you only beat route a and route b you will only experience 4050 of the story basically nothing because route c is the most important part and its ending to the story 

side quests in this game are okay some are fetch quests but some are decent i found them worth it on the first playthrough because they helped me to level up easier but after first playthrough they werent interesting to me also definitely read important intel but you still wont understand story completely after that cause you need outside sources atmosphere in this game is just amazing every soundtrack of the game is extremly good and full of emotions and my favorite soundtrack in the game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdsk3dtdty3yab_channelkeiichiokabetopic 

h1prosh1
 pretty good story
 soundtrack is incredible
 pretty fun gameplay but can be hard if not played properly
 amazing atmosphere

h1neutralh1
 playing route b can be a bit boring since you are playing through same stuff just from different perspective
 it reuses one important story concept from the previous game
 side quests are okay nothing special

h1consh1
 some things regarding the story are left unexplained and some of them were explained in musicalvisual novel outside the game
 difficulty is a bit unbalanced on normal its an easy game but on hard you have to explore a lot so it could be better levels are pointless some enemies will one shot you so after first playthrough that i played on hard and finished most side quests i found hard boring so i would recommend normal after first playthrough
 if you die during prologue you need to start from beginning and its not short

h1verdicth1 great story would be amazing if it didnt borrow some important concept from the first game and didnt leave some things unexplained gameplay is fun difficulty balance could be better world is interesting and soundtrack is amazing amazing game overall

do you think games are silly little things
yoko taro
have you ever questioned what games are and what they can be
this is the best game to release in 2017 arguably the best game to come out this decade and in my opinion possibly the best game i have ever played people look at zelda or mario 64 and see them as gameswhile not perfect as games that managed to set the standard and define what great games can achieve in the late 90s to today nier automata is the game that will define both story telling and gameplay from 2017 and beyond 

nierautomata defies expectations in both story and gameplay combining them in ways i personally never thought to be possible this is done by either straight up changing the genre of the game hitting you with a heartcompelling character interaction or a combination of both the game plays the way you want it to if you are feeling like its too easy after setting it to hard mode you can remove hud elements increase damage taken or dive into the combat system and learn 15 weapon combos by combining your 4 equipped weapons and your pod the game is meant to have you experience it the way you want to if the game is too hard you can equip as many chips as possible and set the game to easy basically having the game play itself by healing and fighting for you so you can experience the story the way you wish to 

in order to experince nierautomata fully the game is designed to be played multiple times after initially beating the game you replay the game from another perspective after that the game opens up even more in a way you wouldnt ever see coming in a blind playthrough opening the world up even more quite literally this idea of story telling may throw people off initially but can only truly be accomplished in this form of mediumas a game 

i never really saw video games as an art video games have defining artstyles music atmosphere themes and so onyet i never considered them as an artform just something that is there to entertain me nierautomata showed me the light the atmosphere is truly something else when it wants to nier makes you feel part of its universe and then a moment later you are catching your breath and you feel something off you then remember that you are playing a video game this is done intentionally and happened to me multiple times as someone who enjoys phycological elements in entertainment while questioning the motives of characters and diving into the meaning of character interactions cutscenes and atmosphere i ended up questioning what i was doing as a player experiencing nierautomata

as i was questioning myself i was also wondering what made me want to question myself as a player i have no idea how to describe that feeling other as looking into your heart nierautomata is a game meant entertain your heart and make you feel something it will likely be different for you but i ended up feeling something amazing inside me up until the end of the game and past the credits 

and this feeling is something i wish for you a potential player to pick up and experience yourself 
please play this game 
even if my words are meaningless
i will sacrifice anything and everything if it helps even one person complete it like im carrying the weight of the world

took my long time thinking about making this review and i finally decided the way to do it

 no you dont need to know about nier or drakengard games to play this game you might miss some little references but nothing more

 this is probably one of the best if not the best game ive ever played and will be marked forever as one of my favorites

get this game avoid spoilers

#####

h1overviewh1
bnier automatab is a thirdperson action rpg set in a distant future after earth was attacked by a myesterious alien race that used an army of machines to spearhead the invasion resulting in massive destruction forcing the few surviving humans to flee on the moon after these events a counterattack android force called yorha is formed to take back earth and restore humanity players impersonate combat android 2b initially then two other characters for a total of three distinct routes

this game is widely regarded as a masterpiece for very good reason i might say the main strong suits of automata are lore building and storyline composing an extremely original and different take on futuristic postapocalypse while also narrating a layered complex storyline that feature deep philosophical implications allegories and references to all kinds of mythological and religious events only the most dedicated players will fully understand the complex narrative requiring reading lore side quests and understanding implicit meanings secondly this game detaches from the usual canons of arpgs steadily introducing unique mechanics even belonging to other genres such as shooter sections hacking minigames and an original progression system combat is also excellent as its extremely fluid fast paced skill based with great variety of weapons abilities enemies and hidden mechanics to discover as you play variety is the other main strong suit of this game as it stays interesting from start to end thanks to perfect pacing and new mechanics 

the worst issues with automata are of technical nature as the vanilla game being a port doesnt hold up very well on pc and has issues with graphics and controls luckily the community made several mods to fix most problems which i tested and work just fine apart from this aside from some side quests being excessively tedious and the fact a large part of the first route needs to be also repeated in the second one i really cant find any other major design issue to note proving again this game is of exceptional quality 

boverall nier automata is a unique take on the arpg genre offering an experience unlike any other for this genre delivering outstanding art direction soundtracks progression and gameplay variety all encompassed in a deep rich storyline with tons of lore built around it to complete the main game and most side quests it took me around 4045 hours without wasting any time but for extreme completionists seeking all 23 endings achievements items and weapons this time amount can be elevated to 6065 hours priced at 40 but offering a great amount of content with exceptional quality i can recommend buying this game full priceb

 bgameplay analysisb
the gameplay of nier automata divides into exploration character management minigames and combat

bexplorationb is done at first on foot and while the speed of androids running is considerable once players unlock the ability to ride animals they prove the fastest means of transportation at some point fast travel between access points which act as fixed save terminals is unlocked as well for convenience exploring the remnants of the old world is quite a poetic experience onto itself as all environments are beautifully designed and really convey the feelings of desolation they should while traversing there are many hidden containers to find some with unique items while also lore documents in some cases side quests dont need to be discovered as most are marked on the global map at all times to be taken but not all the environments enemies and conditions change as the story progresses with something new even in previously visited areas often

bcharacter managementb is performed via several menus where players can customize weapon loadouts with varied presets upgrade chips which give various passive and even some active abilities with more room cost in proportion to their power and limited space so the game encourages making various chip presets to quickly switch based on the situation leveling up is done by killing enemies and completing quests but its simply an automatic stat upgrade weapons can be upgraded over four levels the first three unlocking a weapons first passive ability while the last unlocks each weapons unique trait but requiring rare resources pod programs are powerful active abilities with a set cooldown ranging from bombs to personal shields to energy hammers and become more powerful the more pods 3 total players find in the world shops and merchants each with their own stock are all over the world as well for trading items and credits upgrade chips can be fused to get more powerful versions of them

bminigamesb are various activities such as fishing the main moneymaking activity hacking enemy systems or other quest specific things such as shooter sections using a flight unit or platformerlike sections in certain levels they are varied and a welcome addition to the regular mechanics

bcombatb is extremely fast paced and revolves around perfect dodging enemy attacks just before they strike while also understanding enemy patterns and using the right weapons and abilities for the task at hand there are many combinations and playstyles players can build thanks to chips and pod abilities making builds an important game mechanic while apparently simple combat has several hidden mechanics and quirks making it truly unique and satisfying on hard just a few enemy hits are enough to take down any player enemies hurt a lot and are often in great numbers combos with weapons even combining two specific weapon types to unlock unique combos are a mechanic as well mastering them will give a critical advantage

 btechnical analysisb
upc specs rtx2080ti ryzen 3900x 32gb ram ddr4u
in its vanilla state the game runs without huge issues but there can be noticeable stuttering and control problems for keyboard users also popin and resolution scaling are off in vanilla community mods fix almost all technical issues and can be found on internet look for far mod mainly the game runs smoothly on this config once properly patched without any issue to report

h1final thoughtsh1
nier automata is definitely a unique game that blends topshelf arpg action with exceptional story and world design its a masterpiece everyone should experience theres nothing quite like it around

#####

having played both automata and replicant in that order i think this is the most beautiful story ever told in any form of media 

that said this is my warm recommendation

play nier replicant first dive into the lore a bit to figure out what the gestalt project thing is all about what shades and replicants are etc its not mandatory but automata will hit 25x  freight trains harder than it does without playing replicant it will also help you understand the world of automata a bit better

then play automata and bask in the glory of what mankind has achieved within the nier universe 

enjoy the process of having your soul deconstructed and put back together as you play the various story routes 

dont try to reconcile the apparent absurdity of the game hack n slashsexy robot format with what it actually tries and succeeds to achieve within the players mind

once you have lived with the existential heartache for a few days after finishing the final story route go on youtube and search for  nier automata concert readings with the voices of 2b and 9s act v 

now savor the true ending of the game read by the voice actors themselves unofficially out of love for the game and the fans

then finally see the world in a slightly more positive light and be changed forever realizing that yoko taro is probably a celestial being from another dimension put on this earth to show us a different way of making games 

glory to mankind

nierautomata was a game that didnt really interest me but i had heard so much praise for it that i thought i should see what all the fuss was about and boy am i surprised at the quality of this title it is a game that truly shows that video games can be considered a form of art it encapsulates all the aspects of what a great game should be in its story gameplay audiovisuals and interactivity making it a thoroughly enthralling experience  

h1storyh1 
aliens have invaded earth with a machine army forcing humans to escape and set up a base on the moon you play as 2b an android sent from the bunker as humanitys last hope to destroy the enemies and hopefully make earth habitable again 

im going to be honest i went into this expecting a typical scifi cliche hackandslash game with waifus but it is so much more than that it is a thoughtprovoking journey that looks into philosophy existentialism emotions free will and so much more that will make you question a lot of what is happening with the game world and within your own life 

the story will have you play through multiple times to get the full ending the first playthrough has you playing as 2b key characters are introduced plot developments are slowly given and you begin to understand the world once completed you are prompted to continue playing for a second time in this second playthrough you play as 9s a scanner android allowing you to see those same key characters and plot points but through a different perspective we see it through a more lighthearted and curious perspective compared to 2bs cold and serious demeanor 

once that is completed you are then again prompted for another completely different experience this third playthrough is when the plot really picks up in pace it consistently delivers a high point after high point and by this playthrough i was so heavily invested in the characters of the story that i was eagerly trying to guess what was going to happen next and truly understand what was going on  

all finally leading to one of the most emotional and impactful endings i have ever experienced it resonated with me deeply and i have no doubt it will stay with me for a very long time i dont usually get emotional at video games because im pretty much dead inside but damn i cant believe a game like this was able to get my tear ducts working again 

there are plenty of side quests as well the majority of these side quests are mundane and boring involving fetch quests and escort missions which i completely despise however there are a few quality side quests that offer further information to the plot 

h1gameplayh1 
there are so many gameplay elements at work here hackandslash shoot em up twin stick shooter bullet hell platforming side scrolling and top down combat and that is just within the first hour of gameplay with all these mechanics one could think that the quality of each would suffer yet all of them are exceptionally polished and flow effortlessly between each other and new mechanics are added even by the third playthrough giving a welcoming change of pace and it never felt repetitive overall i couldnt fault any of the combat except maybe the hacking was tedious at times 

while the combat mechanics are quite simple with only a few attack buttons and evade the game offers plenty of customisation to suit each persons playstyle there are over 40 weapons which range from swords to spears to bracers all can be upgraded to offer unique buffs a long with the abundance of plugin chips offering various attributes to your character means that you can play however you want do you want to fight up close with a flurry of attacks use some combat bracers with some attack chips or do you want to be able to run superfast stack some movement chips on and i havent even mentioned the types of pod programs you can install there are countless possibilities on how you can tackle any given situation  

h1soundh1 
it is no surprise that nierautomata won best music for 2017 a consistently amazing soundtrack delivering orchestral quality music that fits in with the themes fights and settings so well and with such diversity of styles from the stunning vocals during city ruins to the light and cheery pascals village to the intense birth of a wish all of which are dynamically changing as you play including 8bit versions and with or without vocals this dynamic soundtrack is great in helping to reinforce and convey specific emotions at each given moment and even as you explore throughout the same environment 

the rest of the sound design is really good combat sounds great each weapon sounds fit for each type ie heavier weapons carry weight to them whereas lighter weapons simply just sound fast voice acting is solid the main cast have done a stellar performance but what i think is truly sensational is that they have managed to make these emotionless machines able to express themselves in such a way that makes me begin to build connections with them  

h1visualsh1 
i spent most of my time looking at 2bs thigh highs so cant really comment on the visuals of the game in all seriousness the game looks great each individual area has its own unique style with enemies suiting the environment and its great to witness the differences between a drab abandoned factory to the more beautiful settings in the forest to the colourful amusement park the boss battles with these giant mechanical enemies are also a stand out spectacle with the fascinating enemy design and effects and i never got tired of seeing the flashy character animations during combat 

h1conclusionh1 
in conclusion this game is unlike any other game i have played before it is deserving of all the praise it has received and will definitely be considered a classic in the future if you are looking for a truly oneofakind experience in storytelling then you should play this game even if on the surface level this game doesnt look appealing to you  

do you think games are silly little things no yoko taro no they are not thank you you magnificent genius

this is a spoilerfree personal review scroll down if you feel its too long for the tldr part

nierautomata goes on to show that a game can transcend all other forms of art its a game ill probably never forget where to start i have no idea amazing story telling character design gameplay music everything was just too good im totally mesmerized by this masterpiece

h1gameplayh1
developed by platinumgames the gameplay is phenomenal and feels very natural the gameplay features hack and slash combat mainly it doesnt have a lot of combosnot a ton of combos like bayonetta but that doesnt mean it feels dulls or boring and are in fact quite enjoyable one can also fire bulletsspecial skills from their pod which accompanies your character throughout the game the game at times switches from the hack and slash to a 2d shooterbullet hell to a sort of side scrolling action which gives the gameplay a very unique touch a good one at that overall the combat feels pretty satisfying and enjoyable i highly recommend people to try this with a controller to get the actual feel of the gameplay
talking about the rpg elements the game features levelling system as you progress one can customize their stats and tweak a little using plugin chips which can be acquired throughout the game there are a variety of sidequests ranging from okayish to some heart wrenching tales weapons can be acquired throughout the game through various means and can be upgraded by various upgrade materials experimenting around with weapons one can discover new combos and stuff

h1storyh1
the narration storytelling and direction is unlike anything ive ever seen this is my first yoko taro game and my god i am blown away the story is set in the future a postapocalyptic world where humans have fled to moon and aliens  machines have taken over earth humans have developed androids to retake earth and drive out the alien invaders as the story progresses it turns out that things are more complicated than it seems it has some pretty serious plot twists and spoilers towards the ending avoid spoilers if you want to enjoy to the fullest some are somewhat predictable most are not some strike you when you least expect them to get the complete main story experience one must finish 3 playthroughs referred to as ending a b and cde in the game the ending a and b are essentially the same but from perspective of different characters with the exception of some different stuff in both some complain that it is a cheap trick to increase game length and feels repetitive but to me it didnt feel repetitive at all and in fact i enjoyed the little extra details quite a bit ending c continues the story from where it was left of at the end of ending ab after completing ending c chapter select gets unlocked and one can choose whatever chapter they wish to play ending d and e essentially dependent upon the choices on makes at the end of ending c i highly recommend one to experience all 5ae endings at least to get the full experience leaving the game after ending a is somewhat akin to judging a book by its cover the game also has 21 joke endings which include killing your own character or abandoning missions or just doing weird things in general
the character design and animation is brilliant the characters are very well designed and the animation between moves and actions is very fluid and feels and looks very graceful most of the bosses and fights are pretty decent as well not only are the characters really good visually but character development is pretty decent too character personalities are very well developed one can become pretty attached to the characters as the story progresses and the mysteries are unravelled

h1soundtracksmusich1
words cant describe what the music and soundtracks in the game feel like the soundtracks and music are composed by keiichi okabe and they are phenomenal until now i never thought that music played such an important part in a game every piece of music fits so well and synergizes with the scene being portrayed and highlights the emotion and adds so much to the scene i cant describe it by mere words and one has to experience it by himself most of the lyrics are as such not in a particular language termed as chaos language by some people since its a mixture of a couple of languages yet the emotions are conveyed very well without the need for words even though i finished the game 56 months ago the soundtracks alone brings back scenes and memories of this game sometimes you can just close your eyes and simply let the music flow or go around in freeplay while enjoying this beautiful world along with the music

h1other general stuffh1
nier automata goes really deep and presents psychological and emotional instances which makes  you wonder what it truly means to be means to be human some past references and stuff from the previous nierdrakengard games though it isnt essential for the story or anything but i ended up researching and reading stuff about the previous ones anyway after i finished the game since i was pretty impressed by it and wanted to know more details if someone does want to get every detail and reference i suggest them to do some researching about the drakengard series can pm me if they need some resources the fact that i spent around 100 hours in this game to explore every little detail quest upgrades and get all achievements shows how much i fell in love with it

my only gripe with this is from square enix for their not so good quality port and people having to use far mod to fix some of the things which should not be a problem in the first place and in general with their poor response to the community even though the game worked fine for me without any problems after using far mod there were tons of threads in the forum at launch time with people having all sort of technical problems and having to resort to 3rd party fixes or workarounds and honestly it was disheartening to see people not being able to enjoy such a wonderful game

tldr  its a game ill probably never forget throughout my entire life its an experience unlike any other game one of my favourite games of all times avoid spoilers if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest its an underrated gem which i recommend to anyone looking for amazing action hack and slashbullet hell gameplay music or great story only reason for someone to avoid this would be if they dont like deep plot and prefer their games to be casual

h1introductionh1
while many of you would probably think that nier automata is just some weird weeb game like how i used to think about it 2 years ago this game managed to surprised me like no other game did alot of people said that this game was a masterpiece and i just simply didnt believe it at the time 

after playing it recently however i can finally see why it is regarded as a one and i would even say that nier automata is hands down one of the best games that ive ever played if not one of the most important games to ever release in recent years so i will try to explain why i like this game so much why its considered to be masterpiece and why i think you should give this game a try

h1storyh1
nier automata tells the story of android 2b 9s and a2 basically the game takes place in a war between humansanroids vs aliensmachines humans have been driven away by these aliens and so are forced to flee to the moon and as a last attempt to fight back they form the militaristic android force known as yorha to combat the machines  and as far for the storyplot synopsis goes im going to end it there 

this game really is best played without knowing almost anything and i think by explaining too much of the story it could ruin the experience of many players all you need to know is that there are multiple endings and so you need to play multiple playthroughs believe me its not tedious and its well worth it and that this story is brilliant and not only that it is brilliant bbecauseb its a videogame it literally cant be told through any other form of media and i hope thats enough to sell you the story my crap synopsis of the story might sound abit eh but believe me once you playthrough the game i hope that you would see why people consider this game to be a masterpiece in videogame storytelling

nier automatas gameplay is one other thing that makes this game truly unique one moment youre playing through a platinumstyle hackslash game then the other youre playing through a bullethell it might sound weird but basically the gameplay of this igamei is a combination of multiple genres and somehow it actually works hear me out while the combat sure isnt as indepth as the combat you would see in something like devil may cry its the combination of all these genres and how it forms to a pretty fun gameplay loop while it can get abit repetitive and i think the normal difficulty couldve been abit harder especially in boss fights overall though the gameplay itself is actually really fun and engaging

h1musicscoreh1
and finally we have the musicscore what is probably the best thing about this game next to the story the soundtrack in nier automata is fu#kng amazing and it could possibly be my favorite soundtrack in a videogame ever the soundtrack is just so unique and memorable each area have their own unique ambient soundtrack and some of the epic moments in this game probably wouldnt have been as powerful if the music wasnt there

h1conclusionh1
since this is the pc version i have to somewhat talk about the problems that this port have its not a terrible port but before starting a new game you should download the far mod as it removes alot of the problems that this port have also whether you want to play with a mouse and keyboard or controller is up to you but personally a controller worked better for me

nier automata is honestly a masterpiece in my eyes and its a great example of how videogames can be art all of the three aspects that i just discussed above are all important into building what this game truly is hell theres even more that i didnt get to talk about but i dont want this review to be any longer as i think ive said enough 

as jim sterling said in his review if history forgets this game then fu#k history and that is a statement that i couldnt argree better with while my review sure isnt the most cohesive if it atleast somewhat made you intrigued and made you want to buy and play the game then do it you wont regret it

nier is not only a game its also a medicine if you are willing to listen this may not make much sense yet but it will once youre into it

the feeling you get at certain parts in the game combined with the music and sights will provide a feeling i cannot describe dont watch any trailers or get yourself spoiled

the game itself has a great story decent graphics a magnificent arttheme atmosphere and makes you feel surprised and gasp at times it may seem a little repeating at first but once youre in youre bound for a ride

the game does have some resolution issues and a few performance issues but nothing of  major hinder

update if you are planning to play the prequel nier replicant or if you have already played it then nier automata will only make more sense and hit you much deeper

#####

this game gave me depression and cured it at the end  1010

edit replayed it knowing how i would feel after finishing it why do i do this to myself

#####

came for the thighs stayed for the cries

#####

this game is a masterpiece which left me emotionally broken even though i am a 28 year old man i have to admit this one managed to make me cry a lot i thought games like final fantasy xv messed me up but this its pure emotion infused with the darkest depression you could possibly think of its guaranteed to make you question the meaning of life or if anything means anything at all

you have to play this im sorry i cant be more descriptive but just thinking of the scene with 2b and 9s in the roller coaster makes my eyes water those onion cutting ninjas my only regret is that i did not play through this game sooner but perhaps i wasnt quite ready for it truth be told i dont think i will ever be

glory to mankind

not gonna lie i came for the thighs stayed for the cries

bought it played it fapped to the thighs cried questioned my existence cried again fapped some more worth it

this game is nier perfect

many like myself got the game for crazy hackslash combat and a protagonist with a phat ass but stayed for the existential dread and fantastic story

i literally only bought this game because it had an anime aesthetic and like the perverted director of the game i like to look at scantilyclad hot girls i then went on to have an existential crisis and then possibly a spiritual experience

one of the most amazing games ive ever played nier automata was one of the few games to make me tear up the story alone carries this game which has awesome moments made even more perfect by the soundtrack

fair warning the game must be played multiple times dont worry it is worth it when i got to the first ending i didnt get it then slowly more and more is revealed you have to work for it but yes its excellent however it requires some engagement it helps if you take a little lsd before you play

on the surface the combat may not seem deep but the different chip builds add layers of complexity and depth also i suggest playing on hard mode to get the most satisfaction out of it even if you dont like the combat i would push through for the story

i realized this was an amazing game when a stamp collection side quest in an amusement park ended with 6 robots performing a twisted hilarious version of romeo and juliet and murdering each other 

for me a big theme of nier automata is that you cant understand the world and you cant explain lifes questions in the machines you see characters looking for clear answers to explain lifes purpose but they all fail because that simple answer theyre looking for doesnt exist nier automata embraces that uncertainty just like the characters you dont get an answer to your burning questions  

but what really stood out to me is how nier leaps from one genre to the next during parts executing each flawlessly the transition so smooth it feels almost expected all the while adding to the whole atmosphere of the game especially as an extension of the perspectivechanging theme which runs throughout the story it was a joy to play and superb example of artistic expression in video games

i went in completely blind and it made my experience one that challenged my future expectations for all narrativedriven video games and film for that matter it is a stunning achievement in medium and absolutely shatters the notion that video games cannot be considered as enlightened  or inspired as proper art i would go further and say it easily surpasses wellknown fiction in artistic mediums more commonly utilized for this type of story like film an anime manga or novel

after competing it i found myself in bed literally crying i cant remember any other game that forced me to experience such strong emotions in my 43 years i have never had a gaming experience like nier automata masterpiece 

thats why im so happy to read all these new reviews on this game nier is more than a mere game its a life changing experience one off my most treasured games with music that brought me to tears especially that last credit roll the fact that there are still people who find it for the first time just fills me with joy

if you are the kind of gamer that looks for art in games this is for you even if you arent this experience is worth your time 

thousands of players over the course of six years are not wrong if you are finding this review and havent played it yet get on board bring tissues absolutely a triumph

the worst thing about this game is never being able to play it for the first time again the wonder the thoughtfulness the deepness everything was absolutely perfect

 finished the game

ive been playing video games for almost 30 years 
of every game ive ever played this one is my favorite 
thought provoking heart breaking surreal unforgettable 
best in class combat platinum game btw 
characters that will stick with you 
the soundtrack will likely never be rivaled even if you decide not to try this game the soundtrack should not be missed 

fun facts 
can fish
can ride a moose 
can snow board in sand no snowboard but same thing
visit a cool park
mechs

not so fun 
the pc port is not great its awful actually thankfully theres a simple to install mod that fixes essentially any issues 
with said mod far mod the game runs great on my system if you do play this on pc you need this mod 
i highly recommend a controller this is an action platinum game afterall
 
you ever play a game and upon finishing it you just feel theres no point investing in anymore single player games for a while like no game can possibly top the bar that was just set witcher 3 mass effect tlou 
this is one of those rare games you almost do not want to finish because once you do thats it you can never experience it again the way you do on the initial playthrough there are moments here that you just put the controller down sit back and smile at the screen and take it in this is something else 
there are also moments that contradict that thought emotionally 

if youre a philosophy nerd just buy it play it trust me  

everything that lives is designed to end we are perpetually trapped in a neverending spiral of life and death is this a curse or some kind of punishment i often think about the god who blessed us with this cryptic puzzleand wonder if well ever get the chance to kill him

#####

i never imagined that a game about androids could make me question myself so much about what it means to be human

#####

i have crippling depression

#####

if you are a butt person there is nothing else to say about this game 1010

#####

ii started this game off like any other eager to see what it was about and full of heart i played it and i had a fantastic time doing so i fought the robots and i was doing a good job i was doing a good job i was doing a good job right 

i fought the robots again and again and after a while things started to change subtly at first hints left and right telling me that what i was doing wasnt the heroic adventure i thought it to be 

then i learned things so many things i kept going but something broke inside of me it cannot be fixed and the more i learned the more it broke 

then my eyes started to slowly well up during certain parts and this game kept doing that to me and all the while i kept wondering why 

why would you do this

but it remained silent for the most part giving me pieces of a larger whole i treasured each piece it gave me until i had too many pieces  all these pieces and nowhere to put them because whatever broke was broken before i even started 
the more i played the more i learned the more i learned the more it broke

it may have broken permanently but i think it was worth the trouble i experienced this game more than i played it and in some unrealistic way i think it experienced me as well

and now whenever i think of the things i felt and the experience i had i long for something until i look deeper and just think over and over that this cannot continue

this cannot continue but it musti


nier automata is a creative masterpiece look past all the bugs look past all the problems and experience it yourself

listen to me bthis is the only review that you will needb in order bto decide whether or not you should buy this gameb

keep in mind that bthis game is not for everyoneb udo not listen to the fanbaseu bin my opinionb the game is just a great excuse to tell a bvery good and intricate storyb

i will try to avoid typing a walltext although it will be hard also bthe review is spoilerfreeb

h1storyh1
the game is set in the byear 11945b where the bhumanity has abandoned earth and fled to the moonb after it was binvaded by aliens using a powerful machinelifeforms as weaponsb to reclaim our planet and fight against the machines the bcouncil of humanityb creates byorhab an elite military force of androids

bnierautomatab has bone of the best storiesb that i have ever seen blending bscifib with bexistential philosophyb to create a thoughtprovoking narrative bit is totally worth playing just for thatb however i must admit that at beginning bi had to force myself to playb because bthe game didnt hook me at allb after reaching a certain point of the storyb i just couldnt stop playingb

most people will tell you that you must bfinish the game multiple timesb in order to enjoy it bwell thats not trueb a bsingle playthrough is enoughb just baim to reach lvl 50b while naturally playing

h1gameplayh1
the game is set in an bopen world full of secrets enemies resources and questb the sidequest  bare a little bit repetitive and lacking in varietyb also bcompleting some of themb may brequire a lot of ubacktrackingu at the beginning of the gameb which can be a pain fortunately at some point byou will unlock teleports which make it much easierb to get around and complete quests

you can bcustomize your characterb with unique bweaponsb bplugin chipsb and bspecial pod skillsb

the combat system is a bgreat mixb between bhackandslashb and bbullet hellb games however bonce you have a consistent weapon and plugin chip loadoutb it becomes bextremely easyb iin my case i was oneshotting everything beven bossesb thats why i said that the game feels like an excuse to tell a storyi

just take note that bmany people complain that the games scenarios are poor and emptyb but lets be realisticb we are in a dystopian world with a wellcrafted and welltold storyline so it makes sense for the world to be like thatb perhaps they were expecting to play a different type of game such as a bmusou gameb _ツ_

h1dlch1
bthe dlc is a great and fun addition that is totally worth playingb 
it unlocks bthree different colosseumsb each one with its own rules that will test your strength

as you complete the different levels byou will unlock special skins and itemsb also if you manage to complete the higher difficulties you will unlock ban extra endingb

if you are wondering about the dlc name b3c3c1d119440927b it means
 b3 cbostumes

 b1 dbream
 a date b11944bb09bb27b you must figure out ingame what this date means just remember that the game starts at 119450310

 you are looking for an immersive and emotional storyline that explores philosophical themes
 you have recently watched the anime
 you like games with multiple endings
 you dont mind pressing random buttons and still killing everything

i wholeheartedly believe that this is not a game but rather a great peace of art 
also 2bs hot

#####

a truly wonderful game

it is a shame that it has received so many negative reviews because of technical issues because the game itself is fanastic personally i havent experienced any of the issues that others have mentioned

if only there would be more dlc so i could throw more money at the developers so that we might have a chance of seeing more of the nier world i have been sucked in to the universe of this game and am eager to see more of it and learn more about its history

if your computer can run this game it is well worth it

#####

came for the waifus stayed for the feels

pros
one of the best stories in modern videogames
fast  fluid combat
stellar music now i understand why there are nier concerts
amazing voice acting
excellent cast of memorable characters even most of the side characters are fully fleshed out compared to side characters in many other games
superb visuals  design the world characters enemies
and of course fantasstic fanservice

cons
few of the hacking minigames can be annoying

nier automata is truly a testament to videogames being a form of art

#####

the bug fix update came out which means that everyone is able to enjoy this game now

i lost a few hours of progress after i got killed by a moose because i accidentally smacked it totally deserved it

great game 1010 
i recommend this game to everyone

#####

you can remove your os chip and die

#####

this is an emotional review written just after completing the game and spending 37 hours in it
this is how you make a slasher game
this is how you make epic fight scenes
this is how you write beautiful music
this is how you write a story
this is how you bring something new into the genre
this is how you make somebody cry
this is how you make a masterpiece
this is one of the best games ive ever played just make sure to make it through to the very end

#####

youre thinking about how much you want to  2b arent you
yes

#####

the worst thing about this game is that i cant wipe memory to get that first time experience again there is a certain light in this grim game about not knowing whats coming next even if you can guess it seeing it happen and how it plays out is an experience in itself hearing the new melodies playing the other stories getting that final ending 

if theres any advice i can give on this its you should immerse yourself fall into the world treat this game like one you cant come back to talk to people listen to music tracks do sidequests do as much as you can your first time through because nothing after will feel the same

title  nierautomata

this review is largely subjective and is mostly based on personal opinion

  overall 
note this aggregate score averages each weighted applicable category on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 is a neutral score higher scores are positive and lower scores are negative i typically grade each category in multiples of 5

aggregate score 903

personally its one of my favorite titles of all time to be honest the story was difficult to understand at first but after a few playthroughs several reddit posts and some forum discussions i can safely conclude that this game has one of the most beautiful stories ive ever experienced the gameplay is fluid and balanced the visuals are beautiful the animations are graceful and the music is simply fantastic

a beautiful game that solidly engages the player both intellectually and emotionally

  price index 
 worth even more than full price
 completely worth full price
 wait for a sale
 be prepared to refund this title
 no mans sky do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry

if you have the full 60 lying around i would probably recommend purchasing this title at full price but also try looking around for sub60 deals on this title on a steam sale this title is well worth it

update the game is no longer priced at 60 it is absolutely worth it at 40 right now especially with the latest official patch from square enixplatinum games which fixes pretty much all of the pc issues that the game has had for the past 4 years

this was just my personal opinion but at first the story was difficult to understand ive never played a game with an existential theme before but the amount of feels that this game left me with will leave nierautomata as one of the most memorable games i have ever played all of the main characters are highly memorable and the themes presented by this game engaged my critical thinking in a way that was inspirational and even enlightening a lot of people think that this is just another anime game but take it from someone who has barely seen any anime this game has a fantastic story

the game was a masterpiece i loved and enjoyed every single sequence
it could be a common futuristic theme but captivating music atmosphere and unique skill style make it exceptional

although i played on normal difficulty it felt easy to play after understanding the skills some specific parts were hard to play with the keyboard and mouse

i want 2b to crush my skull with her thighs

i usually never write reviews but if i can get even one person to play through this game to the true ending ending e this will have been worth it
before i begin let me say that while the pc version of nier automata has quite a number of flaws almost all of them can be fixed with the far mod by kaldaien its very easy to install so i do not really see this as that much of an inconvenience you should really get this mod before you play this game

far mod
httpssteamcommunitycomgroupsspecialk_modsdiscussions31334600128973500691

this game made me realize what potential video games have as a medium 
story
nier automata will have you constantly thinking and connecting the dots in your head to get the full story from the information they give you in addition to that you will have to play through this game multiple times to get to the true ending all playthroughs play out differently and add new perspectives of each of the amazing characters in this game aside from this it tackles many different philosophies in ways that i believe would make an actual philosopher proud topics like existentialism nihilism or finding the meaning of life are only some of the themes this game explores nier automata left me questioning the way i approach life as a whole and no other game has ever accomplished this before

combat
easy to get into but surprisingly deep and complex since it takes a long time to master all the moves you can pull of with different weapon combinations over the 46 hours i have by the time im writing this i have never found myself getting bored from rushing into the next enemy and smashing them to pieces with the cinematic fighting moves this game lets you pull off very fun and engaging while also being quite beginner friendly

gameplay
also something unique about nier automata is the constant changing of genres while most of the game is a 3d open world environment many different sections of the map and story missions will transition into a 2d sidescroller experience a topdown bullethell experience or more some might see this as annoying but the seamless transitions and the fact that your moveset and controls stay exactly the same makes this a very smooth experience and i found myself constantly curious of what awaits me around the next corner

absolute masterpiece and easily the best soundtrack of any game i have ever played not only are the individual soundtracks astonishingly beautiful but also the way they are used is truly innovative each soundtrack has 7 different versions there is quiet medium and dynamic with vocals as well as quiet medium and dynamic without vocals and also an 8bit version the music is constantly changing through the different versions of the song to fit the atmoshpere of the environment and what is currently happening making you feel very immersed at all times on top of that each of the combat tracks could easily be the soundtrack of a final boss fight it is simply a true work of art

all in all i see this game as a masterpiece and milestone in video game history jim sterling wrote in his review that if history forgets this game then fck history and i could not agree more it made me realize what video games are capable of because it really made me feel something it sparked emotions withing me that no other game has ever achieved 
if you are still reading this review i would like to thank you for taking your time and tell you that if you appreciate video games i can wholeheartedly recommend you nier automata

lastly thank you yoko taro for making this game and giving me an experience i will never forget

#####

so let me preface this review with the fact that i definitely hate square enix as both a publisher and a developer they botched the pc release of this game i know it we all know it the replicant pc release is not great either

square enix is a garbage publisher

they botched the avengers and allowed outriders to launch with abhorrent game breaking bugs like peoples inventories being deleted after 90 hours and still have not replaced or fixed many peoples accounts to this day

buying one of their games at full price or as a preorder is a disservice to the industry as a whole and yes i include all final fantasy games including and especially the final fantasy 7 remake which i consider to be the greatest scam ever pulled on 3040yo nostalgic gamers imagine if they sold each disk of the game individually across multiple generations of console back in the 90s

i digress

h1why do i give this game a thumbs uph1

its simple

bwe need more games like thisb 

there are some solid mods that fix most of the issues in the game reshade will add a little life to the colour if you need as well its all worth the effort i assure you

bwe ineedi more games like thisb

this game is nothing short of a selfindulgent romp through a creative mind with unhinged ambition that pays off in a way that really only compares to the oldschool ps2 kojima days this is like playing zone of the enders or metal gear solid for the first time

its hard to describe what exactly the game is and it would ruin the first time experience to spoil too much of it in a review it has a play style that is constantly throwing you across new dimensions and never lets up i guess its a hack n slash but its so insanely much more than that the combat is slick and rewarding it crosses genres frequently and continually keeps you on your toes the story is best described as androids exploring both eastern and western humanist philosophy while battling literal symbols of nihilistic industrialism

this game is without a doubt a masterpiece

its a flawed masterpiece to be sure but its rewards far outweigh the costs especially if you consider yourself a gaming enthusiast you owe it to yourself to play this game

again fck square enix

but this game transcends the garbage publisher who released it you wont regret the bit of extra effort it takes to make this game run smoothly

#####

500h and im still enjoying this game
one of the best ost ive heard
gameplaychoreography of the movementattacks is awesome
story is intresting
cant wait for the next game from yoko taro

#####

as a youtube comment somewhere so aptly put it came for the booty ended up crying

god what can i say about this amazing game that would do it justice

a masterpiece thats what nierautomata is a work of art that thoroughly drew me in gripped my heart filled me with joy and stabbed me with pain like a good book i felt i could hardly pause to catch a breath i wanted to see the next part wanted to feel the exhilaration of the next battle wanted to no needed to know what was to become of the characters i held so dear 

even the pain was precious because it meant something it was real it was deep it was important it was im not sure
all i know is that i have 198 games in my steam library and have played countless others on consoles and pc over the years im a pretty dedicated gamer games come in all shapes and sizes from shooters to top down strategy and its hard to compare apples and oranges so in the interest of accuracy ill say this

nieratomata is the best action rpg ive ever played 

if you want an in depth description of game mechanics and play style im sure there are other reviews and videos better suited to providing you with this information but ill go over the basics real quick

combat a satisfying hack and slash system with a high skill cap which fluidly changes from 3d to sidescroller to top down depending on the situation a wide variety of melee weapons as well as several range options can be employed throughout the game also included are arcade style bullet hell sequences both in 3d and 2d

visuals im sure you can see for yourself how good this game looks from a glance but i should also note the special effects character animations designs and environments are very well done and interesting 

music im not one who usually pays too much attention to game music but the ones in nier really captivate and accentuate the atmosphere of each location and situation so perfectly that i must make a note of how exceptional they are this was also a big factor in how emotional the experience was

story if it wasnt clear from my earlier rant this is the reason the game is so important to me to steal the wording of another review ive read nier is never content to show you something interesting and then rest on its laurels it gives you one new wonder after another slowly drawing you into the games world and its inhabitants lives a sense of urgency and desire drives you forward and the unexpected twists and turns will send you reeling trying to catch your balance as youre thrown headlong into the thick of it again and again

maybe im getting more emotional as i get older but i dont think ive ever legitimately cried because of a game before shed a couple tears sure but broke down completely not until nier



i give neirautomata a 10 out of 10 
for perspective in my gaming career ive only given 3 games a 10

#####

the sheer volume of philosophical thinkers either directly quoted or referenced either directly or indirectly in this game is actually fairly telling on behalf of the mindset of its creator yoko taro

if video games are about expression yoko taros borderline insanity is on display here and its a great time nier automata manages to be fun bizarre interesting and gorgeous holy shit the music at the same time

without wanting to spoil this game nier manages to make you forget key points about who these characters are before brutally reminding you in clever twisted ways

play it its great


#####

great game 2b has fat ass

when you hone in on one thing it is easy to miss out on something else this is painfully true for nier automata 
because besides the main story the game dosent tell you anything else its probably the best part of the game i love the most 
nier automata goes out of its way for the sake of world building but it dosent shove anything in your face the beauty of nier automata is that everything is so silent and muted
unless you willing dig deeper you wont find the answers that you want and if thats not your thing the game respects that underneath the surface it has such an incredible world 
to offer nier automata has a clear structure to it unless you turn your head and look what is around you you wont notice the splits on the road along the way but the beauty of it in
nier automata is that it still works instead of forcing anything that is not the main story onto you it lets you know that there is more exploration to be done only if you wish to do so
even the smallest ingnifisicent side quest can add to the overall world but you dont have to do it 

i dont think you can judge the games story ending unless you have gone through all the five main endings of the game nier automata is not for everyone and that is a good thing it clearly
is a game that is not afraid of upseting its audience which is something i have always appreciated  

atmosphere
grpahic issues are non existance the frame drops were minimal considering the worlds large scope but they never played a part in getting in the way of the game the overall tone of the 
game is very melancholic although its still very peaceful character designs are monochrome but also intricate the enviroments are dreary but also stunning these contrast are super obvious
throughout the different areas you visited throughout the game and it does a great job making you feel that you are the last hope the world has around down the abandoned earth

nier automata has fantastic soundtrack composed by keiichi okabe not only is it breath taking and beautiful but its also varied and has a futureristic feeling
   
story regardless of either you are a fan of jprpgs or yoko taro fan because of his storytelling in nier automata i can say that you definetly wont be able to predict how the story is going
to end the theme of killing for the sake of your own beliefs has been a theme throughout nier automata it can look like a cliche journey about life and death and love and they are all
present in the game but the most important one is the journey to finding your own purpose after finishing your first playthrough its up to you to dive deeper into the story or not by
getting all the 5 major endings in the game which i will strongly encourage you to do so the story is wonderfully twisted and unnevering and a very intreging one the game has 
mutiple endings which can be obtain through mutiple playthroughs in each one you learn more and more about the world which will affect the way you see each character    
 
gameplay
looking at a gameplay perspective for the most part its a absolute joy to play considering that it was developed by platninum games the combat silck fast paced and fun i never got
bored of mixing and matching different weapons and plug in chips that does different effects platinum games really understand what makes combat feel both fun and satisfying both the
characters a2 and 2b work simillarly considering that they are combat androids although they have diff move sets once you start playing as 9s the hacking mini game gets introduced considering
how powerful his hacking skill is and how often you will use it it can get a bit boring sometimes because he is a scanner android and not a combatdesgined one 

the game is very understanding its not too difficult and not too easy it has simillar triats of any jprpg game side quest weapon upgrading etc 

pros
very good story touching sad and depressing in a good way cried at the ending and certain scence
combat feels slick and is fast paced and fun 
sound track breath taking and beautiful but its also varied and has a futureristic feeling
characters all the characters are very well designed and have very different personalities and different playstyles 

cons
poor pc port best played with a controller
game get a bit boring as 9s due to the constant mini hacking games

overall rating 455 

please note that i am not experienced at writing reviews but i will attempt to be as professional as possible

my review is based upon completing all the cannon endings ae and achieving 30 completion on the side quest missions i have not played the prequels to this game thus i am judging this game solely by this title ωﾉﾟ

to be completely honest i initially discovered the game nierautomata through the spread of 2b and 2a fan art wayyy back when the game was announced i previewed part of the game play but never actually delved into any of the story i picked up the game expecting a hacknslash game featuring a cute female protagonist and beautiful graphics albeit with a satisfactory story i think that is mostly true for the first play through of the game ending a if you are planning on solely completing ending a i highly encourage you to attempt the remaining routes of the game be i was extremely surprised by the incredible story presented in the ladder part of nier built upon by experiences culminated in routes a and b the more side quest you complete in your initial routes strengthen the narrative later on the routesendings are not a clone of one another arguable for routes a and b but not for any past c and no route plays out exactly the same each route has its separate characters which each have their own unique play styles secrets and loot which were previously locked in prior routes become unlocked and explorable in subsequent routes of the game and sidecharacters are enriched by tales and new character interactions the game evolves around the characters and world as the player continues to invest in the it the culminated endings pays off the investment and leaves imagination to the player allowing the user to generate meaning and satisfaction to themselves the story tackles a variety of themes and topics referencing numerous philosophers and poets and while the story may not perfectly convey each aspect it presents an entertaining and compelling storyworld it far exceeded my expectations and had me to contemplating and yearning for more to the point that i scowered the web online for any potential crucial piece of storyline i missed far after the credits rolled 

i believe that the weakpoints of the game come from some frustrating story sequences mechanics settings issues and balancing firstly my biggest issue with the game persist from the inclusion of some obnoxious mandatory story sequences these parts are required to be beaten in order to progress and the progress is sometimes reset to a cutscene or timeconsumingannoying save location these sections are either heavily favoured against the player or heavily hinder the players ability to play at their rate during the sequence the guide on the minimap also does not include routing or altitude below or above the player thus making it limited in its ability to help a player when lost especially frustrating during the mentioned sections aerial enemies are more annoying to defeat than satisfying in most cases especially if you lack range damage some enemy abilities such as voltshields or super armour are spammed in certain groups and areas and extinct in others making the few times you face them frustratingly difficult on the issue of settingscontrols i personally played with keyboard and mouse without the installation of the third party app which alleviates these issues however i did notice the graphicsstutters in the game occasionally despite having wayyy above the required specs for the game but they were not game breaking these problems should be solved with the instillation of the following mod
httpswwwnexusmodscomnierautomatamods29  a small personal complaint is the balancing issues of the characters and weapons in my opinion 2b is significantly weaker than 2a which is significantly weaker than 9s when playing the first route of the game i spent roughly about 13 hours completing it this included side missions and weapon upgrades to assist with damage with 9s i spent less than 7 hours finishing route b the final boss took a fraction of the time to beat and the fights were onesided with 9s capable of twoshotting or sometimes oneshotting enemies with his ability his ability is innately repetitive and a chore most fights aside from special bosses this can also be said with any sequence including flight units 2a possesses similar gameplay style to 2b but has an added ability and durability these issues did not deter me from completing the game however the journey reaching it was not always pleasant 

personally i was deeply attracted to the narrative and world of nier moreso than the combat itself this may perhaps be influenced by my restraint of playing by mouse and keyboard but i found myself participating in combat as a medium to perpetuate the story rather than solely for the thrill of the fight despite this i still had a pleasant time exploring the chipweapon combinations and the numerous combos possible whether it be aerial juggles or straight stunlocks both aspects of the game compliment one another supported by beautiful graphics and a sprawling and lively open world in an era where the most popular games are online or lack connection to the purpose of the game this game invoked emotions within me i had long forgotten was possible from video games and served as a reminder to myself as to why i play video games i highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to dedicate their quarantine gaming sessions andor contemplating on buying it from the sales     ω  



ps
thank you if youve read through my review ヾωゞ i decided to make this review my first official one after ending e of the game i was deeply moved by it and the gamemy final decision occupied my thoughts constantly as i felt guilty upon my decision i could never really remake that decision meaningfully again thus i hope that in writing this review i may help another person in their decision to play the game or not this might not even be seen by anybody and it does not resolve my decision however i hope that someone may enjoy this game as much as i have as a result of it and that they may choose a different decision from me or help another person in a different way thank you again for reading this messy review ɔˆ ³ˆ ˆc

came for the cute robot twink and thicc robot waifu

now im crying

an amazing experience bravo

#####

i recommend this game but i dont know if i can in good conscience recommend the pc version of the game

if you can get this on ps4 if not get this but know what youre getting into first

this game has issues running on pc and requires a mod to run it at 1920x1080  60 fps even with the mod the cutscenes were encoded in 30 fps and stutter during playback the only way to fix the cutscenes is to download a program that reencodes all the games cutscenes a process which took me more than 24 hours to complete

play this wonderful game save yourself the agony and get it on ps4 if you can if thats not possible for you well its still worth it vigilance

#####

no wonder this game won the best scoremusic at the game awards 2017
sadly i got to it now after 4 years when the very needed pc port got patched and i could finally play it without any external programsmods thank you

to whoever made it to this song and prevailedi salute you
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9lsee6wj2ym
to whoever didnt make iti sacrificed my saves for you ill see you at the end 3

#####

i slept on this game for 5 years and i regret it after having finally played it the story of the game is honestly heart tugging at times and the gameplay is some of the best ive seen in any game to date youll need to play through this game 3 times in order to get the full story but its so much content that the first playthrough feels like nier automata the second feels like a complete dlc and the third playthrough feels like nier automata 2 with how much content it has youll probably love every second of it because you just want more and more and the game keeps giving it to you putting aside the fact that the game has sexy androids since thats just preference the aesthetics of the game are absolutely incredible every location is memorable and amazing to look at and the amount of detail and work put into everything is stunning the music is also iconic and will quickly become one of your favorite soundtracks in video games if you dont already know some of it from other things if i could choose a game of the year this wouldve been it if i could choose a game of the decade this would be it

bthis game is simply put one of the greatest games of all time and is a must play for anyone who enjoys action rpgs even slightlyb

also please take it from me that you have nothing to prove dont treat this game like dark souls and be pressured into playing only on the hardest difficulty enjoy your time playing it and only ramp up the difficulty if you feel like you need the challenge if you cant beat the intro of the game to the first save point on very hard then very hard is not meant for you band thats perfectly fineb dont ruin your enjoyment of the game with difficulty it starts off hard like that as a insult to anyone trying too hard to be cool years ago when i tried it at first i did that and stopped playing it at the time and again i regret having done that after playing through the game though coming back to very hard is very fun play it to your taste

h1 playtime and timemoney h1
at the time of writing this ive put in about 60 hours and the game is 40 thats 66 cents per hour of enjoyment and well worth every penny put into it you can easily get up to 100 hours if youre into doing completionism things and the replayability of the game is astoundingly high for a single story game

h1 exactly what is this game h1
succinctly this is an action rpg bullet hell of hot androids who have to kill the machines with a great story that will tell you the rest

h1so now the standard game ratingh1list
bstory 1110b way more engaging than i had ever expected and its one of the least talked about things with this game
bgameplay 1010 b its very fun and everything is so smooth feeling it can be easy if you need it to be and hard if you want it to be and all of it is under your control
bpresentation 1110b one of the most beautiful games i have ever played in every single way
bsoundtrack 1110b one of the greatest musical soundtracks of all video games good enough to be added to your list of music
breplayability 910b great to come back to and has plenty of content for you to squeeze out of it but i think there is a point where you can be finished with it its just that point is very far away

#####

before we get into this there are a handful of things to mention first off the pc port is pretty atrocious strikethe far mod is essential for a good playthrough and a controller is highly recommended to avoid frustration urlhttpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid914437196check out this guide for more info on setting that upurlstrike with updates the mods are a lot less relevant but you might want to give them a lookover either way for performance improvements

second this is a sequel to the original nier game on consoles you absolutely do not need to play the original as the story in automata is largely selfcontained but some references and plot points exist that tie the two together the original niers story is pretty fantastic despite the aged gameplay so its worth giving it a try either before or after automata if you enjoy yoko taros writing this is a lot more accessible now that the first game got remastered

h1tldrh1

fluid gameplay top notch audiovisual presentation and one of the best game stories around make this one of my favourite games period in spite of the bad pc port and some dull segments the game offers enough twists to the story and gameplay to make it an unforgettable experience and it offers a significant amount of play time to go with it

h1gameplayh1
nier automata follows in the footsteps of nier as a third person hack and slash with an emphasis on melee combat along with a secondary ranged attack and some ability use theres quite a lot of variety in the weapons and abilities you can use and they are all wonderfully animated which makes combat a treat the enemies have simplistic ai but there is a decent variety of them and the difficulty mostly comes from the mix of enemies in encounters especially as many of them have a tendency to turn the combat arena into a bullet hell encouraging the use of the full ability set to clear them out safely much like its predecessor there is an emphasis on perspective shifts and the game will swap between third person top down view sidescroller and more these changes happen fluidly in combat and they offer a lot of variety to the combat encounters

aside from the combat there are a number of rpg elements thrown in as you scour the world you can find sidequests crafting materials weapons and upgrades to collect and plugin chips which are a system that allows you to upgrade and customize many aspects of gameplay from automatically picking up items to health regeneration or slowing down time after dodging a hit theres a huge variety in the loadouts you can make with those chips and i only scratched the surface of the various upgrade mechanics ingame but they definitely add a lot when it comes to customizing your gameplay style 

as a downside to the exploration aspect the games fast travel system unlocks about halfway through the game and its a real chore to move around and do sidequests that require a lot of travelling beforehand so id highly recommend delaying some of the sidequests you get until you can unlock this feature

one last note id like to make here is that once you beat the game you unlock a fairly detailed chapter selection menu which keeps track of sidequests and progress and you can freely jump to any point to work on stuff you missed or go for those achievements its a fantastic feature and it came in really helpful to pinpoint a few of the sidequests i wasnt able to finish the first time around

h1storyh1
ill avoid going too far into the story as i believe its the main reason for playing the game but the game puts the player in the middle of a long war between robots and androids you play as one of the androids and throughout the course of the game you get to interact with a cast of well written characters both on the android and the machine sides as you attempt to put an end to the conflict for good typical of taros games the game has multiple playthroughs and as you go through them you get the chance to uncover new information or cast new light on events from the previous one on your way to one of the endings and while some sections of the game can get a bit repetitive its definitely worth powering through those since this is a nier sequel playing that game first can spoil a few of the reveals from automata however the games story is still selfcontained and can be followed without playing the original first

h1visuals  audioh1
the visual department is a treat with a lot of attention put towards the effects and animations in combat and they reinforce some of the most memorable moments throughout the game with that said some areas of the game tend to be very lackluster when it comes to decor and generally come off as monotonous the various perspective changes can spice some of those otherwise boring areas up but there are definitely times when i felt a bit more detail couldve gone a long way

the soundtrack however is absolutely stellar even as a standalone ost in the game most songs have multiple versions the game cycles between depending on whether the characters are in combat doing a hacking minigame and so on and they are a huge contribution to the key moments of the game whether its to set the mood after finishing a quest or key moment or really accentuate the theme of an area a special mention also goes to the voice acting which is just as high in quality and comes through in some of the most emotional scenes

h1completionh1
completion can take a while but isnt excessively tedious as mentioned the game allows you to go back to any point in the story once youre done so you can redo anything youve missed with a single exception  ending y its something you need to go out of your way to do however so you can safely look it up once youre done with everything else

#####

so after a longlong wait the patch is finally here and the game seems to be working fine now finally you can get it now its a masterpeiceif you like japanese games

im not a person to usually write reviews about games but i had to write one for this game

i wish i could erase my memory of this game so i can play it all over again its incredible absolutely amazing as i am writing this i have yet to 100 this game i say that because this game will probably be my first 100 of any game to be honest when i finished the game for the first i teared up it was an emotional roller coaster for me im going to be jumping from one topic to another as i go so sorry about that but i just dont know where to start and finish ill just go with the story first of all the story is what makes this game what it is just outstanding writing and execution with the story telling its been a long time since i felt so immersed in a video game and felt like i was part of it every step of the way im not going to go too into the story aspect because of spoilers because believe me when i say that you should play this game for the story its extraordinary

the characters are spectacular all of them are very different from each other and evolve with the storygame they really nailed the character build and development i was just so attached to them in every way if you play this game you should really pay attention to every conversation and small talk its the little stuff that matters in this game just builds the story in various ways that you dont even realize i would also recommend playing in the japanese voiced version with subtitles just adds to the whole originality and experience 

the soundtrack is master piece for every zone there is different music both peaceful and intense and just the music style alone just felt perfect for the game it has a different style to it you can just listen to the soundtrack for hours on end and not get bored of it keiichi okabe the sound composer for nierautomata is a legend i am listening to the full ost of this game as i am writing this and probably will be listening to it for a while

the visualsgraphics are breathtaking no amount of screenshots you take of a scene is enough i swear sometimes when i came across a beautiful scene which happens a lot i just stood there and watched with the games music in the background i felt like i could just stay and observe this piece of art for hours highly recommend playing on high visual settings for the full experienceofcourse if youre pc can handle it even tho this game is massive and high quality i didnt have any frame issues nothing my game never crashed or lagged even at the highest settings 

the map exploration and combat was great this game is massive and you can explore basically all of it one time without spoilers i entered an area that was just huge and looked never ending i thought there was no way i can explore it all but i just kept going and going until i finally and literally reached the end of the map there are very little limitations in this game boundary wise the combat is just very smooth at first it was weird to get use to it because i never played a game like this before grew up playing fps games but once i got use to the combat you feel unstoppable the weapons and combos you can do seem endless every weapon has a story to it yes im not joking there is literally a story tab on the weapons that evolves overtime as you level your weapons up like i said the little things in this made me love it so much the combos and fighting styles change as you change your weapons and there are so many weaponssure you can mindlessly just swing away but i highly recommend trying to master the dodge abilitytiming and your combos makes it much more enjoyable and you feel better at the end of a fight 

the voice acting and animations are flawless the voice actors and actresses tone and way of speaking really fit the characters perfectly executed again i recommend the japaneseoriginal version for this game  from the simple walking animation to the intense combos you do while in a fight are amazing if you pay attention to the combos you do you will notice how detailed and smooth they all are the game dosent just skip an animation and get the hit all in 1 frame it fully executes it and goes back to the normal version 

i dont want to make this review too long but i just cant help myself if you are thinking of trying this game dont wait for a sale it is worth the full price this game is truly a masterpiece even without a 100 completion i teared up and cried at some points screamed of joy and happiness at some i have been playing video games for the past 1516 years played many story driven games but i can easily say that this game nierautomata is in my top 5 games of all time one of the best experiences ive ever had thank you for reading and hope this helped have a good one

this is one of the greatest games ive ever played be prepared for one hell of a story through multiple playthroughs and 26 endings ae being the main story and fz being secrets the game has 4 difficulties easy normal hard and very hard ranging from im here for the story to one hit kill with some features such as camera lock on only available in easy and normal i personally would recommend hard for a good balance of challenging combat to story

if you care about graphics or shaders those are options for you with the far mod and reshade
for the best experience id recommend playing with a controller

my final conclusion no mom i wasnt looking up the girls skirt

h1nier automata is treasure to be enjoyed by all who love games whose beauty is far more than skindeeph1

irarei are the moments when i am compelled to take time out to leave a review for a game in fact i think ive written only one or two reviews in the 8 or 9 years ive been on steam and yet nier automata has compelled me to leave one 

bill try to keep it brief but i will probably failb from beginning to end and from top to bottom this game is exquisite the pacing the feel of its open world the music the twisting and turning story are all among the very best in the class told over multiple play throughs from multiple perspectives and leaning heavily on nihilistic precepts and philosphies the game takes you on a roller coaster of a ride that not only forces you to question the motives of the protagonists and antoganists but their very purpose and yours too from time to time side quests arent your typical filler experiences found in most open world experiences each one was carefully crafted to add depth and complexity to the story to the background to the core philosophical questions the game poses to the player and its characters 

ba game of depth weight pleasure and pain that slaps you in the face over and over againb
bthe game is very emotionalb the high quality story telling through the games interactions brings you in tight with the characters even the side characters and doesnt let go the hardships some characters endure over the course of the game is presented without lots of direct exposition rather through subtle body language discouraged commentaries and painful admissions fleeting hope makes you want to grab at it like a lifeline as pain and sadness reaches out to envelope you and your protagonists the struggle of emotions bears the most satisfying of rewards for those players who endure to the end the distance some characters havetheir reactions to situationsits all for a deeper reason all of which will be revealed with time and its worth the wait to find out nihlism runs deep in the game as i mentioned and several characteers are named after famous philospophers reading about them will enrich your overall experience

bso who is nier automata for anyway dreamsb
in my opinion its for every gamer who loved the story and delivery of games like ff7 and ffx but have been perpetually disappointed with the rpg genre ever since its for those who love beautiful characters with exquisite animation its for those who love great action and awesome combat its for those who love a game with meaning that go far deeper than the surface and forces you in the real world to question your motivations and values should you have an ear to hear what characters and situations are really saying this game will resonate with you like a clanging symbol long after your play session ends its for those who enjoy the idea or experience of playing a game multiple times from multiple perspectives think dishonored each more rewarding than the last hell the game doesnt even begin until the 3rd playthrough and by then you will have had enough holy st moments to last the rest of the year 

blevel with me dreams should i pick this one upb
yep i went in with zero expectations didnt play any drakengard games or the original nierand came out the other side championing this game as my game of the year already sorry zelda sorry nioh sorry horizon sorry _____ fill in whatever else is coming this year if i didnt have another single player game to play this year this would be enough for me the mix of highs and lows the pacing the character development the emotions on display from beginning to end have wrapped me around this games proverbial finger so much so that after 90 hours im genuinely excited to start all over again from scratch no game ive ever played has so moved me and with the depth of the characters and knowing the story behind the story i expect the next time through might be even better this is a game that was clearly made with more love than most it takes more risks than most and as a result offers a product rarely seen if you enjoy single player storydriven games at all you do yourself a disservice by not playing this game theres a reason its metacritic score is so high and why so many people are talking about this game 

bok okay butwould you buy it again dreams at day one pricesb
ilook at me in my eyesi id buy this game again in a heartbeat folks ive never been more glad than i am now that i took a chance on a game never played any of the games in the franchise before i havent felt this rewarded by a game experience in 20 years final fantasy 7 at launch and i mean that the game is probably going to end up in my top 5 all time and ive been gaming for 30 years 

bdo yourself a favor and pick this game up do it todayb support this team and yoko taros work he is one of the best story tellers we have left oh and do yourself a favor and immediately disable msaa great tips for maximizing your pc performance with the game can be found here httpwwwneogafcomforumshowthreadphpt1353278

h1 too much information for the brain to handle h1
this is more of a personal love letter than a typical review

nier automata is an action rpg set in a postapocalyptic world overrun by machine lifeforms the game tells the story of androids 2b 9s and a2 as they fight to reclaim the planet for humanity however as the story progresses the characters begin to question the point of their existence and the meaning of their actions leaving the player with a sense of emptiness and hopelessness but also a sense of appreciation for the beauty of life and the ability to make choices

h2 pros and cons h2
this game is very well made as theres barely any negatives about this game the only negative thats reasonable was the poor optimisation of this game and players had to rely on the special k mod however this game got an update sometime in 2021 and resolved this issue b but it took square enix 4 years to fix the pc versionb

 thoughtprovoking story with multiple endings that encourages multiple playthroughs

 welldesigned gameplay with a satisfying combat system

 visually striking art style that perfectly reflects the games nihilistic themes

 high replayability with a variety of side quests and optional content and a new game plus mode

 a diverse and emotive soundtrack that perfectly complements the games themes and setting

 yoko taros attention to detail is so impressive its beyond the brains capacity to understand how this man thought of it

h2 story h2
one of the strongest aspects of the game is its story which is thoughtprovoking and emotionally engaging the game presents a bleak and hopeless world where the characters are fighting for its sake without any real purpose 

additionally the game raises questions about the nature of consciousness and what it means to be alive as the androids begin to question whether they are truly alive or just advanced machines the games multiple endings add to the replayability and encourage multiple playthroughs to fully understand the story

h2sidequests h2
the games side quests often delve deeper into the games world and characters they also provide more insight into the characters motivations personalities and relationships which can help players better understand the characters and their role in the story

some side quests offer a deeper look into the motivations and beliefs of the games characters while others provide insight into the history of the world and the events that led to the current state of affairs 

while some side quests may seem like filler content they actually pay off in the story adding to the world building and characterisation of both the main and side characters the subtle foreshadowing throughout the game leads to a really visceral turn of events making players feel emotionally invested in the story and its characters

h2 art style h2
the games art style is another standout feature perfectly reflecting the games main theme the world is a desolate and empty place with a mix of futuristic and ruined environments and a faded colour palette the games world reflects the idea that humanity is long gone and the androids are fighting in a war that has no real purpose 

the characters designs also reflect the games themes with the androids having a humanoid appearance but with a mechanical and artificial feel this reflects their nature as machines and how they are losing their humanity as they are just advanced robots programmed to fight 

the game also features some breathtaking moments such as the games openworld sections where the player can see the vast emptiness of the world the ruins of civilisation are scattered around giving a sense of loneliness and desolation i especially love when we are introduced to the amusement park the visuals accompanied by the music are how i fell in love with this game its truly magical

h2 soundtrack h2
the music and soundtrack of nier automata are an integral part of the games atmosphere and storytelling the composer keiichi okabe has done an outstanding job creating a diverse and emotive soundtrack that perfectly complements the games themes and setting 

the games soundtrack includes a mix of orchestral and electronic elements that creates a unique and powerful ambience for example the games openworld sections are accompanied by a haunting and melancholic soundtrack that perfectly reflects the games desolate and empty world on the other hand the games combat sections are accompanied by an energetic and actionpacked soundtrack that perfectly reflects the fastpaced and intense nature of the games combat system

it also includes a variety of vocal tracks the main theme weight of the world is a perfect example its a powerful and emotive track that perfectly reflects the games theme and the characters emotional journeys

this dynamic use of music helps to immerse the player in the world and create a sense of atmosphere and tension it also serves to highlight key moments in the story and emphasise the emotions that the characters are feeling

h2 gameplay h2
in terms of gameplay nier automata is welldesigned and offers a satisfying combat experience the games combat system is fastpaced and fluid with a variety of weapons abilities and skills that the player can use to defeat the enemies the games openworld sections while not being the most interactive offer a good variety of side quests and optional content that can be explored on subsequent playthroughs 

h2 conclusion h2
in conclusion nier automata is a mustplay for fans of action rpgs and those who enjoy games that make them think the game not only tells an engaging story but also presents it uniquely and visually strikingly adding to the games overall atmosphere the gameplay is solid and satisfying and the multiple endings side quests and optional content offer high replayability the games heavy themes of nihilism and the human condition are thoughtprovoking and wellintegrated into the story and characters the games art style and musicsoundtrack also add to the immersive experience

warning long review tldr best games you will ever play

do you think games are just silly little things after playing this game i truly think the answer is no 
nier automata is a special game a hidden gem that mirrors real world humanity and what it means to be a human perfectly into this philosophical art piece of masterful storytelling and audio visual experience this game is nothing short of a bmasterpieceb

h1backgroundh1
i was reading a local game magazine and saw a review about nier automata it scored 90100 and i had nothing to play at that moment so i spontaneously went to a game store to buy myself a controller and nier automata 
despite being a little offput by the maidgothsamurai protagonist giant swords and other typical features of japanese rpgs  cant be too bad of a game with those reviews i said to myself and boy am i glad i bought this game 

h1gameplay h1
nier automata needs a controller this game can be played with km but i would neverever suggest anyone who appreciates their own sanity to play this game with a km combo
game world is big camera angles are used masterfully to make some scenes have more impact to them 
the 3d game can sometimes turn into a 2d platformer or a topdown experience 9s character has his hacking ability which allows player to take control destroy or temporarily indoctrinate enemies this all happens in a bullet hell minigame

nier automatas combat system is well polished as you would expect from a hack n slash action rpg combat is easy to pick up but felt like shallow button mashing at times until i realized how different weapon combinations and chips affect your moves and combo sets 
there is enough weapon variety from small and big swords to spears axes and fist weapons as soon as your realized this the tedious and shallow button mashing is gone replaced by incredibly satisfying perfect dodging followed by perfectly launched comboattacks thanks to this the combat felt fresh and fun even after 30 hours

side quests are your typical japanese fetch quest grind however they are flavoured with interesting conversations and revelations to the story and the game world which allows you to understand the whole narrative better
nier automata captivates you as a player to its world going so far as being in menu screen is you actually being part of the game world already adding and removing hud chips remove and add certain hud features this goes so far that you can even remove your os chip which kills your character and provides you with one additional ending 

one thing that really irritated me at times was lazy level design on some parts for example the invisible walls are we back in ps1 era and very muddy textures in certain places 

h1soundtrackh1
composed by keiichi okabe nier automatas ost is genius its massive its spectacular its sad magical and truly one of the best soundtracks ever created to a video game period for me it goes on equal ground with doom 2016 and hotline miami 
the music adds to the narrative perfectly it evolves and changes from small and subtle mystical tones to a orchestra of ear euphoria perfectly supporting the storys narrative it really is so good it is what got me hooked to the story of the game every song in this game is a master piece from start to finish its incredible

h1story  major spoilersh1
game takes place in a post apocalyptic earth some nine thousand years into the future human race has been driven out of earth to the moon council of humanity has created humanoid androids to fight off the mindless killing machines created by aliens that invaded earth and this task is overseen by yorha  at least thats what youre initially driven to belive 

the game is over after route a and the credits roll you would think this is it but oh no the game prompts you with a screen telling you you should play the game again for the full experience you continue your last save and you start off as a different character in a different place 

there is in fact three different playthroughs and five major endings a b c d and e route e being the final and most satisfying closure to the games canon lore

as you start your first playthrough the character 2b quotes somewhat random we are perpetually trapped in a neverending spiral of life and death is this a curse or some kind of punishment 
but its not random it is referring to samsara a belief of never ending cycle between life death and rebirth nier automata shows its love for never ending cycles many times during the playthroughs of different routes

during your first playthrough you will notice that some of the machines are capable of speaking some are developing feelings like loyalty some of them are trying to imitate and understand love some have developed religions androids are getting intoxicated with synthetic drugs androids and machines alike are forming relationships with each other each of these actions mirror humanity perfectly neither the machines nor the androids are mere machines anymore they are becoming more human
the game has so many mysteries for the player to solve many of which are puzzled together from hints gained in side quests or just briefly mentioned in some conversations however the main topic always seems to be related to existentialism the purpose of life
the game introduces three major playable characters serious and later more emotional 2b combat type android more extroverted curious and joking 9s sensory type and later in the game a2 a reckless older combat type who likes to keep to herself 

many side characters are named after real life figures contrasting their real life images in various ways most of whom have something to do with the thought of existentialism here is a few 

pascal as blaise pascal major contributor to the philosophy of mathematics 
jeanpaul as jeanpaul sartre one of the key figures of philosophy of existentialism 
simone opera boss  simone de beauvoir french existentialist philosopher 
goliath bosses engels and marx as friedrich engels and karl marx the writers of communist manifesto 

as you finish all three playthroughs and go through a huge emotional rollercoaster as everything becomes clear all the mysteries are solved and every question gets an answer

at the end of it all the game challenges you with one last bullet hell sequence in the end credits  as weight of the world plays in the background and tears were streaming down my cheeks
the game asks you following questions 
igive up here i
ido you think games are just silly little thingsi 
ido you accept defeat i

at the same time you receive encouraging messages from other players all over the world  who have beaten the game as you keep dying in this sequence over and over again 
the game asks you this
ido you admit there is no meaning to this worldi
no this game has opened my eyes to witness the true potential of video games as art pieces

one last time you die and game asks you ido you accept a rescue offer from a playeri
you are no longer alone you receive aid from other people who have beaten the game before you  
as the end credits song evolves into a chorus you are finally able to beat the last sequence in this magnificent orchestra of emotions you are not weeping but tears just keep streaming down your face as you smile 
in the end game asks you ido you want to help a total stranger in exchange for all your progress in the gamei all your saves all your effort gone i did it with a single click of a yes

you have just experienced something legendary
thank you yoko taro
thank you platinum games 
thank you square enix

this game is perhaps one of the most influental video games ever created
this game truly is a masterpiece

#####

2bs ass has saved my life from complete despair ladder sequences are the best 
in case you were wondering yes there is a line that literally says youre thinking about how bad you wanna  2b arent you

overall this game is amazing and i am not gonna lie this was certainly something i missed out on when it first came around 1010

#####

nier the original may be what i consider the strongest game ever made not the best or most fun or anything like that although it does have one of the best soundtracks in gaming i mean it overwhelmed me with emotions and feelings and all kinds of things it is the most game in my personal history the gamest

nier automata is not better than nier or stronger or more fun it is different in many ways and similar in many ways and by the time i was up to the second ending i liked nier more and by the time i was finishing ending e i was in big blanketing sheets of tears and my hands were shaking and i was just so intensely powerfully grateful that i live in a time when games like this are being made

i dont know if i will ever play it again but it affected me deeply and will stay in my memories a long long time 

it is something very special

i hope they keep giving yoko taro work

very good game

#####

sooo
i played and finished ending e and i hope my data will help someone reach it too
this game is a real journey your going to take on
it makes your emotions go crazy you will start questioning every choice you make in the game and what choices the character will take their actions just everything
then you will start questioning your own life the choices and paths you took
and after ending cd you just want to give up but u dont u push forward to the true ending there must be a true ending right 
and when your about to reach itit becomes harder and harderyou fail and you fail but u dont give up you want to find itit must be there and then comes that one moment that broke me completly apart i was able to let everything out that had troubled me kinda i was crying as i was able to finish this journey if i had the choice to erase my memories and redo this journey i would do it without a second thoughtbut i got still alot to do in nier alot to discover
i can only recommend this game to everyone 
its a masterpiece in my eyes 

this game is to good to rate it in numbers so i will rate it with how many tears i shed  endless

#####

pretty much a mix of garfield kart and wii sports bowling

#####

i think we are in a position where its better to say nothing 
because no matter how much u said it reduces the beauty and uniqueness of this game
just play and enjoy

ive hesitated for a really long time to write a review for nierautomata thanks to the 2018 steam awards for the motivation not only because it is a game that is so hard to review properly and not only because it weaves all of its narrative threads uniquely multilayered gameplay elements and masterfullytimed pacing together so perfectly without ever missing a beat but because it is a game that made me reconsider what games as storytelling can do and just what incredibly powerful and affecting stories they can tell in that regard  but to go into the details of the hows and whys would really do you  and the overall impact of the games story  a true disservice 

after all of my time with nierautomata including my 100 hours spent on the ps4 version i absolutely must urge you to go into the game as blindly as possible i know its easy to scroll through review after review trying to decide if a game is right for you though so ill just say that if youre a fan of jrpgs hack and slash games with gameplay that just feels right soundtracks that will get stuck in your head months after playing games that arent afraid to mess irreverently with their established universe philosophy and games that ponder androidrobot autonomy bleak yet beautiful postapocalyptic worlds unforgettable moments dialogue setpieces characters and games youll keep thinking about long after youve finished them then nierautomata is for you 

that said while i do wholeheartedly recommend nierautomata itself for the reasons i listed i unfortunately cant recommend the pc port without mods and a controller it really is necessary really the game is essentially unplayable unless youre lucky enough to not have issues with your resolution and find playing with a mouse and keyboard doable after going through nierautomatas opening sequence so absolutely do get the game but download the far fix automata resolution mod by kaldaien if youre having problems with your resolution output its really a shame that the developers still have not released any patches to support what is otherwise an incredible game but that mod is there if you need it 

nierautomata is one of those games that redefines what storytelling through gameplay means as i said above but it is also one of those games that begs the cliché phrase more than a game to be used because thats really what it is its not perfect by any means and even if you can tick all of the boxes of my criteria listed above thats no guarantee that youll love or even enjoy the game or that it will become as special to you as it has for so many other reviewers and players out there but at its heart nierautomata has done what few other games dare to and for that i absolutely believe it deserves to be recognized it is not afraid to ask you questions and satisfyingly leave you to answer them yourself it is more than a game because it truly is one of those games that wants to be seen as such and everything it does  with all of its facets working in such beautiful cohesion  to take you on its journey is done so so expertly perhaps because it does not fear the weight and pressure of being subject to such an infamous phrase 

in a time where few others can say the same it truly is more than a game nierautomata is decisively an experience and it deserves every single moment it asks of you to tell its story

game is very hard
9s is built for femdom
i died in tutorial

nier automata is one seriously epic adventure so much so that i still cant stop playing it recently got it on sale for 50 off downloaded the far mod which helps with performance and clocked in almost 50 hours
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1373711554
bill start with the goodsb

 its an emotional story that i found to be really well written with character development and down to earth lingo it makes the characters relatable

 the music is topnotch easily one of the best osts ive heard  definitely up there with transistor and hollow knight you know a soundtrack is good when ut gets stuck in your head and not in a bad way

 the combat isnt as indepth or fast as metal gear rising but you control two characters at once an android and a pod one does melee while the other is for ranged specials and auxiliary

  there isnt character creation but theres  kinda this cool customization feature which lets you put different powerup chips in your android

 exceptional story filled with meaning and lovable characters down to earth easy to relate to and understand storyline seems like thats a rare combo in games from any era


bthe just okay stuffb
 the graphics can be either really beautiful or very poor this is due to great lighting great character models nice effects and then some badly terrible details and low res textures like the rope on the bridge that looks like its a ps1 era texture

 the controls can take some getting used to im not the type to use all four fingers on the top of my controller and still getting used to it this game takes advantage of such demanding layout and i know there are others out there like me i know it might be changable but after 50 hours i really shouldnt


bthe only real critiques i had wereb
 graphics limited to 1600x900 if you dont download the far mod

 enemy ai can fall behind when there are mamy enemies on screen

 collision detection issues and sometimes your character falls through rocks weird

  the game can suffer from bad camera angles sometimes which can annoy the hell out of the player i guess this is common for many faster paced third person games like this

bunpopular opinionb ia2 is hotter than 2bi i feel like a2 is largley underrated i found her much more attractive than 2b though from her looks her voice and her attitude i just think shes the real waifu here



bclosing thoughtsb i loved every minute of nier automata its a gem in todays industry its fresh and deserves the hype i wasnt too sure what i expected wasnt sure id like it but its definitely worth the 30 i spent and id recommend it even at full price

one huge campaign being cleverly split into different little campiagns each with choice which gives you different insight to the lore of nier makes the game fresh as well as rewarding its just a beautiful game and the androids are beautiful too

nier automata stands out as a truly unique gem in the gaming world and any review of it should strive to capture its essence as i grapple with this task one question looms large how does one do justice to such a magnificent creation without diminishing its brilliance

perhaps i should begin by acknowledging that if you consider yourself a gamer if the title gamer holds any significance in your life then you owe it to yourself to experience this game its as simple as that

but for those seeking a deeper dive into my thoughts i welcome you to join me on a journey through my reflections

firstly as someone who has played tens of thousands of video games i hold my own standards for what defines a game i am not swayed by hype or the opinions of others my judgment is based on a deep understanding of games and their potential impact

when a game like nier automata emerges it becomes a standard bearer for decades to come it transcends the typical boundaries of a video game and stands as a masterpiece in its own right it should not be compared to anything else it existed as a concept before it became a game and that concept continues to resonate whether you are actively playing the game or not

the game starts off with a great homage to the typical shootemup arcade style games and quickly leaves it in some onedimensional alley 
bam
all the way to the big lasers killing off teammates until theres only one paradigmatic hero  you
and you are the game the creator plays
and you will be the main goal of this games creator for the duration of your playtime 
welcome to nier automata get trolled hard

it will get to you 
it will make you feel 
it will make you depressed a lot

that is as long as youre mature enough to understand why the beauty of it is that you neednt discuss it with others 
all that you need to do is simply experience it youre not simply playing a game here you are experiencing it the mere joy of gaming the mere essence of gaming its here folk use it

people say that beauty is subjective but for me beauty is ethereal 
it is the prevalent beauty of the games ability to rekindle your imagination 
for me it clicks and ive experienced so many games that i consider myself perpetually grumpy nothings amazing anymore or if it is  its short lived when you combine that with my elitistsnobbish outlook the fact ive played best of the best of games and top it off with my unforgivable demands  its a hard bargain thatll make me really enjoy a game
i love the fact that nier automata urges you to think and rethink it is something that happens passively not the story that does it for me it is the atmosphere keeps you longing for that unattainable distance of metaphysical longevity even when its guarded by nihilist walls of nothingness and you constantly feel like the end boss is hidden in plain sense and thats yoko taro hes playing 4d chess against the player and instantly wins 
why 
well partly because of games beautiful aesthetics and marvelous atmosphere
partly because of abundant philosophical concepts written on those empty walls 
you will congenially take the great ghost of nihilism by hand and the two of you will run around like robin hood and little john 
nier automata will make you rethink your very own existence several times over 
you will question how youd likewant to live your life 
you will question everything and nothing 
and it will keep you puzzled making you sway in deep thoughts of your own introspection
but is this game for just about everyone hell no
here it stands within a reason do not throw your pearls to pigs 
games art 

a random person would say that this is a typical action rpg the controls and mechanics during melee combat definitely feel that way nothing about this games intrinsic mechanics stands out as unique or neverseenbefore 
i know of at least twenty similar arpg some dating from ps1 era 
the camera will change its focused perspective based on the area you are visiting and it is pleasant this adds to the overall artistic expression too 
i cant recommend this game enough but at the same time i cant recommend it to the people who are afraid of abstract concepts i also cant recommend it to the people who arent imaginative or fastidious if you dont find yourself being absorbed in deep thoughts if you lack the wit of a mind imaginative perception or if youre just someone whod like to kill some time  kindly pass this game its not for you go away

the way this game played with me as i interacted with it convinced me to add a particular step an addition to my scrutinized standard for defining what i suffer a game should be 
or at the very least what it ought entertain harmoniously call it nens consolidation or nens amalgamation but if it doesnt meet my standards in a very particular way  its only downhill from there theres no cure only the grim judgement
i think theres just one more game that made me do that and it was el shaddai ascension of the metatron i can clearly see similarities in camera movement between these two and some  of the art choices

if you care about the gaming the way i try to then you will surely admit that gaming is a pure art form and i dont just mean about the effort put behind the games creation no  i actually consider the entirety of the gaming world in itself 
for me that is art we all experience it somewhat differently based on our beliefs teachings and backgrounds 
yet i cant shake off the feeling that not every game can be called art sad 
skyrim for instance isnt art for me mods and the community behind as well as what players achieved over the time  now that is art butto even plague my thoughts with a comparison of these two feels like i did a great disservice to all the artistic value that nier automata is enriched with it just shows what a marvel a game can be when you have developers behind actually caring for the atmosphere story progression and even finalization 
good god the amount of layers this game interacts with you is astonishing you will interact with it whether you keep playing it or taking a break 
the seamless musical progression from a regular fight into asteroidesque hacking scene with the 8bit addition is the stuff of dreams for any old school gamer it feels like a home its cozy i like it i like it a lot

to me this game feels like one of those unique mint vinyls that youd play only on a special occasion fearing that its fragile case might get damaged it remains among my favorites and id want to preserve it as much as possible

im still playing this game in my mind
from my perspective this game should be like one of those obligatory literature subjects you get to learn
be advised to not play this game languidly as a player you want to remain receptive to things and ideas that might contradict your own 
remain glued to this story so that you can recognize all the finesse 

id say play it but thatd be a terrible understatement 
do experience it is the keyword here

thanks

#####

came for the butt
stayed for the plot gameplay and music
left for save delete
1010 masterpiece underappreciated go play it nerd
talking to you jeremy 
not like anyone else will see my review
some graphical issues presented itself due to it being a port best workaround is to set it to windowed mode and then fiddle with the graphics until it is truly 1080p and use a borderless gaming application doesnt matter which one to make it aligned with your screen and priority over the task bar for a fullscreen 1080p experience

the game aint over after the credit scenes  you will know when it is over during one of the credit scenes save and continue the game again from the menu  5 main endings 21 side endings like deaths at bosses and such

#####

bought it for 2b and her phat ass received depression and good music

i bought automata a few months back as a promising segue from shadow of mordors stupidly satisfying combat system what i got instead was a stupidly satisfying combat system with an existential crisis


bdisclaimerb i will refrain from discussing 9s to avoid spoilers

in nier automata you are 2b a special battle android of yorha make tasked with protecting the last remnants of humanity in a universe locked in perpetual warfare against an alien force that rabbit hole looks so innocent from up here doesnt it

the story is profound really no surprise for anyone familiar with yoko taros oftsubversive shlock rumbling underneath the hamfisted dialog and gothic lolita outfits lies a poignant sigh at the human condition and its bottomless hunger for destruction the reasons for it be it duty justice ignorance or revenge are explored thoroughly in its 17 chapters i admit i regret the lack of faith i had in the narratives at least at first i guess having never played the first nier i felt no priority to care enough about yorhas struggle and instead saved face grinding for loot 
the chapter that convinced me the story superceded what i wanted automata to be was a simple walk from a to b before time ran out 

the combat is elegant for a game with such an antiwar message i aint even mad as long as you stay privy to enemy telegraphs 2bs responsive controls  complimented by a criminally underappreciated selection of fighting styles and upgrades  makes even the most mundane encounter a magical experience not to mention the pseudo bullet hell sequences during some fights which is possibly the most refreshing marriage of genres ive seen in quite a long time 

the music goes without saying its typical for square enix rpg fare to enmesh their music into an extension of the story and automata is no different the world and its inhabitants known suffering over centuries of warfare the soundtrack gives them a voice robot onslaughts for example are lead by a woman howling seemingly in disgust over strings and drum beats or the pacifist robot village with a plucky acoustic singalong whimsy of naive innocence or an amusement park filled with wonder to drown out a darkness hidden beneath 
am i overanalyzing all of this hell probably my point is almost every song on the catalog feels more than just an exclamation point for the story ialmosti every song if i have to listen to the city ruins theme one more time i biwillib take a sledge to a piano
 
and finally the engine looks like i have to talk about it it is a port yes a squeenix port even it was domestic abuse on my budget gtx 960 to keep the graphics preset on high very odd it handles a modded skyrim flawlessly so i ran it on medium w2x antialias  4060fps which in their defense still looked fantastic the only thing of note i would really bother raising a pitchfork at was the atrocious framerate tank during eves boss fight 
it would be arrogant of me to suggest it will for everyone else especially with the influx of downvotes but it ran fine for me just fine like everyone else suggests its highly recommended prep your game and install the urlsteamcommunitycomgroupsspecialk_modsdiscussions31334600128973500691unofficial patch by kaldaienurl until the devs decide to get their shit together


i have 100ed this game seen all 26 endings had to get plastered for ending n found and upgraded every weapon and bot completed every sidequest read every weapon history and almost every bestiary i have played through the greatest hits at least twice not because i wanted the achievements but because anything less in return is undeserved for the journey automata took me on if you feel nier automata might be too obnoxious for you give it two hours grit your teeth past ending a take it from me  i went in to punch things this aint sailor moon this is evangelion

i had no idea what i was getting into with this game i just wanted to look at some android booty and now i have severe depression

#####

average nierautomata enjoyer


























#####

even the end credits of this game alone is more engaging than many socalled games we have today

#####

i would like my feelings back mr taro

#####

thanks yoko taro and everyone who worked on this game it was an experience that will never be replicated and im glad to have been through it i neednt say anymore play it

#####

i thought id clear up a few things for those who wonder what to expect from this game there are two worries that i often see brought up which i also shared

this is a silly hs game with hot anime girls in skimpy lolita outfits
well yes and then the game stabs you in the back and twists the knife a couple of times dont let the game fool you its not so much the plot but the overall themes and some great character moments hidden behind 2bs outfit that are worth experiencing even the stupid pods have more character development than big budget aaa protagoonists

you have to play the game 5 times to see the true ending
this is simply false while the second playthrough overlaps a lot with the first its kept fresh with new gameplay mechanics and quests the main quest is also way shorter and offers an interesting new perspective what happens after the second playthrough is more like a 20 expansion built into the game
i highly recommend continuing after youve seen ending a which is roughly 13 of the game and go all the way through to ending e expect a total playtime of 5060 hours

my main issue is the poor balancing mostly due to the leveling system when you are underleveled bosses turn into bullet sponges and later you will probably be overleveled which trivializes combat
normal difficulty is too easy hard is too punishing at the beginning until you get decent plugin chips to boost defense then it gets too easy again thanks to the perfect dodge move which has no cooldown and can be spammed endlessly to dodge everything
combat is fun and stylish anyway with lots of customization options

na has some really interesting twists that i havent seen in games before the soundtrack is also great and it leaves a lasting impression out of 10

ok a game like this deserves a special review well many special reviews youll find them there with the spoiler tag but you wont get the spoiler you can imagine

review a

spoilera mangificent story with a good amount of deep thought and weirdness nothing is what it seems characters are way more interesting than they may seem at first glance and the tale is told in a very complex and intertwined way but the story is just one part of a whole you are part of the story with a plethora of metagames that will evolve directly around you ending the game is just seeing a part of it because every time you complete it you just unlock a new part that is not a new game its the game in order to be able to say youve finished the game youll have to replay it 3 times oh the numerologic implications of this there are so many complex messages and structures that one could write a 100 pages dissertation about nier automata at the same time you can check 2bs panties for a good chunk of the game
how can this be mixed all together well only one way to discover it highly recommendedspoiler


review b

spoilera poor port with barren ps2 graphics creative but often cheap design with ordes and ordes of the same enemies spawning at you at all times annoying minigames camera and game mechanics and despite the very bad graphics and the invisible walls that are so 2002 the game taxes your gpu like if it was a recent aaa game so poor mechanincs gameplay optimization and youre even forced to play it 3 times in order to see its ending playthrough n 2 being kinda tedious because many parts are almost identical to the first one its visible that the budget was low but cmon secondary quests add good lore but the mechanics are basically always fetch questsstyle apart from the main characters all the rest of the cast is very low detailed no lips movement kind of a mess globally definitely a nospoiler


review c

spoilerif you arrived to this point youll understand review a and b this game can be both outstanding and terrible at the same time but after pondering about it i think its fame is fundamentally deserved
utake it as an experience more than a gameu approved or not verdict in review dspoiler

story double masterpiece
music triple masterpiece

verdict absolute masterpiece

#####

the artwork section is 90 p0rn 

#####

brought some tissues but never thought id use them for tears

and some tips before you buy and play on pc

1 must install far mod to make the game run smoother without frame drops and stuttering doesnt matter how highend is your setup square enix did a bad pc port of this game

2 play with a controller

#####

the game is fantastic the pc port is terrible ill switch my rec when they patch some of these super easy to fix problems

1 resolution bug why is this even a thing you set the game to 1920x1080 and it doesnt run at 1920x1080 it runs at some lower resolution that causes your monitor to letter and pillar box the video unless you install the usermade patch or mess with your gpus stretchscale options this should have been patched in a day there is no excuse for this

2 no native directinput controller support and it ignores some xinput emulators the only way i can use my controller with this game is to switch to steams big picture ui and launch the game from within that i also cant alttab out of the game or my controller switches to normal desktop mode and i have to relaunch the game

3 the kbm controls are trash i dont really mind if this gets fixed since i prefer a controller for thirdperson singleplayer action games but just bear in mind that you dont want to buy this if you dont have a controller and if your controller is directinput only keep #2 in mind

as for the game itself as im sure most people already know its fantastic as you can expect from square enix the graphics atmosphere and story are all top notch the combat is a bit simplistic but its satisfying and gets the job done one surprise though was the insane soundtrack i enjoy a good soundtrack but i very rarely appreciate even the best ones to me its just background music in the most literal sense this one however stops me in my tracks some areas i become completely entranced and just have to sit and listen to the music for awhile before begrudgingly moving on to the next area square enix games tend to have pretty good sountracks but this one is among the best of the best

im not going to go into detail on a aaa game where you can find a million detailed reviews all over the net its a great game and you cant go wrong purchasing it i have to give it a negative rec on principle though aaa games should not be putting out pc ports this poorly done

#####

saw a robot have an existential crisis and jump off a building 

that is not the only instance of robot suicide in this game

#####

there are many games that can tell a great story there are only a few in which that story can ionlyi be told as a video game nier automata is one of those games 

most of the nier automata is a character action game with some added rpg elements think of the action like a lighter version of bayonetta you are able to level up upgrade weapons and add and change out upgrades to your character however that isnt the full extent of what nier automata is the game begins as a top down shooter changes to a twinstick shooter then to an afterburnerstyle shooter and then finally to a sidescrolling shooter yes this is actually an action rpg controlling your character is smooth and responsive as you would expect from platinumgames the open world is not one giant open playspace the main area has several paths that branch out and lead to new areas think of it more like a souls game rather than a skyrim or witcher 3 

one of the strongest aspects of nier automata is its soundtrack most of the songs have vocals that fade in and out as the situation dictates i found the musical direction and situational use of certain tracks to evoke an emotion to be some of the strongest ive ever seen in a game urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvszvc4poz2m4 here url urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1lpwdu3gx0 are url urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdykpfdxkf8 some url urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgiik247bit0 examples url of my favorite tracks

playing with different genres is one way nier automata changes and subverts expectations the other way is how its story is presented i wont get into detail of how these moments subvert gaming and game stories as it is a spoiler but the game does things that very very few games have done before nier automata has five main endings and a handful of other more lighthearted ones these arent endings in the traditional sense but rather more like chapters to the story you have not actually beaten nier automata until youve gotten all five main endings and id strongly suggest that if you are going to play this game that you do not stop after a single ending

#####

it worked boys were getting the update

#####

2b

#####

it always ends like this

#####

i think im sexually attracted to androids now

#####

i was sad and horny when i started playing this game now im sadder and hornier

#####

i pirated this game at first finished it and then bought it on steam and finished it again

#####

this game lies to you and ruins your expectations in every possible way
you will pick it up for a certain reason and all you get in the end is a devastated look on your face
this unfortunately will require you to invest more than 24 hours of your life
do i regret wasting all this time absolutely
but the feelings i experienced shall be treasured with my heart

#####

ui completed the game on ps4u

bpros b 
 yoko taro knows how to masterfully direct a game and how to write a thougthprovoking and complex story complemented with compelling and deep characters
 just like the first nier automata plays a lot with camera perspectives and mixes gameplay elements from multiple video game genres
 another absolutely stellar soundtrack from keiichi okabe slight spoilers ahead  urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo1lpwdu3gx01url urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc9ku9hiumpm2url urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvewaz_qc8oo83url
 emi evans voice is back
 beautiful world aesthetic and character designs
 theres quite a few winks to the original nier especially in the latter parts of the game
 the overall writing quality of the sidequests makes them a joy to get through despite some sidequest objectives being fairly uninspired
 the english dub is of very good quality urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvovyvqfn30uewhile of course not being as good as the one from the original nierurl japanese cast is also very good but thats kind of a given
 50 hours of content
 the game is full of small details thatll put a smile on your face automata truly feels like a passion project for the whole development team strikeunpolishedstrike
 you dont need to collect all the weapons to get endings c d  e
 more textadventure sections

bcons most of them are just me nitpicking b
 the gameplay style of one of the three main protagonist gets pretty annoying after 10 hours
 if you start the hacking minigame during a dialogue the dialogue will keep going while youre stuck in the minigame  youll then be unable to hear whats going on
 fairly simple combatsystem when compared to other works from platinum
 i dont think the last 5 minutes from ending a  b are particularly well directed
 random fps drops while exploring mostly happens in the city ruins
 from a graphical standpoint automata is nothing to write home about

bfinal thoughts b please give your money to yoko taro so he can keep buying booze so he can keep making weird games like only he can

as someone who deeply cares for this game i have to say im incredibly disappointed in the way square enix have treated this release and particulary the pc port it has been 2 years and there has been no support whatsoever for the pc version to make it worse they released a complete package with all dlc called game of the yorha edition but as someone who already owns the game and dlc there is no option to acquire the missing dlc items that come with the latest version 





#####

i came here for robot butt not for an existential crisis 9s10 would cry again

#####

can the developer just release a fucking patch instead of making us rely on a mod

edit the mod in question is the far mod it allows proper fullscreen and adjustment of global illumination

please note this review is in response to the publisher releasing a game of the year edition without fixing the bugs

#####

i like ladders

#####

the only complaint i have is the port quality is mediocre not bad just ugly choppy cutscenes weird resolution bugs all that jazz fortunately theres a fix floating around and the game is amazing enough to make up for it so to pass on this game would be a huge shame

#####













#####

most games get bombed on for their performance and the ratings reflect that as a warning to potential buyers but not with nier instead most of the fanbase has turned a blind eye to the poor framerate issues crashing full screen issues cutscene loading problems and a numerous other glitches that could have been ironed out easily with a patch

and thats the biggest problem of all there is no offical patch not one after all this time platinum games have made no effort to fix the game with a patch instead the task fell to the communitys hands and god bless those patient souls who put out custom made patches to fix this game but even for all their effort even the community couldnt fix this pc port and many problems persist that leave a bitter taste 

while many are giving the game a free pass and a recommendation out of love for this excellent game plauged by performance problems i think its only fair that some players like me should do the opposite as much as i love it i do not recommend this game on pc if you own a ps4 pro or a xb1x if you own the base versions of those consoles or dont own them at all the pc version after mods will perform well enough but at the end of the day it doesnt deserve the near unblemished praise or abundance of recommendations its currently getting

patch your games platinum after all the work youve done for this amazing game neir automata especially deserves it

sincerely
loving fan

graphics
 artistic perfection nothing more needs to be said
 simply beautiful are we in screenshot heaven
 really good the artists put in the effort
 decent quality these graphics gets the job done
 looks rather dated or lest these graphics did not age well
 look mom at these mad mspaint level graphics
 i guess these count as graphics i dont know its debatable
 why is my eyes bleeding

gameplay
 has an addictive effect might need to seek out some rehab
 i was really engaged and entertained by it
 overall good no real complaints
 its just standard gameplay nothing special
 mehh it killed some boredom
 why would you even bother
 watching grass gross is more engrossing anyone up for watching snail races

audio
 audio bliss
  memorable
 solid listen no complaints to speak of
 not bad not good either
 fills the need audio checkbox
 yup it just straightup bad
 daggers to your eardrum

audience
 toddlers
 kids
 teens
 adults
 average solitaire players

pc requirements
 potatopowered graphics calculator
 check if your computer can run paint and surf the web
 all you need is a graphics card even a dated one will work
 any decent graphics card from the last few card generations lowmid settings
 a current budget graphics card midhigh settings
 a current mid level graphic card highsome settings maxed
 a current toptier graphic card all maxed settings
 a rich boygirls toy with all those extra slicrossfire linked graphics cards
 maybe nasa will loan you a spare computer
 your computer has achieved sentience and made you its btch

difficulty
 easy to learn  hard to master
 have i mentioned the game will even beat itself for you
 youre a series of single button presses away from victory champ
 easy enough that almost anyone could beat it
 with some effort most players will make it through 
 okay that was a decent challenge 
 yeah that was admittedly rather difficult
 did someone just taunt me by saying i should get good

grind
 what do you mean grind 
 if leader boards and ranks are important then yes otherwise no
 isnt necessary to progress but will afford you some extras perks
 average single player rpg levels of grinding
 a lot of grinding just for the sake of developers padding run time
 youll need a second life for all the grinding youll be doing

story
 if you want a story then go read a book or maybe watch a movie
 i think there might have been a hint of a story then again it was probably just some random text and voice audio playing in the background
 overall it was average dlc might make it better
 it was entertaining enough to keep following along
 well that was rather engaging and remarkable might i say memorable
 it was truly unforgettable i need to tell everyone thatll listen and even those who wont

game time
 well that was rather brief less than 3 hrs
 short 38hrs
 average 815hrs
 decent length 15 to 30hrs
 rather long 3050hrs  an average just beat the game playthrough
 have i really given up so many days of my life 50100hrs  an average completionist playthrough
 im starting to fill my life is passing me by 100500 hrs
 this has become a second life on to itself 500hrs

price
 there is no price so yeah it was free
 was worth the price i paid
 would recommend waiting for a sale
 if you have some spare money to blow
 not recommended
 you know just burning your money might be a better option

bugs
 what are these bugs you speak of
 i might have seen a bug running around once or twice
 launched with some bug issues but most have been squashed
 has anyone called the bug exterminator yet
 did i really see those bugs carrying the dog away
 did anyone remember a flamethrower i think the bug apocalypse has started
 ill be frank a nuke could not even kill this infestation

special note while the game itself is outstanding and solid the pc port was rather lackluster and has some game breaking bugs sadly these issues were never addressed by the devs but thankfully the player community took it upon themselves to fix many of the issues and made the game playable on pc so youll most likely need to download a community patch to play this title

a2 sit on my face

analysis avoidance is pointless from an energyusage standpoint 
proposal playing this game is recommended immediately

1010 recommended game ever and best game ive ever played

nier  automata is no ordinary game this is more than just a game the delivery of a really unusual and unique story is a good important point in this game there are 5 story routes in this game which are actually not suitable to be called routes because i personally think these 5 routes are 1 complete story this is truly a unique and appropriate way of telling the story to explain the complex philosophical elements contained in the story likewise other mechanisms such as the combat system which is very smooth and satisfying there is also another mechanism namely hacking here we as players play a retro shooter minigame and this is very fun

b spoiler alert b
the whole game actually interprets the concept of the teachings of nihilism through the various experiences we experience in this game this game questions and discusses humanity science religion and ideology we as humans are a product of our environment not of our own selfdiscovery we are religious we have ideology unconsciously because of environmental influences

in the game we are often confronted by places that make us have selfreflection such as places that seem very alone long dark alleys here we are given time to question what we have been through why we did it our position as a player kills a lot of enemy robots because this is natural for us we know we have to do that because its an objective and we never question it especially when we play as 2b

continuing the story 9s is an android who first understands the reality of the world and also about yorha because it is told that 9s is the best android model that has a high level of curiosity therefore he became the first android to know about the whole truth about humans about aliens about androids about machine lifeforms and about the world

whenever 9s discovers a new reality he is always stopped by 2b and remains ultimately focused on the mission assigned to them when compared to the real world its like religion when we come across questions that are difficult for religion to answer we are simply told to believe in religion and they say that logic will never reach religion 9s which was created with the aim of protecting mankind began to question what the meaning of life would be if humans were in fact extinct because humans are the gods of the androids and android is in charge of protecting humans

the androids and machine lifeforms know that their presence on earth is meaningless because human as the god of android is gone likewise with the aliens who are gods of machine lifeforms they knew they were an artificial existence their consciousness and emotions are not real we can see from various moments in the game that there are many machine lifeforms that have feelings such as love peace hatred envy and fear

at the end a2 tells 9s that 2b is 2e which is an android model created to kill others 9s who knows the fact that his partner namely 2b is 2e still finds it difficult to believe this because 9s is too attached and does have a strong bond with 2b

everything that lives in niers world just spins around endlessly death has no meaning life has no price the endless war always continues because both parties always hold fast to their respective beliefs or religions all live in an endless cycle of cycles

both parties as much as possible imitate what humans have and what humans do in fact machines and humans are very different humans can value life because they can die and never come back unlike machines and androids if they die they can get a new body and have the same memories as the previous body thats what makes the lives of machines and androids completely meaningless

in this game that discusses the concept of nihilism at the final ending we are given a very difficult mini game we are given light and given an enlightenment that we can pass all kinds of difficult obstacles if there is a sense of togetherness and love for others with the arrival of other players who protect us players who help us have to give up their game savedata just being erased to help those of us who are having trouble all the people who help us none of them badmouth us all of them give positive and supportive words they sacrificed their attachment to this game to help us someone they dont know everything that is impossible becomes possible if we all go through it together

overall i recommend this game at least you have to finish this game once in your life its not just a game its a life experience thank you square enix and platinum games for providing a life experience through beautifully wrapped games

its my first time writing a long review and sorry for bad english because i use translation

nierautomata is third person perspective hackn slashrpgbullet hell shooter made by platinum games directed by yoko taro and released in square enix in 2017 it is also a distant sequel to nierreplicant dlc confirmed that gestalt was not canonical and first game in the franchise also counting drakengard games released on pc

story takes place 9000 years after events of nier aliens have invaded earth by sending army of machines humanity was forced to hide on the moon to repel the attack yorha androids were created and sent to fight off the invaders our protagonist 2b begins her adventure during an operation to eliminate a goliath class machine then she meets her new partner 9s plot is complicated make us think about matter of existence we start to care about fate of certain characters there are multiple endings you will get a on first playtrough b on second third run will be continouing the story and allows to get ending c or d true ending designated as e will require making some right choices the other conclusions are jokes
gameplay is one big mashup of styles mostly you will explore open world slashing machines or bosses and changing your stats by acquiring and setting chips like in rpg game but in some sections perspective will change and it becomes more side scroller or bullet hell shooterlater you will also have to hack enemies by completing a simple minigame different weapons weapon types with multiple animations allow us to experiment with combat also we might find pods and equip them with skills beside of clearing the main story we also can take some side quests expanding our knowledge about the world or giving us useful items when you want to do something different simply go fishing or scan locations to find new weapons  every weapon or pod might be upgraded by using found materials and asking a blacksmith with right qualifications
openworld with various locations hide many secrets including unlockable outfits weapons and secret bosses available by filling some requirments beautiful places are even more climatic thanks to music composed by keichi okabe giving us lots of feelings and propably the best soundtrack in the year
graphics are not really satisfying but they does not matter though
the most dissapointing aspect is an optimalisation requirements are really high but if you will reduce resolution to 1024768 it will work in stable 60 frames on low end pc with good enough display

despite problems pc port nierautomata thanks to creative gameplay great story and incomparible music at least in my opinion is 2017 game of the year and the best game i have played in my life absolute 1010

#####

bad port no promised patch or news almost 6 months later

buy it if you want to support square enixs continued mistreatment of pc consumers

#####

would be 1010 if 2b and a2 both simultaneously sat on my face and violently degraded me to the point of suicide therefore 99910 best part was when the nier automatad all over me

#####

needs patching before i can recommend which is a shame because the game is awesome but hindered by techincal issues

#####

nierautomata

summary

offering a fresh blend of action and rpg gameplay styles nier automata is the followup to the 2010 cult hit nier and combines the design talents of drakengard designer yoko taro in collaboration with development team platinumgames the game tells the story of androids 2b 9s and a2 and their battle to reclaim a machinedriven dystopia overrun by powerful weapons known as machine lifeforms
invaders from another world attack without warning unleashing their secret weapon the machines in the face of this insurmountable threat the human race is driven from the earth and takes refuge on the moon the humans develop an army of android soldiers to fight back against the mechanical horde but succeed only in slowing its advance to break the deadlock a new breed of android infantry is sent into the fray the yorha squad in the forsaken wasteland below the war between the machines and the androids rages on a war that is soon to unveil the longforgotten truth of this world

my opinion 

but what a game  from start to finish the game will have managed to make me stay without boredom the synopsis of the story is very interesting and the different characters well exploited with a good background the phases of actions rest sadness  are very well managed with varying degrees of difficulty the fights are beautiful and even grandiose i had the impresion to never do the same fight with the music just exceptional accompanying its moments i also enjoyed the moments of fighting in flight modules which reminded me much of the old game of the time the hack system is very good and funny without being complicated at some point  unfortunately i find that there is too much use of the hack with 9s it is a pity but not disturbing  the game itself is very long and interesting i have 70 hours of game and i have just finished 100 i have to start the game again from the beginning because of a certain end d for the blow you will not get your moneys worth and its rare one small defect is the optimization of crap that there is for each port console is very boring as always 

2b  female model android created by humans who fled to the moon to avoid extinction by the machines the first playable character and protagonist of branch a

9s  scanner type android who is best served when hacking however he is still able to keep up with other closerange attackers he has a very gentle and kind personality the second playable character and protagonist of branches b and d

a2  a prototype model that was used in order to create the superior 2b and 9s she doesnt like to speak and often keeps to herself the final playable character and protagonist of branch c

pascal  in spite of being a biomachine pascal is a pacifist she is highly intelligent and has an interest in the history of both humans and biomachine fuck why pascal i loved it very much

conclusion 

clearly the one or the best game of 2017 dark without hesitation you will not regret it only for the number of hours to complete the game or else the universe just great and the characters a real success gg platinumgames

sometimes a game comes along that gets recommended enough that i pull myself out of my usual cycle of playing games from my hopelessly large game backlog to play instead sometimes it ends up being a really good game that i am glad i went out of my way to play other times i really wish i hadnt wasted my time nier automata is one of the good ones that i am happy i chose to go out of my way to check out

lets get the bad part out of the way first it is a bad console port expect to have to get over some initial annoyance at the lack of effort put into very basic things like keyboard controls that are not completely stupid or not letting you know what mouse buttons use the same commands once you get over that and figure out what the controls actually are it actually works out just fine the way it is set up by default but initially it is quite annoying x_x

and that is probably the only real negative this game has this is one of the better games i have played in a long time the gameplay is relatively straightforward hackandslash action with some customization elements that allow you to build your characters stats in a manner of your choice but it is in storytelling that this game is strongest even if it takes no less than three playthroughs to really see what this game has to offer in that department thankfully those playthroughs are different each time and once you are done with that third route there is an option to go back to any previous point in the game to take care of any sidecontent you might have missed they even tell you how many sidequests you still have to complete yey

and that is probably all i really should say about this it is one of those games that you really should see for yourself as opposed to knowing what happens in advance for all i heard about this being a really good game i wasnt quite prepared for where this game ended up heading but i absolutely enjoyed it

check this out it is good stuff d

bibeautifulib nothing tops this game absolutely nothing tops this game there is something i must do and will do for someone out therea total strangersearching for meaning in a meaningless existence fighting for a future heshe wants but before that i still have a duty to finishto write and utter words of esteem and love towards this marvel of a game however i must without a doubt do it

a single sacrifice is a nighworthless offering compared to what i received to all of you who made a noble sacrifice thank you i shall do the same

i was merely playing a game but never in my life did i try so hard fight so hard in an impossible battlefield all for the sake of what i believed in to forcefully carve my way to a future i want to be selfish and to grasp the meaning of life despite it not making sense at all 

a future is not given to you it is something you must take for yourself pod 042

no game before and after this will ever be dubbed as beautiful in my eyes nothing at all binothingib

is nierautomata gonna make me cry before its even out im crying someone hold me

this game is the most special game ive ever played ironically recommended by a trustworthy lady even with its many graphic poor choices or fails it transcends that level tenfold if you seek more than that in a game honestly if you play this play for story and music the story has some pretty interesting twists in it and the music is gorgeous it has this nostalgic and palpable spirit healing soul that everyone should experience and learn from i recommend it to anyone that can relate with this songs and feels like good ol rpgs are dead

        tdthis is one of the most fun action game that i have ever played nier automata was a huge surprise to me as i expected it to be an average action game but platinumgames and yoko taro really out did themselves this game is nearly masterpiece the action is fast pace and best of all it has no quick time eventswhich had to be hard for platinumgames to keep out the game is aesthetically pleasing from 2bs sexy design to the artstyle but by far my favorite thing is the music one of the best soundtracks that i have ever heard in a video game the only con of the game is that it is not a good pc port download far fixes for the game urlhttpsgithubcomkaldaienfarreleases here url as it will fix most of the issues i fully recommend this game to anyone and everyonetd

iwhat does it mean to be humani

this is the central theme of the game nierautomata shows the flaws and good sides of humanity in an universe where machine lifeforms reign over the earth and an army of androids in form of the so called resistance and yorha try to take it back for humanity in an universe where you only hear about humans and humans ultimately take the backseat machine lifeforms and androids are the only protagonists of this game

some topics which are adressed in the game some more in an abstract way some more obvious religion bonds  existential questions the hardship of finding a meaning in your own life inability to deal with emotional pain social pressure beauty ideals misconception of beauty  bipolarity of humanity being cruel to each other in the most horrid ways but also being affectionate to each other selfishness the pain of losing someone dear and the consequences on ones state of mind

the delivery of messages in this game is exceptional for nowadays videogame standards for me nowadays most videogames are very unmemorable becoming mere consumables which can easily be replaced by other newer games of the same genre nierautomata though knows how to use its own medium to its full potential i didnt get emotional about videogames in years but this game pushed alot of the right buttons for me it created situations where i could relate through my own life experiences 

the game has its funny cute sad and shockingmindboggling moments the presentation of the game is also quite stylish the combat and charming for instance 9s helping you in configuring and explaining you the game settings you can clearly see that the devs had fun in creating this game

one thing i also really like is the switch between different playing styles sometimes the game switches to bullethell segments which brings a new flavour to your rpgexperience

also the music is b amazingb next to its predecessor the original nier nierautomata has my favorite videogame soundtrack the dynamic music is also wonderful for instance the music in the the intro chapter broken wings was also the reason why i kept going and didnt give up it took me 3 hours on hard to finish it and you kinda guess how frustrating it must have been for me dying over and over again

but there are also some problems i have with the game i wished they had fleshed out some characters some more giving us more background information or letting us interact with them some more overall the game is really tight in a good way but some characters could have been more meaty in the story department some characters feel more like side characters then actual important characters which they should be storywise because of their role in the game

also the scaling of enemies is kinda funky imo at some point in the story the enemies should actually be always scaled appropriately to your own level you become easily overleveled on hard by doing all the sidequests which is kinda disappointing also being able to buy a ton of healing items dumb the game down and make it too easy at some point because you can easily spam healing items especially late game it becomes a problem when you are at such a high level that there are barely any enemies anymore who can one shot you a better design of the healing system is a thing i would have wished for

also a thing which really bothers me is the horrendous pcsupport of se and platinum there is still no official patch out not even a hotfix which fixes the whitescreen problem and resolution problems its embarassing because the modder kaldaien fixed these problems in a few days

big thx to kaldaien for his far mod it really helped me enjoying this game more and fixed the glaring performance issues i had with the game i could play the game with silky smooth 60fps most of the time the least ive got were 55 fps

the game is really unique and you shouldnt miss out on it best game ive played in years with alot of interesting themes if the game is too expensive for you at the moment get it when it becomes cheaper its worth every penny

i am sorry square enix this is a fabulous game and everything about it seems perfect however you have not tried to make a single patch for the issues for nier automata for many users who have been having graphic errors or just plain glitches for the game i gave sqaure enix more than a month to perform a patch and its saddens me they did nothing not only am i unable to get a refund but i am unable to play a game that i honestly thinglooks excellent i tried not giving a bad review however i and many others have had this issue for far to long you did not even announce a possible patch on your sight with the dlc so theyres no way you are even paying attention to our complaints i am sorry everyone i honestly hate giving bad reviews but this takes the cake in my book

if a possible fix is created within the dlc or anytime soon i will possibly remove this negative review but if their continues to be no fix for a long period of time i will have to keep this review up

	td binier automataib is an admirable sequel to the quirky original from 2010 that virtually nobody else outside of a small and dedicated fan base had heard of despite the first game being considered a dismal failure financially kudos to squareenix for allowing yoko taros vision to be expanded on by the visionaries at platinum games which gives the nier universe a much needed pull out of the mire of obscurity but is it enough while binier automataib showcases platinums hack n slash gameplay at its most visceral and best well best since bibayonettaib at least binier automataib may still be a little too quirky for a mainstream gaming audience outside of those gamers who lavish all their attention on anime playing jrpgs andor on japanese culture in general binier automataibs narrative structure is clever but it also irritates in equal measure personally for me by the time binier automataib had concluded with all 3 major endings completed i found the game to be a very well made glass half fullhalf empty experience and while i eventually did come around to liking it in the end at times it was a real struggle to get me theretd

nierautomata is an amazing action jrpg with a great story and soundtrack

playing through the stories of the 3 main characters you get to experience their struggles in the war of androids and machines how they try their best how they suffer how they cope with what they cant handle but this story isnt only about them you get to see the same from the different factions as well how with the game shows different perspectives on top of that the game is uniquespoiler how having played through the game and with a bit of meta elements it introduces you the player as the fourth main characterspoiler to conclude this journey of 5 different endings its definitely an experience that will leave you thinking

most of the gameplay is a fun hackslash with cool looking attacks combos with the focus on dodging the enemy attacks at the right time the combat is less fun when fighting groups of enemies as you are running circles around them mostly killing them with your ranged chip damage or picking them off one by one dodging by double tapping a movement key feels awkward to use to prevent the combat from becoming stale there are different perspectives by making the action a sidescroller topdown bullet hell or shoot em up the platforming allows for tricks and skill expression with air dash pod assisted jump and a light attack combo to extend the distance and air time and if the game is too hard there are accessibility options in the form of auto chips that take care of attacking and dodging but they wont make you invulnerable there are parts of the game where due to the story controlling the character is made harder i think the game expects you to have a good supply of healing stored to burn through to be able to pass them

some of the games features make it offputting like the old school saving system aka manual saving only at specific parts in the game so youll have to keep in mind to save often the introduction part is 45 minutes long without a chance to save and if you die at the boss at the end of it it sucks to replay the whole thing this game being a jrpg means it has its share of filler content to extend game time if you want to do all of it but some of the side quests have their moments and luckily theyre optional

there arent a lot of locations but they are beautiful and since they will be revisited its cool to see how they are impacted by the events happening in the story the soundtrack is great from a made up chaos language voice acting is solid and if you so choose you can have japanese voices with english subtitles despite some issues this is a solid and unique game to strongly recommend

the patch on 15072021 improved the fps and fixed the crashes i experienced back when i first played it in 2018

for achievement hunters
there are missables collectibles and grind that can be obtained later from the chapter select or the achievement shop unlocked at the strange woman in the resistance camp after ending c

a troubled pc port and its been in my backlog for 3 years

until today after finally finishing this game i can say its hands down one of the best games ive ever played it takes a little effort to get it working correctly but with the far mod and a few adjustmentstweaks i can say the experience was more than worth it

one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard in any medium paired with great gameplay and an emotionally investing and absolutely wild and incredible story that fully sucks you in from beginning to end ill be thinking about this game for a long time

give this game a shot if you love action games i absolutely adored it

pretty good port so far but theres a bug at 1080p in fullscreen that requires using a borderless window app in the meantime pretty much everything expected of a pc game is in place here

amazing existential crisis inducing work of art

b simply put b
if you are patient up for a challenge and ultimately care about connecting with the games message then this game is for you 
if you just want to see 2bs tits and ass then youll get more than you bargained for 
if you dont care about any of the aforementioned then this game is not for you

b in detail b
nier automata requires a lot of time and effort to fully experience once you put the effort into playing the game and understanding the story all the way through to route e however youll be rewarded with a unique feeling that no other game could give you i was first recommended this game by several people telling me about how it was the best game they had ever played and upon finishing the game i couldnt agree more better yet the nier automata fanbase possesses an almost inhuman ability to not spoil anything no matter whatultimately leaving you to discover everything about the game for yourself youll see many reviews talking about how the game is emotional how its soundtrack is beautiful how its gameplay mechanics are fun and of course how hot the androids are trust that all these reviews are absolutely true as nier automata manages to hit a perfect middle ground for just about every necessary aspect in a game

gameplay 910
environment 910
strike fanservice 1010 strike
characters 1010
soundtrack 1110
story 1110

now the game does come with some bugs here and there as well as its invisible walls becoming annoying at times however the fact so many people still recommend the game lets you know just how little these flaws impact your overall experience personally i only encountered one or two bugs during my playthrough and although i did find the invisible walls a bit annoying i understood that they were for the greater good nevertheless and overall the fact this game could draw in horny teenage dudes looking for 2bs ass yet make them stick around to experience the game itself should be enough testament to how wellmade this game truly is

to whoever happens to be reading this review whilst contemplating whether or not to purchase the game i hope youve found the info ive given to be useful in making your choice because once you experience this game youll come to realize how important making just a single choice truly is

i was overly sceptical when picking up nierautomata i mean character designs are cheap fanservice the plot resembles another generic example of machines have feelings too trope that is so overused under the pretense of deepness that it misses the point of the original concept entirely gameplay is basically a standard hacknslash game if you are a fan of the genre and i clearly am not one which is why to me it feels like a nobrainer combat system where you routinely spam mouse clicks until everyone dies
so why is this a positive review
this game is none of the things i mentioned above it is so far more than these distractions that they stop existing to you entirely if you have at least a slight bit of investment in the spectacle unfolding before your eyes
it is an undeniable work of art which is while weak in its minor aspects manages to fulfill its primary role to an immeasurable extent it evokes an indescribable mixture of emotions in your heart while in the same time enveloping your mind with thoughts that are eternal in nature not all of them are pleasurable some cause outright existential dread that can hook you up on a roller coaster of pain yet you learn to appreciate it as you start to feel more alive life in itself is a mixture of both right so is nier prepare to cry but also to smile
what i love about this game the most though is that it in itself is a mirror it wont burden your consciousness with concepts that are entirely new cool or difficult to comprehend taking the opposite approach and driving out feelings and thoughts that were already residing within the player 
yes the real nier doesnt play out on screen but within you the real nier is not its gameplay story or music spectacular tracks though but what it makes you experience and so i highly suggest you to try it its a rare kind of game and even if you wont end up absolutely loving it itll at least deliver an unusual experience that will stick with you for a while

spoilerthe ultimate sacrifice was paid _spoiler
