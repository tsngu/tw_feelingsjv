h1original review 1202024h1
i cannot express how incredibly disappointed i am in amplitude we are three months post launch and not only have they made a game with several inexplicable design decisions like the change from four player coop to three they havent bothered to fix frequently reported launch day bugs they should have caught in playtesting  even with more than a month since the last patch unfortunately the new patch has introduced new bugs that make it obvious theyre not bothering to test the game in multiplayer at all

as an aside the interface lacks a ton of useful info you cant see turret stats outside of placing a new one for example but thats just an annoyance compared to the rest of it

editing this list in the review update items still present have been moved down to the new list
list
saving and loading a game sometimes breaks quests for clients
clients cant complete sweepers first quest if the host has completed it
clients always see every weapon in the shop listed as heavy and sometimes see different stats on the weapons
eriaudys fight is hopelessly bugged for clients missing animations missing health barsthe devs acknowledged these issues in a forum reply on november 2 theyre still not fixed on january 20
list

and the new ones introduced in last weeks update that are frankly offensive to the players
list
clients lose almost all their movement speed for a second or two after meleeing or being hit by another players melee
clients hit by an exploding barrel ilose the ability to movei the only fix is to quit and reconnect
list

i fear the damage has already been done judging by the player count but i hope amplitude fixes this stuff the graphics are good and the gameplay has potential but i will not recommend this game in its current state

h1update 3302024h1
this is not an update i wanted to write i was so excited for this game hoping that things would be fixed and amplitude could begin the long road to bringing it back to life no luck my friends and i have had fun with the core gameplay and weve added a bunch of hours since my original review but the multiplayer bugs and lack of updates have left us thinking were pretty much done after frustration really took over our last run

list
clients still cannot see resource indicators on crystal slots
clients still cannot see spawning indicators on the minimap
purchasing items from the shop sometimes buys multiple for host and clients
remapping the use key is only partially respected i still have to press e for a whole bunch of things like advancing text boxes buying from shops and selecting a character i forgot this one in my previous list
when joining a multiplayer lobby the game sometimes emits an earsplitting buzzing sound for a few seconds it is butterly inexcusableb that amplitude publicly acknowledged this bug just after launch and its not fixed five months later
clients cannot see the dialogue in the elevator its hidden behind the next level selector
eriaudys fight is still bugged for clients though it is now together enough that they can participate animations are still missing and clients can see him when spoilerhes supposed to be invisiblespoiler
you cant skip the final cutscene its the same pretty much every time though a couple dialogue lines are characterspecific its three solid minutes of the same thing literally every single time
multiple items and abilities have poorlyworded descriptions for example comrades fanatics only chip grants bonuses if there are only comrade turrets in a room does that apply to heroes what about the crystal bot what about comrade through testing we determined it only means other turrets but since most of the ui lacks hard numbers we had to science it we shouldnt have to science it and there are a ton of these issues
were missing station cards where are they how do we get them we thought it was 100ing collectibles in an area but if thats the case the achievement count and our ingame counts dont match and again the ui doesnt tell us
weapon dps is buggy as hell switching weapons while looking at one on the ground results in the displayed dps of the new weapon changing which one is the real number who knows
list

im sure theres plenty more im forgetting there have been two substantive updates in the five months since launch with no communication on a roadmap or other future enhancements beyond a new character the game as far as we are concerned is abandoned unless amplitude puts major work into it and picks up the pace of updates

judging by the player count which stands at around 60 concurrent players worldwide as of this writing were not the only ones

#####

good game solid 710
best enjoyed in multiplayer due to lacking quality of life functions for npc companions
easy to get started hard to master
a worthy successor of dungeon of the endless with the addition of this game being a twinstick shooter
very challenging sometimes just unfair pacing is often lacking regardless if you play alone or with friends
partially because of the progression system mostly because of the level design

session time vary heavily between 1015 minutes and 3045 minutes depending on how experienced your team is average session time is to be expected within 2535 minutes
overall content is probably worth circa 20 hours for me according to the games progression bars

singleplayer is much harder than multiplayer due to the lack of essential npc commands to have them assist you meaningfully some script and pathing errors were especially frustrating at times when you are already missing essential commands to control them

the last wish edition which i got is not worth it in my humble opinion
the art book is not worth to be called an art book with just eight pdf pages worth of a handful of character sketches and promotion art material while the soundtrack is good it comes only as mp3 the rest are just cosmetics without any effect to the game as it should be nonetheless cosmetics interest me not all in addition to the fact you can hardly see and enjoy them on screen seeing all the tiny avatars

the 30 eud price tag for the standard edition in 2023 is fair i would recommend it at a 33 discount
the last wish edition on the other hand was through and through an expensive dissapointment in comparison 
i do not recommend the last wish edition at all

special high praise goes towards the pr team who is very active on steam forums 
you have very good forums moderation and developers replies in no time not only giving an overall great impression of amplitude studios but also gives hope that with the games release it will not end there is more to come for the future which might even justify an increase of my assessment of the game keep up the good work

#####

echoing other player sentiments here as well

the game is significantly less strategic than its predecessor but the trade off of isometric action fails to deliver as a replacement every level feels like a chore to slog through

characters are extremely watered down uninteresting unfun and lack all of the flavor that dote had also you dont find them randomly anymore instead you just start a run with 3 predetermined dudes and thats it

items what items all i have is a white green and blue version of a gun with slightly higher dps all of the depth of merchant interactions is also completely gone

dust and light switch flipping is pretty much gone a core aspect of the previous game watered down to the point that it might as well not even be in the game

monsters spawn in fixed rooms and its no longer based on the doors being opened but instead by time passing further punishing strategic play giving you less time to think but it doesnt make the game any more exciting to play

the meta progression systems are just so bland and uninspiring this is a game that should have focused entirely on unlocking new characters weapons items etc instead its the typical spend 3 cores for 10 fire rate 25 max health



honestly im not surprised the trailers gave a good impression of the game and that impression wasnt good not to mention the weird and very underwhelming beta periods my expectations werent high

like darkest dungeon 2 this is a successor that tries to become more approachable and fancy while watering down all of the beloved features of the original game until its an unappealing tofu paste the increased graphical fidelity means that content will be slow and modding would be difficult

dote was an amazing hidden gem of a game i just wanted more of that game not whatever this game is trying to be

#####

i would sincerely not recommend this game

if you came expecting a spiritual successor to dungeon of the endless a fantastic game then go look somewhere else cause this definitely isnt it

terrible boring and shallow gameplay
brainless difficulty
elements barely matter worth a squat just get neutral damage everything and breeze through the game without any required brain cells
all tower defense paths are random and cant be managed like in the old game
only two gun types leading to horrible replayability
almost worthless hero abilities basically entirely forgettable
writing that even gearbox wouldnt touch with a 10 foot pole
good god that writing the conversations and quotes and nonstop quips that wouldnt have landed 10 years ago makes me want to rip my brain out of my ears

do yourself a damn favour and just go replay the original this is absolutely nothing you want to invest your time in

#####

i am a big dote fan 100 achievements completed and was really looking forward to this one and bought the preorder pack first off i have to say that i knew this was not going to be a 100 dote sequel i anticipated that also i have to say that i feel very harsh for giving this a thumbs down because it is not outright bad i had some fun with it but now after 20h  a few in closed beta is just not fun enough for me anymore to even want to finish it at this point which makes me not want to recommend it

what i expected from ed was dote with an additional action component meaning you control your character more directly and have less idle times conceptually this sounded great to me realistically it turned out quite differently

very good
 enemies have quite some variation in looks behavior properties and their design is nice i enjoyed them overall
 the 3d environments looks great i love the room designs
 shadows and lights look great
 shooting in general is fun autoaim works well autoaim also puts the focus on rpg elements rather than the players skills
 the different guns have different effects on criticals and are handled very differently which is quite noticable and fun to play with

very bad
 in dote you had a stock of dust that you would have to use to manage which rooms to power which controlled spawns and also allowed to unlock rooms to build big components for resource generation as well as lighting rooms with great defensive potential and arm them with turrets and buffing components this was extremely tactical and fun you could even intentionally cause more spawns by not lighting several rooms just to farm them with herotower skills but you had to keep a balance between farming  threat while doing so now this tactical component has been erased entirely dust is now a resource that is very sparse and can either be used to light a room to unlock a bigcomponent slot or shopupgrader or to roll new crystalcarrier upgrades or to deactivate some random global effects it is way less tactical than before because the choices are now usually quite obvious and they are more rare you also dont really manage dust in the same way and have no means of controlling dust generation as we did before dust  light management feel boring now
 there is a blackout event now that completely deactivates all your buildings darkens the room spawns a few enemies everywhere regularly that only attack you and you have to walk an often large distance to then turn off two devices on the map  not fun at all no challenging either and makes turrets entirely useless during this
 the characters dont have a clear level progression anymore you randomly get to choose a generic or characterspecific bonus no new skills just passive bonuses very disappointing i used to be excited about level ups and aimed for specific skills in an order in dote
 the room layouts in levels started boring me soon they seems to always contain kind of the same elements dote was more random big components now only produce resources there are almost no slots for them no choice to free something up for them quite often at least a few doors are locked and need to be unlocked by finding something or moving the crystal as a reult you often have just one door to open at a time i preferred dotes freedom of tactical choice
 items cant be sold anymore there are also only weapons  1 generic modifier now anymore regression on rpg elements odd choice for ed
 meta progression you get a 3rd hero unlocked in solo after grinding for a while making you 50 stronger out of nowhere you also unlock upgrades for weapon types for free or give your character some passive boosts you are at a huge disadvantage as a new player starting a run and then you just get bi bonuses as you play more and you can even start the run with a chest with random resourcesitems i did not enjoy this type of progression
 after a while i hated the elemental weaknessresistance mechanics it pushes you into a direction for the turrets and also the guns you should use it is random and not a choice for the player  imo they completley overdid the impact of this mechanic

bad
 the character skills feel way less impactful than in dote i remember in dote i used most skills as often as i could just waiting until they are back now i often forget about using ultimates etc
 the spawn points are now fixed and you cant do anything about it i really did not enjoy this change but i kinda got used to it after a while together with the reduced tactical value of dust it feels like a lot has been lost that worked well in dote i dont see how this made the game better in any way
 the wave mechanics especially the random timed waves are annoying previously there were clear rules for when waves spawn but now with every door you open after the last wave the risk increases from safe to some very dangerous level there seems to be a timer in the background that then triggers at some point i did not enjoy this feature one bit nor did i enjoy having to fight 3 waves in a row if i research 3 times without opening a door
 boss fights some bosses you need to know beforehand so you know how to defeat them while this is okay it also makes it kind of boring and easy when you know what to expect some are also not beatable with turrets alone so you cant play as you wish you need to play how the game wants you to
 in solo play have no good overview of the games at all and you can only control a hero at a time or let them wait or follow you the direct control favors that you always play a character you cant let all characters be ai controlled
 i did not like the character design at all feels too much like fortniteoverwatch dote had cooler more mysterious character designs if you asked me i find many ed characters annoying especially the dumb stuff they say
 sometimes less is more the dialogues are not interesting at all dote had very short character bios and only few conversation lines those conversations would often take place in the elevator from level to level with a snippet in each transition exciting ed is full of lines that i dont care to read it is mostly mundane dumb stuff
 performance issues

good
 turrets cant be permanently destroyed anymore i like this they resurrect after a wave or you can rebuild them by hitting them when they are down
 the seemless transitions from when you complete your area to another area in the same level is really cool last room becomes first room seemlessly sweet
 ui and ux are good hud looks good some things like the minimap doesnt show navmesh gaps and some ux could really need improvements especially with mousekb but overall good
 all turrets can permanently boosted by hitting them in melee after they gathered enough xp i quite liked this addition and also that you can repair them by bashing them as well as shortterm boost them all based on your wit
 the different elemental weapon effects are cool in general
 the bar as a hub is interesting

_______________________________________________
bottom line surely i was expecting some reduction of the strategy elements in favor of actionrpg elements but with the loss of dust for roommanagement a reduction in resource management streamlining of big components more linear levels a reduction of item choices and characters having always the same 2 active skills from start to end i felt like they reduced so much and gave us so little in return some boring meta progression but no skill tree no tech tree just some bonuses here and there for your character weapon types or crystal carrier the additions were lackluster but the removals hurt this is why i do not recommend this in its current shape i believe dlcs however could potentially turn this game around the foundation laid is still solid the mechanics are just too plain

#####

i want to like this game but since its release it hasnt received any important bug fixes this game is advertised as a coop game but most of the bugs are found in the multiplayer part it was not made for multiplayer and the coop part is getting worse

not only are bugs not taken care of but with each content update new and worse bugs are introduced amplitude does nothing to make the game more stable and playable they just push content out

by now there are so many bugs inside the game that playing it is way more frustrating than fun there are gamebreaking bugs gameplay mechanics that are not working and a lot of coop bugs that make playing together more tedious than fun

i cant recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it with friends
playing it alone is somewhat doable but it is still far from bugfree


#####

i really love amplitude and the whole endless series i really liked the predecessor to this one dote 1 
i really wanted to like this but its just not very fun 
the core gameplay loop just isnt as goodinterestingdeep as the first

#####

endless dungeon feels like it was made by people who did not play dungeon of the endless

that would be the simplest way i would describe endless dungeon it has cool graphics punchy modern kinda gameplay and has a bunch of currentday features that you would expect from a game these days
damn shame that in order to have good graphics games need to be watered down ill go through some things that make this game incredibly simply compared to the first game

 less characters

 characters no longer have unique skill trees from leveling up instead gaining random perks via a level up machine this massively devalues the importance of who you bring in dungeon of the endless each character would gain specific perks at specific levels making them have a lot more depth than their initial abilities for example theres a character who at level 3 and always at level 3 gains the ability to turn kills into food with this system replaced with a random perk system that depth of character selection has been removed

 turrets no longer just cover the entire room now you might think turret range would mean that theres more depth right wrong with the ai pathing being incredibly simple and turret placements all over the place so they rarely overlap or really cover efficient ground this game will make anyone who plays towerdefence games regularly groan the aoe debuff turrets are basically useless because they only slow down or debuff enemies within a tiny area so good luck making that synergize with your other turrets also this means that big rooms are no longer the chokepoints you want the only rooms that matter are the narrow rooms because narrow rooms means easy overlap for aoe

 armor and items are gone thats it those are no longer in the game you can get a single shitty trinket that usually has downsides attached arent you happy

 melee characters dont exist just that nothing else

 you no longer can find characters during your run so your party is completely static and theres no risk to characters dying because they can just be revived for free

 the gunplay sucks yeah sorry but auto aim and infinite ammo just means that gameplay consists of me pointing my cursor at a horde of enemies and holding right click while pressing q whenever its off cooldown i honestly preferred strategically placing my characters across the rooms

 dust is gone kinda you no longer select what rooms are and arent powered this removes a bunch of depth you get dust every now and then that can power on unpowered rooms all this really is used for is activating research nodes or upgrade nodes nothing else

 big nodes only have resource income now no more global buffs or choices

 enemies have types and weaknesses youd think this would be a plus but it basically just means put the right damage type at the right entrance like im a child putting the circle block in the square hole

it really is a shame to get a decent modernstandard game we had to sacrifice all the depth and strategy of the first game i guess action sells more than nuance these days
all in all to conclude my review where the fuck is the elevator music 010

#####

if youre looking at this game for coop then dont waste your time only the host makes progression i will never understand why devs do this

#####

shallow gameplay grated dialogue that wouldnt feel out of place in a disney show for 7 year olds and progression so minimal i maxed out everything in 10 hours there are only two weapon types hero choices feel very barebones and lack variety in gameplay and turrets are anemic at best

even if you are a fan of other endless games skip this one

i see this game getting mixed reviews and i can understand the criticism with it

now a good portion of some of the negative ones came from people who adored dungeon on the endless which is valid i personally havent played that myself so im not gonna bs about stuff i clearly dont know i watched some game play of it  however and there are quite a few different things including playstyles in comparison

for me i love the game i find this a very enjoyable roguelike and coop game most things in coop are shared progression but some arent such as taking weapon upgrades over or unlocking heros however your character chips you unlock from quests stay on and can be equipped in a multiplayer lobby i think the games fun for what it is the gunplay feels impactful mowing down hordes feels nice and i do like all the characters i do think that the characters could be adjusted a lil when it comes to the games ui or maybe say the abilities and passives should be portrayed better with the uihud as well sometimes when im casting an ability i cant really tell and some of the descriptions on the game could be more explanatory with how abilities work i think they should show betterlook like it has more impact 

overall gameplay is fun and graphicsatmosphere are great i think they should try to make it a lil more strategic when it comes to tower defense im not entirely sure how but being able to sell turrets for some of what you payed for on it would be nice selling weapons you dont want or maybe certain upgrades would be a good implementation too also higher rarity weapons should do a lil more than just make the overall stats stronger having unique traits on guns down the line at some point to spice up gameplay even more would be awesome i do really want this game to succeed and get more traction because i think it deserves to it does need work in a few areas as i mentioned and maybe even a lil more that i havent been personally aware of like maybe features in dungeon of the endless that i dont know about could be good in here too 

honestly i been having a lot of fun with it and with friends i take it for what it is and hopefully what it can soon evolve into best wishes to the devs and i hope they do take the community feedback into consideration there are quite a few good ideas out there by the players

#####

this game is fine i guess  the first run or two feels fun but as you keep playing you realize that this game is basically just holding left click and occasionally pressing an ability  it doesnt do tower defense particularly well and it also doesnt do twin stick shooter particularly well 

its pretty boring after an hour or two  i wouldnt recommend purchasing this

#####

let me start by saying i love amplitude and all the games theyve made till now and i want them to continue 

endless dungeon is a huge departure from the endless setting   although i see some common elements from previous titles gone are the characters ive loved  worse the tone has completely changed   the first time i installed dote i played for three and a half hours and couldnt get enough   i had enough of endless dungeon in 10 minutes of play   while gameplay has significantly improved with this title its now a legitimate action game the tone is clearly meant for small children   dote was an adult title all the endless games have been   if id known this game was meant for kids i wouldnt have bought it   instead of the mature feeling the other endless titles carried this game feels more like a boarderlands title   imho there is enough of that garbage out there   shame on amplitude for pandering   

the original dote story sparked curiosity about the setting and the characters   the setup was show dont tell    endless dungeon verbosely oversells a worse premise   where before an interesting cast of mysterious beings have crashed on a nameless object in space and explore to their deaths with no need for an explanation about why you can make multiple endless runs slowly revealing more and more about the alien creatures technology and marooned visitors now we get a group of dull immature chatty spunky characters who all get to hang out on a floating machine designed to facilitate this experience ad nauseam    theres far less variation in the characters as they all use the same equipment so choice is basically meaningless   theres less variation in build design for individual runs than the original title and the tooltips basically tell you flat out which turrets to build depending on what enemies you are facing   

whoever wrote the fluff for this title is definitely not the same staff who wrote for dote   i read every scrap of story i could find in dote  especially the cute notes about all the equipment   endless dungeon has quips about the setting strewn on the ground throughout the runs and screens of word salad about this dull title but i quickly found myself skipping through the content   i feel like im grading 7th grade essay assignments because the writing is so boring immature and witless   the equipment and consumables for dote were very interesting and sparked my imagination   endless dungeons equipment and consumables seem like the stuff you find in any title they do not lend to the uniqueness the endless games once had   

lastly the titles initials are ed   ed is usually associated with erectile dysfunction which is exactly what this title has   there is no punch nor pizzazz  it has low stamina and lacks girth   endless dungeon is limp   

im so heartbroken over this title   i hope the developer reads this   whoever amplitude lost hire them back even if only to impart what these games used to be to the newer generation of game developers    dont sell your interesting setting short  it deserves the type of polished inspired writing the original dote had

#####

intimidate turn off when youre forced to sign a waiver declaring you own nothing and this is a license that can be revoked at anytime not to mention the denuvo and borderline spyware it installs along with the game

#####

i dont dislike the game but i wouldnt recommend it as it is
dote was a game that i would rate highly but not exactly recommend to everyone because it was so niche 
but it was really good for its niche
this on the other hand is very much a work in progress and id rather hide this game from my friends on the offchance that theyll play with me once its fully fleshed out than recommend it to them now and have them drop the game after a few sessions

anyway about the game its aggressively decent 
controlling units directly required a lot of changes to the dote formula and id say it mostly works well the aesthetic is pretty neat
splitting monsters into elemental factions is a mixed bag since it will stiffle your creativity when it comes to picking turrets and weapons
resources carrying on from a floor to the next also incentivizes you to not spend them on the first few sectors which leads to a hoarder mentality
i dont think the active skills and ults are very fun to use on most characters though and since there is no visualsound cue when they get out of cooldown and needing to look away from the action to squint at a corner of my screen is really not practical given how some of those need to be used within a small time window
i miss major modules that arent resource generators

but if i had to put my finger on the thing that really bothers me its the writing
amplitude is a french studio and i havent checked how the french lines fare but in english it feels like it was written by ai
it is so cookie cutter like a dollar store version of borderlands 
when a character has a line thats literally i like things b youve got a problem  b
dote has pretty neat lines and the item descriptions were pretty witty and neither came off as trying too hard like this game does
the voice actors did the best they could though im not blaming them at all
but good lord the red dead eyes looping quips make me want to throw things at my sceen
and it sucks because out of all the stuff ive mentioned i really doubt the devs will bother to change the writing and have the voice actors rerecord the whole thing so i cant even look forward to that element being fixed

#####

i dont usually write reviews but seeing all the negative ones for this game motivates me honestly im really confused by all the negativity this game is getting because my experience with it has been nothing but awesome so let me address some of the complaints ive been seeing in case youre like me and they made you really wary of buying

note that ive only played single player and only on the hardest difficulty so i cant speak to other settings or modes ill stick to what i know and not address the complaints about multiplayer

the companion ai is overall great characters youre not controlling dodge aoe effects with superhuman ability they equip weapons intelligently switching to ones that are more effective for their situation and they use their active abilities competently too the only thing theyre kinda bad at is using shortrange weapons they tend to take damage the only thing they dont do at all is use their ultimates but thats actually preferable because it means you can precisely control when ultimates get used by swapping characters

diversity between characters weapons and runs is great no idea what people who say every runguncharacter is the same are thinking there are so many variables that completely change the rules and feel of a run and not just the recentlyadded station cards though those do help a lot many of the drinks and chips are completely gamealtering weapons vary wildly in range firing speed area of effect elemental effects etc characters only have three abilities each passive active ultimate but those abilities are wildly different between themand the diversity is increased even more when you factor in stats like attack power defense and the biggest one wit which determines whether you want a character doing more shooting or more turret buffing and maintenance

enemies are as diverse or more as they were in dungeon of the endless there are siege bots that can outrange your turrets and will gradually mow through them if you dont pick them off there are enemies who will go out of their way to target your generators there are invisible dudes who sneak up on you there are zergswarm guys that split into littler zergswarm guys when they die there are melee dudes who take almost no damage if you shoot them in the front so you have to flank them if you treat all enemies as the same basic mooks youll be left wondering why this one has so much health and defense or that one killed all the turrets you placed on the other side of the map or how the other one got by you to snipe a generator when you werent looking

a lot of people have called this game mindless or too easy and i just dont agree in the slightest maybe its mindless on the easier difficulties but i consider myself a strategy gamer first and foremost and on hard there is an addictive level of strategy you have to think carefully about which doors to open to control monster pathing and you have to be careful where you place your turrets to set up the best sightlines and killboxes while conserving resources your crystal bot needs to move around a few times to get through a level so you need to take that into account too when choosing where to set up

tons of people are taking it as a given that this game has no content really its a 30 roguelike a single run on hard will almost certainly take you multiple hoursway longer than a single run of dote or hades for sure and youll be doing many many runs to complete the character quests aloneto say nothing of all the extra challenges you can take on via drinks etc theres plenty of content on offer here for the price maybe not quite as much as hades overall but certainly comparable

so many reviews on here say this game is nothing like dungeon of the endless which i also dont agree with i love dote but i love this more and sure there are differencesbut most of them for the better the twinstick shooting mechanics are new sure but they pretty much just replace the roomdancing micromangement from dote the completely different genre criticisms are super exaggerated 

people saying dote was way deeper or more complicated are out of their minds ive cleared the original dote plenty of times over the years and enjoyed it but that game is dead simple compared to this with more to do to micromanage each character more movement of the crystal more things to research and upgrade more variance between runs more damage type weaknesses and weapon switchingthis game objectively has more going on dote had more characters but those characters were much more samey than these with tons of overlapping skills they did a lot less toomostly youd have one character open doors and the rest youd leave parked in rooms how is that more complicated or interesting

its only 4 floors is such a disingenuous criticism each floor has multiple zones easily evening out the number of levels between the two gamesand individual zones in endless dungeon take way longer to clear than any floor in dote in my experience

i also saw a review claiming the music was inferior to the original which must have been posted by someone who hadnt played the original in quite some time because the soundtrack is basically a remastered version of it with new additions to boot i recognized every melody from the original game there were only a few man along with the new tracks which are fine some of the music in the saloon is really nice

ive seen a lot of complaints about bugs maybe there were a lot more at launch or something i dont know ive experienced two bugs and neither of them actually affected my gameplay experience if youre curious one showed a character as koed on the minimap when they had already been revived which lasted until i switched to that character the other bug caused turrets that you get for free via a station card when spawning in unpowered rooms to be broken until replaced by a different turret

the only complaints ive seen that really have any weight are the ones about the dialogue writing its cringey and campy but for what its worth it really comes off as intentionalthe kind of cringe you get from a sobaditsgood movie the voice acting is perfectly serviceable and honestly i dont know what fans of other amplitude games were expecting the dialogue in dote was cringe in the same way and the characters the original game had stuff like team fortress 2 clones and a character whose entire schtick was being an anagram of samus aran maybe the new aesthetic isnt to everyones taste but the new game has way more depth of personality

people complaining about denuvo also have a leg to stand on i guess but the unfortunate reality is that denuvo is all over the place on steam and for what its worth i have not noticed any framerate dips at all the games performance has been remarkably smooth for me denuvo or not per the devs this game also only uses denuvo drm and not denuvo anticheat which is way more invasive

the bottom line for me is this if you liked dungeon of the endless and if you like either twinstick shooters or arcadestyle roguelikes like hades which this game transparently takes a ton of inspiration from there is a strong chance youll like this 

thanks amplitude im having a great time

#####

ill save you time and say its not dungeon of the endless so dont go in expecting something like a sequel but it feels like its trying to be its own thing and i love it musics great graphics are nicely stylized and gameplay is fun cant wait for more additions to it

#####

i loved the original game but this this is not good especially with the drm installed i couldnt play the game at all for 4 weeks when i didnt have the internet because the drm needed to connect and confirm i own the game thats bullshit its almost as bad as the always online system of diablo 3
dungeon of the endless was great this this is a massive disappointment if i could refund i would

#####

it feels like the devs are having a hard time figuring out how to balance the heros vs the tower defense aspect the heros all have fun designs and a neat skill which was fun until heros were nerfed to have the player need to use the turrets more i enjoy the turrets but the turrets arent very well balanced themselves some are wildly more useful than others and youll end up picking 3 you like and using them over the whole roster to try and balance out what your damage types there is also little to no replaying this game the mob variety is non existent you have a group of monsters for every element generally the only difference between them is what color gun you need to use to deal a little more damage to them as they beeline for your very very valuable generators you need to build the turrets but since heros deal much less damage now all you can do is watch as they slip out of range of you defenses and break your stuff

this game has a lot of neat and fun ideas and its fun with a friend making a plan for the waves to show up i dont regret getting it but it feels unfinished i would recommend if you want to pick it up wait for a sale

#####

endless dungeon 2 only has 4 floors

#####

i bought this hoping for a similar game to dungeon of the endless with a more engaging play style and another way to sink in a lot of time into i love the dungeon of the endless but this isnt it and not worth the money i paid

less than 20 hours to feel done with the experience 
 progression feels shallow 
 cast of characters short
 run lengths feel much shorter than dungeon of the endless
 i feel inrun progression is minimized

all in all it might be worth if you want a weekends worth of fun and its on sale but if you want something that challenges you like dungeon of the endless you wont find it here

#####

first review i make on steam

i loved every single amplitudes game but i dont understand what happened here

dungeon of the endless was a game design masterpiece it was a game about strategy  macromanagement resource management and path planification
the direction took here which was supposed to focus on realtime action makes no sense since the actual realtime gameplay is boring as hell basically you just keep clicking and press a every once in a while there is no strategy or skill involved it does feel kinda fun during the first minutes of game but you understand really quick that there is nothing more to it

they completly switched building priorities and you basically spam turrets everywhere since there is almost nothing else to do with your ressources and thats about it sometimes youll come across other stuff foodbased installations to gain perks science pods to research new turrets but they all feel bland you dont get the feeling of empowerement that was very strong in dote very few generators spots almost no strategy on door opening

also they replaced a very simple and clear system stuff happened only when you open doors in dote with something that i just dont understand  enemies spawn in waves from spawners in this game but you just cant understand when sometimes a wave triggers when you open a door so thats okay but sometimes it will happen when you buy an item from the shop or even while doing nothing without clear rules it just looks like the game does whatever it feels like

the metaprogression beyond the fact that they didnt even think blending it in the multiplayer experience which is the only thing everyone seems to hate in the game feels extremely bland also about one to three passives by hero and some minor upgrades on weapon and does not achieve what it is supposed to  make you want to play

there are other issues not worth mentioning considering the disaster that the game is like the fact that slapping turrets to heal them without any cooldown or anything makes no sense if your mate dies next to a turret well you wont be able to revive him since the e key is used for reviving allies and change turrets it really feels like no one at amplitude actually played the game

on a good side i guess the game kinda looks good but not anything you wouldnt expect from a strong aa indie studio

i am utterly disappointed as i couldnt wait for this game to come out and now i am bored simply by thinking about it instantbuy on day 1 and i will probably never play it anymore

i feel bad for amplitude but it is a total waste of money

#####

the base game is fun for me its a very turn brain off and shoot monsters sort of thing  in single player mode the game works well  unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives for this game

replayability on single player is low unless youre achievement hunting the game gets samey pretty quickly trying it with different drinks helps changing your play style pretty significantly but doesnt change the maps or bosses much at all

multiplayer is extremely buggy achievements are earned or not earned when meeting the criteria with a roll of the dice  choosing science upgrades purchasing from vendors and choosing crystal bot upgrades are all highly likely to go haywire giving you the wrong choice or purchasing everything possible  the crystal bot status and animations often get stuck  you dont always get credit for quests or beating the game with a drink enabled  somehow i have the achievement for beating the game with a drink but never got the reward for doing it the first time

#####

rolled the credits on 7 hours of gameplay could have been way sooner dont listen to guys saying how good the game is for x or y reason or how its not cool the game has it so hard or whatever this game has more than earned its mixed review because it is an unfinished game playing it feels like a very early alpha of a 10 game to give you an idea its at the point that ive been told that its hard to find players to play with cant tell if its true because i only played it with friends but id be careful about that if you want to play with matchmaking

you only have a few bland and boring heroes who already felt old at my second run you only have two weapons you can switch your base weapon but youll never do it since having a vanilla weapon is paramount and its almost impossible to tell which weapon is best because stats are that shallow have fun holding left click from start to finish

your hero only have one skill and one ult for some reasons the ult of my character was that weak that i never bothered you cant gain more skills or change it up like other roguelikes at my second run id already felt like there were no more things to master the only improvement you can have is unlocking passive abilities some are op most are meh your runs will always consist in aggressively spending your resources into gaining regeneration passive

theres only 4 archetypes of enemies 1 boss every now  then thats all you wont have different opponents if you take a different path if you level up or anything they come in waves after waves of only the same thing

the game is beaten way too fast its a the point that im pretty sure devs had to know that the game could be beaten on the first run because theres artificial difficulty added to the end boss see in normal roguelite you wipe at your first boss at your first encounter with special foes you grow stronger with time until you go to the end boss in endless dungeon you are never slowed down and to do a make believe that the game is difficult you have all the extra difficulties of an ironman max debuff max added drawbacks of an end of the game ive already bested the boss 34th times normal roguelite wiped on my first try because theres just to many debuff going on obliterated the boss on my 2nd try because the debuff were lifted wtf

the game is just too shallow the tower defense aspect is interesting same as the combo with heroes but the replayability is nonexistent heroes have the charisma of a boring sidequest written by ai enemies are all the same the only unlocks are passive abilities the weapons are all pretty meh theres nos lore no compelling things to do hades made me stay for a very long time because its characters and cool lore here theres just nothing which is sad because amplitude has developed its own lore throught the years but here theres only a very little lore and the very few it has is belittled by a i break the 4th wall all the time wow look how smart and funny i am kind of humor 

i could go and go for hours for example some of the base core mechanics dont really works you can spend resources to heal your heroes and it is expansive or you can reroll and reroll your passives skills until you have passive regen and then you can ignore altogether healing you gain resources for every forward progression you do but on the last level you just cant spend it i finish all my games with hundreds of resources with my heroes still very far away from max level because theres nothing left to interact with

all in all an unfinished game

#####

you know how darkest dungeon 2 is like darkest dungeon 1 but not as good same its still fun just dont expect dote levels of depth

#####

let me start by saying i love the idea behind endless dungeonbut i have never finished a game like this in such a short time and felt like there was nothing else to do

game is fun if yoy mamage to not run into any gamebreaking bugs but after you clear it for the first time its done theres no reason to keep playing

the differences between characters is superficial at best
all the strategy present in dungeon of the endless is gone
i cannot recommend anyone buy this game in its current state

wait for a huge discount or a massiva patch

410 score

#####

its fun not quite tower defense not quite twinstick honors the spirit of the original game mostly probably more fun with friends but i dont have any

#####

good game but same remark as everyone else  its a coop game but only the host gains progress including achievements 
we are in 2023 that system should not exist anymore

#####

for 40 you dont get much beat on hardest difficulty by 11 hours nothing that interesting left to do meta progression is severely underwhelming dungeon of the endless had so much more going for it 

gameplay itself feels good twin stick shooting format fits well besides that its a big let down as a fan of dote

#####

im somewhat conflicted on what verdict to give but ill have to say that right now i do not recommend the game despite really wanting to like it

to put it simply the game is a turd but a turd that has been polished with love and care and people put work into really making the turd work look and feel good but at the end of the day its still just a turd

the good
the atmosphere is great the saloon theme i like all the music in the game is really fantasticive listened to tracks casually on spotify which says a lot imo the cast of characters is wide and colourful they have distinct playstyles and abilities that feel different enough its a game that i really want to explore more i want to test out all the characters and builds but the core of the game is just not conducive to that sadly

the bad
however the gameplay itself is very shallow and honestly boring most of the time you just open doors wait for waves open more doors wait for more waves and backtrack a lot through rooms youve been in 20 times especially the first floor you will spend 30 minutes just standing there and holding down fire 90 of the time until the wave is over

its also buggy ive had atleast two softlocks one on the final boss one on the red eye death boss and atleast two ability bugs that i have noticed one allowing me to ult twice in a row another giving me 900 damage and 200 fire speed for the entire run as of writing this there has been no patch yet so i expect this issue to be hopefully fixed

even without abusing bugs the game is very easy which is mostly a fault of the shallow mechanics just plop a couple turrets down dont forget to make resource generators and dont stand in the fire thats it the game is beaten on hard difficulty you also have infinite revives so long as one hero is still standing with no drawback


if the game ever falls to 10 or under id say grab it its propably worth but even at a lighter 30 price tag its currently not going to provide you the bang for your buck

#####

this is not a spiritual successor this is a spiritual failure taking a great game like dungeon of the endless and making it into a game with very little strategy and generic characters and slightly okay art is not a good improvement this game is a huge amount of steps backwards from the original beauty that many of us enjoyed and made us look forward to this one the amount of bugs in multiplayer is also a huge issue i wish i could get my money back

#####

less than the sum of its parts sums up this game pretty well

the game feels excellent shooting the guns and fighting the enemies feels great but it is a tower defense game and regardless of how good the shootybang feels its very limited because you have to devote a lot of attention to setting up watching the progress of and repairing turrets if playing solo you also need to switch over to your ai companions constantly to tell them where to stand ultimately the most you can do is hold a chokepoint regardless of how good your are at the game as a twinstick shooter

so if you cant really concentrate on the gunplay how is the strategy element

extremely shallow frankly you need to decide how many turrets are likely to be necessary hoping to save resources for the future however which turrets to build and where is obvious you also need to decide between three upgrades at times but its rare that the choice is difficult and even when it is its not exciting do you want a 50 upgrade to the speed at which you repair turrets or a 10 upgrade to your damage output these are a significant majority of the games choices

the game is excused for not being a sequel to dungeon of the endless but if thats the case why does it still have pretty much all of the same game mechanics but stripped of what made them interesting it is torn between the vision of a strategic resourcemanagement tower defense and an action twinstick shooter but the strategy lacks meaningful choices and the action gives you scant freedom to express your skill and is something youre constantly distracted from

ill repeat that the game feels excellent a significant overhaul of some of the games systems could turn both sides of the equation golden at that point and with an expansion of the fairly small amount of content in the game this would be one of the very best runbased games out there at present im disappointed to report that its one of the shallowest instead its disappointing because it really wouldnt take much change to make that leap

#####

let me start my review by saying the game is good for the most part
however i am 12 hours in and feel like the game is very hollow it takes next to no time to unlock all characters and upgrade all weapons the game play itself is either very easy or unforgivably difficult and coop outright sucks there are also lots of very odd and irritating bugs

cool game lots of potential but i feel like i have wasted 24 on this title
i would not be able to recommend this game to anyone unless you are a stubborn fan of the genre maybe wait and see if they improve it at all

#####

previously i had written about some bugs that were present in the game and why i thought people should wait until they were fixed to make a purchase  im pleased to be able to say that the bugs have been fixed and quickly too and now the game is in a much better state

#####

if you liked the strategy element of dungeon of the endless this game is a disappointment
limited array of characters completely removed the concept of melee specialists and melee weapons gear is no longer an upgrade investment but a matter what flavor element do you want to shoot
floors are limited to very few generators removing the option to play at a higher level of risk and strategy it really feels like a shoein of the original mechanic the dust mechanic is also toned down to the point where its unnecessary to include the merchant is also underwhelming
the game is so easy its boring the monsters spawn at fixed locations trivializing turret strategy there are so few doors to open they had to remove using them as a way to progress the research mechanic
my hopes for this game where to be like dungeon of the endless but with more control over characters giving it a skill challenge on top of the already amazing strategy challenge we enjoyed endless dungeon is a bare minimum reference to the strategy and themes of the first with flashy graphics and voice acted characters
edit
while the game is a disappointment to my expectations i still gave it a second chance and i can see why they simplified some of the original mechanics to fit into an action style game
putting my expectations aside this game is enjoyable however my review will remain negative until more characters are added among which they focus on adding melee specialists the fact that they dont have this feels like they sacrificed a huge game play and content component of the game to instead focus on marketability by hiring voice actors but lowering costs from hiring voice actors by having only six playable characters

#####

before i continue i also want to address one of the top negative reviews right now on launch day this dude is a clown he had 03 hours played and was whining about coop meta progression and somehow got 100 people to say his negative review was helpful it was a simple bug that is already hotfixed 
play more than 20 minutes and you would see that dork

anyway
really cool game so far definitely feels like a proper remakereimagining of dungeon of the endless which i put 60 hours in and am a huge fan of everything from music to level structure to the whole thematic universe has so much love put in i really dig the different characters and that the runs are a satisfying length people have complained about other bugs but i have yet to see them so far
heres some rapid fire reasons this game is awesome

super detailed environments and setting love and care put into the universe and characters
lots of content to chew on for run diversity with fun characters and items to unlock
satisfying runs and difficulty selection to tune the game just right hard is perfect for me
impressive lighting and graphics engine the stations have a lot of atmosphere

definitely give this one a try if you dig roguelikes tower defense scifi ect you wont regret it

#####

do i recommend this game my thumb would be in the middle like a grey thumb like a thesis approved with major revisions

tldr game is really fun however gameplay seems quite shallow for a roguelike
disclaimer this comes from someone who hasnt played the first game 

pros
 gunplay is fun but not perfect
 strategy requires you to think about resource management
 playing solo feels like playing rts since you micro manage the characters which is my cup of tea might not be for everyone
 graphics are nice to watch
 controller support runs well currently using a 8bitdo controller

cons
 upgrade scaling who thought this was balanced enough
all the weapons and turrets are already available at the start and can be upgraded for future runs however upgrade options are very limited  2 upgrades available per gun specialization of the upgrades are very similar to the point that every gun feels the same in late game hero upgrades are more distinct but dont feel that much different either

 turrets can be upgraded during runs however i cant seem to findlook for the differences in stats of the 1 star vs 2 star turrets

 characters dont really talk that much about each other dialogue sounds inorganic like someone hired a writer that doesnt know much about the endless universe and just wrote down stuff that he thinks a generic alien would say wasted opportunity to enable us players to connect with our characters they talk a lot but they dont say much not much detail for example the way they interact with each other feels like back 4 blood yes that abomination of a game if you are expecting 3 survivors to talk with each other and add character like left 4 dead while shooting hordes of enemies you will be disappointed i been playing for hours with the 3 same heroes but i barely know them

 crystal bot path selection is clunky and awkward almost feels like the ai chooses the hardest possible path instead of the path with the shortest distance

summary 
for a roguelike game the roguelikeness seems to be half baked scaling needs a lot of work va dialogues feel empty lorewise however gunplay and strategy are fun i dont see myself playing this for too long compared to other roguelikes i see myself bingeplaying this game for 2 months then uninstalling it and forgetting it ever existed on the 3rd month 
i have been waiting for endless dungeon for a while got excited enough to buy it early shortly after release and i have to say i should have waited for a sale like 50 off

rating a solid 6 
unless the devs work on it continuously in future patches it will always be a 6 at best

#####

i like this game i see the soul and passion behind it but you have to be kidding me with the pricetag the game has 30ish guns and they all feel the same except they deal different kinds of damage they feel reskinned essentially the game has a very limited amount of enemies and bosses too the thing is the game looks nice it has personality but it is heavily hindered because it took absolutely no risks in terms of gameplay there are eight characters in total that you can play with there are lots of stages that you can fight in but they for now in my 9hrs all seem to be cosmetic they have no real differences they also feel too similar of course they can come with different enemy types but the enemies are an entirely different issue ill talk about it

so enemies come with elemental weaknesses that means the usage of certain elemental weapons is incentivized over others depending on which enemy you are fighting this forces you to basically always use the same weapons against enemy types there are only 30 or so weapons in the game why would the developers choose to give players even less freedom in the way they play by basically making them use certain weapons this seems like just bad game design and this game has a lot of that and ill comment on that too

the game lacks major qol features if you play solo your npc friends cannot use ults on their own so you have to switch to them certain characters even when you activate their ultimate and switch back to your preferred character will simply stay in their ultimate mode and not do anything bunker is the prime example why would they make everything soshallow why not make each character really unique each time i pick a character i play the exact same way and it is of no consequence why not have weapons only unique to the character you are using why not have a melee only character or something why is there no melee weapon in the game why is there not a semblance of uniqueness or quirk to any of the characters this is a roguelike

another issue is the upgrade mechanics in the game each time you upgrade a gun it stays like that it is now just stronger forever this is just stale not only that but the upgrades are not cosmetic and they are only really tame upgrades some of them are just copy and pasted to another gun  like faster fire rate more damage less weapon spread etc  etc it is so boring for the love of god please rework all of the  systems but this especially make guns actually unique make heroes actually unique give me consequences for my actions and add a bit of rng to my game

there is scrap in the game a currency basically which you cannot use for anything but really pointless loot boxes which give you bonuses on your next run once you upgrade everything its done your currency is now just an ever growing number and speaking of abilities each character comes with one minor skill one ultimate and one passive does this seem like its not enough because it isnt enough the game gets stale really early on you unlock all the characters within 15hrs of gameplay and you unlock them in determined specific ways why would you introduce such familiarity into a roguelike devs genuinely curious roguelikes are supposed to make you take risks make you play with guns that you came across just because thats all you have each run is supposed to feel new and fresh  i have never once felt like i have taken a risk in this game i have never had to improvise and i have never felt like im trying something new this game falls behind incredibly when compared to other roguelikes

now on to the bugs there are bugs that delete your progress lock stories behind bugs there is a very common bug where the enemies will just instantly die when they spawn there are people who completed the game without any issue because they encountered no enemies lol it is just unfair to make this game thirty dollars that is not pocket change i have never looked into my pocket and found thirty dollars the last wish edition comes with 8 pdf files and an mp3 soundtrack of the game and like 3 unique skins and thats ten dollars more seriously i think this is a game that will be monetized heavily they will lock features behind paywalls features that should already be in the game i hope that this is just my speculation prove me wrong please the game needs more weapons more characters and more everything  if you lock these behind a paywall your game is going to die the player numbers have halved already and playing this game solo isnot perfect to say the least

8 characters 30 or so weapons and the limited pool of enemies each monster category comes with only six different enemies and the really really repetitive and similar levels make this game into something that is not a roguelike this game is only a roguelike in name only

here is my conspiracy theory i think the direction of the game was changed midway through development because the amount of features missing from the game and the amount of game breaking bugs make me think that this isnt a game design oversight it is just the developers being forced to redesign this game in a short amount of time  there is literally no texting in this game lol i think the direction of the game was changed and the devs had to improvise a lot and did what they could look up how coop upgrades work that is not just game design oversight  that seems like the devs didnt have enough time to implement simple features

so here is what i think i think the game has a lot of potential it has good visual design but really really bad and confusing game design choices the dev team seems to be receptive to issues and they are already at work fixing the bugs but at this moment this game just isnt worth buying especially for the price i hope the devs really listen to my complaints because i have voiced them publicly multiple times i want this game to be good my suggestion is wait just wait until they make this game worth picking up and if they start monetizing it then just pass on it this is a disastrous launch with people literally not being able to play and their dlc codes being invalid it is too vanilla too predictable too repetitive and is easily outclassed by other games in its genre i was and still am excited for your game despite all the complaints i hope it gets better i am cautiously optimistic

edit submitted a refund request i dont wanna have a game that is dead on arrival the player count currently sits at 24k as opposed to its launch day number of 9k

so this is what you will be getting for your totally well priced purchase you will be getting denuvo which will scrape all the data from you it is basically spyware you get a game that crashes all the time ruining your good runs you get a game that erases your progress you get a game that has so many gamebreaking bugs that i cant even count anymore you get a game with confused game design 

the most accurate analogy i have of this game because the currently coping playerbase loves to make analogies to make games like this seem good is a headless chicken yeah a headless chicken you are paying for a bad game with spyware radio silence from the devs is very saddening

update game is doa and amplitude killed it almost zero communication with the playerbase  it is insulting will never be buying again currently the game sits at 200 players on this day with a max of 450ish in 24hrs couldve been a good game but its dead now too bad

h1hi friendh1
do you
enjoy actiony twin stick shooters
appreciate a tower defense now and then
love the amplitude studios art style and are also an endless universe fan
have friends who share these traits
 then welcome to my after100 bentirely subjectiveb recommendation of strikeidungeon defendersistrike biendless dungeonib

note that there is another game by amplitude called idungeon of the endlessi i will not be comparing the two as i others have already done so

right then iendless dungeoni a gorgeous hybrid of gaming genres the art style beautifully allows for easy readability during chaotic times the music excellently sets the theme of a difficult timeisoftheessence space western it also plays a big part in making the saloon one of the hubs i can vibe for hours in the sounds amazingly communicate events while not feeling like too much is happening at once the gameplay proves difficult to master practice makes perfect i am very bad at this game but i still have fun most runs companions help with the latter also the lore is iendlesslyi nice but insufficient in my opinion #moarlorepls 

before you draw your own conclusions about iendless dungeoni please consider that its easy to have false expectations about what youd want a game to be versus what it really is looking at what others have to say i think the scope and complexity of iendless dungeoni are misunderstood it is not a bad game but a difficult one with a lot of moving gears im a big fan of amplitude studios and of everything endless ive been hyped about iendless dungeoni since they announced it and so it gets a big recommend from me but no game is objectively perfect so heres the good the bad and since there is no ugly apart from denuvo anticheat yuck youll be getting my unsolicited adviceinstead

be warned  reading from this point on may lead to your own joy of discovery being spoiled

the game just doesnt feel fun you run around building and smacking turrets the progression between runs seems nonexistent like you dont get any stronger turrets feel meh and will die instantly and you run around smacking them to upgraderepair them weapons and upgrades from chestsmerchants feel lackluster like they dont change up the gameplay enough

the bosses red aoe cone just blends together with the rest of the dark and red design and sometimes makes it hard to dodge the huge aoe cone 

the game also seems heavily balanced and designed for coop making single player really boring playing solo will give you ai companions but theyre limited to staying put and shooting or following you and shooting
it just doesnt have that ohhh i just want to play _one more_ roundfeel like other roguelikes

#####

the game is very good so im going to recommend but here are my issues with the game
 its way too easy compared to the previous game
 way too short for an endless dungeon 4 stages really and then you finish the game kinda sad consider going for level randomizer or make a mode where we go for infinity levels
 no melee characters why give me my katana lady back
 characters lack leveling up more depth upgrades for food dont really mean anything sure flat stat boost is great and all but we could get modification to how our abilites work or something like that missed opportunity
 no character unlocks in multiplayer

but dont get me wrong the game is still awesome

#####

one of the most important things first if you expect an endless dungeon here a game in which you can sink in  a lot maybe hundreds of hours and expect to still feel excited or see fresh things then you are heavily mistaken you can easily unlock everything and finish the game in 20 hours if you just play it normally there is absolutely nothing new you can do after that every run will look nearly the same as your character actually matters so little its impressive im gonna explain it in a few points or until i get bored
1characters
there are 2 types of characters in this game ones i qualify as supports using sidearms and dps using heavy weapons at literally no point in this game do you need to use a support it is similar to actively selecting a special difficulty mode where game is always overbearing for you out of dps characters you can actually choose characters that matter at all the starting character is actually the best one over all beacuse she simply deals tons of damage comrade is another one that is interesting with his ability to place his own turrets he is incredibly usefull at everything this game throws at you there are 2 other dps characters but their existence is inconsequential to gameplay they can be good they can fail absolutely
2turrets  guns as far as i know you start with every one unlocked i dont know why it could make for great progression most turrents have their uses unlike support characters utility turrets actually have a great impact that you may miss since they cost something and you have to choose beetween it and another damage turret on the other hand most guns are completely unusuable there are a few which are very good and the rest you simply dont want ever the game also gains another layer of difficulty if you have both a support and dps characters as dropped guns will be either small or heavy overwhelmingly reducing your chances of finding a good gun overall turrets are cool guns kinda mediocre
3bossfights
probably the best part of this game every boss you fight on second floor is unique and intense in a way i absolutely did not expect the final boss though is incredibly mediocre its not special interesting or challenging at all i expected another one after finishing his second phase nothing more to say here
4gameplay overall
a snoozer if im being honest a game you will forget after finishing its unique not exciting nothing you find in a run makes it unique you unlock everything fast and upgrades are simply not needed its a mediocre tower defense play bloons if you want a good one its a horrible roguelike play nuclear throne enter the gungeon risk of rain anything if you want a better one this is nothing to write home about just a review
5
yeah thats it some more things i can add is game has silly humour that will get stale by the time you launch the game it has some silly story that wont get you invested especially since characters in game arent interested either i can praise it for some cool designs but its also nothing special thank you if you read so far hope this review ages really badly and some updates make the game very cool

#####

honestly think this game can be as good as dungeon of the endless if they gave us more decision making in runs ill list my personal complaints you might agree and you might disagree


 dust feels like something they put in after the game was done and made you will rarely come across dark rooms that need to be fed dust to be powered personally think we should return to the old formula of clearing rooms by using dust which also means removing spawners and going back to the old door based respawn mechanic

 spawners just suck okay theyre not fun if youre playing with 3 friends you can just spawn camp the first 3 spawners its silly

 it doesnt bother me as much as it does others but i do kind of miss the old dark atmosphere the previous game had the characters and album from dote was written in such a gritty way its not a big deal but it added to the enjoyment i think

 one thing i do dislike is the sheer amount of witty jokes the characters make i feel like a lot of writers are doing this now because it appeals to the younger audience maybe it does but i find it annoying

 super subjective the guns arent very interesting not much else to say about it other than i think theyre not very creative

 no ability to sell or recycle weapons in dote you could sell weapons and get resources depending on the type of merchant no idea why this isnt here maybe because resources are so plentiful already

 resources are too plentiful my friend and i managed to speedrun all the way to the boss without really worrying about the threat of death because of the plentiful resources the main strategy is to just spam turrets and hold choke points such as long corridors



its hard to critique this game without talking about dungeon of the endless which really goes to show how loved the original was really hoping the devs take the feedback seriously and improve upon it

if they had to change just one thing please just make dust more relevant all the endless games have dust as the main mechanic and it just feels so pointless in endless dungeon

#####

bsadly i dont recommend this game which is a shame because i really wanted to like it i love the art style and voice actingb

h2things that disappointed me about the gameh2

1 b pacing b
the games pacing was too slow and it took far too long to complete 1 run over 2 hours on hard difficulty 

2 b character customization b
character customization was dullnonexistent slightly increase the damage or range on your 1 basic ability

3 b weapon customization b
weapon upgrades were dull 10 attack speed or 1 piercing thats it youre done upgrading

4 b abilities b
each character has 2 abilities thats it one basic one ultimate most were not useful or not fun to use loss of player control during an ultimate

5 b tower defense b
the tower defense portion of the game was lackluster the turrets were a pain to manage and it felt punishing and time consuming to upgrade them

6 b micromanaging b
actively managing turrets and the ai isnt fun it adds a layer of micro managing that isnt fun

h2changes needed to get me to reinstallrecommend the gameh2

1 b improve pacinglower time commitment b
increase the games pacing while lowering the time commitment needed to complete a run 

2 b improve character customization b
an interesting talent tree that changes the playstyle for each character

3 b improve weapon upgrading b
upgrades and modifications to weapons that change up their primary fire and amp up their critical hit passives

4 b improve active abilities b
revamp basic and ultimate active abilities losing control of your character is not a fun mechanic

5 b add more active abilities b
add another 2 basic abilities and allow us to unlock different basic and ultimate abilities for each character

6 b give us more tower defense b
make the tower defense portion more enjoyable and remove the additional ai characters in a run instead maybe make it possible to toggle between characters on the fly

h2 still on the fenceh2

wait for a sale 50 30 wasnt worth the 124 hours of mediocre entertainment i got thanks for coming to my ted talk

h1 the only positive review you need h1
this games worsening review score makes me sad  i just beat the whole game and i honestly had a blast this was one of my stand out experiences of the year spoilerthe multistage final boss really came out of nowhere it had the perfect difficulty having to dish out damage manage my turrets and micromanage my character around the areaspoiler

this game however is not dungeon of the endless and beating it fully solidified this for me they tried to go a different direction with this one which i highly appreciate

otherwise i still love the atmosphere characters levels quests and progression the game has wonderful lore and what i believe to be the most interesting and personal look at the endless universe ive never had the chance to go into something like an endless transcendence chamber and experience it like this you can really tell love and care has gone into this game in so many ways from character dialogue and comic effects to the evolution of dungeon of the endlesses atmosphere which slowly emerges as you get to later zones and repair the stage 

thank you incomesbarx to manual aim hold ctrl
the unfortunate monsterspawner issue was fixed when i unlocked all 3 characters does kinda suck in multiplayer doe when someone has to spawncamp

h2 here are the actual issues with the game i believe need to be addressed h2
there after definitely less after ive fully completed the game
 blocked interactivity with merchants and nodes due to weapon drops or lore blips
 multiplayer streamlining and a multiplayer difficulty rework progress is actually completely shared outside of a couple odd hero quests and some hero unlocks these people are spreading misinformation and simply havent played enough difficulty however is horrendously absent in multiplayer
 the ai is actually very good but would still like finer commands
 manual hero lobby selection avoid janitor complaints
 please bring back melee focused characters i loved these in dungeon of the endless and while i believe this is a far better game i would enjoy these back

h3 now for the brunt of this review and to address complaints sorry about the length h3
admittedly i am coming at this game as if its a rogueliketowerdefenselite dungeon crawler with twin stick elements i am not approaching this game as if its an evolution of dungeon of the endless this game is very different and i am glad it is more later and i am not approaching this game as an endless universe fan looking for incredible depth complexity or control

h3 firstly the solo ai h3
i genuinely believe the companion ai in this game has been massively improved since the betas it is now a master at avoiding damage and area attacks even moreso than me let your crystal bot follow them during the shelldiver and youll see what im talking about also concerning ultimates i am so thankful the ais do not use their ultimates automatically or even situationally this would be horrible as i see a lot of the games solo complexity stemming from character management if i am in a pinch and switch to fassie in order to boost my other character or simply need the other heroes ultimate to protect my crystal bot i want that ability to be available not wasted on a random group of monsters i am actually quite surprised that the ai uses its abilities at all as i was expecting i would need to micromanage them completely this makes the ai incredibly useful in certain situations some heroes can simply be left in a choke substituting for over a dozen towers i however do have to admit that i would like more commands

h3 secondly the games lacking complexity h3
i honestly believe people who say this havent progressed enough in the same vein as other roguelikes this game becomes more complex the more things you unlock most of this games complexity comes from unlocking and managing heroes and their associated quests the difficulty you will have playing an array of different elements once more than two enemy types spawn and the size of later floors alongside your expanding turret roster yes the floors do get larger from what i can tell my last run i had five generators running on a floor large enough to support over 12 different hostile spawn rooms the game also gets more complex as you start having excess screws to purchase supply creates allowing further tinkering with your runs starting parameters one of the issues i had in dungeon of the endless was it felt like the difficulty increase in the game was artificial each floor was theoretically the same in size and scope with progressively more enemies due to choking the dust economy and more systems to deal with them here it feels like the developers took the opposite approach opting to start the game out simple with two enemy types and small floors layouts theres actually an incentive to go out of my way to fully explore starting floors here instead of praying rng blesses you with the ability to find the elevator quickly while coming across adequate gear upgrades along the way

h3 now for the lacking twin stick shooter or tower defense elements h3
i want to say firstly that i did not expect the game to focus on being a twinstick shooter or tower defense game during the beta our feedback form specifically asked if we wanted freely placeable towers or a stronger focus on twinstick elements i said no to both of these as i thought the game had a strong noncommital mix already what is here is enough and the depth only increases as more heroes and towers are unlocked also i have to note it feels like its been several years since ive played a good twin stick shooter according to steam whether its the ascent enter the gungeon or helldivers theres always someone complaining about lacking twin stick shooter elements its gotten to the point where i am honestly confused as to what a proper twinstick shooter really is aside from a select few ancient indie games where most aspects outside of gameplay are sacrificed

h3 next the game being a step down from dungeon of the endless h3
firstly the dust system i actually like what they did with the dust system turning it into a tangible resource  and there are now a number of ways outside lighting rooms dust can be used dust is now used for crystal bot upgrades when slotted in boss room terminals and to deactivate difficulty altering pillars an example could be 50 enemy movement in dark rooms and 10 character movement speed therefore you need to decide if you want to use 3 dust to deactivate at the pillar losing the debuff and buff or spend your dust lighting up rooms i do think however that the added rng with random permanent spawn rooms can shaft you on some runs and i would love to see some way to stop enemy spawns in an area even just for a few waves as for the complexity it can be found later i never really saw dungeon of the endless as that complex of a game to begin with the game came with complexity of choice something which i believe endless dungeon holds off on till later

in conclusion i believe people have simply not played the game enough as of now and their experience will either get increasingly more positive as more of the game is explored and more of its systems unlocked or remain the same as they realize the game is not for them i genuinely hope for the former as this is one of the most intriguing roguelikes ive played in a while i dearly pray amplitude continues to update and support this game as it has so much potential but potential is just potential and what is currently here is a solid 8510 for me

edit denuvo tried to play offline and realized something shady was up avoid the game if you want i personally do not care but its still unfortunately here

#####

the idea was to coop this game but that was a bad idea 
hope they fix it but how it works now you have to play the game for everyone to host it to get progression and unlocks
some game breaking bugs prevent me to play it any further cant get my quests done tried multiple times but it just doesnt register it

the looks are amazing the sound track is fun and thats why i hope they fix it and maybe even add to the game is its worth its price tag

#####

you can progress when you are not host people writing reviews are just stupid just make sure to have the hero unlocked before playing online then you can progess hero missions momentos drinks and so on and you can still change hero buffs if you have bought them and done missions for that hero

ive been a huge fan of amplitude and the endless games with dungeon of of the endless being my favourite by far about ten years ago now
i was so excited about this game coming out and when it did was crushed and disappointed dote was more of a show dont tell game the characters were mysterious the items were varied with their own little cryptic quips the game didnt hold your hand and tell you what to do it was for you to discover and learn in your own way the lore was so cryptic that it lured you in and made you want to find out more

this game ed  feels like a sellout by comparison pandering to a much younger and more immature audience i feel the characters are now cheesy cliches who talk far too much with repetitive lines ramming their character traits down your throats we get it zed is a kmartbrand version of pink shroom is all the tired tropes older generations perceive in an angsty gen zer rolled into one character and then force fed ad nauseam i wanted to like fassie because he seemed like an interesting charismatic character at first but even with him every repetitive line was constantly reminding me in case i forgot that he was a bartender comrade would only talk about revolution but it felt like someone at amplitude wanted a character who is a diehard revolutionary without any apparent revolution for him to actually be a revolutionary in smile and nod at comrade cartie while being a scholar talks constantly like someone trying to be a baby which creeps me out i was actually excited to see they recently released a japanese voice pack because it would be a refreshing departure from these current voices but sadly this is bugged and wont work when i enable it come on amplitude


gameplaywise ill speak for the soloplay as i havent dabbled in multiplayer which based on other reviews has its own plethora of issues most disappointing of all for me is the inconsistency or complete lack of activeultimate skill use by the ai ive heard a dev respond to someone else raise this by saying they consciously made this choice to leave it up to the player to decide whenwhere it was strategically appropriate to pop those abilities but then this should have been an option we could toggle if we were able to pause mid combat to issue commands like we could back in dote then this would be helpful to keep skill uses reserved for us but in ed theres no pausing and we dont have time save the extremely quickfingered few to micromanage who uses what ability when and where especially when characters could be elsewhere in another room and you dont know what they should be doing this second while youre handling your own mess

dote also allowed you to send characters to specific rooms and gone is that ability in ed positioning ai characters has become oversimplified and clunky sadly 

the weapons used to be so diverse in dote and now are essentially clones across three elements fire acid light theres very little room for experimentation with weapons as you either have the correct element for that enemy or your efficacy is crippled
same goes for the turrets which are elementallybased as well you are basically forced to build one of the two variations available if you researched them that will be effective against the element of the enemy coming through that way in dote there was so much more room for trying different turret combinations to serve not only on the local situation but the global one across the entire map and even that entire specific game run

artistically the game is very beautiful and nicely polished and theres some fun use of 2d effectselements amidst the 3d stuff props to the artanimation team no doubt

i just really really really wished amplitude kept dotes more subtle and nuanced tone this game feels so oversimplified immature and low brow by comparison as if it were designed for children

#####

conceptually endless dungeon is a weirdo game its predecessor dungeon of the endless succeeded thanks in large part to its gripping multilayered strategic gameplay to call it anything but a strategy game would be disingenuous as the action element of your characters automatically fighting monsters is really only a tool used to test if your strategic planning was successful or not to put it simply it is a roguelike with very little action but a whole lot of strategy and it absolutely flourished in its own little weird niche it carved for itself the intent behind endless dungeon seemingly was to boldly break out of its predecessors niche to try hit a more mainstream appeal forgoing a good chunk of its strategy in favor of a more actionoriented gameplay loop with grander presentation the result is a reasonably fun game but one that feels at odds with itself its an ambitious title that tries to do a helluva lot succeeding decently well at most while not flourishing at any one thing in particular 

i do want to stress that i feel it has some good foundations for a great game to be built on top of i think the switch from 2d to 3d went over beautifully with the environments being detailed and the colors vibrant the combat may not require the intricate planning of the last game but it feels snappy enough to engage you with the turret shoving mechanic being an especially fun addition to make the moment to moment action feel meaningful i have fun playing it and i am optimistic for the games future to grow and develop beyond its solid yet underutilized foundations into something truly special definitely a step down in terms of complexity and distinctiveness from its predecessor but still a jam in my humble opinion at least get it during a sale if youre curious or wait to see if it gets fleshed out by its developers please amplitude im on my hands and knees begging yall have got the makings of something goated here

#####

super cool game with a few rough edges

the multiplayer progress issues have already been addressed so no reason to beat a head horse

the good
you are always doing something and the game encourages you to keep pushing forward
the turrets while similar all feel diverse enough to encourage good placement to get max value
8 playable characters all easy to unlock lets you quickly get a taste of all your options and pick which one you like most the abilities of the characters all feel varied enough that they dont just feel like reskins
you are rewarded heavily for being smart with doors and you feel the impact of a good path vs a bad path 
gameplay is fast and smooth movement feels fast and responsive and gunplay comes with just enough autoaim to help you hit targets amid the chaos

the bad
enemies going completely invulnerable for a painfully long time just feels like a time waster it would be cool if you could melee where they are and disrupt their stealth
the enemy ai being completely brain off most of the time yet sometimes will path to a generator through 5 rooms makes it feel like theres no real value to generators unless theyre in a really good spot
the core having a turrets take damage every x seconds modifier is a real feels bad like im playing a tower defence game and punished for building towers even with healing towers it is often not enough on top of enemy damage
weapons feel very 1 dimensional there are shotguns snipers full auto rifles and launchers the lightning shotgun and the toxic shotgun play the same and it quickly gets bland and becomes pick the big number

the neutral
towers upgrading is extremely unclear how progressed a tower is to the next level is a mystery and if a tower dies before you melee it you lose the level up a small indicator would help a lot with understanding how a buff tower levels vs a damage tower
ai not using ultimates at all means in solo play you have to constantly hop between characters an option to at least let them panic cast or cast alongside the player would be nice 
the tutorial scripted death is really weird instead of a swarm overrunning you in an unwinnable situation you watch as a single bug bops your crystal and executes it it had me worried enemies would just do insane damage to the crystal which is not the case
the option to buy loot chests from the character select screen would be a nice feature just to streamline gameplay

overall has a lot of potential but needs a little polish fun if you enjoy games in the genre

#####

coming from dungeon of the endless its tough to express how deeply disappointed i am in this

they took out everything that made dote interesting different and special everything

the way dust worked in dote to power rooms and how monsters spawned in dark rooms was good hell it was great the mechanic worked so well to make you anxious about just one more door because the tactics of how many doors you opened and which ones you picked mattered powering and unpowering rooms mattered now you just open all the doors place turrets at choke points and hope you find good enough weapons to keep up with the bullet sponge curve in ed dust and dark rooms basically have no considerable effects on the game

what else the graphics updated to look like every other game the music made more generic the theme and mood from creepy and quirky to something flat and tasteless the writing stale theres a revolutionary who is so tropey after one floor i just wanted him to shut up down with the capitalist scum and to the barricades he shouts as hes mowing down alien bugs on a space station it has consolitis too though that appears to be the standard these days

they made it wasd and mouse aim which would have been bawesomeb if they had actually taken some notes from other such games you cant dodge the movement aiming and general ui is janky autoaim is on by default presumably because aiming without it is a nightmare the projectiles dont strike where you expect them to this is not something that is hard to get right ive played plenty of comparable games that have responsive intuitive controls go play hades for an amazing example of how to do it right oh and if you play solo expect your ai buddies to make some seriously questionable life choices and dont expect the healer to heal you when you really need it unless you switch to her midcombat

there are some serious bugs too both annoying and gamebreaking twice in 20 hours the crystal bot has gotten stuck in pathing leading to serious damage once i teleported to the bot and got stuck in a place i couldnt move out of turrets and enemies repeatedly get softlocked into a cycle where neither can damage each other enough to kill so you have to go across the whole map and finish the enemy to end a wave

the runs are quite long which would be fine if the game was built so that you could play it to the end on the first try if you were good enough but now you have to unlock a bunch of crap that makes it more likely to win including removing arbitrary and deeply unfun difficulty blocks on the final level by repeatedly playing the game welcome to the final level you have no income lol its the same with the characters they have four unlocks each and you have to do the quests one at the time so tactically the best thing to do is to play until you have unlocked the next step then quit the run so you can hand it in what kind of game design is that

sigh

i preordered this on day one and hyped about it for ages i suppose that was my mistake i finally got around to playing it as i recently got a new computer i dont know what happened to amplitude but they stopped making the flawed masterpieces we loved they removed the masterpiece and kept the flaws and thats how endless dungeon feels

if you arent coming from dote this game may entertain you for a while wait for a sale even with its flawed mechanics and janky controls but if you are expecting dote 2 dont bother this is the popcorn version the daytime tv dote the homeopathy edition just play the original

#####

january
devs what dont you currently like
players all of this
devs
end of febuary
devs heres that grandma nobody can name as a playable character

#####

as of december 2023 i would recommend  it has massive shoes to fill for many people who played the previous game but more on that later  

endless dungeon is a fun cross between twin stick shooter and tower defense with you the player controlling the flow of enemies on the map based on doors you open as you explore a randomly generated level  dont be put off by the twin stick thing its not crazy hard like smashtv  

the game oozes with that trademark amplitude appreciation for style and for the endless setting theyve created  the characters have loads of personality without ever getting annoying  theyre strange but also relatable

i think the difficulty needs polish in that they need to offer more alternate methods of accomplishing goals something which dungeon of the endless excelled at  im also not fully sold on the bossesi prefer that the levels gradually ramp up in difficulty in a more organic sense  the security zone boss is decent because it follows this approach more  fortunately as a solo player the allied ai is pretty good

now if you came from dungeon of the endless to this i can understand that you might feel underwhelmed when you start playing this  i did  amplitude suffers from their own success here as dungeon of the endless is one of the most genuinely fun and replayable games out there and this game is marketed as its spiritual descendant yet is fundamentally different in some of its basic mechanics  
endless dungeon an action game with a tower defense component and a threat level based on doors opening but sometimes slowly increasing on its own with set enemy spawn points  dungeon of the endless a clicktomoveyourmanhere tactical strategy with encounters occurring only on door opening and enemies spawning in any unpowered rooms  

i appreciate that amplitude is mixing things up here and i think theyll perfect this but its a work in progress and is trying to do its own thing  if its not your thing fair

#####

tldr its a buy but give it a few more months and a sale dont buy it now and not at full price it isnt fully cooked yet


so its a good game but needs to go through a few more updates around key mechanics before id say its worth a buy at full price wait on it it still needs time to cook otherwise i really want to love this game

i consider dote one of my favourite games so the translation shouldve been easy and at its core this is a bgood gameb but its hamstrung by some key issues that make the game more frustrating than it needs to be the key issues are

list
bthe teammate ai in soloplay are pale help compared to other playersb theyre just glorified turrets really they dont have any tactical sense no personal intelligence to see a problem and rush to it they fire at what you fire at and thats it this is obviously a big issue in a game that is partly turnbasedstrategy and requires all team members being aware of many things going on at once so multiplayers the way to go right
bthe multiplayer experience has littletono communicationcoordination toolsb you have a mic you can ping yourself on the map and thats it if your teammates arent on mic theres nothing you can do to organize them in any other shooteverythingyousee game this wouldnt be a big deal but this game has scarce resources which are received from opening doors and enemy difficulty increases the more doors that are opened you can see where im going with this multiplayer right now is every man for himself and since you all share resources for personal upgrades you begin to resent your team
bfinding open multiplayer servers is a huge choreb i have no idea who developed this games ui but its impressively inadequate there is no server list like youd expect you have a list of regions and when you click one it shows you what servers are there no servers all full you need to back out and click another region this sounds small but it ends up being 20 clicks to see all of the servers when it should all be on one single table why it was designed this way is beyond me and so far they seem to not acknowledge the ui issues

beyond those big three i do like the game though they do tone and lighting well the heroes are interesting and unique enough to matter and while the gameplay can be a bit shallow at times theyre actively adding new content so theres clearly a desire to keep beefing up the game

if they solved those big three issues id back the game 100 but as it is wait on it

#####

it is fun when you need something mindless great for a sick day

you can tell the epic games store exclusivity was in this game because it doesnt have very simple steam integration specifically its a game released on steam in 2023 that doesnt include save game sync you wont be able to take your sick days on a trip with your steamdeck unless thats where you put the time in

#####

bought it on its first day and i got to admit as a dungeon of the endless enjoyer 170 hours i was abit disappointed at first because i felt the whole strategy that i liked so much is kind of lacking on this game but i gave it a chance and i found myself drawn to the game as i did to the first one there is still alot of planning strategy where to put characters to hold the incoming waves and manage the resources in addition to controlling the characters which feels amazing the new crystal mechanic is incredible feels much more intese and challenging and gives the crystal itself a feeling of being a part of the team and not just an item you carry to the end  the graphics sounds and characters are fantastic in my opinion

#####

im big fan of the game and dungeon of the endless but at the same time i would not recommend it now

good parts 
 good music
 good cinematics
 good gameplay
 good story and lore
 playing with friends is fun
 fun for 2030 hours

bad parts 
never seen a game with so many bugs crystal bot stuck final boss hp bar missingattacks animations missingnot disapearing cant access true ending after all memories collected monster staying at 0hp making run harder etc etc
not shared steam success in coop for a coop game should be fixed soon but super super not fun when you want to rush the game like i did
most weapons are the same with just different elements
 characters are not enough specialist of their domain healer shoud do less damages and heal more supports should support more and do less damages carries are fine tbh
 dont check the merchant its waste of time he always sells useless things not like in dungeon of the endless where it was super satifying to meet him
chests are not satisfying to open at all the loot is so much often bad to take
 no textchat or minimap pings means no communication for a coop game means you dont even want to play coop with strangers
 no server list for multiplayer coop only matchmaking
 ally ai has super low iq it can only shoot ennemies and dodge some attacks nothing more
 ennemy ai attacking generators 1 sec after crystal is in a new slot should not be a normal behavior they should keep focusing crystal bot for the current wave
 if a stranger leaves a coop you cant control the ai that replaces him
 not enough steam success finish a run in hard or finish the game 1515 times for example
 some itemsturrets are super super op and some are useless it makes the game less fun still ok for a game release but need balance asap

despite all theses problems i still like the game it could become really great in few weeks or months but cant recommend it now

#####

i loved dungeon of the endless and this game is not that and thats okay i hate having to write a review comparing a game to its spin off source but honestly its what needs to happen i love this game too its got more work that can be done but the bones of it are amazing

now having played several hundred hours of dote between a pirated copy and steam over the years my opinion is that the original was actually a flawed but extremely fun game and while not perfect endless dungeon fixes many of the issues i had while adding new actiony vibes a lot of complaints say this lacks strategytatics but i say its changing the strategy and being more about reacting to rather than controlling the flow of the game

the game may have less characters but they are extremely customizable within their specialties instead of set upgrades on leveling and some characters only getting good after certain level thresholds the game has upgrades that are build defining i can play bunker with a combination of pure tankthorns damage shove meleeknockback crowd control front line turret support or just flat out raw damage it depends on what i roll from the upgrade shop and adapting to the randomness is something i find fun

there are less equipment slots losing the armor slot but the guns have a wide variety within in them its hard to explain but guns feel like they serve functions instead of just being straight damage upgrades a gun might be a knockback gun or rapid fire elemental crit gun or just plain aoe these guns plus the game knowledge of knowing where spawns are lets you take certain angles or know what rooms are best for you to defend so you can avoid overspending on turrets you can get by with anything but it feels good to realize you can do something cool

turrets no longer die meaning we can make fallback points and use delaying tactics as turrets pull agro turrets can be healed to keep them alive creating a front line support roll in dote this would bleed resources the only strat that would feel good would be making kill rooms that were all or nothing

we no longer use dust to light rooms and control spawners while i agree dust could be made to feel more useful i dont see the difference in the long run between the old system and the new either way i am setting my defenses in a way that enemies walk through them it doesnt matter if i control the flow or react to spawners enemies still walk through defense points  

turrets no longer hit everything in a room so some turret slots are directly useful for engaging enemies but the slots that arent can be filled with strong support turret thats do effect the entire room so with limited turret research opportunities you can make choices like filling door with elemental turrets or flex slots like the buffer that dont care about position for bad positions

its valid to not like the changes from the original or denuvobugs but there is good stuff here maybe could use balance changes but still really fun

a unique blend of dungeon crawler tower defense roguelike

the artwork character and gameplay design is a great 810
replayability is awesome as the level design randomized each time

bonly the hostb
1 character quest to unlock skill slot
2 progression to unlock new character

bother player who joined the lobbyb
1 in game resources to unlock saloon upgrade scraps
2 skill points saves to unlock weapon  character upgrade

bif the progress is saved and sharedb
the coop progression experience would be easy 810 or 1010

if your not too concerned about hosting or just doing it for replayability gameplay to satisfied your roguelike craving experience im confident you can get all your character unlock in 34 days

also there will be updates on bcoop progression saved for multiplayer next patchb so if your bothered by the progression not saving hold off for a week till the patch rolls in

good luck  good hunting

#####

would be great for an early access title hopefully its got a strong road map because right now the game is too repetitive without enough content to back it up will revisit based on future patches

#####

its a fun coop game  it deserves a thumbsup

#####

the coop in this game is the strangest thing ive ever seen if youre the host and playing with your friends they can only use the things youve unlocked if you first go to your own save it would be as if you were starting to play from at first participants cannot equip skills change unlockable character skins weapon skins anything they are simply assistance for a coop where only the host can do whatever they want

#####

30h played and enjoyed every one of them its a whole lot of fun to enjoy this game with its fresh genre mix awesome art style ultrawide support outofthebox and the suspense curve where the levels start relaxed and then ramps towards the end where its allgunsblazing out of the final exit door hopefully 
its a fun relaxed tactical thinking game easy to get into and enjoy a few hours
it is indeed a bit more on the light side in terms of gameplay but thats actually the part that i enjoy most its the game thats perfect to enjoy with some friends for a few hours taking on the hordes and having a blast theres no large skilltree that needs to be mastered combined with the 00001 loot chance weaponry needed to progress no grinding for resources no how to keep em hooked just blast away and have fun

#####

there are still bugs and glitches that have been there since release day the amount of content in the game is laughable and the variety of weapons and enemies is sad 210 pass this game up or get it on sale for dirt cheap

#####

the other reviews made me nervous but truthfully i think people had an expectation of what they wanted this game to be and it just didnt turn out to be the game they thought it would be im not saying its perfect and id love to see the story expanded further but overall ive really enjoyed the time ive spent playing definitely recommend buying if its on sale

#####

i have over 100 hours in dungeon of the endless and im coming into this with a good amount of time on the pre release builds

my basic thoughts are this the game feels like it wasnt designed to be played in singleplayer and quite honestly i feel like this game should have been an rts if youre looking for a dote2 this isnt it theres far less to consider as you open doors and much more of your success is offloaded onto your ability to play a twin stick shooter rather than on your ability to plan 

this wouldnt be so bad if the twin stick element wasnt painfully simple and your ability to order bots wasnt so woefully limited early combat is largely going to boil down to just pointing in a direction and holding mouse 1 which for me got boring real fast i kept wishing i could just sit back and let the characters do this themselves and on the flipside when i started getting more weapon options that could dramatically effect combat performance i found my bots making awful decisions on their own that i had no way to really consistently stop

an easy example is the flamethrower which is ultra close range there are enemies who can damage you basically within a second of being at about the same distance this weapon attacks from maybe even further but unfortunately for me i had no way to tell my bot to stop charging at bugs and using it every chance she had instead of firing at the enemies from far away with her standard gun 

this game trades so much of what i loved from its spiritual predecessor for a game that honestly feels a bit ill conceived to me i cant call it a bad game it looks great and the music is enjoyable as always but i dont know who its really for

also this is just a personal subjective thing but i could not stand any of the voice lines these characters are insufferable if theyre not on mute 


#####

this is not a dungeon of the endless remake game its a totally different thing that takes elements from dote and remix them differently  if thats what your looking for you might be disappointed
i like the original and i love this one more even if thats a totally different gaming experience


#####

just boring

none of the progression meta or otherwise feels good it all just feels flat

for something branded roguelikeroguelite none of the run progress ever felt exciting or desirable

honestly felt like a game that tried to mesh td with roguelikelite hero action elements and ended up with not much to show for either

looks nice though

#####

having 100 the first game dungeon of the endless of this side series of the endless universe i was excited when a spiritual successor was announced

ive tried liking this game but its just a game with an identity crisis it doesnt want to be it predecessor yet it relies on the ideas in that to keep this game afloat the entire time i am playing something feels just off with this game 

the gameplay is decent at best but feels shallow compared to the depth that the previous game provided instead of a colorful cast of characters you have 8 characters its obvious this was because the characters took on more active roles than the previous games where before characters were units you moved on a board here theyre heroes you directly control 

solo is completely forgone for the coop experience while its not impossible to solo the ability to solo is really hampered compared to dungeon of the endless in that the other heroes are harder to place and by default just follow you where you go while you can command them to stay in places all they do is just stand in places unlike in the first game where depending what was in the room the characters could interact with nodes to repair them or make the generators produce more based on a characters statsskills here ai just shoot no repairs no enhancing just shoot

the level up system is completely different in that they provide more stat modifiers than actual new skills like i mentioned characters could repair or enhance nodes depending on their skills which they would gain over the course of a run by leveling up or equipping certain items that would give them said skill

speaking of items there are only guns and stat modifying cards additionally all extra weapons you find you have to leave behind instead of having the ability to sell them for resources like you could in dungeon of the endless at vendors

so far i havent seen any fun easter eggs that affect your game such as the ability to sometimes get a hidden hero if you choose random like in the first game

lastly the lore to be honest the lore feels really watered down compared to the first game theres less interesting monsters to fight heroes look and feel really generic the fun of completing achievements for a gallery of art that would reveal more lore is gone its all found through character quests or finding nodes on the floor to read 

so overall this game is just less than the base game of the previous title it is using for marketing choosing to be more coop friendly it lost the charm the first game gave its not the worst game ever but it certainly doesnt live up to the potential the first game left

#####

this game is the definition of mid

#####

actually quite an entertaining game that i enjoyed playing with my friends and even random players  however it needs more difficulty levels as playing on hard  max difficulty  isnt very hard at all  its called endless dungeon but it is indeed not endless you would think that at least there would be an endless mode where things just get harder and harder until you cant take it anymore but nope the game offers a fair variety of towers and weapon types some of these towers are obviously much stronger than others and youll aim to get those same towers every play through which isnt hard to do certain weapons are significantly stronger than others which again renders the use of some guns virtually non existent endless dungeon offers some decent options for weapons but only two weapon types so unless you and whoever youre playing with choose a character that uses different weapons youll be competing against each other every time a chest opens for guns  some of the characters can get some really op perks which while sounds like something youd like but it can lead to the game becoming ez mode too soon and if the challenge isnt there its boring

all in all endless dungeon is a fun game that will definitely keep you busy for a little once you beat it on the hardest difficulty you will be left wanting more and atm the game doesnt have much to offer in that regard i am eager to see the direction this game goes in i would wait for it to go on sale or wait for more content to be released

#####

they gutted most of the systems from the original game and just hit it with a fresh coat of paint way less variety dont even have melee charactersweapons and depth of play than the original super disappointed with amplitude on this one not worth 3040 at all

#####

i kept seeing reviews for this game that had threatened put me off and i have to say that i found none of them helpful 

one common refrain was that progression wasnt shared in coop this is not true its a bit wonky to be sure requiring the player quickly jump into their own solo lobby to unlock characters and such but its really not as big of a deal as many are making it out to be and good news amplitude has committed to quickly patching the wonky behavior so it wont be here for long 

i was a little sad to hear that some had felt it was a step back in decision making but ive found this also to be untrue theres a lot of tough decisions to make on each run especially on larger level sizes i thought originally the spawner system was a step back but found i was wrong and spawners keep up the intensity of each level while letting you plan your defenses and exploring around them spawners also have elemental types that inform what kind of weapons you are carrying as well as what kind of turrets you should unlock and place i really enjoyed the drilling mechanic that has your crystal move to a location but then it follows a character until its placed back into a slot while you fight endless waves  i really hope more interesting mechanics like this can be added

another really cool addition is the boss fights i was just blown away with how cool and fun they are and each fight has some unique mechanics also the music absolutely rocks

theres also a decent bit of progression  character have 3 mod slots each that are unlocks by doing runs and achieving goals and each of those slots can be customized with several unlockable mods all guns also have mods that can be unlocked you can customize your crystal with mods as well you can unlock level modifiers to vary your runs you can buy powerups to give you an initial boost on each run its all there and would be excited to see the options available grow 

some have even said the characters are boring but i found it was very similar to the original  theres a lot of unique perks for each character than can be unlocked in a run that can be game changers i think many have missed these since you are given 3 random choices at a time so these perks may be missed initially some characters have some really unique abilities and passives as well that really alter play style 

and none of this even touches the wonderful art and animations the procedurally generated levels are excellent and very immersive the game runs very smoothly and is well optimized it also works beautifully on the deck 

id urge people to give this game at least a half dozen hours and few runs so that you can really experience all it has to offer each time i found myself disappointed something was missing i would very quickly discover that the feature actually exists but hadnt been unlocked yet 12 hours in the game is not enough to see everything it has to offer and those reviews should be ignored

#####

fun game that includes turret placement protecting resource generators and shooting stuff that has different elemental weaknesses cons would be very few servers in asia and also i am unsure if they will add more characters and weapons in the future

#####

the game does not have full coop progression i have to go to my game and play alone to unlock characters and their advancements

#####

as someone who has enjoyed all of the endless games including dungeon of the endless it was obvious to me from the first announcement of this game that it would not be as hardcore as dote up front im 8 hours in and there is more than enough variability as options become unlocked to change each characters playstyle

yes there is a wonderful depth to dote but endless dungeon is more accessible and i am having a lot of fun playing with my brothers im finding endless dungeon on normal difficulty to be of decent challenge while finding the game relaxing

i hope for great future updates as i know the amplitude team can do i havent encountered any game breaking bugs

#####

a fun game to play with friends coop progress is being worked on and will improve the game i like the art style and different character abilities looking forward to more content from the devs on this

#####

coop should be drop in 

a full run from start to finish took me two hours the first time i beat it with online coop its a big ask to find 2 other people who will stay with you the full 2 hours if anyone leaves you will be stuck with the pots for the rest of the run

if you can get around that its a fun game

#####

this game departs just a little bit too much from its predecessor the jump to 3d was a great idea but it lost a lot of the charm that made it so good 

half of the characters feel like they were modeled after more popular games eg overwatch while the other half felt right at home the game is too cutesy in my opinion for the world that it tries to build the creatures arent scary to fight and feel more like cannon fodder than actual threats the happygolucky attitude everyone seems to have combined with the overly endless optimism and forced joke at every opportunity makes this really feel like a game for teens and younger rather than the actual fanbase 

in my opinion it almost feels like management and pr teams got involved with the creative process rather than letting the actual developers do their thing considering how most of the bonus content is skin packs i wouldnt be surprised if that was the case 

all that aside the game plays as advertised and i cant fault them for that the issue i have with the game play is that outside of certain parts of the game that ill detail below it falls flat compared to its predecessor the previous game had far more urgency strategy and choices to it than this one does at a certain point resources simply dont matter and some weapons are so worthless that it feels like an insult to have them appear on screen about half way through most runs i devolved to just spamming open every door to find the exit faster in the original game this type of tactic would be a death sentence but here it almost felt like it was the intended way to play entering new floors became less of an enjoyable experience and more of a slog to get through 
however the boss floors more than made up for it interesting mechanics challenging game play and non beefcake bullet sponge bosses made the boss floors so much more enjoyable they were really a great breath of fresh air to the game and definitely where the devs really put in their best effort the downside is that in order to get to them youd have to run through a bunch of nonenjoyable floors just to get to them 

and unfortunately i cant recommend this game to others while i am perfectly content with having spent my money on this game for both myself and my friends whom i bought the game for i cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone else should have to sit through 1020m of lackluster gameplay just to get to a good 5 minutes of fun i also cant recommend this game to fans of dungeon of the endless because it just doesnt feel like it truly hit the mark

so what would need to change for my opinion to change 

bring back the grit stop catering to the lowest common denominator 
cannibalistic characters deranged psychopaths and prisonerguard dilemmas were so well written in the original i dont even remember the names of the characters in this game aside our drakken bartender  but golgy chef nanor and esseb tarosh are etched in my mind
difficulty is good its part of what made dungeon of the endless so good 
make the choices we make matter  doing 10 more damage isnt interesting
hell go crazy with modifications and upgrades for the turrets remove damage types from weapons and focus on making the weapons interesting give us melee weapons back in fact just give us more weapon options 

if you want turrets to be the primary method of defense make them stronger and more resilient but more susceptible to monster resistances the reason you remove damage type from player weapons is because theyre a backup they should always do damage just less of it

if you want players to be the primary method of defense do the opposite make more turrets have a supporting role make an aoe heal bot turret or one that provides cover from enemies that can shoot at you let us build breakable walls that block enemy movement and let flying enemies fly over

if you really want to go the extra mile give us reasons to spend our resources poorly earning upgrades by paying for a detrimental effect in a run and then completing the run then we have to choose between unlocking that sweet laser sniper beam rifle or building two great turrets thatll definitely hold down a corner add in drops for killing creaturesbosses in special ways alongside some unique upgrades to the characters skins weapons or even an endless mode and then youve got yourself way more replayability than exists right now 


idk ill come back to it later im sure i cant be the best judge of games i put over 2k hours into destiny 2 so what the fuck do i know amirite

#####

if you have an itch for a good tower defense game this is one to check out without a doubt

for me its up there with orcs must die series and sanctum 2 as my favorites in the genre

good graphics on here controls and handles very good and its a blast to play

pretty much the gameplaycontrols of the ascent or hades but tower defense style like orcs must die or sanctum 2

basically you are defending one main spot and then also some side areas where you have osme upgrades done and then later on after you have beat some rounds the spot you had just been defending starts to move towards the door to the next area you must follow it and protect it shooting enemies and setting up turrets along the way 

there is also a neat little hub sort of area where you can chat to people upgrade characters or weaponsetc it is fun solo or with a friend in coop

had no idea this game was coming out never played the old game so this has been a very nice surprise for me so far played almost 3 hours and cant wait to play more works well on pc and also stream deck

i honestly dont understand the mixed review score for this tbh it runs great controls are awesome and its the most fun i have had in a tower defense game since orcs must die series and sanctum 2

#####

i really really want to love this game but as it stands there isnt a single reason to play coop unless youre the one hosting you cant interact with anything or anyone in the saloon you arent awarded any achievements you arent shown any of the dialog upon reaching the end of a floor and you arent allowed to upgrade your character or any of your unlocked weapons everything else ive experienced thus far has been great i just dont understand how or why a game released in 2023 would utilize archaic coop mechanics like these especially when the game is marketed as and balanced for coop play

#####

they did coop wrong limited fun due to coop progression handicap

#####

for all that it gains with the better visuals and more active combat it loses in the strategic depth and charachter building i feel they are close to a good game here but they failed to build on the strengths of the previous game

#####

decided to give this a try due to a friend wanting to try it coop did the tutorial and one multistage run found that it ran into the same feeling that dungeon of the endless left me with which was that
 the decisions that led to failure seemed like the occurred distant from that failure thus making it unclear as to what caused said failure
 the systems were fairly opaque so after failing we didnt have the first idea of what we should have done differently we are both game designers and so its not like this sort of their was foreign to us

now i imagine through grinding out a number of runs one trialanderrors ones way to further success but i didnt feel driven to do so for two core reasons
 despite wearing an action game skin it didnt feel like micromoment play had a greater impact than dps the decisions that led to my kit and turret placement felt outsized in importance compared to momenttomoment shooting which felt secondary
 the shooting itself felt boring its all very colorful but fairly weightless the gun for the support character felt like shooting bbs the powercharge time for the q and e powers were glaaaacially slow and the response time on initiating the ult which is generally a oh crap button felt very high latency just not an appealing gamefeel to me overall for action gameplay

its all very well built from a standard production perspective runs well sounds pretty good it exudes competence roundly but i dont think for a single minute of the 48 minutes i played i would say i was having fun

#####

i have been playing this game with two other friends using discords voice chat and it has been a blast so far  i feel like the direction taken with endless dungeon is the right one it would have been a mistake to make a carbon copy of dungeon of the endless that in the end i didnt play much i am having a much better experience with this new release 

i have only managed to do a few runs given the fact that they lasted between 1h and 1h30 each spread in two sessions so be aware that you will probably need to find around 2h if you plan on reaching the last area for the first time however for my pace it was very enjoyable that way things are diversed enough to feel fresh and even the areas already visited are pleasant to play again we managed to beat the first boss we focused on and it was exciting to dodge the teams death a few times on normal difficulty i think the difficulty looks fair while playing 3 players coop

the art direction is really good character and world designs are varied the characters are very different with their own sets of skills and weapon specializations we already found a nice balance with our team and having fun mastering our favorite heroes however i still have a few to unlock as well as new areas in 6h of play time i have barely touched the surface on what the game has to offer moreover there is a bunch of lore about the endless universe that may appeal to people familiar with the franchise

at the time of writing this review the game seems to have some important bugs it seems some quests arent working so i cant unlock some character perks and the friends who were playing with me didnt unlock the achievements i got during the release day be aware that the developers are very reactive and seem invested in taking care of the issues i have read that some people cant launch the game but for my friends and i it was smooth one friend only got one crash during the early access time and that was all the issues about stability that we experienced

in a nutshell if you enjoy the endless universe and having fun with friends during medium length sessions with thoughtful planning and dynamic combat i would say this game is a good choice even better it is a roguelite so if you are a completionist it will keep you busy for a long time and will make you excited to unlock things for sure

update  10272023
patch allows hero unlocks no matter whos the host



if you are planning to play this game in multiplayercoop modes there is a few issues the host is the only one who keeps the progression  achievements excluding a few resources you can collect while playing in order to unlock new characters you must be either in your solo game or playing as the host at least when playing the game with other people for the first time there are a few popups which will inform you of these issues

this is enough of an issue that i wont be recommending the game for anyone who wants to play multiplayer

update developers responded  10212023
 thanks to your feedback and explanations weve realized that this was an important topic and  that we absolutely needed to improve this experience when playing in multiplayer

#####

its very good

dont let the negative reviews dissuade you this game is a spiritual successor to dungeon of the endless while they may seem similar theyre actually very different games

theyre both tower defense games with heroes however dote is a tower defense game with a focus on resource management and some hero management whereas ed is a twinstick shooter with tower defense elements and some resource management

in essence theyre two different genres leaning towards each other which may make them seem similar but be quite different as a result fans of the previous game come here looking for more and get burned

the content is well paced and well measured out youre generally never overwhelmed or confused the complexity is kept low enough that its easy to understand but still leaves room for plenty of nuance things like managing choke points learning how the maps are generated what heroes combo well

not to mention its not an endless grind despite the games name im 20 hours in and id say im about 6070 ish percent of the way through the main content which i consider getting to the reactor a few times and getting all the hero quests done

i can definitely see myself putting another 30 or 40 hours in just going for the achievements the game is great fun and i think ill love doing the achievement challenges when ive unlocked everything the true joy is optimizing around challenges

tlrd most negative reviews are from people expecting a sequel when its really something else the game nails the roguelite progression without being an endless slog or an rng fest

#####

i had really high hopes for this game and while i dont hate it its definitely a letdown for me i really like dungeon of the endless the predecessor to endless dungeon but i was actually really excited for the change in gameplay style i like having full control over the characters instead of only being able to pick which room theyre standing in it does make solo play more difficult but i find the game much more engaging as a twinstick shooter and i prefer to play with friends anyway unfortunately ed removed a lot of the strategic elements that made dote fun

first heres what i actually like about the game
the twinstick shooter gameplay is decent
all characters can repair turrets turret repair efficiency is based on wit i like this change
the enemy design is pretty good
most of the visuals are good i really like the lighting effects especially the shadows created when firing a weapon
i think the reloader is a good inuniverse explanation for why youre able to keep playing as the same characters each run
some of the new turrets are cool

now here are my problems with the game
the characters are terrible there are far fewer of them than in dote and the ones we get are like something out of a bad kids tv show theyre totally uninspired and extremely bland zed is a generic punk girl with attitude blaze is a generic cowboy with a sniper sweeper is a generic socially anxious guy all three of these characters look like rejected fortnite skins bunker is a less interesting ripoff of lady joleri tulak from the first game comrade might be the worst he runs around yelling about fighting the oppressors no matter whats going on in the game he feels like he was made by wealthy 70 year olds in a corporate boardroom as an attempt to appeal to young people half of the characters have extremely annoying voices and they talk constantly this was an immediate turn off for me
in dote most of the rooms were not powered and you had to use your limited amount of dust to power them you could powerunpower rooms at will and unpowered rooms would spawn monsters this allowed the player to make way more choices and as a result the game involved way more strategy having monsters spawn in set rooms and changing how dust works makes ed way less engaging and eliminates one of the games core strategy mechanics
waves happen on a timer which encourages rushing and discourages strategizing
the elemental damage types dont seem to add much in my opinion they just kind of pigeonhole you into researching whatever element the enemies youre going to encounter are weak to and you know what kind of enemies youll be encountering before you encounter them
the way you unlock characters is way less engaging than the first game they just give them to you for finishing a run
you can permanently upgrade your characters and weapons using resources you get in game i think direct upgrades to your character can work in single player roguelikes where you only play as one character like hades or rogue legacy but in a multiplayer game with multiple characters to play as it just disincentivizes you from playing with the stuff you havent upgraded yet it also puts new players at a disadvantage
individual runs are less unique because theres a lot less strategizing necessary you kind of do the same stuff every time as a result the game has less replayability
im not against having locked doors in the game at all but they way overdo it basically every floor will have multiple locked doors this just further reduces player choice and the importance of strategic thinking
you can play solo with three characters but you have to unlock it why is that not unlocked by default playing with only two characters should be a challenge that gets you an achievement or something

overall the game feels very dumbeddown compared to dote i hope some of this stuff will get changedfixed in future updates

#####

looks very good plays very well and there is a lot of choice on turrets and their placements and it got good music and satisfying boss fights too and also just shooting down a corridor of bugs is great

#####

tldr  if you are an old time dungeon of the endless fan and were expecting a modernized sequel with a bare minimum of equivalent level of strategy then do not purchase this game as it is a completely different game which uses a similar theme to the original but is actually intended as a coop run and gun

having spent a considerable amount of hours on the original game i was extremely looking forward and excited when this game was first announced  to the point were i even bought the preorder the end result however left me very disappointed and with no way to refund the purchase since i had preordered the game the original games strategic and tactical depth was completely thrown out of the window and replaced with run and gun mechanics with the occasional setup of modules here is a list of major changes done in relation to the original which in my opinion killed the fun of this title completely

 waves no longer spawn in unlit rooms but instead have fixed spawns  killing off any feeling of risktaking as you can simply fortify said areas and not have to worry about an attack from an unexpected direction
 dust is still used to power rooms but as already mentioned this does not determine enemy spawn anymore instead the only reason for lighting up a room would be to obtain an additional area where you can setup turrets or modules letting your crystal take damage no longer reduces dust and hence does not affect room lighting
 melee specialists have been completely removed with the only melee attack being a basic shove that every character can use
 science research automatically triggers a wave and is no longer turn based probably due to the smaller room sizes overall
 turret repairing is no longer a specific trait to specialists but is simply a matter of using the shove attack on a turret midcombat
 when playing solo ai companions are completely useless
 greatly reduced hero roster
 absence of functional armor

very disappointed in such wasted potential as this could have been a modernized version of the original masterpiece but what we got instead was an unfinished and linear version which butchered what initially made it good in exchange for some flashy graphics and visuals cannot recommend especially to dungeon of the endless oldtimers

#####

edit they just nerfed nearly all heroes and weapons because they were too meta over turrets in their latest major update 
why you would want to nerf something controlled by the player at all times and buff an autoturret is definitely going to make the gameplay on the players end feel worse over just buffing turrets alone

their words
overall balance the game you might need a few more turrets we have seen that some of you can just carry the game without turrets as heroes are perhaps a bit too powerful this is why we have balanced heroes and turrets to move away from this meta 

players should feel strong in a twinstick shooter roguelike but im assuming theyd rather pick what meta you play

i dont recommend this right now not when its asking this price and blackout protocol is right there




original review

610
rather mixed opinion for this was looking forward to this since announced but unfortunately missed some key features this genre of roguelikes really need to feel fun for me

starting off the solo play is tedious and doesnt at all feel great with the ai and ai commands offered for the team of 2 or 3
you can only command ai to wait or follow and they play too inefficiently to really hold off anything
youre stuck babysitting ai teammates alongside your actual defenses crystal bot generators and turrets

the coop experience without friends isnt manageable enough for a good time
 no couchsplitscreen coop
 you can only hostquick join sessions in a selected region no browser or solo matchmaking
 various upgrades are only selected and managed by host which causes a bit of confusion and restricts freedom with any builds you attempt to make while you require the host to manually do it
 no text chat or push to talk only open mic
 limited ping system

the lack of communication doesnt really feel great for a solo player and when theres no couch coop i genuinely cannot recommend this when you intend without a party of 3

 progression saves for your playthrough keys currencies current character quests but you cannot newly unlock characters in coop when not hosting 

characters have 2 abilities one is an ultimate gunplay at its core is simple and most of the gun variety is okay no melee 
overall im not sure where the strength in its gameplay lies aside turret defense 
skills only feel okay not too interesting and the gunplay is too simple for the thrill of a roguelike i didnt feel like continuing many runs because the lack of gameplay diversity through a run did not engage me 
there was no feeling of being an powerful scaledup abomination of a character towards the later end of runs after getting experienced

the homebase saloon characterweapon upgrades are mostly just a numbers change that can be permanently equipped to heroesweapons prior to deployment 
most weapon upgrades were just minor buffs
weapons upgrades selected only by the host in a coop session

the upgrade merchant during a run is pretty much the same just with some negatives effects being a possibly ie attack power 20 max hp 10


overall i think the price is not really justifiable and there isnt much here that brings this over other titles already on the market for equal or less
i dislike that i disliked this but it didnt play too well into what makes this genre style work and feel great to play 
youre getting a wavebased turret defense twinstick shooter that doesnt show enough strength in both shooting or turrets with not enough build variety surprises and roguelike features that really requires coop with 12 friends

hopefully over time things will get more fleshed out for some wellneeded depth

no horatio hero 010

still an addictive fun experience youll die a lot but as youre not horatio that is an acceptable outcome 

better point out this one plays as a different beast from dungeon of the endless so if youre going to dive in expect less of a direct sequel and more of a twist on dote

pros   beautiful graphic design style to the cast
           heroes are all unique and dont overshadow one another you will find someone who works for you
           addictive arcade experience of one more go
           despite dying and failing a lot you will still feel like youre making progress
           most digestible lore for the endless titles found here
           fassies cafe adds a little variety to future runs when youve achieved the main objective

cons  as of the time of writing its still got some bugs need patching 
                    basic blob monsters not being added to the archive once killed for example
           some achievements are not activating when they should so that could be an error too
           the heroes whilst great are currently too few in number so some runs end up feeling very samey

should be noted at the time of writing a lot of the coop hero progression that wasnt working on launch other reviews have mentioned appears to have been altered by the devs so they seem to be listening to the criticism and adjusting accordingly

#####

kinda boring only the host progresses so a waste of time for everyone else

#####

after playing it i fully understand the games mixed rating i feel like the heroes need a lot more character but there is still a worthwhile game in it for you if you have have friend to grab along

#####

game is short and not flushed out saves are not cloud based and there is no warning about this nearly no online players i dont recommend this

#####

in short currently would not recommend
coop progression is not actively shared
key elements do not progress at all other elements you gain resources but have to annoyingly go into your own game to unlock
some progression even requires you to replay in your own game just to progressunlock it

im a long time fan of the lorebuilding in the endless universe games i absolutely loved that about every previous game
i was saddened when they came out with the civilization clone humankind to be honest i didnt want yet another alternative human history game i wanted more endless universe to explore

i preordered this game very early on because i had trust in this developer given my experience with their prior games
after the release of this game and the way they are glaringly and tactically ignoring complaints on their forum i now feel the opposite i feel like they are letting us down big time

when youre not the host your progress on your hero quests is halted
youre basically playing instead of a bot for the hosts progression not your own
i dont get how they could ever think that that would be an enjoyable experience

you gain resources to unlock certain things but quests are not progressed even if you have the hero unlocked yourself
after a long coop session you need to go in to your own solohosted game to spend your resources
thing is nothing of what you select in terms of upgrades will be active in someone elses hosted lobby
so now the host needs to spend their resources not on just the hero they are maining but also the hero their coop partners are maining
so those resources become even more of a grind it makes no sense to me
everyone mains their own hero with their preferred weapons as a playstyle so they will invest in those things with priority over others
but when you join a friend to play with you are at the mercy of whatever they have unlocked and activated

the closed betas did not clearly laid this out for us and it did not give us a clear way to give feedback on it either
it simply was never the focus and instead we kept being told meta progression is still wildly in concept phase and can change

i made a simply thread talking about some issues i ran in to when playing coop giving ample space for the devs to respond to let us know certain things are bugs if they were and that other things are working as designed but are being reevaluated
instead we get toxic fanboys whiteknighting it we get a copypaste faq listing with ambiguous wording over what is and what is not shared progression we get zero response from the devs on these things they dont acknowledge whether or not hero quests nor progressing is a bug or not even though they are very clearly reading and replying in threads they chose to completely avoid the biggest issues some of their consumerbase is suffering from
what does that tell you do they not think about how that makes them look

#####

       i was really excited for this game i waited eager for the release of this game as i really enjoyed the first one but this game was a disappointment for me the game is so not repayable you play a few rounds and you have really just experienced the entire game 
       this could have been solved so easily with the saloon alone by making the saloon empty and barren and make you have to delve to get characters in the saloon instead of the only way to effect it is with the band make it so to unlock characters you have to find them like the first game the ending should be a hard to get special ending that should be like an easter egg rather than the standard end it would make more sense if the end was fed into the loop i dont know how but if you beat the game you would understand what i mean 
      i love the style of the game the vibrancy gameplay even feels good to me but the choices for repeatability were very much lacking i feel the love that was put into the game but as soon as the game launched that love left the building in my eyes i love amplitude studios and they have some real bangers of games but this one needs work before i can give it a recommend

#####

010 abandonware game breaking bugs still exist as of march 14 2024

#####

i actually like this game but there are some changes id need to see before i can recommend it let me explain

the main thing that drew me to the game was the fact that you can solo with ai companions i thought that would be fun and it kinda is but the problem for me is that unless you tell them to stay put it feels like their ai gets turned off if theyre following you in a party they feel extremely dull and a lot of the time dont react to enemies until most of them are already dead however if you tell them to stay put they wake up and become aggressive and will actively avoid aoe attacks hazards and even move between rooms if you leave them in the right spot i feel comfortable leaving them to defend a certain point at least where im at in the game on normal mode and thats good

but it really takes the fun out of it when they act like crash dummies when theyre roaming around with you i wish that would change maybe if they just gave them defense mode but only let them roam around in the room youre currently in they just feel so inert in a party when it comes time to move the crystal bot it always feels like im guarding it by myself

my other issue is that so far every run feels the same theres not really much variance the upgrades dont feel fun and the gear so far doesnt really feel impactful especially since you can only have one piece of gear per character from what i can tell theres not really builds you can make you just play the same way every run and that really hurts the gameplay loop the actual gameplay is fine to me i think the shooting is kinda fun the abilities are ok but its so plain without being able to make builds

i played the previous game dungeon of the endless it was a lot more strategic and played very differently and it was a lot more of a numbers game but in an active shooter game like this i think that being able to have modifiers to your character like in hades runs would make a huge difference to the replayability

if they move more in that direction and work on the ai i will change my recommendation but as of right now im 35 hours in and im honestly bored with it and kinda disappointed and thats a shame i might play it a little more but i dont know for how long

also this is a minor gripe but when you find lore entries on the ground i think its kinda silly that the characters react like its the most boring thing on the planet unless its a map out of here i dont care i get that its supposed to be funny but hearing it every time you encounter lore is like the game telling you not to bother reading it lol

last thing i dont like being able to see skins as an option that are unobtainable like obtained from a 2022 event i wish those would get removed as an option unless you have them unlocked

#####

the reviewers who dont recommend have valid points but after binging the game for a day and beating it in about 9 hours if i never touched it again id say it was an ok purchase the game is still being supported and ill probably be sinking in enough hours over the monthsyears for me to be pretty happy about getting the game my biggest complaint is simply how horrible the ai teammates are all they need to do is point shoot and use their abilities on cd but it is what it is

#####

this game is a pathetic money grab no love went into this

#####

edit 2 game is just kinda mid with an arguably low amount of replay after about 24 hours of game play i have most of the unlocks seen every floor fought every boss and completed like 90 of the character stories all while playing on normal and hard theres not much left for me to do other than a new run for a new runs sake and going back to redo things i did in multiplayer as they dont give achievements unless youre host which is really sad considering how many hours i have in their other games and how little ive completed in those maybe that just me

edit the devs have said if you dont have the thoughts as them then dont buy our game and i cant refund now or i would as im not part of their hive mind the seem to be spending more time after launch trying to delete steam threads about denuvodrm even tho the game doesnt have drm it has anticheat and dissenting opinions then they are about addressing game issue their first update post is about game progression design that should have been a no brainer for a coop game with no mention about missing features like ptt no chat and horrid bot ai honestly i should have seen this coming after the train wreck that was the launch of humankind where they did basically the same thing i play games to escape the all encompassing political landscape and they to me have just made it political by deleting voices that they dont like the speech of

i like this game it is fun and im glad the online games work better than dungeon of the endless

tldr good game but missing major qol features for multiplayer mode like pushtotalk

the game is clearly made for multiplayer without several features trying to play single player is doable but the bots are awful they will not use most abilities cant use ults and only to commands dont move and follow meaning if something is on the other end of the room that need defending they will not move to the other side to defend it nor will they follow the moving objective that is part of every run as for the missing features there is no lobby viewer unlike their other games just quick join the voice chat is straight dog shit the mic gain by default is 100 so everybody peaks theres no push to talk or toggle mute i have had to just leave many games because i will join a game and even with vc at 10 the other playersmusicfamily or random mic static has been so bad im sure i have ear damage now there is no text chat to make up for the people who turn off voice chat which i have run in to a few due to the only open mic issue you earn scrap to by upgrades and chest to help at he start of new run but only host can buy them if you are playing with somebody you will be earning this scrap but can use it to but those chest unless you kill the lobby and restart as host meaning 2 of the 3 players will always have more scrap than the host even tho they cant use it after they buy the upgrades for their game there also seems to be an issue with players trying to complete their character stories in multiplayer too as of right now is a problem where you can complete one story part have to leave star a single player game then rejoin to lobby to start the next part maybe this will be patch soon but at this time its still there
 
if most or all of the qol issue get addressed i will give this game a positive review but its hard to play a coop game without good communication

#####

very very short endless dungeon i know the setting is the endless setting but my goodness you need to finish your game before you release a skin pack lol

#####

in its current state i would not recommend until they add some sort if true endless mode or at least more depth to what is there

while an enjoyable experience it isnt very endless at all the replay value is just getting small time upgrades for your weapons or moderate tier upgrades for your characterscore or doing their side quests to unlock their slots that isnt a negative in its own right obviously upgradespower are fun things to get the issue stems from hitting that what now wall as early as you do sure you can run different characters to get their side quests done but it still feels very empty

#####

i loved the original and wanted this to be good but im really disappointed in how mediocre this is

avoiding comparisons to the original  for coop top down shooters hammerwatch or helldivers are just better games in general  for tower defense with a hero system sanctum 1 and 2 are unmatched

what this could have had going for it was strategic decision making around door opening like the original  but its foregone all of the careful roompowering defensebuilding wavetriggering behavior of its predecessor  waves trigger whenever and with the new health pack system youre no longer forced to weigh spur of the moment trades of resources for temporary survival

additionally the heroes are just boring to me  i dont mind being given a janitor hero as your first but the badass female space marine just feels like a trope and none of their abilities were really interesting  there is good voice acting and animation but the writing feels like its weakly satirizing hero archetypes instead of creating unique characters i miss the characterization of the original  the lowres pixel art and sparse mysterious dialogue was more engaging because it was a dripfeed reward for completing levels and let your imagination do most of the work  maybe characterization gets better further in but im not enjoying it enough to find out

while i wanted to like this game i dont see the core gameplay loop being improved to a point where id ever recommend buying this over other options  i hope they make a more worthy successor in the future because i loved the original  i refunded this and then had a great time playing the original for a night  like the liveaction netflix cowboy bebop this piece of media is best used as a reminder of how good the original was

#####

this would be a sideways thumb if steam allowed it but since its such a huge dissapointment i go with a negative
first the art direction i awful the first dungeon of the endless was amazing in that regard with an eery mysterios undertone and some gallows humor the charackter design was topnoch
now we have a space western theme instead which would still be ok but the whole slapstick humor they slapped on it is the worst the first charackter you unlock is a literal janitor which again would be ok but they made it way to silly he has pink cleaning cloves and runs around with a mop on top of that his special attacks are also mopbased come on

the gameplay also has huge problems no longer do you have the tactical view instead you control a single charackter diablostyle  your aicompanion  can be ordered to hold a room but you never know if they let any stragglers through so your crystal gets attacked without warning it was clearly meant to played as coop but it doesnt give anyone reason to team up since only they host saved his progression your mates wont earn anything and wont be shown any dialoge or cutscenes

overall im just dissapointed this long awaited sequel falls so short of the orginal

#####

this is not a dungeon of the endless remake its a totally different game that takes elements from dote and remix them differently
so if thats what your looking for you might be disappointed
im a big fan of the original and i love this one too even if thats a totally different gaming experience
also consider playing it solo for the first 20 hours and go multi when youve already unlock most things


#####

according to global steam achievements im the first and only player at the time of this review to beat this game with starter weapons only and without upgrading any turrets along with completion of all quests achieved solo on 3 player difficulty so i have a solid grasp on this games feel and balance the performance is smooth with only a single crash on startup the character design and music give me constant risk of rain 2 vibes which i enjoy theres enough playable characters enemy variety weapons and quests to sink 20 hours into tho it can be a bit dull and boring at times killing mobs off screen due to the camera not panning far enough or because of walls and the radar blocking the view

theres 3 different ways of playstyle to finish a run as there are 3 resource types including food industry and science food for leveling your character industry for placing down turrets and science for researching new or upgraded turretsbuffing towers all of these resources can be used at a certain vendor too for weapons and a single upgrade each stage

1 build only food generators maxing out your characters stats to become completely unkillable im talking 80 damage reduction 3 hp regen a second and a taunting aura or 200 damage and 50 fire rate bonus while saving 300400 industry to spam turrets on the later levels without a care in the world my personal favorite and the strongest playstyle

2 play a balance of all 3 resources pushing through at a moderate pace getting all 3 characters to levels 4 or 5 while having 2 level 3 turrets and a couple of buffing towers having possibly a struggle on stage 3 and a hard time on stage 4 as turrets in this game lack the dps to hold off on their own for even a short while  

3 build mostly all industry putting down turrets every level feeling weak the entire time and go through an endurance run till you get 1 shot lol this is how the 3 coop random matches i played went as people bought bad weapons from vendors they didnt need while lacking levels to the dps characters

all in all i think its a neat little top down rouge like tower defense and twin stick shooter my only real tweaks id like to see is a buff to single target weapons because they absolutely lack the dps to clear anything even when its a legendary weapon also a change to turret stats since it feels wrong that 8 level 3 buffed turrets cant even hold off a single spawner on their own when its the correct damage type to the enemy mob

#####

i do not enjoy this game as much as i thought i would weirdly enough i loved the first game from 2014 and played it for multiple runs while playing this one i got bored after a couple of runs 

my applause for the well done animations and nice graphics but the top down action style gameplay has robbed this game of its soul the gameplay just doesnt feel right there is so much happening on the screen i sometimes lose my character in the chaos the ui doesnt help this problem since sometimes it just blends into the background and its hard to look at what you want

when you buy something from the vendor during a run sometimes the weapons drop so close to him that you either waste time to position your character in such a way you can pick it up or you just give up on that weapon and take a lost to your resources this clearly hasnt been tested thoroughly

i hate the so called main character that is a janitor wish you could change the character you move around in the hub area i have not seen an option for that if there is such a thing then the ui is worse than i thought and i didnt see it

wish i could refund this but i got sleepy at some point and left the game running just buy the older game from 2014 you will have more fun with that

#####

edit  more  more updates coming allowing you to unlock characters progress and achievments even as client  great now if they could fix the rampant graphical bugs i could actually recommend the game

3 instead of 4 player coop not being able to unlock and upgrade if youre not host wth is this  graphical bugs gallore and different indications for bosses between hosts and clients balance issues for most or all characters and their progression in multiplayer is limited if youre not host
 probably tried to slowdown carrying but fucked over everyone else

#####

friends and i enjoyed the game when it first came out but i am not sure if the game is receiving proper dev support

there appears to be an easily reproducible bug where the nonhost player is unable to move after getting hit by an explosiveacid barrel  it happened to me twice within 15 minutes of playing so we decided to play something else  i checked the forums and it looks like people reported this bug back in jan 2024 and its still not fixed

#####

i can only assume the publishers or higherups forced the developers to release this game earlier than intended 

cutting corners and butchering multiplayer in a game focused on multiplayer is asking for trouble

its unfortunate to see i was enjoying the game for a couple of hours and then it hit us progress was not tracking correctly and quests were not completed accurately for host and guests

this game doesnt deserve mixed reviews but i cant recommend this game until the developers fix the issues and according to the latest post it could take a couple of weeks i got excited to see this game wasnt early access but they just failed to enable that taganother game ruined by deadlines and corporate mismanagement

#####

in all honesty this game was a disappointment 

the bones of a good game are clearly there and amplitude has demonstrated the ability to make well written and atmospheric games but they havent quite managed it here 

gameplay is both too simple and too easy and the solution of nerfing effective strategies and characters into the ground is not one that improves the experience 

the art design is very nice with the characters and environments all looking great and the music is absolutely fantastic good music can enhance a mediocre game but even one of the best soundtracks released in recent times could not make this enjoyable for more than a few short hours in its current state

it could be saved so id recommend checking back in a year or two and see whats been done

#####

i really want to like this game but there are so many issues with it

multiplayer progression is not working several collision glitches bosses softlock transitions between floors can crash the game losing all progress

the title is misleading the dungeon is not endless it is only 4 floors 

each run feels the same not much customization no incentive to keep playing other than upgrading heroes which you can only really do efficiently in solo
the end of game cutscenes should all be skippable not just the last one
once the saloon is fully upgraded there is no way to dump the screws currency into anything meaningful the kiosk is the only way but still overflowing with screws


#####

so game was all good and fun but today devs decided theyll nerf all weapons and almost all character to their graves while buffing turret by a mere 10

thats not the way to go devs buff your turrets rise a bit the difficulty buffing ennemies while nerfing player just make an aweful gap

as a 3 player lobby not random matchmaking game was doable i dont even imagine for solo player with all the nerfs adding the brainless ai which in solo can just follow you or stop where they are not even repair turrets not even protect the crystal while its on the move 

game isnt worth it with the latest nerf patch

#####

its okaybad and i wouldnt currently recommend it 

the enemies feel spongey and it doesnt feel like you have that much impact in your levellingweapon choices at least so far i actually disagree with the other reviewers in regards to the team ai i think the ai itself is finegood plop them down in a choke or an area where the enemy will path to and they feel like they do well the part that i dislike is the ui related to their interactions having an action cog style menu where you have to hold down to give orders feels really bad especially when your attention is split between that and looking at map

honestly it feels like a less polished less fun synthetik mixed with a tower defense game the meta elements seem like theyre trying to be hadeslike which is good but the game lacks the voice acting or interesting characters that hades has my initial take is that there are balancing issues in the characters themselves shroomie downright feels useless outside of completing niche character quests theres no point in having a healer when the enemy is rushing after objectives and only engaging you when youre in the way in addition having primary stats which get stronger when you level is essentially fine but when your characters have bad primaries such as wits then it essentially feels like theres no point in taking levelups for them and instead pushing them towards the people that can carry the game zed

 the game itself doesnt feel like it knows what it wants to be unsure if it wants to be an action roguelike or a tower defense game i do enjoy the pushpull between engineeringfoodscience and think that its a good design choice but feel like so many other elements are lacking and because of that would not currently recommend it as it stands i would rate this a meh and hope that it gets updates but at release i would not buy it again in its current iteration

#####

game is fun af overall difficulty could be a bit harder and a larger pool of bossesheroes to play as but overall game is very fun and worth the 3999 price tag cdn 810

#####

pretty great could use more character though horatio also being able to re read text logs that you find in the station back at the saloon would be nice

#####

the games coop features antiquated tech from years ago that doesnt allow players to progress their missions if they have joined a friends lobby therefore making coop a detriment to the game rather than a plus

other than these issues and a couple bugs here and there the game plays very nicely and i love the series but there is no excuse for the coop to be such a bad experience if you are not host you basically play as a side character

#####

i was surprised to finish a roguelike so quickly without any real unlocks to anything upon completion and when you finish it once there aint no incentive to really play again other than to just hang with friends nothing changes you just grind a higher difficulty and enable drinks to change some modifiers but the game remains the same for the most part gun upgrades are overall pretty boring and most dont do much all the districts are for the most part the same tileset a different paintjob and characterstheir quests aint nearly interesting enough beyond just getting their chipslot upgrade real quick 

the combat is also very simple majority of enemies being zerg hordes walking in a simple predictable conga line with different flavors of resistancesweaknesses and they also dont really deviate from the conga line save for some attacking a turretgeneratoryou which is pretty snoozy from a character defending this hallway in a holding one button sort of way because nothing is happening sort of way which you know fine it is a tower defense game and you cant defend all paths at the same time right weeeeeell the tower defense part is also super annoying you can only plop them down on certain nodes but their firing range is so limited that setting them up to cover eachother or to actually hit the enemies can be annoying in of itself unless you say heck it to the short range turrets throw em in the bin and just opt for the long range ones honestly it sometimes feel that if you dont get your hands on a taunt turret via rng research your run might just as well be over most of the time because of how bad the turrets are at covering paths due to the limited rangebad node placement and rng of big rooms unless you overspend in industryon the flip side the taunt turret is also hilariously op if you have a high wit character on your team to a point where you sometimes wont have to spend industry on any other turret save the heal one

theres also some annoying bugs at the moment that break the game like the core bot getting its pathing stuck against a wall same goes for some monsters just finding themselves stuck in walls or wall objects the bug boss and its damage cone not showing up for coop partners is pretty bad too or the fact that it goes through the cover you can hide behind sometimes theres probably more i havent encountered yet as well judging from what others have said but i imagine all of that will be fixed in time anyway

now that i have blabbered mehs and negatives in a big block of text heres some brief mention of things i actually enjoyed
the artstyle is great and carry its own charm the music is also pretty good

in summary a very finite out of ten endless experience for me

#####

its a shame really art direction and soundtrack are really cool but gameplay loop is ultimately hollow theres not a lot of variety in the run and gun combat genuinely just point and hold  and occasionally whack a tower to repair it the package just isnt good enough yet and the lack of shared progress for coop thats a joke isnt it 2023 why havent we evolved past this

#####

just not as clean as the first game firstly solo is rough because the computer player doesnt really do what they need to and the game is a twin stick shooter now so you need everyone to be doing their micro you cant just macro the npc somewhere

then if you do multiplayer instead the game is just not set up well for it you have to leave lobby and load in to your own multiplayer to do your upgrades and quests not to mention only the host gets to unlock the new characters if you want them youll have to start your own lobby and make the same progress over again even though youve already done it

spawners are placed in random rooms around the map instead of just being unpowered rooms or new rooms you open the problem here is that because its now a tss it feels like a lot of power was taken from the turrets and put in to the heroes so its difficult to make defenses strong enough to hold a side without you having to go reinforce it so every wave things are coming every direction and most of the time you just end up standing in the crystal room holding down lclick and letting autoaim do its thing not to mention if you re playing singleplayer this is pretty much your only option anyways

it suffers through a lot more issues that i will not rant on about but will mention some of them quickly

after using a skill sometimes cant attack for a while especially with the barkeep
boss attack indicators disappear sometimes after being revived
the shooting has a lot of aimassist leaving it less satisfying and with less control
its easy to get chipped down by ranged attacks you cant possibly see because of all the on screen effects which on one hand does matter because you dont heal fully between waves but on the other hand doesnt matter at all because reviving is both free and nearly instant 
same interaction button input for everything mixed with a janky interation box on them makes it so often times there is a turret slot a momento or an item in similar spots and you just cant interact with the one you want 
unclear ability descriptors such as efficiency which many hereos and their abilities scale off of but from everything i could find from people discussing the term could mean anything from power cooldown reduction attack speed health attack damage etc for different skills on every character without any known ryhme or reason
the melee shove feels sloppy there are many things that increase its damage even though it still doesnt hurt at at all on top of which it seems to swing from where you input the command at and not where you are or where the animation is when it goes off making it feel disconnected if you are moving at all when using it 

there are plenty more but this review is getting long enough as is
   ultimately i think it tried to turn in to a tss and tower defense and failed to do either 

if it helps at all this review may be a little biased as my friends and i just really enjoyed dote and were really looking forward to this one 

maybe its okay on its own i dont think its nearly worth 30

it just doesnt have nearly the depth strategy or cleanliness of the original game

#####

i just dont know why id play it when so many other far better more enjoyable games exist you know like dungeon of the endless not to mention the bugs that plague this game two of which have ruined a perfectly good run 30 minutes in by softlocking me
it feels like an early access title 
if you want a 3d top down roguelike with actual depth play ravenswatch or something similar not this and especially not for 30 dollars i hope this game improves over the next several years as i was really looking forward to it

#####

codewritten by hidden gems review  httpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator38624426 follow me code

endless dungeon is a tower defense roguelite game but the game focus mostly on the features of a strategytactical gameplay

this game remember me starship troopers you allways have to hold the line againts the incoming waves of monsters  and protect the little robot for doing his own stuff

a very challenging game with 4 difficulties which even with the most easy you can get defeated at least if you want play solo because there is too much ground for cover so this game its definetively builded for coop which you will get a lot of more fun than playing solo

on the field you can set a lot of turrets of diferent types which will be better one type or another depending of the type of incoming monsters playing with the elemental roles

normally roguelites cost way less but this game isnt focused on that just some upgrades on the characters and weapons where i see the why cost bigger its in the graphics and design of the game with so many strategies you can apply because this is not the typical roguelite game its way more deep than that

#####

very fun and satisfying topdown shooter mixed with tower defense i have only played solo and have enjoyed myself quite a bit my favorite aspects are the visual design and well executed horde slaying tower defense action playing solo there is an aspect of micromanagement akin to an rts that may not be fun for all but i actually find enjoyable the loop of finishing hero quests and unlocking new things is great but i quickly ran out of things to spend scrap on the weapon upgrades feel like an afterthought and bot ai is questionable at times despite some flaws i can heartily recommend this game i just hope they add some more complexity and variety with futures updates

#####

essentially this game is a demakeregression of its spiritual successor dungeon of the endless many of the aspects that made the tactical gameplay excellent is either partially or completely removed what was added bosses twinstick shooting meta progression moving the crystal split maps is poorly implemented or just makes the game worse the game is too short and the difficulty is lacking as well

the game doesnt function particularly well in either solo or mp either in solo you have very limited control of the bots lacking even the ability to send them to separate rooms so you end up wasting a lot of time moving them around manually for what was a simple feature in the first game for mp you cannot play with 2 players  1 bot like in the previous game making 3 players somewhat mandatory the game doesnt have text chat or vcc commands functionality to make playing with randoms comfortable either
  
cannot recommend if you think this game looks interesting play dungeon of the endless instead

#####

negative review until coop progression is fixed

#####

this game has to be the most boring roguelike i have played upgrades weapons and quest are all extremely lack luster i never got anything that made it feel like this is the run i wish i hadnt played over 2 hours so i could refund it

#####

great tower defence stick shooter where you can play the game either entirely tower defence stick shooter or married together in harmony very different to dungeon of the endless however so if you were looking for the same game this isnt quite it but my friends and i prefer this gameplay to dungeon of the endless

#####

overall i think the game is pretty janky and rough around the edges theres a lot of room for improvement here but i am having a lot of fun playing this game despite this 

the good
the core loop is unique and satisfying i havent played another game that blends this mix of twinstick shooting and tower defense it was a bit of a learning curve initially understanding how important turrets were you cant just shoot your way through things but the core loop of exploration finding enemy spawns placing turrets defending escorting was great 

i like the cast of characters there are cool designs and abilities the art in the game is also great i love the 2d character art especially 

room for improvement
the game feels kinda janky in general we need a separate button for turret interactions vs everything many times ive accidentally built turrets instead of interacting with something right next to it aiming feels kinda weird even with aim assist turned off sometimes i cant tell that im hitting an enemy or not 

i think the ui needs to be revamped a bit its really awkward looking at the top left of the screen to get important info like your cooldowns would prefer to have your health at the bottom middle and also have vfx that trigger whenever your q and r abilities come off cooldown that are centred around your character to minimise the amount of looking around the screen you have to do 

one of the things about roguelikes that makes them interesting is the potential for huge variety in your gameplay experience per run unfortunately i dont think endless dungeon delivers on this the upgrades you can get over the course of a run mostly amount to stat increases i think this game needs a lot more variety in weapons and perks to facilitate this at the moment most runs feel very samey and late game you arent really doing anything drastically different to what you were doing at the start of the run youre just strongerbetter at doing it the biggest variety comes from character choice which only happens once at the beginning of your run

the solo experience could use some looking into i like being able to swap between your two characters is great i would love being able to have more commands for your ai companion rather than just stay and follow like defend the crystal bot would be a great one

bottom line if you are a fan of these genres twinstick youll probably get some enjoyment out of this but dont expect anything mindblowing

#####

i love the endless series
i hate endless dungeon

too shallow to be an interesting tower defense game too bland for a frenetic twin stick shooter too smarmy for endearing scifi characters and not funny enough to justify the many many attempts at comedy nothing about endless dungeon actually works 

endless legend endless space and dungeon of the endless were flawed games that were elevated by a suite of dlc to add depth and right some starting wrongs

i do not believe endless dungeon is salvageable

edit i have now learned that the game opens a window in your browser for an exit survey after being uninstalled on steam what the fuck is this shit amplitude that is scumbaggery that will lead to me never purchasing another one of your products

#####

this game is coop only until they can make a competent ai partner its incredibly disingenuous to sell endless dungeon as a full finished game at a full finished game price while having such a blatantly nonfunctional key feature its a teambased tower defense game if you are playing solo due to the nonfunctional ai you do not have a team 

ive been playing the real game for under a half hour and have been in combat for less than 20 minutes if i took a screenshot every time the ai partner was sitting absolutely still while monsters were attacking towers or the crystal less than a quarter screen away from it id have 10 screenshots by now itd almost be hilarious if it werent the core gameplay

#####

just fun for first hour and all of the content will be keep on repeat it just a bored game even playing with friends

#####

hella satisfying basically no content though

#####

some of the worst presentation  execution issues ive seen in a game

there are idozensi of these issues ranging from minor irritation to game breaking that plague ieveryi moment of the both the game itself and the developer communications around the game

to list a few
 the coop progress doesnt work the way the prelaunch faq described it notice that im not referring to how bad it is but just that it iisnt what was describedi
 the gameplay is essentially strategizing around very specific tower defense mechanics but the mechanics are either not explained explained iincorrectlyi or explained so vaguely as to be actively unhelpful how waves work what triggers them how the bot moves how upgrades work how a turret gets exp or even that a turret gets exp at all how repairs work iwhether your character can use a gun youre about to buyi how the mobs will move and behave etc
 i had frequent issues with the menus in coop if i hit esc to open my settings it would blur the game in the background which is totally normal but then if my coop partner attempted to start a run i would then lose the ability to interact with or close the settings menu as id start iinteracting with the character selection screen that was blurred in the backgroundi i had the same issue with tutorials being triggered by my coop partner weirdly overlapping my own which would then cause me to buy the wrong turrent or otherwise interact with world incorrectly while navigating both tutorials at the same time
 the game has voice lines that do not match the dialog being shown on the screen for example a character might say im worried about thing because of lore but a voice line such as ahh im nervous and i dont know what to do would be played from a small selection for that character this design decision is binsaneb its so utterly and immediately disorienting to read one sentence while another vaguely related sentence is being spoken all exposition in the game involves experiencing this 78 times in a row unless you immediately turn off voices as i did

i really dont want to spend any more time thinking about this to call this early access would be generous it is absolutely not ready to be a product anyone pays for there are a lot of ireallyi great ideas here but the execution is unbelievably poor maybe take a look at this in 6 months

#####

this could be great with a group of friends its a multiplayer game where youre forced to play multiple characters at the same time if there arent enough other players available i cannot recommend it for solo players despite the low graphics requirements it still runs my computer hot

#####

the game is ok seems to be focused more on coop then single player but theyre trying to turn this into some bs live service crap with twitch drops for cosmetics and probably timed events so if youre looking for a chill game look elsewhere

#####

in my opinion this game is lackluster for a roguelite meta progression is dull with the very few upgrades available being of little to no help the majority of the weapons are completely worthless and unless i get lucky and pick up one of the more powerful weapons i tend to stick with the starter weapons the gameplay loop itself involves you exploring a map by opening doors and finding an objective you then have to escort a very mindless robot to the objective yes escorting in a game  the worst part of any game and its a bloody core mechanic in this game if you intend to play alone definitely pass on this title as the ai is worthless if you have a friend or two it might be okay though i think you can have a better experience with other titles

there are some really odd design choices such as the music being programmed to mute sound effects when it creciendos like it is the most important thing to be able to hear its obnoxious

price wise they want 2499 for this game i think that is far too expensive for what you get ive gotten to the point where it has started to become samey and boring already and im only 5 hours in i find myself losing interest after the first map and find myself ending my run out of sheer boredom the majority of the time runs go on for far too long for the type of game play it is 

my advice would be to save your money and buy other roguelites  there are some really amazing ones out there and the majority of them arent overpriced like this bland entry it does a very poor job of scratching that roguelite itch i wish i had gone with my gut and passed on this one rather than listening to the very generous review scores that this game totally doesnt deserve

#####

the price is not worth the very little content

#####

this game was enjoyable at first but as i kept playing it felt more mindless than anything

i bought the first game and enjoyed the tactical depth of that way more i wish more elements of the first were brought into this one

#####

apparently only the host gets progress in coop unacceptable and very disappointing

#####

a fun mashup of genres but gets repetitive way to soon wouldve liked more variety in weapons turrets and missions it would also really benefit from a local coop function i think the game is really elevated by the 2 player experience and currently as a solo player the ai is to dumb to substitute a friendbenefit from a good team layout would like a local coop option as i currently wouldnt recommend a friend to buy this i also dont get why it wasnt there in the first place its the perfect couch coop game 90 of the time youre in the same rooms and you can split to split screen if one player walks off screen otherwise make an option to disable the split screen if you think some people wouldnt like it

#####

never played the first one but it is satisifying as a tower defense and roguelite

#####

its  fine its lacking some depth and replay ability on the harder difficulties the enemies just become bullet sponges like its ok but id wait for more content

#####

what a letdown

my friends and i have logged dozens of hours into dungeon of the endless a game with so much personality strategy and interesting gameplay ideas we have been looking forward to endless dungeon for literally years

the problem starts with the characters longgone are the chainsmoking rakya who fills the room with poison the hoverchair bound warden mormish who is likely an imposter the roommeltingbutneedstobealone mizi tons of characters all with unique backstories and interactions with the other characters and funny quips
the only character i liked was comrade back in the beta he was so overthetop so passionate so socialjusticey that he looped all the way back around to being awesome and i finally unlocked him in the full release and his voice lines have been changed so he now sounds like genericangstydude

i truly dont know how you fucked this up so badly amplitude i cant imagine anybody champing at the bit to play as wuss with a mop or giantpolicerobot lady

the gameplay is pretty ok the guns are fine the dialogue is awful how dare you ruin comrade he was legitimately hilarious even if i got the feeling amplitude wasnt in on the joke

#####

by itself a mediocre game as a successor to dungeon of the endless terrible

#####

i wish support for this game was endless but it lasted like 2 months d

#####

very fun game has some kinks that need polishing but the game is a hell of a lot of fun super addictive

#####

this game does not deserve a mixed rating

judging by other reviews people did not like that this game is different when compared to dungeon of the endless 

i have not played the first game so if you are like me you are very likely to enjoy this game

its a fun tower defense  roguelite  hero class hybrid

game is perfectly fine as solo too

#####

on a discount it might be worth it but right now i wouldnt recommend it 

i think the concept is nice and it works but it lacks any depth to it there is just not enough variety for a roguelite like this to succeed in the long term the weapons are too few and too similar almost all hero powers lack any impact in just 10 hours i have already reached the end and seen everything the game has to offer

#####

just feels boring recommend dungeon of the endless over this

#####

games in 2023 dont support cloud saves

#####

great for multiplayer with friend group for about 10 hours 810
i wouldnt recommend for solo players or anybody looking to get more than 10 hours for this price

ps dont buy it for twinstick shooter element alone its barebones

h1gameplaybalanceh1
its a mix between twinstick shooter and towerdefense with heavy focus on resource managment 
this combination fun for about 10 hours due to limited replayability turning things stale

bit plays like a realtime strategy gameb 
your shooting is like 30 of damage required to defend a point is and often times you need to defend multiple both of those elements are fairly weak individually its the strategy that brings it up the gameplay of this game is figuring out how to defend a location which involves strategic turret and character placement using the least resources

breplayability issuuesb
btldrb action shooting doesnt matter enough to be engaging turrets dont have enough nuance to be stimulating as a strategy game little to no variety across runs
list
 player shots have heavy autoaim and the game is balanced around your aim not mattering which limits how much your conscious involvement in battle actually matters 
 in most character you are a glorified turret and a turret buffer except some characters lean into 1 side more than other dont get me wrong utility skills like healing turret buffing turret setup matter and make characters feel different but in battle they play mostly the same
 turrets are horrendously balanced acid spitter is the best against everything you might need a long range light turret purely to remove invulnerability from 1 enemy type not race  type
  list
      there are longer and shorter ranged turrets of the same element shorter range sometimes not always have more aoe but they can take out roughly 1 miniwave before getting killed
      theres a concept of elemental weaknesses but for exploiting those means using shorter range turrets and shorter range turrets live just as long as the infinite range acid spitter
      almost all turrets not acid spitter can be attacked from just outside of range so if youre not there to babysit them they can die before even dealing damage
  list
 turrets dont offer any nuance even if they were better balanced you get a limited amount of turrets getting 1 and upgrading it is always better than having 2 1 for short range 1 for long range there are no upgrades that change turret behavior you will always pick 1 turret type to use against enemy type and that choice can only be limited a little by rng and not by difficulty of choice
 metaprogression is a mostly linear grindfest 
  list 
     i never had to think which upgrade to get because theres 12 builds for each one and upgrades that dont fall into 1 of those are just useless also these upgrades enable playstyles rather than upgrading them
     weapon upgrades a large chunk of meta progression are specific to the weapon which you have a chance to get in a run ie each weapon upgrade gets you a chance to be stronger if you find it
  list
 in run upgrades are mostly boring stat boosts that change nothing about how you play
list





h1why not soloh1
first thing you have to understand is this game is difficult and not winnable with a single character and it is also not winnable by placing turrets to fight for you you have to manage multiple characters beforeduring defense waves and you have to repair turrets in battle to keep them alive and shooting

you can play solo but youll be at a massive disadvantage 
list
 you cannot tell an ai character to go defend a location without actually going to that location yourself ill spare you the details but if you need to do it combat  you lose
 you cannot tell ai to defend the mining bot as it moves if it dies you lose
 ai is stupid ai can follow you or when told to wait its basically another turret it cannot kite enemies it can back away until it eventually corners itself repairupgrade turrets or adapt to enemies with frontal shields that block frontal damage compensating for this will require you to be a significantly better player
list


h1uih1
some ui is so good i never realized it was there and some makes so little sense you might keep a notepad while playing
for exampleall of these are part of 1 big problem 
list
 you can only see character information stats abilities and such in character selection menu when starting a run you cannot access this menu while waiting for players to join in multiplayer
 2 of the stations in the hub tell you about stuff unlockable by quests and 2 other stations tell you quest objectives there are actually 2 more uis that shows you a character that has quests without saying what the quest is or what you get out of it
 to see what abilities do you have to hover over a character icon without clicking to select because that hides the buttuon and then click show details on character splash screen if you hover your mouse over another character that character even if its locked gets selected instead
problem check out the following screenshot httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3054888043
exact same design mistake is made in another ui
 2 out or 3 starting characters has wit stat as an upgrade there are no tooltips that explain what it does and i couldnt find a help option to learn about stats i had to google it
 tooltips for weapons on the ground highlight the fact its not for your character instead of saying which character its for
 telling ai companion to wait involves using a slow and errorprone radial menu
list

h1conclusionh1
i can only recommend it to people with stable groups to play with solo experience is miserable playing with randoms is an option but its a hit or miss and if you want complete the game itll be more of a miss

because i can only recommend it to a tiny subset of all players its a very firm no until those issues get resolved

#####

one note real time combat walking backwards simulator watered down strategy watered down 4x mechanics watered down rpg mechanics and generic borderlandswannabe cartoon art style instead of the grimdark we want also the lack of diverse items is lame the roguelite elements are all currency based which in theory smooths progression but in practice is dull and grindy adding medkits instead of just eating food is unnecessary and clunky absolutely terrible to play solo because ai is by default awful waves spawn randomly instead of on door open so you cant fucking pause the game or think out progression progress in coop still doesnt carry over to single player fullynone of the hero quests ive completed in coop have applied

good things are the elemental system adds some new depth and the teleport to crystal is nice

mixed no crystal running updated graphics hero quests are interesting but locking access to roguelite elements behind them is stupid

to devs double down on the strategy and resource management the real time elements are not fun get rid of the random waves and trigger them off doors fire your art directortheres a massive mismatch with the audience for these types of games

#####

unless the game specifically closes through the option in the main menu your entire save will be wiped
love losing hours of progress each time the game crashes

#####

bias as i loved dungeon of the endless
it is action based dote which is great explore room by room gather resources and build your defenses without going overboard so you can carry materials to the next floor

#####

people were having fun but dont worry they patched it out


after giving it some thought ive decided to try and piece together why this happened my best guess is that they do not play their own game there is a reason why you can ignore turrets and just use heroes that reason isnt omg heroes op the reason is that beyond a certain point turrets lose a lot of effectiveness and players end up having to do most of the work anyways at that point why build a turret youre just going to have to kill the enemies yourself anyways blurs bypass turrets in a few ways and the others have units that can pose similar problems for turrets beyond the very beginning of the game turrets just get less effective if you want people to use turrets more that is what you should be fixing

tldr unnerf the heroes and fix the actual problemturrets just lose effectiveness against enemy types present later in the game

#####

why you should probably not buy this game

1 lack of quality of life functions in coop progression for others is not shared in the same lobby this means that if you want to mod your favorite weapons or progress your story beats then your friend has to go back to solo or host himself to see that progression

2 gunplay is lacking the only shop i believe that can not be refreshed because then you would have the answer to any wave i guess some guns feel impactful but the top down perspective is rough on aiming these long cd big dmg guns

3 abilities are lacking in a world where every game has abilities that modify how the game is played the abilities presented in this game besides sweepers slows are low impact  dont last long and fairly long cds depending on what cell mods you purchase

all of this comes together for a frustrating experience that while enjoyable with friends doesnt make it easy to recommend

#####

i think the game isnt bad but steam doesnt allow an for an indifferent option so had to choose negative

this game is very static i think the rougelite should be removed from their description because rougelikelites are repayable and i cant see people coming back to play more in its current state

 heroes chips and in dungeon levelling seem to use the same pool of upgrades and there are no alternative abilities or options or loadouts of heroes to make them interesting why are there no options for bonuses to weapon categories for gatling guns pistols or change the way an ability works etc for example why cant i choose something that turns shroom into dot poison and looses ability to heal etc

 weapons weapon types are locked to heroes which is understandable and fine but there isnt much variety or choices offered heroes also dont really benefit from using 1 type over another either basically all weapons feel the same even though some look different

 progression everything feels pointless after unlocks you can only use scraps to buy 1 chest for a new run but whats the drive for doing another run in the first place ive unlocked the heroes and fully levelled a few ive unlocked the weapons but ive still only gone passed the first boss i kind of dont feel a need to play anymore and i havent got to the end yet because ive pretty much hit the wall in progression and again everything is static which isnt what rougeliteslike strive for because the game is meant to be fun and different each time

 gameplay why would i invest in a turret that cant defend the whole room like the original while also knowing the crystal bot is going to move to a new location making that turret absolutely pointless in most situations in dote the path wouldnt change for the run at the end so most turret choices were still strategical and you were building up to that final run this game is more about just upgrading heroes and using them like movable turrets instead theres nothing interesting in chests after youve found most of the cores etc so there is just a few scraps or sometimes a weapon that you dont want the merchant cant be sold to to offset those disappointing chest drops and most of the time theres also nothing worth buying and it all feels like the same experience everytime same few weapons same 5 to something chip same 10 damage from upgrading your heroes etc

bosses for the most part feel like a chore they arent fun and engaging and also further bolster the feeling that tower defence is pretty much non existent in this game and you should focus on levelling heroes over all

heroes dont die so you also cant find other heroes along the way which was a key element of dote which again enforces a static unmoving unchanging gameplay loop here my advice would be to follow risk of rain in terms of being able to change how characters work through items etc which would somewhat simulate the originals experience of finding new characters

i think the dev team needs to go play dote play some td games and play some rougelites like risk of rain 2 or something as thats a masterclass in how to do things right from an action perspective but also character and run progression there is literally no risk reward in this game

#####

dont bother its fun with friends but so is everything else simplistic no coop progression boring guns most turrets suck and the final stage of every run doesnt let you get more resources

just so unfun from every angle i play it with my friends because i like playing games with my friends and theres nothing else out not because i like playing this game

#####

gonna preface this with the fact that i played a ton of the first dungeon of the endless game

this game has too many issues its not worth buying in its current state 
on top of not delivering a good base game experience its got a bunch of quality of life missing that makes it feels like it was a rushed uncompleted release  

all of the characters have the same game play loop hold left click and wait for the enemies to die 
the upgrades you get during a run or after for that matter do not feel impactful you have nothing to look forward to on completing runs other than hoping a new character feels better it doesnt all of your weapons feel the same 

this game will need a massive overhaul to save it on top of plenty of quality of life changes

#####

im actually sad for this game i was really hyped when the game went into beta and i tested it it seemed fun however now that the full version has launched i find myself disliking the end product when you start the game its way too hard after a couple runs it gets way too easy thanks to its progression it does not seem rewarding at all just a lack of balance that throws off the game secondly its replayability is lacking thanks to almost no enemy variation not many guns in the game and the mapping seems way too linear for a roguelike no secret rooms no secret levels overall the games lack of content is similar to that of a game in a closed beta and the updates to the game are too slow to actually matter not much content added since launch

i wish i could recommend this game

#####

i liked the idea of the game i loved the original i thought more of what made the first game great would be available in the game but it isnt

in the original one of the monsters could open doors and make enemy waves start spawning far worse than what they are and made it so you didnt get resources for opening them

this does not instead that same kind of monster would just roll off and spawn monsters but not make things feel more threatening as enemies start enclosing you from all sides forcing you on what you have to protect and what you have to give up upon without that feeling of frantic worry choices feel like they dont matter

in the original characters all had their unique weapons and fighting play styles some had aoe some had melee fighting styles some had mid range long range healers and skills that felt like they mattered

this does not most weapons feel like they are useless and if you do not manage to get lucky on a weapon drop you will not succeed

turrets felt like they mattered in the first game placement what they were capable of what the resources meant and what you should prioritise

this does not while turrets help they are mostly a thing used in boss encounters which added a fun little depth to it when you didnt expect it but the bosses feel very basic and not so thought out

in the original levelling heroes gave them perks immediately this you have to purchase them from an array of upgrades that quite frequently dont feel like they actually make you stronger in any way

no matter what element i look at in the game the weaponsmost suck the turrets helpful but dont make me feel like they change the game in anyway whatsoever hero customisation not worth it and so many feel pointless to their abilities monsters and their ai nothing feels as polished as the original and it feels like this game was pushed out far too soon without proper thought into adapting what made the original so good into a more 3d playscape like this one has

you spend more time shooting things off screen by aid of your map than you do actually seeing them i wanted to love the game since i loved the original i beat the game but i do not feel satisfied with what it delivered for what i spent on the game i would recommend waiting for an 80 off sale as right now it just isnt a good game

#####

it was a tough choice deciding whether to give this game a thumbs up or down i wish there was a neutral or meh option

in short tldr the game is wildly overpriced and not fun for solo players
if you dont care about money and have two friends to play with then it is probably something youll enjoy

i think having the endless name has given the devs the courage to charge over double what it should be asking for
there just is not a lot of game here
the visuals are nice and the environments are gorgeous and have a fairly unique artstyle but everything else is just passable
each of the enemy faction types only have a couple of different enemies there are barely a handful of towers the story is conveyed via a half dozen comic pages and the dialogue is short quirky and an attempt at humour that throws any sort of immersion right out of the window

the collectables are also quite a let down

solo players have a rough time for multiple reasons with some being fun crushing

everything takes longer and backtracking is significantly increased for several activities
turrets are quite weak and you are at the mercy of rng when it comes to the amount of turret spots you can place in essential rooms
the final zone also actively destroys all of your turrets which is completely miserable for a solo player

overall the game needs a lot more cooking before it has enough content to even come close to justifying the price and it needs work to make it fun for solo players
after playing for a few hours i just dont have any drive to boot it up and do another run and therefor i regret purchasing the game based on amplitude hype

#####

played the beta was super excited for the full game i thought the basics looked interesting but the additional unlocks and characters would easily add additional depth the bosses further down would get harder because obviously the starter bosses would be easier and kinda simple the upgrades would add real power and there would be more interesting guns and characters to play

the beta was basically the full game the character level ups are superficial and uninteresting at best the handful of guns were so boring and so similar two types large and small two elemental flavors aoe and single target the characters really had zero interesting upgrades and the unlockable characters are so similar in game play that there is no reason to even grind for more characters there are no fun wacky combos no real interesting choices i really dont know how any of their alpha testers managed to play this game dayonend and not hate themselves this game feels like its an early alpha proofofconcept for a future game to be released not a 30 fully released game this was my first foray into the endless series and i am severely disappointed i regret buying this game and regret not trusting my experience after the first run because i cant refund it at 21 hours

#####

i want to be very clear that i dont think this is a bad game i just cannot recommend it to people there is something off about the gameplay that just makes the core loop feel much less satisfying than i had anticipated this was one of my most anticipated games of the year and i cant help but be a bit dissapointed in it i cant necessarily put my finger on it but i might come back to elaborate after i play it some more part of it definitely has to do with the rapid pace of the game play you barely get defenses set up before youve exhausted all the doors and resources in a zone and have to move on to the next zone

it is funny because after rewatching some gameplay it looks significantly more fun than it feels

edit yeah i 100 think that my biggest issue with this game is how little tower defending you do the resource mechanics dont incentivize camping out in any way and really encourage you to keep moving from room to room to the point that i dont see why turrets were put in this game at all pair that with the fact that weapon variety isnt the best and most of the non generic weapons just dont feel very punchy and you get a game that is hard to want to come back to

#####

game play loop is just empty  

#####

i wanted to like this more than i did being an old school fan of the endless universe 
what i found in the game is that it really feels watered down i was hoping they would elaborate on the gameplay from the first dote game but it feels like they took a lot of stuff out to make room for the playable characters its just disappointing because they did better like 8 years ago and have stepped backwards with this title
its a too safe and lacks the creative style they have had elsewhere in the franchise i guess i was expecting more from a game in the endless series so maybe thats on me 
id honestly rather play the old game more at least it has more going on under than hood


#####

i honestly cannot comprehend how the entirety of amplitude watched this game happen without gouging its eyes and ears out did the writers from previous endless games just die i refuse to believe that a series that produces such stunningly unique characters designs and lore watched this excuse of a game and decided yep thats what we want to relay to our loyal fans
honestly one line from isyander in es2s cinematic has more character than this entire game
as a person who maniacally preaches endless lore and games with my first ever game on steam being es1 this is just heartbreaking do the community a favour and give a raise to the person working on the academy update in es2 and fire the writers for this game

#####

its fineish to me the game felt very neutral and quite shallow as a lot of people have mentioned it gets very repetitive after several runs and there are no interesting systems to back up the monotony each run feels and plays the same even with different characters 

nethertheless i wanted to finish the game however in the end of the todays run when prompted to get back to saloon the game has became unresponsive and upon restarting the loaded save was from 3 days ago the game doesnt use steam cloud but some internal cloud save solution and no idea how it does autosaves but ive lost about 4 hours of gameplay and im soooo not doing this again so its a nope for me

#####

bought it for coop play  turns out coop is pointless and only has hostprogression  seems like the bones of what could have been a fun experience but lost me on the terrible multiplayer implementation  refunded

#####

it is a great game with great mechanics graphics and lore
i dont think it is relevant to compare it with dungeon of the endless as the gameplay is very different most people were expecting a dote 2 and i think this is why endless dungeons suffers from that many bad reviews

endless dungeon is more stressful and the strategic aspect is very different still enjoyable upgrades for weapons and characters are not too grindy the lore is still pretty much enjoyable if you are interested in and the immersion sound design music voices is great

if you read this please give it a try by yourself this is not dungeon of the endless 2 and this is a great game

#####

i really wanted to like this but i dont 

endless space was great was expecting same kind of fun this has the dryest most unrewarding game loop ive seen

maybe it will get better later but its not worth 5 in its current incarnation

#####

fun play for a day i guess its not bad just really short 
so i guess not endless dungeon
story also feels lackluster the ending was pretty stupid
doesnt have that endless replayability feel type beat

#####

only played solo
bshort and sweet versionb

if youre looking for a lighthearted though moderately serious tower defense  roguelite experience within a science fiction setting with wild west elements this is likely the only game out there at the moment

longform

list
 bgraphicspresentationb
while its nothing that is going to make you spontaniously give birth the art direction is one of the strongest elements of the game that blends colorful and gloomy genres together as you descend from the lively saloon area into the dark and dangerous zones and districts present within the starstation the group of characters find themselves in

 bmusicb
the musical vibe is blues in spaaaaace the music in the saloon tends to go for the calm route but in the zones and districts the music switches to being tense whenever the monster wave countdown begins youll be hearing this a lot

 bgameplayb
this is a top down roguelite tower defense game what that means is that you will take control of 1 of 23 heroes while traversing the zones and you need to protect a crystal from being destroyed by monsters which spawn from danger rooms in waves on the path from the crystal robot you can lay down defenses that can damage and weaken the monsters before they get too close or increase the damage of your heroes in order for them to hold off larger waves the overall goal is to get the crystal robot to an exist which you have to find through opening doors which unlocks rooms within the procedural generated zones and while you are exploring zones you may find slots in rooms which allows you to create obelisks which begin generating science industry and food resources to allow you to research better defenses build more defenses and heallevelup your heroes while within the zones

upon death you go back to the salloon and can use certain resources you discovered within the zones in order to upgrade the salloon weapons and heroes in order to make your next run a little easier you can also find items called drink mix that allow you to make your next run have special modifiers that changes up how you play though admittedly i only have unlocked 1 drink mix before beating the final boss for the first time

btime investmentb
each run i have done clocked around 5 hours of playtime so you can play the game in bite sized chunks and still feel like you made meaningful progress

bdifficulty curveb
the game allows you to change the difficulty settings before you start a run in the hero select menu but overall you should be able to quickly learn what the dos and donts after 2 runs about 10 hours unless you get lucky with room generationwhich will make you learn quicker

bcontrolsb
i played on mouse and keyboard and using the mouse to aim  shoot and the keyboard to move and interact has been acceptable

breplayabilityb
youre not gonna find every item and unlock everything on your first run so there will be plenty of reason to go back to this game one of which being the randomization of the zonesmeaning youll almost never be exploring the same layout

just dont come into this game with the expectation you will be playing it for the rest of your eternity as a 95 job this isnt a live service game

bcoopb
you can play with up to three players i havent played much of coop so i cant comment further

bconclusionb
i enjoyed my time with the game as a fan of the endless universe the story is enough to keep me invested in going down and unlocking more lore to read though you can certainly have a enjoyable experience without needing to know anything when playing this game
list

#####

missing a lot here melee is pointless definitely needs more classes and guns could benefit from some melee classes youve basically seen everything in 1 run there is a lot thats good but to much thats missing i cant recomend it the way it is now for its current price tag its worth about 15 given some time to cook and add more in i could say it would be worth about 30

#####

after the gem that was the original dungeon of the endless this was a disappointing purchase 
pros looks good 3d looks great and the characters all look fantastic
cons 4 floors
no dust system
little to no upgrades for characters guns turrets
just a point and click top down shooter with slow gameplay with the occasional ability thrown in
the attempt at humour and storylines are very rough and boring

overall would not recommend this game especially for the current price perhaps with a bunch of major patches or modding this game could become a more well rounded game but right now it feels like half a game sold for a full game price

#####

the game is okay but they need better weapon variety and add better effects like multi shot or spread shot to make it more dynamic also if there was a way to make weapons combine effects like fire and lighting 

#####

to anyone who might have played and loved the original dungeon of the endless save yourself some pocket money and reinstall that one instead of buying whatever this is 

this sequel traded all strategic and gameplay depth for graphical depth leaving in its wake nothing but a barren and sterilized wasteland of a subpar roguelike game 

the spirit and soul of all that which made the previous game a masterpiece has been trampled and spit on an utter and endless disappointment

#####

i have been a huge fan of the original and i feel like this is a really great evolution of the prior games design but with more of a reflex action focus

regular game support and active updates  balances  content are being introduced 

#####

its uh not good   dungeon of the endless the previous game in this series was a pretty well made dungeon exploration game that required the player to manage heroes with vastly different skillsets and make a lot of interesting decisions with a limited pool of resources

endless dungeon scraps all of that stuff and adds meta progression lame and direct control of characters   the latter could be nice if this had been made interesting somehow but it wasnt   direct control of your characters typically consists of holding down the mouse button while aiming into a chokepoint so i really could have done without this

anyway i really dont have much good to say about this game so ill just point out some of the ways in which its dumbed down

1  you can no longer get generator upgrades and there are now significantly fewer generator slots per map

2  enemies now spawn from designated generators rather than unpowered rooms   dust is simply used to turn off steles that have negative effects rather than as a critical resource to manage wave spawn points

3  heroes no longer have unique skills and leveling progressions   now they just get to pick from relatively generic powerups any time food is spent to level them at a food station  the big difference between any two given heroes seems to be which weapon category they fall into and melee weapons were removed so its just big gun vs small gun

4  enemies now have elemental weaknesses and resistances so but you can always see which type of enemy is spawning from a designated point   this really just winds up feeling like busywork as you cant tell the ai controlled heroes which weapons to use meaning that you have to manually drop the one you dont want it using and then pick it back up before you leave the floor

i really cant think of anything good they did with this game  its just flat out much worse than dote

#####

mostly the same same formula as the first game love the ambiance and music the guns and upgrades are pretty dope i do wish this game had more characters and unique dialog in between levels hopefully they add more characters later

#####

i have no idea why this game is rated so lowly  i like most of amplitudes other games so i picked this up and have thoroughly enjoyed the dozen or so runs ive played

#####

im ultimately recommending endless dungeon cause it bwillb be worth your time and money eventually but you need to understand one or two things

 endless dungeon is technically unfinished its definitely playable from start to finish with isomei replayability but the game has some flaws that need to be ironed out and generally lacks content amplitude has done this with all their games dote included releasing them in a somewhat weak state but steadily polishing and adding to them over time endless dungeon is currently in that weak phase but as time progresses i know amplitude can make this into a killer game the foundation of a good game is here it just needs work

 if youve played dungeon of the endless comparing its current state with endless dungeons is wildly unfair to both games dote received years of extended development and support after release transforming it into the masterpiece we have now ed hasnt even been out 6 months so it hasnt had the same time to be polished if endless dungeon is still comparatively bad after a year or two then we will be right to complain but until we get there lets give amplitude the time and feedback they need to cook

ips amplitude please make the solo companion ai fix turrets solo play is micromanaging hell because of the aii

#####

stay classy play fassie

#####

feels like amplitude have dropped the ball a bit almost every element that made dungeon of the endless smart and tactical has been gutted and replaced with a system thats similar on a surface level but lacks any of the depth of strategy

that used to be the end of the review  and i think all of those criticisms are still valid but having played more of the game i can see that endless dungeon is a decent game there are design decisions that i think are poor but i had to figure out strategies to navigate these limitations and find ways to win

the biggest problem endless dungeon has is the dungeon of the endless dote exists in a vacuum this is a game that i enjoy but think if only theyd done x which is also true of dote i loved the game but also some turrets are pointless and some enemies are a bit tedious however this becomes more of an issue when theres such a solid earlier blueprint to work from and the people playing this game have quite likely played the first one so they know when things are worse

this is a solid game the positive review is now deserved  and maybe with a few tweaks down the line endless dungeon will feel like its defined by its own merits and not its failings compared to dote

#####

too little interaction for nonhosts for it being a coop game 4 crashes in 3 hours of playtime yikes

#####

endless dungeon is a dungeon crawler  tower defense  hero twin stick shooter 

pro punchy gameplay absolutely beautiful graphics easy to pick up and do a run and feel like you accomplished something hero designs are unique these characters feel real your runs get more productive as you learn the game systems and start unlocking more characters and weapon upgrades

con im not sure the onboarding difficulty is right im glad i swallowed my pride and reduced it a little bit for my solo runs so far im not a hard core gamer and this made the game a lot more fun and pick up and just play for these first few runs and its still pretty hard

i love the original dote and in my opinion that game still stands alone really pleased with this spiritual sequel though its a bit of a slow burn but worth sticking with 

great experience on steam deck

#####

i like the game  the only expectation i had was an isometric shooter  thats what i got with a little bit of tower defense added on  i dont necessarily get the negative reviews but i like it

#####

endless dungeon was a game i was really looking forward to let me say that the game is not inherently flawed but it does fall short when compared to its predecessor dungeon of the endless dungeon of the endless set a high bar that this latest iteration struggles to meet the development team has clearly aimed to make endless dungeon more accessible and cooperative by reimagining it as a topdown shooter while this approach could have introduced an exciting dynamic the execution leaves much to be desired and leaves the game play to feeling extremely gutted the transition to a shooter format appears to have come at the expense of the games original strategic depth and complexity elements of resource management tactical decisionmaking and challenging gameplay have been notably diluted what is particularly disappointing is the missed opportunity to integrate innovative design elements that could have enriched the franchises original formula and created a real masterpiece the end result is a game that while not poorly constructed lacks the essence that made the original compelling endless dungeon is neither a complete failure nor a triumphant success it situates itself as a passable game that could be appreciated by those new to the series looking for a brainless shooty game with some very light resource mechanics but almost certainly will disappoint fans seeking the depth and strategy of dungeon of the endless i really hate to say i dont recommend this game but at the end of this day this just made me download its spiritual predecessor and reenjoy it instead

#####

nice mix of action and strategy with a couple of niggles 

the good

 rewards thoughtful play
 lovely art and music lots of character
 plenty to do for the price

the bad

 you will get sick of hearing the same voice lines over and over
 some bugs
 some underwhelming loot
 the final level has its difficultly artificially inflated the first two times you get to it which really puts a damper on the achievement of getting there for the first time

still apart from that its great nice ideas and doesnt outstay its welcome

#####

an extremely shallow game that does not respect your time and does not live up to the legacy set by the endless franchise and by dungeon of the endless
list
metaprogression is simple and linear with all meaningful upgrades effectively unlockable in a single run
unlockable maps that serve little purpose aside from splitting currency and lore
gameplay overly focused on twinstick shooter mechanics with vestigial strategic gameplay and undue time pressure
an hollow ending that leaves little reason to play again once youve succeeded in a run unless you are a completionist
list
if you want a good game buy its proof of concept urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp249050dungeon_of_the_endlessdungeon of the endlessurl instead as it is very much worth its price even when not on sale the only reasons to play ithisi game endless dungeon are to hear more wonderful music by arnaud roy  which you can do without supporting this game by buying the soundtrack urlhttpsarnaudroybandcampcomalbumendlessdungeonoriginalgamesoundtrackhereurl  and for more endless lore which has already been recorded in videos and the endless wiki

it honestly pains me to leave a negative review on an endless game but i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anybody

edit better emphasis and linking

#####

its an enjoyable game its just a tad shallow theres all these weapons and turrets but they dont feel distinct enough to matter eventually you just unlock everything and each run starts to feel the same as the last

#####

if you are looking for dungeon of the endless 2 i do not recommend this 

this game should have had another name on its own its alright but nothing special

#####

excellent sequel to the first game it is not the same formula but i consider it is a good move the game is even more interesting when you play it with your friends

#####

its an absolute blast that is if roguelitelikes are your thing ive had a lot of fun with it both solo and in a team with friends the sound design is great the visuals are great the gameplay is a little bit punishing especially solo to start with but you seem begin to grow out of that with the persistent upgrades and youll find yourself unlocking the roster of characters fairly easily which enables you to experiment with different team combinations its a big thumbs up from me

#####

i could have so much fun with endless dungeon but it is riddled with game breaking bugs

 crystal bot getting stuck
 invisibible walls
 characters getting stuck in walls
 progression stopping bugs with the red dead eye boss fight

ill revisit once they patched this game out of early access i expect more from amplitude

#####

i have crashed twice so far mid run one was in a 3 hour run and the second was in a hour run both times you just lose everything you got that run the runs can take hours if you want to full clear and the fact that you dont at the least keep rewards per floor cleared or have any option to start back at the floor you crashed on is crazy ive lost 4 of the 6 hours i have played so far and honestly its a shame because its actually a fun gun that i enjoy

#####

this game is pretty cool but since the launch we play with a friend periodically hopping they will fix the coop netcode it still sucks and have some weird frustrating bugs
boss is unscync with the one who does not host the game
when you click on a selected item of choice it take everything but not what you have selected


#####

i honestly dont get the mixed reviews the game is a fun mix of twin stick shooter and tower defense
its not extremely deep and suffer from a slight lack of variety  for now  but the gameplay loop is really pleasant
each runs i played through was enjoyable theres a fair amount of content and things to unlock including upgrades heroes lore which motivate the player to try different routes and playstyle the heroes are overall well designed with different abilities and passives and managing your ressources during a run is fun  focusing on your heroes your turrets your gear deciding if opening another door is worth it or not
one thing that is a bit annoying is the fact thats is easier to play solo with 2 bots instead of playing with a friend because you wont able to bring a bot with you and will have one less hero to do your run i recommend to play the game with two friends to have a full team

i encountered two game breaking bugs and had to force end my runs sadly hope the devs will fix those issues asap

for the price its really fun roguelite

#####

so writing this review at just shy of 16 hours of gameplay i cant really bring myself to recommend it even though i love the endless franchise as a whole there are just too many flaws for me to be able to ignore with a good conscience i will say that i have had a good time with the game but i can see how others might not

the major issue at the moment is how many bugs we kept encountering while playing here are a few that come to mind

1 shrooms first hero quest cant be completed in coop mode this seems like an oversight as it appears that the player must be able to control both her and zed at the same time to complete the quest

2 fassies second quest to get the recipe from the second floor seems to be bugged when you play coop as well not sure if it is straight up locked when someone else is hosting or if it can get bugged if someone else buys it

3 with comrad you are supposed to gather a set amount of scrap when we tried doing this quest it instantly completed even though we just entered the level

4 there appears to be a myriad of visual bugs with everything from attack indicators missing to turrets not acting properly to even objects missing in the saloon like the drumset and various memorabilia some times people also zip across the map and their laser sights hang around

5 these visual bugs also applies to boss health bars as they often tend to bug out and not show up properly even for the host 

6 dialogue between the floors also seems bugged as you can spy it happening behind the choice of next destination when you are not hosting

7 the different windows like research and vendor and similar feel floaty especially when you are not hosting so you end up getting different options than what you clicked

8 the blue steles feel like they give the same effect when you encounter multiple for some reason we encountered multiple ones for example stuns all enemies every 3 seconds or applies burn to all enemies in the same zone 

9 when going through the transcendence center for some reason we encountered blobs even though the info the game provides says that they shouldnt spawn there

there are probably more that i havent encountered or remembered to mention but this feels like too many for a proper release

another thing that feels unintentional is that only the host gets the steam achievements as well feels like something like that should be shared even with the other unlocks that arent included in coop it just feels like the game doesnt want you to play coop with how it handles things you cant really progress any other hero than the one you are currently playing even though your group might complete quests you are still missing on others while playing this design combined with the bugs makes it more frustrating than it would have been if it was only suffering from one of these issues

all in all these are things that can still be salvaged but it feels like its a shame it launched like this

update as far as i know some of these issues have been adressed and the developers are actively working to fix and adjust the game to their credit it might still become a recomendation some day but not yet i think

#####

this game is just lame
1 characters are boring no builds no melee anymore
2 coop is designed like shit  2nd player enters game in readonly mode and not able to progress lvl up skills etc there is no points of playing together since 2nd player feels just like an npc mechanic not something developed for fun
3 strategic element of the dungeon of the endless is gone too
4 ui design is not obvious and really hard to use sometimes
it feels like huge downgrade from dungeon of the endless refunding and going to back to risk of rain 2 huge disappointment for such price

#####

game is fricking broken now your crystal bots pathfinding is just broken so it gets stuck on everything  so you have never ending waves

#####

something about this game does not work it is hard to pin down what it is people are pointing to balance matchmaking and  lack of content but i think it just needs to get punched up shooting moving and getting just needs to pop more maybe with more sound effects idk it just feels sluggish and off i loved the first one

#####

imagine a game where you are in an endless dungeon now imagine a game that is fun this game is neither this game is a roguelike where you have to survive waves of enemies but the hardest part is surviving the clunky gameplay if i could refund this game i would

#####

the soul of the game has potential 
sadly it feels like an early access release it feels like it wouldve needed another 612 months in development before a final release
the randomness of the maps and balancing issues between the weapons just feels unfinished
solo play isnt fun at all because you are accompanied by a bot and its ai is atrocious the way the maps are set up you need someone with minimal competence to safe guard other routes and is absolutely lacking in that department
had a fun evening with a friend in coop but its just not worth the price tag at its current quality

wait for patches or buy in a sale

#####

i tried to like this game but idk the gameplay is very bland

#####

really enjoyed the original dote and bought ed on the strength of that hoping amplitude could catch lightning in a bottle twice  they havent

a meh game perhaps a 510 with none of the retro charmunlockable artwork of the original
neither a good twin stick shooter or tower defence rogue lite it falls between two genre and fails

perhaps worth picking up on sale or playing via gamepass while waiting for hades 2 

#####

i was pretty excited for this as dungeon of the endless is a really cool game unfortunately i think its too watered down and confused about what its trying to be its an isaac like roomclearer but theres zero quirky upgrades or builddefining loot to find its a pseudo tower defence but elemental resistanceweakness means theres always right turrets and wrong turrets for any given situation its a twitchy twin stick shooter but it auto aims and most fights are solved by standing still or walking in a circle whilst shooting its a roguelite game but meta progression means the characters get significantly stronger with unlocksloot boxes from the hub area theres a choice of paths through the dungeon but all this changes is the element of the enemies on the run and the midrun boss were meant to replay the game over and over but this fundamentally conflicts with the narrative especially the ending essentially it does a lot of things to an adequate standard but it doesnt do anything well 

its priced reasonably for what is there but dang i would happily pay an extra 10 over the asking price to get a more polished and refined experience as it stands at the moment its an okay game fun for a day or two but very forgettable

compared to dungeon of the endless using dust to power updown rooms tactically is gone weapon upgrades are gone armour upgrades are gone devices are pseudo gone they still exist but theyre very minor effects now spawns are in fixed locations the bosses are good once but tedious on repeat plays theres less characters the characters themselves dont feel hugely different outside of big gun or small gun quirky character personalities have been pushed over interesting tactical differences i get the personalities are important to many players but in a mechanicsdriven game about running the same content over and over i need build variety right now theres really not much

the narrative feels very weak too the opening of the game sets up what couldve been the looping of the story postvictory but having beaten the game the gameplay after the final boss is literally just pretend you havent finished the game yet outside of hades this isnt exactly a genre known for good story or writing but the walls of text as quest rewards and mandatory postboss cutscenes really drag the game down

then theres the bugs oh god the bugs the first few runs in coop were great but my last 4 runs were all killed by progression blockers where the elevator wouldnt activate or bosses would become invincible and softlock the run we didnt have a single run in coop where something didnt break especially boss health bars which never worked

also coop progression being mostly hostonly is not good everyone i know that played this game instantly saw the problems with the coop progression not being shared im not sure how this made it to release it feels like padding alongside things like the kill 100000 enemies achievement ive done all the levels and all the bosses bar one which kept softlocking trying to load the map ive had multiple successful runs ive unlocked every character ive metaprogression maxed one character ive got all the saloon upgrades with all that im still only around 15k100k progression on that achievement 
 
i thought it might be nostalgia goggles so i replayed dungeon of the endless over the last few days but it really is just a better more polished game choices in that game feel meaningful characters genuinely feel different which turrets to not use feel like interesting decisions support charactersoperators arent universally awful at combat the dust system for powering updown rooms is fantastic also its much more tactically challenging

i had fun with endless dungeon but after 2 sessions in coop the magic has faded and im not getting that just one more run feel if youre interested in the game maybe get it on a sale but id strongly recommend dungeon of the endless or risk of rain 1 or 2 over it

#####

the gameplay is fine it isnt bad but it isnt anything to write home about the mission design is good its familiar to dote but a few new options and obstacles make it feel fresh i think my biggest gripe is the characters none of their abilities are particularly fun or feel impactful many of the characters ultimate abilities would be regular abilities in other games having none of dotes cast return is also a big miss in my opinion the new cast falls victim to the trend of overly designed weird characters 

the visuals are great i love dotes aesthetic and the transition to 3d has been handled well even if i prefer pixel art areas are dark and foreboding but still have color making them pleasant to look at

i cant recommend the game right now especially at 30 as it is i would say it is worth 15 or 20 wait to see what characters and weapons they add the game has a strong foundation it just needs some more content

#####

please make it 4 player coop

i love the game but 4 player coop would be ideal i would give this 10 out of 10 if it was 4 player i didnt know it was only 3 player coop when i bought it made me very sad i have a group of 4 people and we dont play it as a group because of this reason

#####

visually a master piece

gameplay is fire even though its not dungeon of the endless

#####

honestly a let down i was waiting for this game with high hopes but this isnt what i was expecting its a watered down version of dungeon of the endless

the co op doesnt work properly the characters are annoying at worst and empty at best the items are boring and the rougelike elements have been mostly removed or dumbed down

im going to refund this game and maybe check back in a year

edit came back early to check on initial progress the dev has made and it is still the same low quality rip off the only issue that the community told the devs about that the devs actually made a change for was coop unlocks its telling that they didnt even understand this needed to be in the game on launch

#####

this game released and still feels like its in early access need one or two major updates to be worth the price

1 ive experienced ctd while playing multiplayer 3 times
2 softlock in final boss chamber robot gets stuck on a pillar
3 coop has a significant amount of delaypinglag host advantage is real all progress is not shared so my friend got a ton of achievements and unlocks and i got nothing imagine beating the game and still having zero upgrade slots unlocked for your character lol
4 bosses are pretty plain content and gameplay feel a bit barebones right now

i finished this game in 5 hours not impressed

#####

after playing it for a while i reinstalled dungeon of the endless its predecessor and played that

#####

this game is ok its pretty fun ive had a few bugs dealing with multiplayer but got everything working eventually
the game has a nice spin on the rougelike genre adding turret defense into the mix but the gun play is lack luster and could use some tweaks to give it more impact id also like to see more progression opportunities in the game and some other features you typically see in rougelikes here is a brief list of my suggestions to improve the game

 add more turrets and have them unlockable and upgradeable in the hub area
 have an endless mode its in the title
 add hit markers to make shooting feel more impactful shooting is really unsatisfying right now
 dont limit the player to carrying 2 weapons or give the players more frequent gun options 
 add a system to upgrade weapons during the runs extra effects more damage etc itd be cool if there was an upgrade station and you could change the element type of a weapon
 different weapons having different crit affects would be cool and could make gun choice matter more
 while guns have more than just dps and damage type thats all thats emphasized maybe bring attention to the differences more projectile type fire rate aoe
 add active items and passive items think enter the gungeon
 have more impactful hero upgrades crit chance and damage are the only ones that feel useful or maybe just limit upgrades to health health regen damage crit chance and crit damage
 maybe have unlockable kits for each hero to spice up their playstyle

i feel like a little bit more game design and depth would have taken this game from okay to great




#####

endless potential wasted dungeon

#####

terrible coop experience no cloud saves to play on pc and steam deck without 2 different saves
a stupid question prompt pops up when you uninstall or even verify integrity of files not a fan of that at all 
crashes are frequent which just loses all progress
worth refunding to spend my money elsewhere
but my biggest issue is the coop being a dull experience

#####

steam deck review  i want to like the game but cant recommend 

saved game was wiped randomly after 3 hours and the dlc i paid 7 for does not show in game 

quite a bit of stuttering on my end as well

hope the devs see and make some updates if not still a pretty game to look at lol

#####

the original was better in almost every way plus this has denuvo

#####

this game would be fun if it was not fake coop locking heroes and upgrades behind solo stuff and quests to unlock tokens is really annoying and makes me want to alt f4 why play this kind of game solo makes no sense

#####

every upgrade feels like a debuff work towards fucking your own ass

#####

i want to recommend this game but this games ai companions are stupid and it ruins the game because it is a crucial part of the game

#####

i was thinking this was going to be dungeon of the endless with some quality of life punchups and new features and instead it somehow has half the content that game had

also the game feels terrible to play solo the ai companions are not very smart about positioning or ability use and the only commands you can use on them is to tell them to either follow you or stop following you  there is no defend objective or patrol this path there isnt even a run to this room button it feels awful

its not a bad game its just incredibly disappointing in its current state

i can see it being very good if the devs pay attention to the community and start to add things that already existed in the prequel

#####

concept is good
execution is terrible

#####

it made me go back to play diablo 4
i did not have any performance issues i dont mind the host only progression coop it is just boring and shallow it would be a good game for 1015 


#####

its probably worth it to hold off and wait for coop progression fixes unless youre playing solo

#####

gameplay wise the game is fun however the game comes with denuvo which i cannot support remove denuvo and i would gladly support the game

#####

pros
 tower defense rougelike is a rarity
 excellent art style
 smooth gameplay
 contents not locked behind paywall only dlcs so far are ost and cosmetics
 quick dev updates and bug fixes so far

cons
 very little build diversity no unique way to carry out a run like other rougelikes
 hero upgrades and tower upgrades and in a way guns dont interact with each other much
 amplifier tower seems to be a must
 shroom medic character seems to be a must
 buggy progression in multiplayer quest or achievement of host or others not registering
 multiplayer qol is severely lacking upgrades esp chests locked to host instead of individual players lobbies are locked at the exact number of players no filler bots in multi
 shallow weapon permaupgrades only 2 predetermined upgrades for guns  hero permaupgrades is mediocre
 denuvo its anticonsumer previous games by amplitude are published via sega without drm why now worry about the game quality before piracy maybe

suggestions
 having an autopathing would be nice eg displaying path on the floor to a spot on map or auto run to a ponit on map
 allow pinging on map
 tower range and incoming enemy attacks should not both be red circles 
 2 gun drop 1 light 1 heavy per chest would be nice so is a system for upgrading guns during a run
 a buff at the end of each districtzone for the rest of the run
 more items for merchant allow merchant reroll
 more saloon upgrades andor add more tiers to current ones
 4 player coop

for context i only  play multiplayer have been enjoying the game so far but its honestly cannot recommend it in its current state it has such a high potential yet the game underdelivers for its price tag i will update this review if devs make major positive changes to it
610 nov 2023

#####

once you find out that coop starts when you return to the main screen then the real fun starts

gameplay is interesting enough to keep every run challenging with planning out how you want the wave to flow to simply risking opening a door overall for a topdown rouge shooter its one of my faves for now 

only things i could see improving is mainly aimed at coop seems some of the progession isnt linked so unless you are the host youll miss out on leveling up some skills from the workshop 

but overall as the game develops i can see this becoming a rather interesting fun coop game that could keep the hours vastly more interesting 

give it a try and dont forget to contribute toe games2gether

#####

nope the devs are patching the game to force players into using the boring strategies they like 500 concurrent players on a good day so no multiplayer probably because you will be done playing in 5 hours play it on easy mode and beat it in under 2 hours then you can get your money back

#####

a shallower remakeretconrebootsequelwhatever of dungeon of the endless focusing more on the action rpg that is the current fotm than the ogs more strategic gameplay 

also regardless of political stances deleting threads because they hurt your feelings not cool

#####

well that was boring

this game is a far worse version of dungeon of the endless in a different genre that theyre obviously not comfortable with play that game instead

#####

its honestly good though pretty short for a roguelike 

the content is lacking though for 30 dollars it doesnt really bother me personally it took me 15 hours to reach the end on normal most of my characters had unlocked their full potential all weapons upgraded all saloon upgrades purchased i feel like ive seen everything worth seeing each run typically lasts 13 hours depending on how slow you pace yourself and how thorough a player you are 

my only real gripe with the game is the autoaim makes it way too easy wish you could turn that off and just aim skillfully but maybe there is a design reason for it i dont know

ill likely comeback and play again on hard in a month or two or if there is any content updates later on

#####

no steam cloud saves

#####

after 6 hours ive seen what the game has to offer price is way too steep get it on a 5060 sale

#####

whereas the gameplay loop ist not problematic for me personally i really dont like the superficial and stereotypical writing of the characters comrade the punkrevolutionary with the pithy talk dungeon of the endless had an element of mystery that is lacking in this reinterpretation with a style more reminiscent of comics and funny action movies 

similar to everyone else the issues with bugs crystalbot getting stuck progression problems and missing achievements is absolutely unbearable when you keep in mind that they had playtests and betas 

lets just ignore these problems and focus on the advanced access and great skins that came with the more expensive version  yay s

#####

as of right now i cant currently recommend this game

 strikecoop progression is a combination of broken and missing devs however have laid our plans to fix this but its baffling that the current system made it into the final releasestrike  this has been updatedfixed

 weapons are just kind of boring the mechanics work such that you dont find a cool weapon and stick with it you just swap to whatever weapon has the element type you need for the current enemy type its just not very interesting so far ive seen no evidence of being able to find a cool epic weapon or something with stats that shake things up a bit

 no melee class everything is a guns

 theres no room balancing strategy you cant prevent spawn rooms from spawning stuff so every level really becomes open every door until you find the exit and hope you dont open too many spawn rooms since youll lose if you do

 the meta progression system means the game is impossibly hard without grinding up currencyresources to level up and unlock things i cant say im a fan of the mechanic you cant win from skill  strategy you can only win through grind because if you cant output the required dps at a given time you lose

the tldr for me is simply its pretty but boring mediocre twinstick shooting mediocre tower defence and mediocre  roguelike mechanics

#####

lack of content and meta progression is really disappointing i completed all of the saloon upgrades in my first 34 runs definitely feels like an early access title

#####

game is designed around coop but lacks proper cooperative progressions with the progress being tied predominantly to the host player cuts the legs right out from underneath it being marketed as a coop experience

shared resources make coop frustrating unless youre with a dedicated friend which i was but i cant imagine playing this with a random 

the tower defence portion is fine but the gunplay is not good no nuance to how you fight no reloads required no taking cover required you dont even have to time your shots just hold down the button and let the generous autoaim apply a steady amount of damage to the enemies your character abilities are not majorly impactful and are realistically the only thing that you have in your arsenal that isnt holding down left click leaves combat feeling very underwhelming 

i had higher hopes

#####

what a tremendous letdown after how rad dungeon of the endless was  tiny roster and awful coop doa for me

#####

quick verdict dont buy yet

the good
1 great atmosphere and sound design
2 solid twinstick shooter with diverse character choices
3 fun with friends in coop

the bad
1 progression is pretty lack luster after about 20 hours all i have left to unlock are gun mods which dont do anything interesting aside from minor stat boosts
2 the strategy really comes down to luck and setting each floor up to make mobs run past as many turrets as possible 
3 weapon and turret choice eg damage type comes down to which mobs spawn there isnt any reason to play with different builds
4 for a game that is supposed to be played over and over again the endgame feels underdeveloped

ive put hundreds of hours into games like the binding of isaac dead cells and hades endless dungeon has a chance to rank among these titles but its going to take many months or years of further development before it does the fact that it also has coop capability in its corner is even more reason for fans of the genre to want it to grow but for now id recommend remaining patient before you purchase 



#####

edit character unlock progression now works even when youre not hosting its still a bit weirdly worded and unintuitive but it supposedly works so i cant complain that being said theres still enough of the other problems that im gonna wait a bit more on thumbing this up independent gun upgrades please

additional edit uninstalling the game forces your browser open to a survey page asking why you uninstalled maybe because i need room on my pc actually f uck off sega dont do that shit ever again didnt even know uninstalling a steam game could do anything other than uninstall it

there seems to be a fair bit of fanboyism going on in the discussion of this game which pushes me to leave this just as much as my negative experience so far a mixture of mediocre elements that dont translate as well as they should from dungeon of the endless on top of the coop progression being a nonsensical hodgepodge of some things share some dont for seemingly no reason to the games detriment as well as denuvo drm being here which is always a slap in the face if not an expected one at this point just leaves a sour taste in my mouth the fact that you needed to make an infographic to explain the multiplayer progression a la total warhammers dlc sharing infographic should be a sign that you messed up and need to rethink the entire thing

for the proudly ignorant out there who ive already seen showing their heads in discussion denuvo is a negative because drm being added on top of steam is needless in a nonlive service noncompetitive game and has a documented history of causing performance impacts on games such as nier automata drm of this caliber often does not stop pirates from eventually cracking the game sometimes even getting their own form of multiplayer sessions going and more often just effects the people who bought the game legit is it truly the worst thing ever and worth skipping the game over nah not in my opinion but dont go around decrying people who point this out if you yourself do not understand the situation people who say the sun is the center of the galaxy arent heretics and your precious successful game company does not need you to white knight for them be critical dont mindlessly consume

will gladly update this to a thumbs up if even just the coop progression smooths out but its just a few too many things that breaks the camels back

i am a player who has over 900hrs on endless space 2 more or less the same on endless legend  and dungeon of the endless has read the comics and totally supports the universe they created

i believe the largest disappointment was the overall disrespect of their own endless universe while the first instances of endless be it dungeon space and legend were filled with mystery mood character some humor but keeping a solemn approach for its worldbuilding it kept you wondering what had happened and the factions were incredibly beautiful and unique on their own endless dungeon feels to me the proof they have wandered too far away from that beautiful unique universe to a less risky carefree cute gags with no real backbone status youll never sell me four armed human is a hive mind craver ever

while the gameplay is a nice streamlining of the original dungeon of the endless it gets repetitive very fast the focus on heroes seems how to say this there is only so much focus you can have on meme characters 

i would really really have loved to like this game i bought it as soon as it launched for me and my so however it felt like the last slap to the face after amplitudes last decisions with their last few years of releases

#####

repetitive game with too little to do and no meaningful variation between runs character design is out of line with other games in the endless franchise with the current characters feeling like theyre going for more mass appeal than before not inherently bad just not something i like

cannot recommend due to the amount of data this game gathers others reviews explain it in far more depth

#####

was hyped for it sadly after one run it became apparent how terrible it is buy it on deep sale if you like the endless franchise but be aware of the lack of depth contents and overall replay value that comes with it

#####

what we expect a new updated and smoother version of the first with better movement new levels characters and items

what we got a very generic feeling twin stick shooter with incredibly watered down mechanics that loosely mimic gameplay of the first

to me this game just doesnt deliver gameplay seems to consist of holding down left click and a letting the game autoaim as i run through tedius levels all interesting mechanics of the first are completely gone or so watered down that they might as well be removed if you never played the first you may enjoy this but if you come in expecting dungeon of the endless 2 prepare to be extremely disappointed

#####

tragic how you managed to ruin such a good concept

#####

what a shame this game went from a smooth cold atmospheric beautiful  pixelated  strategic game to a cartoon comedic mess only barely carrying on what made the first game dungeonoftheendless the masterpiece that it is 3 players max instead of 4 8 noninteresting characters to play from as of now the upgrades for heros feel weak and lack any showfull impact leveling up for heros is pointless as more industry and science is always a better option to food a selection of 3 options or having 3 choices max is a recurring theme in the game that needs to change the most double it or change it all together until this game gets some serious changes and content added your better off playing dungeonoftheendless or just avoiding this

#####

lost 7 hours of progress because of the games awful save synchronization system also lost a ton of progress on my file because the game doesnt give clients unlocks randomly i tried replacing the file with a friends and even that didnt work the game has denuvo tacked on too because the devs are greedy assholes the gameplay doesnt even really make up for it either what a disappointment

#####

im happy i got to play it but disappointed by the lack of things to do youve seen everything once youve completed the game couple of times if youve gotten hundreds of hours out of dungeon of the endless youll get 1520 hours with endless dungeon
every floor is exactly the same ending inengine cutscene is unskippable youll get tired of it after completing your 3rd run core floor drags on for far too long you have only a handful of characters to play as barely any customization for the characters decent selection of weaponry from which only a fraction are actually useful its very polished but very lacking in content
id say come back in a couple of years maybe well have 20 characters by then new upgrades new floors and such rright

#####

i really have not played much of this game at all but quite frankly this game has an identity crisis its dungeon of the endless but theyve added a topdown twinstick shooter element to the mix which isnt particularly good the gameplay still feels the same stay relatively still and shoot at the horde it imo just isnt a big enough upgrade to warrant the new price or extra cost just play dote

#####

its missing its charm it feels like forced and not really smooth gameplay

#####

tldr cool ideas but lacking excecution depth and finishing go play 2014 dungeon of the endless for an excellent fulfillment of a similar concept

main critic

unpolished
long waves get repetitive real fast
shallow gameplay
boring generic vo
bugs
no real progression after endgame
despite claims the maps are not proceduarly generated but instead the same map mirrored with slight tile set variations
roguelike choices such as weapons and lvling are not interesting  you cant create over the top builds or something just boring incremental 15 damage choices etc
missing multiplayer progression for joiners just the host get full progression

positives

the music artstyle and graphics are awesome
strategic and tactical planning of floors  turrets kill zones are rewarding concepts

i feel bad for the team because they obviously put a lot of heart in the game but it needs more time feedback cycles and funding to reach that great game threshold

#####

in my opinion this is a downgrade in almost every way from the first game still enjoyable but the strategy aspect has been stripped down to a minimum in favor of having more agency in the combat which kind of just feels like the original anyway except you have to hold down left click now nothing is really exciting no guns stand out as better or more fun than any of the others everything looks and sounds great but its just kind of boring i think this could have been better if it was its own thing and committed to the hack and slash feel or if theyd been more faithful to the original idea and just made a sequel but somewhere in the middle just doesnt really work as well if youve never played the original you might not care but since i loved the original and had high hopes for this one i cant recommend it

#####

the game itself is not bad

but it is way too short and has way too little stuff to actually do
if you want to play it make sure you have at least one friend to play it with and pick it up when its on sale
current price i can not recommend it

#####

i almost cannot describe my disappointment with this game they took a tower defense game that was second to none and completely wrecked it the merchants only ever have a scant few items and they are completely attack based with minimal dps variances i mean for crying out loud there really isnt even strategy involved in this game any more you used to have to monitor your dust to strategically power rooms and characters abilities to give you an edge in more than just a combat move like i was playing an mmolong story condensed down this is not i repeat nnnooottt what i could ever consider to be dungeon of the endless successor in any fashion they turned it into gtfo but with a crappier back story and none of the forethought of the original game

#####

just a heads up for anyone going in blind beacause of their love for the first one this one is pretty much nothing like that one apart from the visual aspect it feels like a straight up downgrade in every regard both in depth and in replayability wont go into detail since by now you should be able to easily check it out

you most definetely can enjoy this game somewhat but if you go in expecting a better albeit somewhat different version of dungeon of the endless you will be dissapointed so be warned and look this one up before buying it or dont this is just a friendly reminder



#####

im a huge fan of dungeon of the endless and sank hour upon hour into it  i bought this sight unseen absolutely my fault thinking it would build upon the previous game  update the gameplay and graphics  just be an all around improvement  i dont think ive ever been so disappointed in something  literally everything i liked about dote is gone  its as if someone decided how can we make this game 100x dumber and userfriendly for an iphone  because thats exactly what it plays like  just a generic roguelite freemium mobile game

i unfortunately went past the refund window as i kept hoping the game would get better the mechanics would get deeper  just anything of interest would happen  but no  totally my fault for not doing any research into the game before purchasing

#####

lots of negative things to start spouting here

cringy hero characters solo play bots do not repair turrets you have no control over what bot players do in solo playthey just follow around throw abilities and shoot no melee character at all to my knowledge sara numas was on dungeon of the endless for example

feels like more things and mechanics should have been here but i am guessing that developers hit some sort of design philosophy wall to try to make it all work in this kind of twin stick format mess twin stick shooting and slashing should have been made more satisfying and then work the turrets around good and satisfying bugalien shooting in dark and atmospheric corridors the elemental damage system is another really irritating feature here basically you need rng mostly on the damage type for only 4 elemental damage monsters it is rps feature that feels lazy i dont remember dungeon of the endless being that way

lackluster mess overall in comparison to first tower defencerts hybrid i do not get why this has gotten game journalist recommendations as a big endless scifi enthusiast i went blindly for this one really disappointed only major overhaul updates and additions can make this fun at this point

#####

risk of rain 2 tower defense update 1010

#####

if bastion and hades had a baby then gave it sentrybase building with a class and elemental weakness system you get endless dungeon love the art direction sound design gun play characters and variability of game play wanna support do it wanna tank yes please wanna do tons of damage here you go champ

embarking on an adventure through the enigmatic corridors of endless dungeon was a gaming experience like no other this title seamlessly blends heartpounding action with strategic brilliance creating a coop masterpiece that deserves the attention of every gaming aficionado

pros

amazing pool resource mechanics endless dungeon boasts a resource system thats nothing short of brilliant managing resources becomes a strategic chess game adding layers of depth and excitement every decision matters making the gameplay incredibly immersive and rewarding

good coop gameplay the game truly shines when played with friends cooperative gameplay isnt just encouraged its essential the synergy between players the thrill of coordinated attacks and the shared victories create unforgettable moments that bind friends together in the heat of battle

roguelike gameplay mechanics endless dungeon incorporates the best elements of roguelike games offering procedurally generated levels permadeath and the thrill of uncertainty in every playthrough this roguelike essence adds an exciting dimension to the game ensuring that no two adventures are ever the same

tower defense mechanics endless dungeon introduces robust tower defense elements allowing players to strategically defend generators and gembots crafting a solid defense strategy becomes paramount adding a layer of tactical planning that enriches the gameplay experience

enemy variety endless dungeon presents a diverse array of enemies each with unique challenges and tactics this variety keeps the gameplay fresh and ensures that players are always on their toes adapting their strategies to overcome new and unexpected foes

cons

limited singleplayer experience for those who prefer solo gaming endless dungeon might fall short of expectations the games true potential shines in multiplayer and while its playable solo the experience lacks the vibrant teamwork and camaraderie found in coop sessions

learning curve endless dungeons intricate mechanics while rewarding come with a learning curve new players might find themselves initially overwhelmed by the depth of the gameplay however this challenge transforms into a rewarding journey as players master the games intricacies

bad bot mechanics one notable drawback lies in the games bot mechanics bots while providing assistance lack the sophistication of commands they simply follow the player making it difficult to manage simultaneous tasks such as defending generators and gembots effectively this limitation can lead to frustrating moments especially in intense situations

in conclusion endless dungeon stands as a testament to innovative game design offering an unparalleled blend of genres that captivates players from the first moment its unique combination of roguelike tower defense and cooperative gameplay mechanics creates an experience that is both intellectually stimulating and heartpoundingly exciting while challenges exist they are overshadowed by the games strengths making endless dungeon a mustplay for anyone seeking a thrilling strategic and endlessly engaging adventure

#####

i liked the tactics of dungeon of the endless a lot hardcore and unforgiving at times

this game is nothing like dungeon of the endless the action is meh the guns dont feel like they do much or completely oblitirate everything the rarity of the weapons means nothing some physical uncommon guns were doing more dmg than endless guns that match the monsters vulnerability none of the gun metersnumbers mean much
so many times i just hold click and look at the door the tactical part is not much better i dislike the elemental resistancevulnerability approach its shallow and not very engaging
a mechanic that i miss very much from dungeon of the endless is turning the lights onoff and carving a path for yourself which actually made you think monsters couldve spawned from anywhere and were mixed now theyre set type set spawn location bullet sponges brain off hold left mouse
the danger meter is not adding anything at best and annoying at worst im planning my next move i dont want to deal with a wave now i didnt open new doors

weird issue with difficulty it will be way too easy 70 of the run and will suddenly spike to hardcore

the game has amazing atmosphere like all endless games but it lacks a soul and character its not leaning hard enough into any genre and tries to sit right in the middle so it fails to infatuate players from any of the genres it tries to fuse


as a result of the disappointment i actually got my friends to try dungeon of the endless to show them how much more thrilling and rewarding the game felt even though we werent actively shooting stuff wed be playing dungeon of the endless a lot more if there werent issues with connectivity and the fact that you cant reconnect to a run after dc

#####

810 for me so far 

graphics and performance have been really good and the soundtrack is amazing

enjoyed the original dote despite being awful at at it and really like this new take on it came in with little expectations and very happy playing it  

the ai needs a little work lack ofsmarter ability usage and some small quality of life changes could help playing solo which the devs are responding to questions and feedback plus making changes which is great 

all in all really enjoying it and feel it was money well spent

#####

im really enjoying this game playing with my friend like alot

but

yes i know almost all the progression is shared thats not enough devs   

it needs to also be the hero quests as well i shouldnt have to main the hero that my friend wants to play to unlock the chip slots so that he can choose which chips he wants in when we do coop   for example shrooms no country for old medics wont unlock the with zed  no matter who is which character in the party on coop i should not have to go fucking solo it to unlock it and then go back into coop your wasting my time      make it everything its not cheating or ruining the game for us to unlock it all together its not gunna make us drop the game faster all you are really doing is wasting our collective time   you have no idea how angry i am to realize after we get down near the core level only to figure out it didnt even do the first chip slot for shroom 

please i dont care if it unlocks hero quests awkwardly fast its suppose to be a game we jump into have fun and jump out if i want it to go longer i can turn the difficulty up

so until its all progression you get a thumbs down because its not really coop to me with this extra red tape in my way hell idk make the quest have a few more steps or some crap

#####

horrible saving interface between pc and steam deck caused me to lose over 20 hours of game play be warned game has some potential but a lot of problems to over come cloud save via steam would of been so much better then your proprietary setup extremely disappointed

#####

this game has not enough content to justify the price tag and what content is there is so buggy its hard to believe its not another beta test you only get 2 bosses per run most of which only have 1 attack red dead eye has multiple aoes that are insanely easy to dodge so it quickly becomes stale and mindnumbing there is little variety in the weapons and just not many to begin with in general i understand this is roguelite or roguelike or whatever but it is insanely repetitive in its gameplay loop unless you are achievement hunting you will run out of new things to do within the first day of playing if youre playing this solo just get hades instead while you wait for hades 2 its cheaper as for coop its the only way that makes the game somewhat bearable or at least it would be if it wasnt insanely buggy if you arent the host you get to double cast your ult but thats where the beneficial bugs end fassis q is unable to target himself all bosses lose all their animations for everyone but the host the last boss in particular just doesnt have a working health bar for his first phase for everyone and people who arent the host might get the wrong generatormerchant item from what they clicked with gameplay out of the way ill briefly explain why the characterslore is lame characters arent diverse or from any of the interesting races found in endless lore cartie is the only good one and its just because shes friendshaped and i need any excuse to get serotonin the others are 2 maybe three humans idk what shroom is humans a humanoid robot a dragon furry and then whatever comrade is overall the designs just feel uninspired but tbh its just the poor frosting on the bad cake doesnt apply too much to the gameplay review as for the lore i dont really care that it feels disconnected from the rest of the endless franchise but i do care that the endingtrue ending are extremely lame and really kills any motivation to find the secrets via multiple runs all in all this was a big disappointment and i hope they fix most of the bugs and perhaps ill be excited for new content but it better be free

#####

regert

#####

pros
 the loreuniverse 
 unique characters
 alright gameplay loop
 the saloon which is your base

cons
 several bugs including but not limited to achievements progress wiped crashes and the bot you transport getting stuck
 dont get the feeling of just one more run
 minimal tactics needed

they have tackled several of the initial issues but to me who spent a fair bit of time to simply get wiped as soon as the first major update drop just put the last drip in my cup i would like to recommend this game because it is a cool idea and concept and to some extent i can but as it stands right now they need to continue the development before i change this review around it feels like they released a game that is less than 70 completed

#####

nice game its fun but wait for sale high price for little bit content big   nobody is actually playing this game if u want to play coop with randoms

#####

achievements and new character unlocks are only progressed for the host when playing coop other than that i miss the tactical and strategic feel that dungeon of the endless had this feels more like a runandgun game and that gameplay just wasnt that satisfying for me not that i cant enjoy that type of gameplay but rather that the feel and impact of your actions just comes off as very bland to me

#####

this is a maybe vote gameplay is great but holy fuck the coop is annoying they say they are fixing this and the menu system is annoying
there is no way to look up character abilities without the pregame start up that has a timer for no reason

edit i honestly have never had anger at a menu before that is then proceeded by calm at how lovely the game is

#####

they need to reconsider how coop works and make it so that all parties are able to progress through their game even when only one player is hosting not sure what the thought process was behind this as there is absolutely zero benefit for anyone who enjoys playing this game for the coop aspect for now its a 610 in my book gameplay is great but the coop system is a big part of the score for me

#####

an otherwise okey game if its not a sequel to endless dungeon 1
1 simplified spaceresource management and also turret design
in the first game the biggest fun comes to how you use heroes and light to occupy rooms remove darknesswhich produces mobs and plan out your path normally this requires frequent changetweak of the dungeon light map hero location and all 
also the mobs are not always targeting your turrets so its possible you have the slowhalt rooms if thats what you needed now its very much simplified to the point this elemental damage kills that mob and every turret will very soon be destroyed if you dont tend to them

2 boring and mainstream enemyboss design
enemies areunimpressive tbh its never a strong feat of the first game but its somehow more annoying especially sometimes those rolling enemy just find a corner room and starts to produce smaller mobs its so annoying that you cant stop it rolling but have to follow it to where ever it decides to stop i mean seriously just stop there so i can kill it this is not a running simulator

these boss design are so arbitrary it doesnt create much of anything the drilling boss is a bit more interesting due to its action nature but the worm queen and the ai is just very boring design  you do everything the same way and only go kill the queenmove your crystal bot every now and then this is to the point i feel they dont add much to the game especially when paired with boring turret and map design 

3 it is so annoying to control 3 heros in solo mode
instead of previous game where heroes you can put in a room and only care for when they use their ultimate here your heroes has a low cd active skill that the ai doesnt seem to understand the ai is pretty bad at placing mines and wards or really anything aside from shooting a lazer or heal other  using 3 heroes is so clumsy in the action oriented control scheme 

like seriously i understand that you dont want the solo timesink indie style aka why the previous game is so much fun but do you think this is okey just wonders around with 3 heroes knowning that the ai sucks and cant really play the hero 

4 really terrible selfindulged progression
going to the core which is the ending point of this game is not as easy as doing it all right its a progression where you have to collect all the previous zones the game will apply game crippling effects in core area such as your turrets just dies and cant do no shit your heroes are crippled and all that nasty shit 
preventing you from finishing the game or severely limiting the builds you can apply to core area

the only way to remove those crippling effects is that you go to hacking post check all the areas and finish the collectibles 

i mean seriously game designer look at your shitty mechanics what is the big deal to allow player finishing the game when they are at the end point facing the final boss why do you have to stop people from winning so arbitrarily just because you had a brilliant progression idea what makes you think you and your brilliant design must stand in peoples way to success to show how important you are

all in all this game is made by untalented selfindulged plainly mediocre designers instead of the brilliant endless dungeon 1 game now we got an unimpressive mainstreamed solo unfriendlyflawed game that is just lazy and stupid and care only about the ego of designers 

stay away from from it

#####

no compatibility egs  steam on release what a shame i was looking forward to play with my friends but not possible atm
and no set date for the crossplatform update of course the devs just say that it will be soontm
tldr dont buy if youre planning to play with friends not on steam

#####

im a longtime lover of the endless universe and amplitude games in general and this is no exception i enjoyed the original dungeon of the endless game and endless dungeon builds on that formula in a really pleasing way ive been playing mostly solo and have found the ai helpers to be suitably smart though there are a few improvements id like to see overall always excited to see the next chapter in the endless story and really enjoying ed

#####

uniquely fun and tactically interesting one of those td  wave shooter games where things are at their most fun when stuff gets hairy its a little content light at launch but the visual and audio polish on this game are amazing and theres some fun tech to be discovered with character combos  combat tricks

also they patched the coop progression issue 8 days after launch 8 fuckin days thats insane a team and game worth supporting

#####

just switched computers all my progress is gone this is barely a game at this point

#####

too expensive for its condition the game itself lacks some mechanics and the gameplay is really i mean really boring 
the idea of the game itself is pretty good but in reality you hold down a button to shoot and your character has two different spells one of which is your ultimate and has a very long recharge time 

the weapons arent extraordinary theyre simple basic elemental weapons that youll find in every other game 
the characters are welldevelopped at least

610 might turn into a 710 with a few updates

#####

bland gun play dialogue and va that makes you physically wince and towers so flimsy a strong breeze could topple them 
all i can say that i liked was the visuals

#####

there is no one playing this in coop mode and playing solo with the ai is just soo much worked and not fun dont recommend it at all

#####

all the strategy of the first game but as a coop twinsticker shooter
the game play loop is addictive and satisfying

#####

nice vibe cool action good music as usual its the amplitude studio follow up i wanted

#####

extremely fun game just dont understand why make a game coop if you have to use the progression only the host made and not your own devs out of touch with reality

#####

its a rather enjoyable expierence and is only elevated when with friends however for those who have not i would recommend the prequel 

#####

this is easily the biggest  gaming disappointment of the last couple of years not only is the game unrecognisable to the original classic but it is also extremely mediocre in its own right from a studio who are usually very solid i am not sure what went wrong here but it is an enormous miss given how many years they spent developing it 

the worst part is the absolute lack of strategy or thought required when the last was so involved most of the time in our coop run through on hard i just blindly opened all the doors as quick as i could because you didnt actually need to plan anything and then stood in one place holding down mouse 1 it also had absolutely none of the tension or character development of the first 

id give it a 410 which stings much more when what it was a sequel to was an easy 910

#####

had high hopes for another endless dungeon style game

the cons that were enough for me to not recommend

1 3 player coop down 1 from dungeon of the endless
2 less weaponscharactersuniqueness than its previous iteration
3 after 13 hours in at the time of writing gameplay loop just isnt there
4 dungeon of the endless had some narrative depth to it whereas this games storynarrativeetc is shallow and unamusing

overall this game needs a few more years a couple dlc packs and an overhaul or two to become worth it in my eyes

#####

2 guns 2 powers all boredom refunded as i didnt find this game enjoyable solo also they wanted 55  70 my currency for this sorry but this game is way too low budget to justify near triple a pricing

#####

here it is the nerf everything patch that lazy devs fall into its ok even blizzard does it

#####

great game well polished ive not had a problem playing solo so far with the ai honestly i prefer this over the previous game they made mostly played on steam deck it runs really well

#####

unfortunately this game was halfbaked at launch with poor progression limited character variety lackluster character designs and not a rewarding or fun gameplay loop for a rougelite this game should only be purchased after a year or so of updates and during a sale at that

#####

played a ton in the beta and now getting ready to play a ton more a great change in the format from dungeon of the endless

#####

i do not recommend this game as is right now as others have said its too bare bones personally it didnt feel worth playing alone but was somewhat fun with a friend for a bit with all the other games out there its not fun enough to invest my time and from other reviews ive seen it doesnt have much replay value

it definitely has the potential for a fun game but from reading the survey comments it seems like the game is not likely to get what it needs to keep me invested

#####

shockingly similar to dungeon of the endless id rather not pay another 30 to play the same game with an extra dimension added

#####

it is a video game for being in development for 5 years and having a good predecessor its incredibly barren and desolate i didnt beat the game in 6 hours but i unlocked everything in 6 hours everything you do in the game is meaningless all progression just a facade
the core gameplay could be fun but its never capitalized on the gameplay was so poorly executed that the devs have so far only been releasing balance patches and bug fixes in which they have to strongly nerf the heroes just to force players to use the turrets 
these updates are strong telltales that the game at its very core isnt functional
that isnt to say you might really enjoy the game
but if youve played the predecessor i think its more likely than not that you wont enjoy this title

#####

fun tactics based gameplay enjoying the combo of roguelike with tower defense and shooting only downside is the difficulty spike can be a bit jarring around the 3rd floor but eager to upgrade and push through

#####

this game is very disappointing i love amplitudes games and especially dungeon of the endless but endless dungeon has the gameplay depth of a terrible flash game the most ideal strategies often involve standing at choke points and holding left click for minutes at a time its pretty but i cannot in good faith recommend this game given that it chose to go for window dressing over solidifying the core gameplay loop it claims to be a towerdefense twinstick shooter and somehow manages to go toedeep into either genre

#####

i like the game for what it is i know others have had problems but i have yet to encounter them

#####
