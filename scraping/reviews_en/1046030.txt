a game you can play with a dog on your lap
i have a small dog and he likes to sit on my lap and rest his head against my left arm when im at my computer unfortunately this means that i cant move my left arm that much without disturbing his nap this game can be entirely played with the mouse so its the perfect game for if your arm has been taken hostage also its really relaxing and cool
1010 can play with dog on your lap

#####

never have i been so torn on a game before this one ultimately i dont think i could recommend it to people based on my experience with it i spent 61 minutes in game working my way through the island getting stumped and starting over again and not once did i not enjoy myself on the contrary the game is very charming and sweet everything possesses a toylike quality which cant help but put you at ease

my issue happened after the sixty first minute i suddenly realized i had seen all i felt was necessary i didnt feel the urge to continue and i knew i would be unlikely to play it again again not because anything was poorly done or unenjoyable i just felt like i had finished the experience it rather feels like the game possesses little replay value due to no lasting progression you simply play each island until you run out of buildings to place and if you generated enough score you get another building pack otherwise game over

that is my one real issue with this game the price is super affordable and the developers are as humble and genuine as the game is itself i would readily play anything developed by their hands based on what i have seen in islanders

but at the end of the day i would not recommend the game or any game where i might suddenly mutter ohthats it before i even felt like i had really began which is what happened an hour in 

however for all the above reasons clicking the thumbs down button would feel like picking the wings off a butterflyi feel comfortable supporting the team if not this particular game

islanders is the second game from threeman indie outfit grizzlygames while it looks like a city builder at first glance islanders is actually more of a strategypuzzle game where you place buildings in certain positions in order to earn points earning a set amount of points unlocks new buildings and eventually if you get enough points you can move on to another island 

h1positivesh1
listthe game is really beautiful the islands look great the buildings are really well designed and the art style really fits well with the style of game islanders is an absolute pleasure to look at 

the core gameplay is really simple but theres a lot of hidden depth to the game too itll be enjoyable for casual players and minmaxers alike essentially you start with an empty island apart from a few things like flowers and statues that come in handy with certain buildings and youre given one pack of buildings to begin with in order to get more buildings you have to hit a certain score threshold buildings get points from interactions with other buildings as well as stuff thats on the island so success in islanders comes from your positioning of buildings you can do pretty well just by playing casually like i do but if you really plan things out you can get incredibly highscores ive seen some seriously impressive stuff from other people playing this game

as i mentioned its really more of a puzzle game rather than a city builder not having to worry about resources or income etc makes a really nice change and the way positioning works keeps enough strategy in the game to keep it interesting

theres no grid or anything youre free to play things wherever you want but the buildings do slot together really nicely one of my favourite parts of the game is designing cities because the mansions and houses slot together really nicely

its a really relaxing game to play there are no time limits to speak of the music is really calming and as i mentioned earlier it really is a pleasure to look at this would be a great candidate for a podcast game but ive been really enjoying unwinding with it without any other kind of audio 

the procedural generation for the islands is fantastic the islands always look beautiful theyre really well varied and for the most part you have everything you need when you start having such good procgen really is crucial to this game for replayability and they absolutely nailed it there are also a couple of different biomes and weather effects that really add to it as well 

its an absolute steal for 5 i gladly would have paid twice as much for this game its so well designed and it offers a lot of replayability im going to keep playing this over the weekend but i definitely see this being something i pick up every so often to unwind for a little whilelist

h1negativesh1
listtheres currently no undo function this can be kind of frustrating as you often have to be very careful with positioning to get the points you need and its easy to make a tiny mistake that really messes you up

theres currently no free build mode id really like to see this added the core gameplay is great fun but id really like the option to just build whatever i want

you cant tilt the camera or zoom inzoom out list

h1verdicth1

islanders is an excellent little game the core gameplay works really well and the whole thing is lovely to look at add a bunch of replayability and youve got a great game for just 5 highly recommended

i enjoyed this game quite a bit its worth the price but i would like a way to see my other islands after a game is done something like a gallery

h1islandersh1

a very relaxing score chasing city builder which keeps your interest in short bursts its a shame there arent objectives other than high scores to obtain but due to its very reasonable price youll definitely get your monies worth 

 h1prosh1 
very relaxing with a melodic soundtrack 
easy to play but more complex than first appears
meaningful achievements which are fun to chase
very reasonably priced

h1consh1  
no friends leaderboard and cannot view the whole of the online leaderboard
 cannot undo a move once object is placed
the scores are difficult to see on some desert maps 
no objectives to obtain apart from a high score

h1overviewh1
islanders is incredibly easy to pick up and understand but underneath its simplicity lies much deeper strategic play the gameplay does feel a bit similar throughout so its better to play in small bursts but i found it incredibly relaxing thanks to the wonderfully chilled soundtrack
 
gameplay involves placing buildings and objects on a procedurally generated island depending on where you place them and what you place them near to will depend on the score you achieve there is a target score you must reach which gradually increases as you gain points an island meter fills and once this fills you are free to move on to the next island 

i would have welcomed a bit more detail in the environments changing weather conditions would have been nice to see characters tending the land boats in the water and different animals and wildlife inhabiting different terrains i think this would have made the game a little more interesting watching a city develop

there is a deeper strategy than just plonking objects where they are the most value you have to consider the islands terrain what objects achieve the highest bonus points and in which order you should place them land is always limited so youll need to rotate buildings and fit them as tightly together as possible 

you get a choice of two packs and this also can have an effect on your progression there does seem to be some sort of order to the pack choice the packs get more complicated as you progress with bigger objects but with potentially higher scores 

i am enjoying playing islanders i usually find i play an hour at a time as it does become a little tiresome if you play for too long i never got the one more go feeling but i did find it incredibly relaxing to play i wouldnt describe it as a puzzle game but more of a score chaser  

the asking price is very reasonable considering you will easily get 10 hours out of the game i would highly recommend 

h1gameplayh1  
you must reach a target score by placing building and items on a procedurally generated island once you reach that target score a new target score is created

gaining points causes your island meter to fill slowly and once the meter is full you will be able to advance to the next island if you run out of buildings and have not reached the target score it is game over 

you are presented with a choice of two packs and need to decide which pack to open the other pack will be kept for the next choice and will stay until picked there are quite a wide variety of packs to choose from but you will see the same packs at the beginning of each game and the further you progress the more diverse the packs become pack selection can be very important in the success or failure of your game

within each pack are certain items pertaining to the pack in a brewing pack you will always find hop fields and a brewery for example in a fountain pack you will always find a fountain houses and a mansion the packs always contain the same items and you will start to learn what is in the packs the more you play unfortunately there is no way of knowing what is in the pack until you open it i would have liked to have been able to preview the cards in the park before deciding to pick it 

you will also start to learn what items fit with others houses and mansions score highly next to city centers for example there is no need to remember such information though if you hover over the cards in the pack a description of bonuses is revealed which will inform you what scores highly next to each other 

to gain high scores it is best to try and plan and leave room for buildings you know will score highly together for example a temple scores highly around houses and mansions but only appears later in the game by placing houses and mansions which are readily available early in the game and leaving space for a temple in anticipation of it being dealt you will score highly the only disadvantage of this strategy is that you must guess how big a space you will need there is no template or blue print for a temple you can use this can become frustrating

another factor to consider is the terrain certain objects and buildings can only be placed on certain terrain you wont be able to place a field on a desert region for example if you were presented with an arid island then you would avoid the farming pack 

the trouble is that the farming pack will be in your next choice and the next choice and the next until you choose it this forces your hand slightly if you want to avoid it i think it would have been nicer to throw the discarded pack back into the pile and generate two new packs on each turn

once you have chosen your packs and have opened them you need to place them somewhere on the island you can freely move the building or item around the map and the score constantly changes as you move you will always get a preview of the score before you decide to place it once you have placed the item it is stuck there and cannot be removed an undo button would have been welcomed 

you can rotate the buildings so they fit tightly together but there is no snap in place or best fit mechanic available which was a shame i think this would have been very useful when placing houses and mansions as they are often shaped differently 

the camera can be moved around but there is no zoom in or zoom out available 

you can stay on an island if you wish even if your island meter is full you dont have to move onwards immediately this means you can build some nice looking civilisations but the islands tend to be very small and are designed to run out of space there is no free mode or sandbox mode available yet 

there are online leaderboards to compete against but no friends leaderboard you cannot see the whole of the online leaderboard only your score this left me wondering what the top score was 

the game is purely score based its a shame they couldnt have created other goals or objectives to obtain i think that would have made it more fun 

 h1soundh1  
there is a very relaxing tune which plays throughout the game some people have reported that it is annoying but i found it calming and not repetitive there are a few wind effects and minimal effect noises but sound is very basic 

i think they could have improved on the sound with seagull noises waves crashing on the beaches weather effects etc 

h1graphicsh1  
graphics are quite basic too and could do with improvement why not include villagers tending the land or animals that roam around the map boats in the water waves lapping onto the beaches weather conditions are all obvious inclusions 

 h1conclusionh1
i didnt enjoy this as much as i thought i would i hoped it would have more puzzle elements and scenarios to aim for rather than purely score based objectives

due to its very reasonable price i would still recommend this game however it is very relaxing  to play and underneath its simple exterior does lie a deeper challenge

i smoke about a pack a day but i played this for 7 hours straight without even thinking of having a cigarette

#####

i really like puzzle games but its rare that i find any that fit what i want out of the genre  specifically i like playing for score rather than solving premade puzzles  fallingblock puzzlers such as tetris or others that throw a random array of piecesthings at you at ever increasing speed is more my thing

well this is basically that except without the whole increasing speed thing  islanders may look like a pure city builder in screenshots but this really is more like a funky turnbased fallingblock sort of thing with some elements of citybuilders smashed in to reshape that old concept into something new  the idea of simcity  tetris sounds very odd on paper but thats essentially what we have here and it ends up working out wonderfully

your job here is to build a bustling highdensity city on each of the different islands the game presents to you  as you continue to place buildings down your score will rise as will the meter on the right of the screen  your biggest goal is to fill that meter which lets you move on to a new island before you run out of buildings to place  if you do run out without filling that meter your game is over  its a simple concept but one that works out very well and it creates a pleasant sort of tension as you try to fit more and more pieces onto an island with limited space trying to use each one in such a way that allows you to reach the needed goal

there are many different buildings available to you yet not so many that it seems overwhelming  from houses and mansions to circus tents and temples theres all sorts of things here  there are even plateaus which are big platforms you can place that then act as more land you can use  unlike traditional city builders buildings in islanders dont really do things as they sit there  you have no resources to manage other than your inventory of buildings to place so theres nothing like buildings that produce resources or any of that nonsense  instead each individual building produces points based on which other buildings are within its radius when you place it and the size of that radius varies greatly from one structure to the next  when you hover over a building in your inventory the game will list just how many points you get for specific buildings that it interacts with  however most buildings also have interactions that will take away points  for instance you cant just smash two lumberjacks right next to each other they dont like that and youll incur a penalty  keep them out of each others range though and you can use them without trouble  a huge part of the games challenge is juggling the positive vs the negative with each piece  as well as planning for future buildings  some of these are very difficult to use properly  the temple for instance is a gigantic thing worth huge points if used right but it needs a ton of space and there are some buildings such as markets that it will react very badly with costing you huge points  like any falling block puzzler though you just have to deal with what you get  which means careful strategic planning  you have to actually think about what youre doing  you have one big advantage though  unlike block puzzlers the pieces arent dripfed to you one at a time  as you fill up the meter on the left of the screen youll be given the opportunity to get a pack of new buildings  these packs are usually themed and you choose one out of two packs to grab and get a pile of new buildings based on that  this choice ends up having alot of impact   the best part is there are many different approaches you can take in this game  if you browse through some of the games screenshots you can see all sorts of screwball tactics on display there  the buildings in the game are quite versatile in the ways you can use them and thats part of what makes the game shine  


on top of that though there is no grid or anything here  buildings are not made of tiles like in many builder games  instead the bounding box for each building will exactly match its shape  that lshaped house can slot in with other buildings in exactly the way it looks like it should  which just adds even more to that whole tetrisy feel  and its extremely satisfying to do too  though it also means that when you do make mistakes those mistakes are obvious awkward little holes in your design that nothing will quite fit into

the other brilliant part is actually the islands themselves  these are procedurally generated and their size shape and features will vary wildly  what makes it so great though is that the islands themselves have a huge effect on the strategy that youll use on them  what works on one island might go very badly on the next purely because the shape is different forcing you to adapt and do things in a new way    alot of games that use procgen will tend to do so in a way that manages to make it not really matter each run ends up samey even despite all of the supposed procedural aspects  but not here  the procgen is very meaningful and will keep the challenges coming as you keep playing  im seriously impressed by this aspect of the game  its always exciting when you move on to the next island and see what sort of challenge youll be facing next

and even with all of that going on islanders is a game that respects your time  you dont need to do long 3hour sessions to feel like you accomplished something  granted you can do that and chances are you will indeed do so the game is very addictive and fun but at the same time you could jump in for a quick 10 minutes build a bit score some points and feel like you did something  you can save and exit at any time which is important in a game like this

overall islanders is an amazing game with endless replay value and challenge for those that want it yet managing a quite relaxing nonfrustrating atmosphere at the very same time  easy to learn and play yet the depth it contains means theres no end to the possible strategies you can employ  a truly masterful example of minimalist design done right

#####

i made sure to buy this from the trailer alone we need more of such honesty in game marketing

great product it actually tells you what it is and what it isnt in one of the best trailers ive ever seen really easy to learn to play and super relaxing due to its non stressing mechanics beautifully crafted environments and an amazingly soothing soundtrack the game counts with a slight amount of strategy involved the more you progress and learn about it which makes it even more interesting to play 

highly recommended good value money for less than the price of a pint

#####

not actually a city builder  theres no simulation here just scoring points for placing buildings instead this is a  puzzle game think of it as turnbased tetris with your goal being to get as many points as possible by fitting pieces into a limited space once you realize this this is a great game its just as addictive as tetris while being much more relaxed  since you can put it down and pick it back up again at any time highly recommended  so long as youre expecting a puzzle game not a city builder

#####

simple game that distracts you from the agony of life

#####

for the price of admission you gain one of the most relaxing chilled out games ever made

islanders is the very definition of a hidden gem

if i had one wish for it its that it received some more updates

#####

one of the chillest city builders ive ever seen no need to worry about your citizens getting mad or disasters happening to your city just try to put your buildings correctly and while doing so enjoy the relaxing music atmosphere and beautiful landscape
a great game by the developers

#####

very laidback cozy and stress free

it appears to be a city builder but its really a sort of puzzle game where you create your own puzzles by being shortsighted and bad at planning

#####

simple relaxing and the price is right 

i enjoyed the honesty of the devs video to kind of give you a quick run down

#####

this game is really twosided if played causally it is peaceful and atmospheric perfect for relaxing if played to get a high score it becomes a challenging puzzle one that tested my resolve it doesnt have the largest depth of gameplay becoming somewhat repetitive in early game however if you can make it to the 3rd or 4th island you can put together some wonderful towns that feel new and unique the developers are correct this is certainly not for everyone if you enjoy base builders this can scratch that itch if you like puzzles the unique challenge of working with your own past decisions in city planning might be interesting to you  for the price especially if its on sale i think its a winner

h1the one sentence summaryh1
iislandersi is a simple yet sophisticated city builder that is both incredibly relaxing and delightfully addictiveand a bveryb worthy addition to your game library

h1 the positivesh1
 bthe art styleb the game makes the absolute most of its colors and shapes to provide a minimalistic setting where you can build and grow your idyllic island city everything is themed to fit togetherfrom the sprawling farmlands to the tetrislike cities and manufacturing areasand ultimately results in an islandscape that feels like your own personal creation

 bthe gameplayb the gameplay is simple but versatile while most city builders focus on the micromanagement of your city iislandersi doesnt burden you with all those overcomplications 

the game is all about scoring maximum points based on the adjacency bonuses of each building you place a simple ruleset that is easy to learn fun to master and immensely rewarding as you learn how to boost your gains

 bno timer no pressureb theres nothing in the game pressuring you or disrupting your play its all about you and your pace which is great

 bthe soundsb much like the game they are modest minimalistic and utterly delightful enjoy all the i plops i and i blips i of placing buildings and scoring big points

 bthe musicb like everything else its simple charming and doesnt get on your nerve after hours of playing it accomplishes exactly what it needs to in a minimalistic meditative city builder a background pulse that doesnt get in the way of and truly enhances the experience

 belegance in simplicityb the game is accessible to everyone of all skill levels heres a short list of the ways it excels in its simplicity
list there isnt a huge learning curve
 its super rewardingeven if you only have five or ten minutes to play at a time
 losing doesnt feel bad
 learning comes easy youll often find new ways to improve your score
 the minimum bar for success is relatively easy but you can keep on boosting your score even after youve already met your goal
 there is no end to the game your only objective is to progress as far as youre able
 if you dont like the layout of an island you can easily meet the goal and move along to the next landscape no need to stress over something you dont like
 youre not overwhelmed with choices you are given a palette of buildings to work with and only expand your optionsand the decisions you have to makeby placing those structures you never have too many tools to use at once which is also a part of the challenge
 basically no words far bifarib less than this review at least
 ithe list goes on but the tldr is that the game is incredibly welldesignedi
list
 bsandbox modeb dont care about points just want to create the most amazing island possible the game includes a sandbox mode just for you allowing you to take full advantage of the models and artwork to create a itrulyi idyllic island paradise

 bcamera modeb built the perfect city no worries the devs made sure that you can capture the perfect screenshot

 b building varietyb not only is there a great variety of structures but it seems like the developers are continuing to add new objects adding to the variety and choices you can make as you play its super exciting to see it continue to grow since finding those new buildings hooked me all over again

 bthe achievementsb the achievements are solid meaningful educational and not so difficult that youll never be able to 100 the game

h1 thetake it or leave ith1
 bthe best city is often not the prettiest cityb while there is a natural logic to where you place things the optimal path often involves somestrangeplatform placements in order to stack buildings its not a breaking point but its probably why some people will prefer spending time in the scenario editor

 bsome islands are isuperi difficultb there are some odd and sometimes disruptive discrepancies in the difficulty between the different levels though the good news is that you can usually travel from these islands with relative ease

 bonline leaderboardb want a reason to keep playing and striving to improve well theres an online leaderboard to track your progressa nice touch for competitive players

iive now reached rank 490 and plan to do even better by the time you play this gamei

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2604848787

h1 the notsogreath1
 bthe placement of buildings can be challenging at timesb the pieces dont slot together as cleanly as tetris blocksor even in spaces where you intentionally try to leave room for future structures to fit in sometimes your entire strategy will be destabilized because youre off by a few pixels which adds an unnecessary complexity for minmaxers trying to optimize their score in a game thats all about maximizing the use of your space its unfortunate to spend so much time guessing the approximate distance between perfect and good enough

 bbuilding synergies are not innately clearb it can take a surprising amount of time to learn the optimal placement of the different structuresan issue compounded by situations where one building prefers to be around another but that second structure doesnt like to be around the first an ia equals b but b doesnt always equal ai type of situation that can cause frustrations

now this does feel like a part of the charm that keeps the game fresh that said there could absolutely be a clearer way for the game to convey the relationship map of buildings that doesnt require memorization and patternrecognition

h1  the final wordh1
all in all iislandersi is a nearperfect game for players who want a simple elegant city builder that they can learn master thoroughly enjoy and pick up or set down at any time for what it aims to accomplish it excels and for the price tag its well worth the 10 hours of entertainment

islanders is a charming and relaxing puzzle strategy game wrapped in the guise of a city builder 

islands are randomly generated and youre given options for which building packs to choose you have to try and think ahead to what space you have and what buildings will compliment each other and then fit them into the terrain in a way which maximises your points some will be complimentary to each other whilst others detrimental and slowly you build up your settlement into something that hopefully looks pretty and has a high enough score to continue you need to meet progression levels to continue on to a bigger island and if you run out of buildings before you get there its game over your highest score is pitted against other steam players to calculate your global rank giving you something to strive for if youre so inclined

islanders is the perfect example of a simple game done well completely minimalistic in design it nonetheless offers a completely satisfying level of strategy and gameplay most of all it just feels very calming to play it serene and soothing  something i definitely need right now my friends may be grateful for a concise review for once to match the game

my new gaming zen

 if you find the reviews of an old welsh lady interesting please follow  urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator28971565my curator pageurl 

#####

first off if you havent seen the developers trailer watch it now hands down the most down to earth sales pitch ever

islanders is exactly what it claims to be and nothing more its a relaxing city builder with simple rules and simple progression the game doesnt necessarily have a lot of depth its not like civ or some other titles like that  you pick up this game to chill this is the kind of game you play late at night with some lofi beats and a cup of tea

if you like this check out superflight by the same developer its a little more intense but has a similar art style and chill factor  highly recommend both games

#####

this game is addictive
its both extremely simple and extremely deep
simple
 place building near more resources for more points
 placing buildings near some buildings gives more points while others may take away points
 get enough points to fill up a meter to unlock more buildings to place
 get enough points overall on the map to unlock the next map
 repeat endlessly procgen
deep
 space limiting means you have to plan ahead because buildings cannot be removed
 planning 3 4 5 buildingpacks ahead is critical lategame but it may reduce the maximum number of points you can get out of a building pack earlier on
example you get mansions and houses earlygame their max bonus comes from grouping them around the town center but lategame they get bonuses from different buildings some of which like the tavern and circus may lose points being in proximity to mansions while others lose points being in proximity to houses
 verticality can be critical in lategame point maximization

the cities because you cant plan them in the same way as most citybuilders and because of the procedural generation are much more organic and naturallooking than any other citybuilder ive seen they feel like how real cities grow

and for five f dollars

if you like citybuilder games this should be a nobrainer

#####

do not buy this game the developers at grizzlygames all have phds in psychology they know what you want they have meticulously crafted this game to appeal to every single addictive need in your subconscious it seems innocent enough when you start playing after all its just a casual cityisland building game but its not long before you realize youve been playing the game for 10 hours straight and you cant stop yes its that insidious you cannot stop it will not let you sure you think youve got it all under control its just a silly game right no no its not it is much more than that

islanders offers you with open hands palms up a tiny space on which to build just build the game asks you on bended knee sure why not you oblige naively

you add building sets based on what you think works with this island you place your buildings ah you begin to see how the building relationships turn into points lights begin flashing in your brain it seems so easy so obvious you build more unlocking building sets as you go the synergies begin to awaken neural pathways in your brain you consider the combinations the space available to you carefully patiently you place each building one at a time to maximize the points for each and every placement

but with each island the bigger picture paints itself upon your psyche you realize how foreplanning is essential the later buildings the big ones like the temple the market and the oasis require space and design for maximum efficiency oh it seems so easy on the surface but the bulk of the iceberg hides sinisterly beneath the surface

the more you play the more you realize this simple casual game has depth beyond initial impressions

but while you are pondering those concepts the developers have quietly lured you in ensnared you you dont know it but you are now a captive islanders is a prison from which you cannot escape 

so innocent so simple on its surface islanders is not a game but an obsession i used to play wow yes that wow the one that has claimed the lives of people who would rather live their ingame lives than do what was necessary to survive in the real world

islanders is far more deadly than wow you cannot stop playing just try i dare you

if you are reading this know that i am now as you read this building an island carefully planning its layout and design i am placing buildings in what i believe is the best location available to maximize the points of that action i am a prisoner a willing prisoner i grant you

but the developers knew what they were doing grizzly is their name like the name of the team responsible this game will devour you hours will turn into days will turn into weeks do not buy this game i implore you

#####

be me
start playing the game
this seems pretty chill and easy 


3 hours later

just one more island

the greed for points is real its cool to see your little colonies become huge cities if you can build and manage well your space and the buildings themselves


game is addictive and really relaxed very simple and intuitive good to keep you focused and empty your mind for a while

totally worth it wont be stopping any time soon 

buy it

#####

a lovely little game thats a joy to play

also kudos to the devs for adding linux support the game works like a charm even on my aging thinkpad x230 running debian 99

#####

i always come back to this game to play for some hours it is so calm and beautiful is the perfect game to spend some time when you are stressed or feel like you need something calm 
also quite interesting see how the interactions between buildings work when aiming for a highscore

#####

very addictive puzzle game that has that just one more go factor my top score is currently ranked 15189th which may well be the highlight of my gaming career excellent price as well

#####

lets establish one thing this is a rougelike disguised as a casual citybuilder game

it lures you in with attractive landscapes and soothing music as it positively reinforces your obsessive compulsive tendencies with highpoint values when you start making poor cityplanning decisions and are denied resources to continue your cityorienting mania youre notified that thousands of people are better than you and that you better try again 

youll want to feed this addiction to the point where when you lay down rest youll see the photobleaching of numbers etched on your eyelids forcing you to reflect on the time you could have gotten 82 points for a market but only got 73 because you accidentally moved it a centimeter to the left 

if this sounds like your kind of poison this game is for you


#####

its not a city builder but it is a really fun and relaxing puzzle game

#####

this is a good game well worth the price of admission

the game isnt a fun little city builder when playing you have to put aesthetics aside because its not about making your city look good its all about optimal placement for each building to get awarded the most points while minimizing any penalties to keep playing you have to reach an ever increasing score threshold at some point youll accumulate enough points to progress to the next island if you havent unlocked the next island and fail to meet the next score threshold its game over

the strategy comes in understanding the building combinations that work well having a plan for where youre going to build and deciding which buildings to place first as you accumulate points youll be awarded more buildings you want to keep thinking ahead so that you can build up an area so that you can realize the maximum potential of those high scoring buildings for 100 points at a time however you have to be careful that youre not planning too far ahead and lose sight of the immediate goal of repeatedly hitting that scoring threshold eventually you will run out of room optimal scoring locations and youre done hopefully youve unlocked the next island to continue

i enjoy the game and do recommend it however its one of those games that is meant to be played multiple times always trying to beat your best score it can start to get repetitive even with the procedurally generated islands then after playing a few hours and reaching a new high score its a bit deflating starting back at the first island with 0 points thats just the way the game is

i was told this was relaxing buti i have spent 7 hours screaming because i cant get every building in perfectly

#####

beats the 1hour test

#####

giving it a thumbs up although i applied for a refund its not a bad game at all but its not what i was looking for i expected a city builder kind of game but this is more a puzzle game with a city builder theme if you look for a beautiful relaxing puzzler with a citysettlement theme you came to the right spot

#####

have you ever been playing an rpg like skyrim or dungeons and dragons or something along those lines and you open up a chest and you find two items in it and the one item has perfect stats and you know it will make you twice as strong but when you put it on its like a little orange fez with a propeller on it and the other item is something awesome like a spiked full plate helm that matches your armor perfectly but has stats worse than what you were already wearing

yeah i hate that sht basically i hate any game that forces you to choose between ascetic appeal and competency this is doubly true of games like city builders where most of the fun comes from building a wonderful little settlement that you can stare down at wistfully while watching people run about on roads or drag wheat from the farmhouse to the granary or whatever

this game does not have little villagers running about and no resource management at all in fact but it was very clearly designed by people who share this aesthetic leaning this game is about placing buildings in the right spots and the cleverness of its design is apparent in the fact that the right places to put things are selected so that they optimize both the beauty and success of each of your little settlements  designing your settlements to maximize your score inevitably results in beautiful scenic farmsteads and little clusters of adorable houses that seem to blend perfectly into their surroundings add to this the fact that islanders gameplay is as addictive as it is simple to learn and you have something rather special

this game is one of those rare little gems you find from time to time that costs next to nothing but winds up being a crowd favorite anyways i doubt ill be getting a three digit playtime on this when its all said and done but im glad i picked it up

#####

i work in healthcare and this peaceful game is helping me to deal with covid19

#####

thumbs up despite not liking it its very nicely crafted and soothing dirt cheap as well just not for me as i need more from a game also pixel hunting isnt my definition of fun having it gridbased ala annocaesar would be more for me but i know its not the popular opinion

#####

more puzzle than city builder this small game is full of replay value for leaderboard chasers it takes a short time to understand the mechanics and relationship between buildings in the game after that it is all about the rng to determine how pleasant or frustrating of an experience you will have it is nice and casual even relaxing most of the time

a charming minimalist strategy game whose chief goal seems to be for you to relax and have fun 

the bob ross of strategy games if you will

#####

if you like playing solo boardgames but are tired of the setup islanders is the perfect game for you

smart deeper than it looks and tricky to truly master the game is priced way too low

#####

i dont like very many games but a friend recommended this one after hearing exhaustive detail about exactly what i wanted and islanders is exactly what i wanted  the scoring mechanic is gently puzzly the graphics are pretty the sound is wholly optional there is not a whiff of time pressure anywhere the procedural generation keeps it feeling constructive and new  the games trailer was a very good and honest intro to the concept and i advise watching it

two things id change if i could id like something inbetween sandbox and high score mode where the point mechanic continued to exist but didnt affect what buildings you could grab  omitting scoring entirely makes sandboxing feel a little too wheelspinny even for my game i play when im spinning my wheels  and secondly i wish there continued in highscore mode to be meaningful choices about which building sets to receive instead of a weird number of parks and walls accumulating till its impossible to go farther even with lots of space left on your island  its occurred to me that this might be to make the islands not get too processing intensive but still

#####

keep the poor and rich in separate cities for more points

#####

can play onehanded great for casual play while eating

#####

few games can combine opposite qualities as well as iislandersi does its a minimalistic game on the surface but deep at its core it is captivating even if at times it can get a tad repetitive  it is addictive and at the same time it has infinite replay value it is relaxing and calming but it makes you challenge yourself without being demanding and above all its a really really beautiful and complex experience that can appeal to a very wide range of gamers out there

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1711359348
in iislandersi we build miniature worlds that can fit on one island elegant good looking cities surrounded by farms with fields stone or wood processing units and mines the whole gameplay consists in building this world by strategically placing buildings one at a time every building gives a certain number of points when it is placed on the map and those points are computed based on what other buildings it has in range some buildings like each other and must be placed together while others have to be spread apart in order to avoid a point loss what at first sight seems to be a very casual  sandboxy city builder soon transforms into a strategy game of finding the setups that award the most points in the current configuration or the best placements that are imposed by the randomly generated relief of the island in order to make the most of certain buildings like the city center for example which gives bonus to houses and mansions youll end up tetrising the buildings around it squeezing as many of them as you can into the smallest space possible taking this strategy one step further youll soon find yourself planning ahead the positioning of the massive temple building which is pretty much the cashcow of the game and constructing everything else while leaving space for its placement when it will later be available its one of the endgame buildings

iislandersi is not a turnbased game but its gameplay is stepped  tired in the sense that you are given only a few buildings at a time using those to reach a certain score allows you to select the next pack of 6 buildings and so on failing to reach the target score of the current stage makes you lose the game while reaching that target score contributes to the progression towards the next island when a certain point threshold is reached you can choose between continuing to play on the current island vs moving on to the next with a very different relief type and starting anew the points are carried over in this case the game is linear there is no level selection its just moving from island to island and spending as much time you want on the current island with the remark that sooner or later you will have to move to the next island because the target scores will be impossible to reach its a game that can be both played for hours at a time as well as with breaks inbetween

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1705593134
one of the many things i liked about iislandersi is that it lets you choose the difficulty level you can play it in a very casual mode not bothering to even reach the points needed to go to the next island because you can always start anew or you can play a bit more strategically in order to have an islandstreak basically collecting enough points to go to the next one and then gathering more and more points with each island you traverse until you lose the game  in the end you are awarded with a spot in the daily leaderboard and finally you can play it in a more hardcore way getting the most of the game placing every single building in its optimal spot making calculations ahead of time planning where to build and what squeezing those points until the last drop its entirely up to you to decide how challenging you want to the game to be or how much micromanagement you want to do

i cant say it enough this game is really good its lovely captivating extremely cleverly made and for the modest price of 5 its a steal dont hesitate to buy it you wont regret it

overall
a fun and cheap game to play casually unless you plan to challenge the top scores which i dont really bother to hahaha randomly generated islands with a simple goal keep building to unlock next set of buildings or the next island that you can build on definitely worth it for the price

pros
deceptively fun and tempting enough for a short run to go over a couple of hours 
looks beautiful for a simple game and concept is easy to pick up as well
cheap and smooth running no bugscrashes
sandbox mode is fun to just mess around

cons
not much to play for once you played long enough and went through all the available buildings
no story or anything to take note of the goal is basically to keep building as efficiently as possible till the next set of buildings are available or the next island is unlocked
not much reason to return or continue once you played far enough

honestly to anyone who lives a stressful life or deals with mental health issues i can not recommend this game enough i got out of the armed forces in 2017 and have been dealing with severe adjustment disorder ever since ive been enjoying islanders the past few days but tonight i had something else in my life set off my mental illness and an extreme level of ragedepression after fuming for a little bit i decided to load up islanders an hour later i hadnt even realized how much time had gone by and i find myself completely relaxed and calm i dont think any other game has ever done that for me before every game has a catch or something that just rubs you with stress i just finished an island with 36743675 points means i needed 1 more point for my next pack of buildings but i couldnt get it as i was out of buildings so i had to move to a new island and it didnt stress me in the slightest 

the graphics are pleasant
the gameplay is extremely simple to pick up but clearly expansive to attempt to master
its inexpensive
and its a massively helpful tool for temporary relief of mental illness including rage and depression

1010 can not recommend enough

#####

what i thought to be a colony managercity builder turned out to be more of of a city builderpuzzle you read that right you build a city on one to the next that is if you choose to but heres the catch you gotta plan out your building placements to get the best out of it if you do well youll get the required score to make more buildings you do badly you lose each buildings has their own restrictions so read their description carefully to know where to place them its a fun game and i highly recommend this its easy to understand and but it has some island formations or environments than can challenge you

pros
 the design of the game is simplistic and beautiful
 the islands formations are mostly distinct from each other so youre not gonna play them over and over again
 very calming

cons
 sadly no matter how hard youve worked on an island in highscore mode you cant go back to it once youve decided to move on to the next island all that progress will be lost other than your score so prepare to take screenshots if youre ready to move on but still love what you did with your current island

if anything there should be an option to save islands for future viewing but thats just me i have made several colonies in different islands that i would really like to look at again but screenshots are the only way to do so

#####

i fell in love with this game when i realized you can ctrlz to undo

#####

well this is good thing to pass some time but it is essentialy not a city builder but a puzzle or more to be more exact  tetris

#####

buy on sale this is maximize points by placement to beat your previous score  it is purely a casual moveyourmouse across the island to see points before placement  this is not create a unique island based on your imagination because you wont get enough points to keep playing  you need a chunk of time there is no save feature  

i personally prefer to gather resources to build what i want where i want  worth a few  entertainment on sale

#####

this is an absolute gem of a game with such a low cost and gameplay so simple and breezy youd think there was little depth youd be wrong after almost 20 hours sunk im still captivated by the complexities that arise from such an elegant game design 

the zen like relaxational state this game induces combined with the one more turn addictiveness make for one of the best game experiences ive had this year

it blows my mind that a few university students created this

#####

surprisingly great game

its a tetris of citybuilders in a way its similar to minimetro and similar mobile games but it has a bigger scale and requires precise input theres no rush and the controls are great you put buildings on a map one at a time each building has an influence radius various buildings give or take points for putting a building down get enough points and you select a new set of buildings get even more points and you earn a ticket to a next random island you can go to after youve finished with the current one

its very simple and very chill yet theres a lot to learn and there are different ways to organize your buildings random maps provide a lot of variety

this game would probably feel done after a few hours but those are good hours at this cost its a steal

#####

this game scratches so many itches that i dont know where to start

ive always been stuck in this paradoxical situation in that i love building cities but dont like most city builders this new take solves so many problems i had with games like simcity 

first of all is the intensity i dont want to he stressed out by a building sim but i do want to be engaged everything from the aesthetic the soundtrack and the mechanics relax you in this game there are also no time limits which always sour my fun however there is still a lot of strategy its easy to learn hard to master you need to think ahead and plan your urban centres the lack of a bulldozer means that each placement is significant and could easily bite you later

that actually leads to my only issue so far i really wish there was an undo last move feature as i can be a real idiot some times and am prone to miss clicks apart from that all id really like from them is more of what they already have going 

build pretty cities in an engaging way that does not stress you out that is the sales pitch and the game captures its goal perfectly think im going to to be returning to this game quite a lot over the next few years

seriously kudos to you devs great work

#####

this isnt really a citybuilder as much as its tetris with a citybuilder skin that said its relaxing to play very lowpressure and is a fun gentle game for when youre feeling delicate  the transient nature of your cities each city is discarded never to be seen again once you complete each island makes this game ultimately feel a bit cheaper than it is and with nothing besides a highscore to earn from island to island there is no sense of progress or achievement

in any other game these would be bad things  but together with its ambient soundtrack they turn it into a highquality mobilestyle game where you can pleasantly idle away time with no consequences  recommended for anyone taking a sickday or is hungover and wants something to play that wont ask much of them

#####

i really enjoyed playing this minimalist strategy game found it most fun and relaxing its a game that is mostly easy to learn as you play although i will say there are a few guides that can help out quite a bit

there is a small amount of micromanagement involved but once you learn how all the pieces are placed high scores are achievable when you start your first island you are given a choice of what type of pack of buildings you wish to start with to start with a few farm city woodcutters fishing brewery mason are buildings you will deal most in the early part of the game as you progress on your first island you will gain points as you place buildings down you will have a point total to make before you can progress to another island as you move from island to island the land areas also becomes bigger so you have more to work with

each building in the game has certain other buildings they work with gaining you even more points as well as other buildings they do not work with which will lose points when placed near them the buildings have a zone of influence which determines if other buildings are in their zone and what all will cause positive and negative point effects so you will be learning where to place certain types of buildings in zones away from other types of buildings that would negatively affect them

now once you start the game and pick your first pack of buildings you will continue to have a choice of packs once you reach point totals to open up your next pack sometimes you are able to save packs for later placement if you reach your point totals with good placement strategy this will also help you to bigger point totals since you can plan better with more choices in buildings

overall the game isnt too easy as you do need to think over placements but is easy to learn making it a perfect game to relax with but not being too boring the graphics are very nice and really fit the game as well as the music  the achievements are all pretty easy with the exception of making it to the third island in a run under 4 minutes but it is doable so 100 achievements can be doneits very satisfying when you get that placement that scores you a huge point total

#####

great game i was worried that i would find the puzzles repetitive but instead i love them theyre challenging too i wake up early in the morning and play this game with a cup of coffee  makes for a really peaceful and relaxing morning  highly recommend this to anyone looking for something that will hold your attention make you think but also keep you feeling calm

#####

relaxing fun replayable and just cute
this game is worth more than it costs

this game costs about 1 on sales
this game is better than fallout 76 anthem and other 60 aaa titles

also this game cures anxiety and softens depression at least for me

just a cute little game to pass some time here and there

#####

i feel like a dork for giving this a thumbs down but i think marking it as a citybuilder game is a little misleading

it has a great concept but it lacks depth i just finished a session that lasted about half an hour and i was bored the music on a loop started to grate at me and i was hoping it would finish soon

that said it is a novel game lovely graphics lovely music until you hear the same track for the thousanth time lol and yet lacking depth it gets tedious the buildings dont actually do anything so to recognize what they are to get the most points you willl be mousing over them a lot to see the name and youll be just mousing around a lot to find the best place to put the next buildings

its cheap so you can try it and make sure you check out reviews so you know exactly what you are getting

#####

a total sleeper dirt cheap runs on a toaster easy to pick up but deceptively deep graphics and audio are extremely pleasant you cant afford not to get this game

#####

islanders is quite a unique take on the genre 
the game puts you on a randomly generated island and your job is to generate a certain amount of points to advance to the next 
      
after a you reach a certain score you get to choose from a pool of building options each with their own unique set of buildings which greatly impacts your progress since not all buildings are usefull on each island type  
there isnt any population you have to care for if you enjoy that then you wont become happy with this game its more of new take on the genre 
            
i enjoyed my time with the game a lot and for the small price it offers a lot you really cant do much wrong if the concept of it sounds interesting to you 


#####

this is another game that seems very similar to dorfromantic but without the dominocarcasonne type mechanics it is not totally pointless like townscaper which is not even really game

like dorfromantic youre pretty much limited to placing objects from a small inventory but you have more latitude in how the objects are placed its basically dorfromantic without the fixed tiles and tile grid instead the limitations are what terrain buildings can be placed on and where you can place them to gain the most points and not lose points

#####

i honestly have no idea where the time flies when i play this game its just putting building on the island and then another one and another one and another one and another one five hours later and another one and another one

h1from threading the needle in superflight to cluttering an estate with as little wasteh1

this aint icivilizationi the whole strategy comes with placing buildings within proximity to other buildings that synergize with it and away from buildings that lose value from it in order to have a positive net value and establish that site iits like finding a location with a bdowsing rodbi you can rotate and snap buildings into position for maximum density or however you may want it to be presented for aesthetic purposes as the goal of the game doesnt always need to be to attain the highest possible score out of a given island once youve adequately drained an island out of more possible growth or youve run out of points to spend and cant get any more but youve fulfilled the gauge to fo the next island you can just take a screenshot and move on to decorate a new one where you would either be given an even more variety of buildings to play with or be put into a scarce situation where you must make ends meet to travel to the next island in order to continue the run

there are no builders rulers researchers or anything that forces you to wait for things to complete or turns to pass the game gives you everything you would want to do at your fingertips and you can take it as slow or fast as you want it as well as pauseresume quitreturn at any time without punishing you for it

mouseonly gaming is possible too you dont need a keyboard you cant accidentally place anything while dragging the map so you neednt take unnecessary precautions or anything and even if you do place something that didnt snap into place correctly you can undo one step back with a full refund and no consequence

the natural way these cities form abiding by the valuecount system is fascinating mansions are closer to city centers while houses are further away so circuses end up in the outskirts of cities which creates a gradient of poorer folk as they get further away from the city centers while jewelry stores being closer to mansions has gold mines near them like the california gold rush where richer people built their homes on gold money if you leave gaps in between cities temples will be very profitable later on 

just like with superflight they had a great and honest trailer to explain what their hypercasual game is all about without needing to show you a flashy montage because those who do usually just have a product thats more style over substance

#####

the game does not ask much of you but youll want to take a screenshot of your town before moving on every time

islanders review

this adventure never ends

some key points that this game offers

1	procedural generation the fun never ends
2	two gameplay modes
3	indie gem 55

gameplay  controls

the game is played with your keyboard and mouse the layout and keys are pretty simplistic this is in no way whatsoever a bad thing this is simply a minimalistic game that doesnt require much to offer you hours of joy

you start the game on one island choosing between two build packs once chosen it is up to you to determine where to place your buildings depending on the position that you build you will receive a score for each placed building there are several factors that multiply the score it can either be increased or receive a loss it comes down to some strategic thinking 
as you build up your island and reach the score threshold you get to choose more building packs and expand your island as you build up your score you will get closer to unlocking the next island 

graphics

absolutely beautiful the colours are so vibrant and warm it not only welcomes you but keeps you busy for hours the weather conditions for such a tiny game are quite brilliant it brings your tiny islands to life  there is a gorgeous day and night cycle that takes place there is snow there are sunny days and so much more

you can see the birds in flight the wind at work turning your windmill there is so much detail to all the tiny aspects of this game that one can simply say it is a work of art it is masterfully done

there are a wide variety of buildings that can be built and every single one of them is unique in size and colour further adding beauty to this game

sounds

islanders creates a relaxing atmosphere for you to play casually without investing hard hours of gaming the sounds and background music are key here each island is an adventure made better by the relaxing music that soothes the soul
there are a variety of sounds in the game whether you are building or simply enjoying the view you will not feel alone or empty there will be good music and sounds accompanying you

replayability

islanders offers us procedural generation in a score based environment simply stated the fun never ends you can keep going to see how many islands you unlock you can go at it to keep beating your own score or to try and take the number one spot on the leaderboards

last but not least sandbox mode

mgr gamings conclusions
spoilers ahead

islanders is the perfect getaway experience it is tiny but packs a massive punch if you had a hard day at work and are looking for some casual gaming without investing too much effort islanders is for you it can be played over and over again whether you are just casually playing it or artistically it will offer you a unique adventure every time

the sandbox mode is the cherry on top it gives you the power at your finger tips to truly test your skills out and create the perfect islanders that your imagination can dream up

this is a game every gamer must have great for stress reducing and to simply break away when a break is needed islanders sells for a steal these developers have created something beautiful for a very low price they should be supported
if they can create something this amazing for such a low cost imagine what they can create for us with a bigger budget and the community behind them we need more developers like this

#####

im not sure that i can call this game as relaxing as i would of hoped there are limitations set by a requirement of improvement almost a mastery of each island youre given this to me makes the game feel methodical but almost plays detrimentally to the idea of something calming

i recommend the game but feel it isnt as calming as intended nor is it as relaxing as the player may hope

keep this in mind upon purchase

#####

has that one more turn thing 15 mins becomes 3 hours

#####

this game totally doesnt deserve 2 it deserves at least 510 i feel bad that i bought it for 2 and to support the devs i gifted it to 3 other people

first time playing 2 hours straight very relaxing at first then micro management kicks in in order to get highest points possible and get every achievement

relaxing music cute graphics challenging islands puzzles endless possibilities procedural maps perfect to watch a movielisten to something and relaxing your eyes at this gem

also if you manage to create a nice city then you got yourself some nice 4k wallpapers high res graphics  photo mode

its a bargain dont hesitate to buy it
i recommend this game

#####

i got this game as part of a fanatical bundle a while back but its slowly became a favourite chill out game of mine if im feeling stressed the soundtrack is chill the graphics are pretty and even though there is a high score mode its not really all that intense so its a rather relaxed challenge

overall i recommend this to anyone who gets overwhelmed with existing its a relaxing game and very easy to pick up 
8 cities out of 10

#####

hmmmmmfirst hour of playing this game meh its ok quite nice
second hourok i understand this game now
third houromg its a charming little game
seventh hour ok stop now take a break you like the game we get it

sweet and charming little game

#####

this game is a delight in many many ways and i loved it so much that i bought the devs other game just to support them a bit more

my favourite thing the sound design as you grow your city on each island it truly grows as the noises of living mix in with nature and the soothing music how the sound fades in and out of each area is not the only detail about it that i love but its a big one sometimes i just spend some time looking and listening

the gameplay is condensed to its near max but zeroes in amazingly on the satisfying aspects of playing these builders for me slotting things together nicely making things look cool and being functional enough the score system to move on is just enough of a challenge to be motivating but not crushing

one of my all time faves

to the devs if you ever put out dlc for this or further iterate on it in any way you have my money

i got islanders thinking it would be a city builder when really its more of a deckbuilding scoreattack puzzle roguelike strategy game disguised as a city builder

i like it but thats what it is not really a city builder in the same vein as tropico or city skylines i strongly recommend watching gameplay footage before considering a purchase but i found that its a very interesting and addictive game once i got past my initial expectations definitely worth the asking price if it seems appealing after viewing gameplay footage

#####

a great cooldown game for when it gets heated in rocket league 0_0 910 just please add the ability to zoom in and out and then it would be 10

#####

bargain of a game especially on sale if you are into city builder games or puzzle placement ones enjoyed all my 70 hours sometimes you just need a game to come home from after work when too tired to do much else a game which is easy to play and chill as f islanders has been that game for me i would do a procon list but honestly would be half a page of a dozen positive things to say about this game over one or two minor criticisms which honestly doesnt detract any enjoyment from the overall experience 

as a wise man once said any game that has had effort put in and is cheaper than a price of a sandwich you really cant go wrong with and this game is great for what it is too bad the average price of a sandwich has inflated to the point beyond where it would now be cheaper to buy this game twice good times 

#####

very fun  relaxing for the price this is a steal as for suggestions add creative mode id also love some more unique buildings for the island type youre on esp for late game and i wish there were some more developed animations  maybe fishing ships could go out and catch etc

thank you for your lovely games guys

#####

straightforward trailer had me sold am now segregating the rich from the poor at any opportunity

#####

bdo you like games typical iphoneandroid games where you can waste 30 minutes on doing nothing getting bored moving to a new game and then returning back to that game because it was a guilty pleasure 

do you have hundreds of games downloaded on steam because you have a spending problem and have low attention spans

do you spend 499 the price of the game for delivery from your typical grubhububer eatsdoordashjustshutupandtakemymoney places to eat b 

if you answered yes to any of those questions then this game is a good one for you  

so ive recently had to quarantine due to the pandemic and started looking for casual games compared to my usual overwatch cod league of legends gameplay and this is pretty fun its self intuitive and is sorta like a mini city builder you basically build an island till you cant anymore and then trash that island and upgrade to a better one until you lose at first it is confusing but it has an easy learning curve it took me about an hour to figure almost everything out now i just need memory to remember which items benefits others to be faster but is not necessary in order to be good at the game just so that i dont have to read every time 

for 5 bucks its not bad to have for a game to just sit and collect dust i got it for 2 dollars on sale so you might get lucky with that as well and then it is well worth the buy 

id give the game a 910 the only downside is that i feel you should be able to save an island to where you can at least go back and look at it several times my island ends up looking cool and i just want to be  able to save it to look at the masterpiece that i made other than that its great

#####

this game is awesome so relaxing and its so satisfying building your own little city when i progress to the next island increasing my score i get so sad leaving my old city behind 

#####

i miss black and white series  this is the best current alternative for me

#####

very simple and satisfying gameplay relaxing this game doesnt push you to play in a certain way or speed and the inability to save games makes it very easy to keep going and not hold onto your ultimate best my one gripe is not being able to save islands as images

#####

fun and simple city builder you start on a random island and roll a certain type of building like lumber mill or houses then you try to place them in the best spot this is where the challenge comes in buildings grant points based on modifiers like terrain or other buildings they are near for example building houses near a city grants extra points 
once you reach a certain point threshold you can choose to stay and rack up a higher score or you can abandon the island and move on to a new randomly generated island if you dont get enough points its game over its simple in a way but also deep no two runs are the same games can take anywhere from 10 mins to upwards of an hour if youre luckyskilled enough

#####

the other reviews say more than enough

ill just comment on the mechanics a little to help you decide if you like it

this game is all about sequence you get a score only from the piece youre working with and its radius

circus benefits from house within circus range there is one house when you place circus and you get points for one house if you later place another house within the range of the circus you wont get any extra points a lot of the time it makes no sense but thats how it is circus has a bigger range house has a smaller range

if the above doesnt annoy you then go ahead

tl dr its a puzzle game not a city building game get all the achievements and move on

#####

islanders  its a really nice simple game with great graphics its core is a city builder but with a twist its like playing tetris with you having to place buildings into a limited place its got a nice soundtrack and a colorful palette of colors which is in my opinion a really nice change of pace in a city builder game however there are some flaws in the game there is no life in the game you dont see your villagers traders or whatever you would have on your islands so it is a bit bland and dead but the biggest flaw in my opinion would be that when you advance to the next island you cant go back to your previous islands to build more or even to just look at it however it is worth the price

this game is truly one of a kind 
there is a bit of strategy to this game that you learn as you go or you can check out the community guides each building has bonuses and penalties to placing them near certain buildings or other features on the maps there are neat synergies in planning what areas of your island will go together some maps afford very little space making them very challenging while others are more straightforward the difficulty intensifies with each map 
islanders can be played casually or with the intent to get a high score the music and aesthetics are unbelievable i wish i had the soundtrack it is so good there are also little bird sounds and other sweet noises that really help you zen out and enjoy tf out of some chill building time this game is super small and runs well making it an easy one for folks with less powerful computers or for people looking to add something on their work or school laptops 
make sure you take screenshots of your beautiful creations i hope you enjoy this game as much as i have

one of my favorite games of all time it can be enjoyed for hours with no island ever being the same after awhile it starts to feel very meditative as a person who cant keep their hands still while watching tvtalking with friends this game is a fantastic lowthought experience that always ends up designing a beautiful island

#####

played it thought it was cute and fun but lacking depth played again and now im seeing adjacency bonuses for 50 different buildings with my eyes closed this game is the exact definition of easy to learn but hard to master it abstracts so much away that it i expected it to feel dry but i still end up feeling very proud of every city i built

bislandersb is a beautiful city builder of sorts but you dont have to worry about anything other than placing available buildings where they give you the most points its still a good idea to think ahead a bit though

heres how it works youre presented with a brandomly generatedb small island and a choice of two packs of buildings choose one check the tooltips to find out which buildings go or dont go together and place them accordingly once you reach enough points to level up as seen in the bottom left corner you can choose between two packs again and eventually the island silhouette in the bottom right will fill up and you can move on to the next random island i wish the game would tell you how many points or levels you need exactly though

new islands tend to get bigger but they dont necessarily form one landmass and most likely theyre in a different biome which is only cosmetic you can keep playing the same level until you run out of buildings to place might as well as its all about high scores and bif you run out of structures its game overb a back to menu button would be nice to have here or if the next island has been unlocked you can move on keeping your points but not any remaining buildings

and thats all there is to it believe it or not its a bsimple concept does what it has to really wellb but it may not be everybodys cup of tea i dont normally play endless games or ones that only offer randomly generated levels as i get bored of them really fast and wasnt expecting to get more than 1 or 2 hours out of this either but 5 hours flew by pretty fast and i could probably play a bit more but ive already seen all the buildings and probably every biome as well

theres also a bsandbox modeb where you can place whatever you want wherever you want including water weirdly and with the bphoto modeb icon you can hide the ui esc brings it back and take lovely screenshots of your creations because chasing scores can mean things ending up in weird places a few millimeters to the left or right can give you a bunch more points and to hell with anything else gotta get ahead on the leaderboard which tends to glitch out and display random scores instead of your own best

bthe graphics are wonderfulb plenty of settings separate volume sliders windowed mode resolutions etc baudio is functionalb meaning the sound effects arent annoying and the musics barely noticable it can be good in a game like this but i wouldve liked something more memorable to improve the overall picture even further

mouse and keyboard are supported and bcontrols are intuitive and rebindableb left click moves the map around right click rotates mouse wheel zooms inout byou should be able to zoom out furtherb though and bundo is availableb as well

bi can wholeheartedly recommend the gameb its completely relaxing and this from someone who shouts at solitaire looks and plays really well and its ideal for playing for a few hours in one sitting or short bursts as byour progress is saved automaticallyb its not too expensive either but if you think the games onenote nature isnt in accordance with the price just wait for a sale

i love the living crap out of this game the graphics are what initially got my attention but after watching the video i thought id give it a try let me tell you this game is wonderful it leaves out the stress of getting stuck on challenges or tasks but keeps the strategy element with so much going on in my life this game has been super relaxing the graphics the audio and the gameplay are amazing i do have a list of things i think would really add to the game as well if the creator is open to suggestions id love to see more types of buildingsindustry farms with animals would be super super cute overall adding some sort of life would really enhance this game animating little animals and people in the towns would be awesome shipyards would be a cool add as well paths and stairs to help get from the different land levels would be super nice as well and help to really connect all the buildings that are on separate layers

this game runs super smooth and the only weird glitch i have ran into is that sometimes after placing a building the camera movers out to the ocean which can be a little confusing if possible it would also be nice if in the settings we could turn off or turn down the clouds they hide my kelp farms in the ocean really well 

again i love this game and i am super excited to see what the future holds for it

#####

the music of the game is awesome

#####

at 650 this game is a steal infinite replay value strategy with zero stress tiny game the shoehorning is incredible i have had it crash a couple times but havent lost data to my knowledge the simplicity leads the way for likeability

#####

very tranquil type of game zen something i return to whenever i am in a bad headspace no rush chill music  cute artstyle the core concept is very simple but getting far andor highscoring can be a challenge recommend it to anyone even if daily life isnt massively overwhelming to you

#####

fairly simple and relaxing city builder with a roguelikerandomized component that generates a different island each time you play and jump to the next mechanically its basically the city building equivalent of a caravan shmup where you aim to score the highest with the tools and combos you deploy on the surface youre given however that randomized componet will make it so that some runs will be far less optimal than others regardless of that fact the game is built in such a sleek and efficient way that you will overlook that bit most of the achievements are fairly engaging nudging you towards the game mechanics combos speed building clever building placement and terrain examination so they are a good way to track your progress across the board

there is a fair share of building combinations and types to keep you engaged for a while just dont expect an hyper complex level of simulation ala cities series or sim city

performance wise it runs great without any hiccups and at least on my configuration i required no tinkering in the options menu i wish more things were this playable straight out of the box without long winded tutorials and such its bam straight into the building overall it may not last you long but the hours it offers are fun and relaxing and if youre in doubt pick it up on a sale itl lbe even more worth it recommended

#####

i kind of cant believe how good this game is

the amount of depth is just right and by only needing to make a few decision at any given time theres no stress  it allows you to end up with pretty intuitive and complex islands without having to plan ahead

just beautiful and super zen

#####

if you like dorfromantik youll love islander

just saw i clocked 50 hours into islanders so time to write a short thumps up review 

as other reviews will tell you this a very laid back and nicely looking cityisland builder there is a fair amount of different buildings which give modifiers for a load of other buildings in this way you will reach a threshold after which you can move to a next island so no timers no enemies and definitely no stress 

and that is the strongest point of the game the accumulated game time is not because i play this game all the time no obviously i played a lot when the game was new and i saw different buildings and islands for the first time but where other games are uninstalled andor forgotten after the new factor wears of islanders is still there from time to time i pick up the game again if i have a bit of spare time but not enough to start up a bigger game or i just feel like a light game and in game i am on a so far more or less infinite run where i build one after the other of the most marvellously looking island cities clog them up andmove on to a different island to start building again maybe the same day maybe the next month definitely recommended

relaxing puzzle game nice achievements not very grindy

city builders have come a long way over the years simcity was one of the first pc games i ever played decades ago the growth in complexity ai and realism have made them increasingly complex and left behind the mild relaxing gameplay of their beginnings islanders seeks to take the genre back to its roots at least on the surface

abbreviated review httpsyoutube7k5uz7k6g_w

h1jigsaw cityh1
when getting into islanders it quickly becomes difficult to put it in the genre of city builder sure you ultimately build a town but the gameplay is hardly traditional you start by selecting a one of two types of buildings which provides you with a packet of individual buildings to place the collection of different structures dont require any resources to place only the right surface on which to place them it can vary between one or two individual buildings up to around ten but you dont have to place them all immediately

the challenge of the game comes in placing buildings near resources and other buildings to get bonus points each one has a set of other types of buildings that award score bonuses if placed within a certain sphere of influence this process is simple at first but as you get items that require specific terrain and real estate becomes rarer placing a building for the maximum number of points can be difficult buildings also have counterparts that reduce the point value so that must be considered as well

this process adds points to a pool that unlocks more packets of buildings for you to place it also serves as the failure state since if you fail to fill the pool before you run out of buildings its game over however if you do manage to fill all of the terrain or run out of points you may have still scored enough points to unlock the next island this transfers you to a new procedurally generate space to start all over and continue collecting points

h1high scores vs maximum relaxationh1
trying to strategize and maximize your building placement and selection can make islanders into a somewhat competitive game you can traverse through islands inflating your score so that when you do ultimately lose or abandon the run your score leaps up the online ladder for the tiny bit of personal prestige that affords on the other hand you can just sit back and slap down buildings as you please to make a town that generates the bare minimum of points this type of gameplay can easily put you in a zenlike state

at times it can feel like playing civilization games where you just lose track of time opening up and placing just one more pack of buildings the somber and relaxing music adds to this overall effect but the limited song selection can quickly get old even with its forgettable nature however the lack of any need for sound cues makes it easy to turn on whatever music you want while playing i still opted for a relaxing variety but the freedom to do so is appealing i do wish it had a better and more diverse soundtrack though

whichever way you play the ease with which you can get into the game makes either choice viable the concepts required for strategic play are simple to understand but require foresight to put together properly keeping the gameplay chill requires so little effort that it almost feels like the game puts you in a trance its a pleasant balance to have in any game

h1not the new york islandersh1
ive come to appreciate the innovation indie game developers bring to wellestablished genres the freedom and accessibility of game development have led to some wonderful experiences over the past few years in particular islanders falls into that spectrum the game takes something very familiar to someone like me and gives it just enough of a twist to make it feel like a new evolution  

while islanders isnt a something that will occupy you for days at a time its a magnificent game to drop into for any length of time from minutes to hours its a game you can play on a desktop or laptop with ease to occupy whatever free time you want it to moreover its only 5 at its base price so its worth getting at any time even without a sale the combination of ease of access simple rewarding gameplay and a low price makes this a ridiculously easy recommendation

h1overviewh1
islanders is an amazingly unique game from indie developers grizzlygames the music artstyle mechanics etc all blend together quite nicely creating a relaxing experience for any type of person to enjoy 


h1prosh1
   stress reliever time killer and more when first reading about the game and its reviews i was interested in the amount of people who talked about the games ability to let the player lose track of time to my surprise they were right first time playing through the game and i already had an hour on record


   simple to understand when you first start up the game there will be basic instructions on how to navigate the game after that youre essentially left to figure things out on your own this isnt a bad thing however as you learn very quickly your objective what that objective is basically is to strategically place down various buildings that come in a series of kits ex lumber kit city pack etc doing so will accumulate points that collect towards a point goal which will ultimately unlock more kits as your progress further 


   not your average city builder there is no resource management like in a typical city builder utilizing certain buildings spacing points etc is the only real management you have to conduct in the game as many others have said its more of a puzzle than a city builder 


   beautiful artstyle like iextremelyi beautiful i cannot put into words how breathtaking this game can get just look at some of the screenshots the developers provide and youll get a good gauge at how amazing the game looks i believe each island is procedurally generated so no two islands are alike there are some aspects that could use tweaking that ill go over in the next section 


h1consh1
   mechanics although the game has some simple mechanics that make it as great as it is there are minor things that could be added that would make the game even better first off an undoremovemove feature in the large amount of islands ive gone through there are many times were i make the mistake of placing a building in the wrong spot or misclicking etc having a feature to do any of those three things would be a major improvement all around 


   creative modefreebuild this game has so much potential when it comes to making photogenic moments if a freebuild mode was added i believe there could be so many scenic islands to be made 


   cinematic mode as stated before this game provides tons upon tons of scenic moments having some sort of cinematicphoto mode or option would provide players the ability to make a lot of amazing art 


h1summaryh1
in the long run islanders has a lot of potential adding in a couple more features here and there tweaking certain mechanics etc would provide many more hours of fun to the game this is for sure one of my favorite games that i plan to come back to from time to time to just relax and unwind from a long day 


#####

games enjoyable and fun to pass the time with it has a unique feel and the achievements are mostly obtainable i say mostly because of an achievement added recently beat 21 islands and each island takes longer and longer to complete mess up one and you have to restart no restarting if the island you get is poor and well no island counter great game before the recent achievements and still good but now it seems more repetitive and boring as you attempt a 100 you will have fun if you do not mind that hope for a huge challenge attempt it but be wary not to burn yourself out of the games potential joy i will probably attempt it again one day but its a shame to get sent back to island one to have such an achievement

#####

very relaxed game super satisfying and even has online scoreboard well worth the couple quid

#####

outstanding little game
 space  management limited resources plotting over islands
allocation of space for maximum efficiency towards highscores
game keeps on going as long as target score are reached unlocking more buildings to place
when all if filled or pleased with your current status could move on to the next island

creativity patience and good eye to count and plan your estate
basically limitless if played right
which is harder than you assume

bought the game the rush of the unlocking of rarest reach 3rd island within four minutes achievement
without anymore hesitation could slow the pace in endless highscore mode

time flies being captivated and engrossed by the rush motivation to keep expanding
hours spent solely on even a small island 
could see myself playing this bit by bit on a daily basis


very pleased with my purchase
highly recommend

#####

self titled city builder islanders is more like a lowkey strategy puzzle game with a city building theme game play is very simple and straightforward yet oddly satisfying its one of those games thats easy to learn but hard to master in the long run the soundtrack and visuals are great and really set a colorful and relaxing atmosphere to zone out to while you play not really anything bad i can say about this game what you see is really what you get chill game for some casual gameplay 1010 would vibe to this again

#####

this game is basically about building a city and optimising the best spots to gain the most points you play in a rather calm atmosphere and it is relatively easy to play the point of the game is simple but being really good at it could take some time and thinking this game is really replayable but could be quite repetitive at the same time it has really clean and nice graphics which creates a unique style around the game i enjoyed this game for the few hours i played and recommend this game if you want a good few hours of a relaxing game

#####

its a fun little diversion but as time went on i couldnt shake the feeling that i was playing a freetoplay mobile game it follows the same cycle easy problem instant visual reward with minimal thinking required constant worry about having enough points to buy the solution to the next problem it lacks depth as advertised i suppose but also any sort of creative or gameplay satisfaction beyond i clicked a thing and a bunch of dots flew into a bigger dot

i enjoy city builders but often dont have the mental energy to devote to planning so the idea of a minimalist city builder appealed to me however i never got the i built that or that was broken and i fixed it sort of satisfaction city builders can provide oh well at least its cheap

#####

calling this game city builder is overstatement its more about placing randomly given buildings to wherever you get as much points as possible amount of points is determined how building is located in relation to existing building some buildings decrease and other buildings increase the points for a new building placed near them you need enough points to get the next set of random buildings when you dont the game ends

the graphics are kind of nice and the game is pretty relaxing so i wouldnt call it a bad game its fun for few hours but gets boring pretty quickly if you get it cheap its completely ok way to kill some time

#####

if you had a bad day and all you want is sit back relax and play a chill game this game is the best for you just buy it

#####

first time playing i sunk five hours very light and relaxing strategy game good to chill with a cup of coffee or tea great aesthetic great tunes all around a pleasant time

#####

i just think its neat

#####

i was recently lamenting the lack of modern undemanding games to play when you lack the energy or the focus to do other things games such as the old popcap games before ea happened to them and so forth 

it was with delight then that i came across this game for around the same amount that i might spend on a coffee and a muffin its got pleasing visuals a pleasant if unimaginitve soundtrack and straight forward game play 

the game doesnt ask much of you to begin with you place things down next to things that provide synergy and away from anti synergies then you begin to get absorbed and learn that placement order is sometimes quite impactful this is especially notable when you begin to plan multiple packs in advance 

soon youre eyeing out the terrain dreaming of a temple by the spire in the mountain with the mansions overlooking an idyllic agregrian villiage as your cities take shape in a delightfully hilter skilter style that is reminding you not to take it too seriously 

islanders is also kind to the player placing a building is final was it optimum who cares says the game lets just keep on moving on and oh look that lack of tessellation opens up the opportunity to place a charming little fountain go on this philosophy extends through the game to the overall islands once youre done which is largely decided by you its time to move on take one final look and wipe the sand garden clean its very zen here there are no regrets and no trophies just the act of sculpting 

will you play to optimise score aesthetics until youre bored islanders doesnt mind and doesnt get in the way of your enjoyment it provides enough structure to keep it from feeling overwhelming without becoming overly prescriptive 

linux users will also be pleased the game will run under steams proton compatibility layer despite the lack of official support yet and also quite well under wine if you prefer that 

i highly recommend this game its not deep but it is delightful

#####

islanders is a community builder game  minus any actual community 
you spawn a random island and the game allows you to choose from 2 tower types to start placing on the island  you score points for each building placed based on location and resourcesother buildings nearby  once the level is completed by reaching the required points you are put onto a new blank island with a higher point requirement  repeat steps

its unique for sure  its super chill since theres nothing actually going on  no people no production no managing of any kind  this isnt really the same as most community builders its just a chill game where you drop buildings onto an island for points  and no other reason  

for that reason i dont recommend this game to someone like myself  it doesnt provide anything im looking for in a community builder  and frankly the game is super shallow at this stage  i dont see a purpose or even a goal besides reaching a random score for the island only to have to do it all over again from scratch dunno not for me

#####

saw it on my feed saw it was 5 its worth 20 fun relaxing stress free city builder almost has a puzzle quality

#####

i play this game when ive had a tough day when i want a puzzle and dont want the frustration of other more hardcore games when i want to play a game that is interesting in the choices it offers without being really punitive in any way

because sometimes you just need a break a cool breezy soft break from everything else and that game delivers that

you will still finds way to enjoy yourself setting up the perfect combo for a specific building waiting for it to finally come up trying hard not to break you setup and finally getting it obtaining the payoff for your ground work that feels so good

#####

i was originally gonna give it a thumbs down but i decided to recommend it plz volvo add a mixed option

its okay the main mode of the game is more of a surprisingly complex puzzle game theres sandbox which is a minimalist city builder much better than highscore mode imo 

my main problem with the puzzlehighscore mode is that its completely reliant on rng for example you can get a completely barren desert island and your only choices are farm and lumber packs the island has like 6 trees in total spread out everywhere and you cant put the farm fields down anywhere but on a 3x3 square at the top of a pillar of rock its basically an instantlose could just be skill issue idk

the sandbox mode is the only good part of the game to me you can put down anything and make a cute little island paradise 

i wish the game had a mode like other city builders where you manage resources and such doesnt even have to be a full mode it could be just a very basic simple stressless one which would fit with the rest of the games minimalistic simple theme

allinall its okay not exactly what i expected for when i bought it but its worth the price either way and for people who do want a simple citybuilder without having to manage anythingsee how high you can score this is it  very similar to townscaper 


tldr maybe i didnt read the description thoroughly enough dunno just dont be dumb like me its a good game worth the price

#####

h1just one more turn not quiteh1

islanders is very minimalist which as i am sure you know is their selling point i suggest watching the video with the developer above if you havent already because from that video you will decide if this game is for you or not

what i will add is that it began to get quite tedious once i reached the 4 hour mark however i have found that since then playing in small bursts works for me before playing other games later or not once i have played for 20 mins or so

games like these are often touted as ijust one more turni gameplay and while that does seem to be the case at first i was reaching the point where the opposite was true where it became ugh another turn on this island

it is not a bad game i am fully aware that many people will like this but as is usual for steam reviews a middle of the road bmehb option would be preferable over recommended or not

if you feel that this review is vague and lazy thats because it is sorry

#####

you will

relax as you listen to the lovely music and ambient sounds
feel happiness as you imagine living in a small hut you have just placed in a scenic location
experience extreme satisfaction as buildings slot together
be joyful as you place a building that gains many points
become slightly concerned as you find you cant place a building where you planned
sense the encroaching panic as areas become cramped
agonise as you decide what to place and where
regret as you realise you could have chosen something else
watch as you run out of buildings to place and places to put them
grieve as you lose your streak of successful islands

and you will b enjoy it b

#####

i wanted to recommend this game but it advertises itself as a lowstress city builder for some this may be inaccurate at best and dead wrong at worst

islanders is something of a turnbased strategy game where youre playing against the score counter to earn more buildings to place failing to keep up will softlock the match forcing you to either move to a new island or if you lack the score to unlock that island start over completely the islands are randomized as are the buildings you receive because of this youre under pressure to make the best use possible of the buildings allocated to you at all times remembering their effects on other buildings within their radius of effect all while planning out where youre going to place buildings in the future to minimize point loss

the islands themselves are very limited on space further restraining your options for building placement expect cramped cities villages really with buildings strewn about everywhere if you actually develop a single island enough

my point is bthis game can be stressful to people who dislike scoregated progressb because of this i just cannot recommend islanders as a relaxing game unless youre content just playing in sandbox mode

#####

this game is pretty relaxing its fun to wind down and explore all the islands and make unique cities i would however suggest to the developers the possibility of adding boats we can make docks but why cant we add boats as static decorations we already have balloons p just an idea

#####

fantastic relaxing city builder a cup of tea in game form

#####

while this game bills itself as a city builder its leaning heavily towards the puzzle side of the genre im opening with this assertion because the game lives in just how engrossing the puzzle elements in this game are ive played a lot of citybuilding games and many puzzle games generally so when i say that islanders tickles a part of my brain that many citybuilders dont reach im not saying that lightly

islanders combines a bit of tetris with a bit of the classic x buildings in range gives y bonuspenalty mechanics that youd be used to from say the classic impressions games or from the anno series where islanders boldly departs from that formula is that it doesnt stick buildings on a rigid grid you can place them freely and even rotate them nearfreely and the hitboxes for the buildings are well they give a little bit of wiggleroom therefore very slight overlaps are possible but on the other hand its very easy for a slight misalignment to propagate throughout your whole city until you end up with gaps all over the place that said there are a few 1tile buildings which seem custombuilt to take advantage of these gaps and there are latetier buildings which allow you to create more building space not all the terrain features are as restrictive as they look some rocks can be removed as can all trees so there is a lot to play around with when it comes to designing a city and when you get that perfect alignment to snap a lategame block into a space reserved for it and fill an entire level bar in one go yeah thats a great feeling

speaking of the level bar now is as good a time as any to cover the game part of the game ie win and lose conditions you place buildings which score points based on their likes and dislikes with new building packs being given to you when you accumulate a set amount of points so the game is a tension between placing things right away to score points and keep your island alive or waiting until later so you can place a building in a perfect environment for massive points theres an rng element in which building packs are offered you generally choose between two options and you need to be canny with your selection based on both the environment available and your longterm plan for example it doesnt make much sense to pick a lumberjack pack if there arent any trees around but if you do have an island with lots of trees then it might still make sense to pick something else first since every time you open a pack you gain buildings previously unlocked as well as your new buildings  there comes a point where you cant productively use any more lumberjack buildings but getting extra farm plots is rarely a bad thing so there is such a thing as too early for certain packs and while im not 100 sure on this i believe its equally possible to miss entire groups of buildings if you charge straight for endgame options and ignore lowtier ones completely 

while the rules are pretty simple the game gets very deep very quickly with all kinds of strategies available and a lot of tricks to learn such as judging the relative merits of different building packs for your island or learning to read the spaces and go yep i can stick a temple in there ill surround that area with buildings now to support a future temple

the overall effect is a game thats easy to fall into and lose track of time with theres a ton of little optimisations to work on every time you play and each new island is a clean slate sometimes you get a good start and can go large placing down temples and marketplaces worth hundreds of points at a time other times youll get a cramped or barren or other challenging island and have to figure out ways to work within those limits and keep your island alive while you build up to unlock a kinder island

oh and of course theres a creative mode for when you just want to build something awesome or test a strategy i guess  such modes are practically a requirement these days theres a leaderboard too or simply the challenge to see how long you can keep a run alive

one critcism i will raise is that the games minimal ui small buildings procedural island colours so yes sometimes youll get lime green and pale yellow buildings against green grass and organic gridisland shapes can definitely be hard to parse even for someone who likes to zoom right in and check out all the details i imagine that anyone with visual impairment would struggle to play this game fully since it is so reliant on judging distances and recognising small details as far as colourblindness that will vary per person  the devs have made different building types stand out based on their shape rather than colour in fact the colours are arbitrary and change with each new island however the aforementioned issue with potentially lowcontrast or similar hue palettes may still render the game inacessible

this game is not going to be everyones cup of tea but for people who enjoy the kinds of things that this game is doing it is very very good at its niche much like the 3long 1wide park tile that can sometimes turn a gap between buildings into a 30point payday there will be certain times where this game just iclicksi perfectly

#####

the game features procedurally generated islands where you must place complimentary buildings near each other appropriate buildings near each other earn points which are used to level up and unlock another set of structures failure to accumulate enough points results in starting over with a new island the difficulty results from limited space to place buildings and having to decide which structures to place the randomized islands give a lot of replay value and extend the life of the game beyond a onetime puzzle islanders is a simple but challenging strategy game

#####

hours of entertainment for 5 earns this game a huge thumbs up perfect game for a quick 3060 min gaming session with a very small learning curve this is as much a patternrecognition game as it is a citybuilding one that will get you chasing the highest score in the leader board and all the steam achievements there is to get

#####

manage your resources and build wisely this is a very beautiful building game

#####

easily worth the price 
it will scratch an itch for you you didnt even know you had

equally a city builder a lite puzzle game and a chill ride 
recommended to anyone who wants to let their hair down

#####

its not exactly a strategy or a city builder in a traditional sense it feels more like a positional puzzle game if anything but its an enjoyable experience nevertheless you get randomized packs of buildings that you have to position on an island with limited space then you gain or loose points based on the synergy with other buildings for example if you get a town center you want to place houses around it but you dont want to place some of the identical buildings too close you also have to keep an eye on terrain because certain buildings benefit from natural resources or the type of land however if you run out of buildings and do not meet the required score the game is over islanders supports leaderboards making it a fun highscore grinder if you want to compete with other players while the tutorial does not tell you everything the games ui is easy enough to understand takes maybe 20 minutes to figure out your way around  

h1 pros h1

 thought provoking gameplay 
 relaxing atmosphere

 nothing bad really but it might benefit from extra modes
maybe a free build island saves or unique challenges like rct

b overall thoughts 810 b

its not what i expected but unlike many similar positional games i actually like this one if you looking for a simple puzzle game with a fair price i think you will enjoy it for a few hours

#####

i overall have mixed opinions about this game while it is fun to plan and build up each island with the games synergy bonus for buildings being an achievement hunter the newly added achievements to get to later islands are close to impossible to get the achievements require hours of playing to attempt to get them in a run and each run is extremely dependent on getting good rng to advance that is frankly not fun and i believe the achievements to be poorly designed and they likely shouldnt have been added it is a shame because i now leave the game incomplete while also feeling jaded and unhappy with my playthrough of it

islanders is citybuilding game stylized in a truely yet artful minimalistic fashion unlike the majority of citybuilders islanders approaches the design in a very relaxed way the soft melodic soundtrack is relaxing to listen to passively as you enjoy the game the art style is lowpoly but very well done and pleasing to the eye as it captures the aestetic the developers sought for

islanders is a game that sticks out from others in its genre in a unique way instead of throughly planning out road design districts and all the other complexities that make up traditional citybuilders islanders presents you with a procedurally generated island in which you are to place various buildings from packs in a thoughtful way in order to gain points the points are gained due to proximity of other buildings andor natural features that compliment the building type as you gain more points you unlock more building packs and later a new island this cycle repeats until you run out of buildings to place and are unable to unlock the next island which is where the game ends giving you a highscore that is set on a leaderboard comprised of all the players

i definitely recommend picking up and enjoying islanders especially for the price it is well worth it and if you catch in during the time this review is written you can pick it up for 50 off definitely a buy in my humble opinion

#####

this was one of my all time favorite casual games simple and relaxing but the most recent update drastically changed the visuals on the ui the icons are now stylized and dont look like the buildings they represent placing a building activates a 3d highlight mode that is awkward and unpleasant to look at this was a nearperfect implementation clean and visually accessible  now its messy the seasonal skins add nothing new publisher should have left well enough alone

#####

im not a big strategy game player its never been my strong suit but at 8 dollars cad i decided to give it shot
47 hrs later and i can say when im having anxiety symptoms it will be my go to game the minimal attitude calming music and graphics and easy to understand game play leads to a lowering a blood pressure i dont even feel tilted after a game over because i can just start again

the only thing i wish would have been a free play mode to choose a size of map or have an expanding map but at this price point i cant say that i am disappointed i have paid more for a lot less so i love to see such a nice relaxing game available on the store

#####

islanders is like a board game but you play by yourselfwhich is good when youre locked down at home via deadly virus or have no friends or both

your city management skills will be put to the test and more than likely found wanting  despite trying to sim city on top of a series of mountains in a frozen wasteland

its a bit short but hey at least its not like monopoly



#####

i didnt really believe in relaxing game types before i played this

its honestly too good the graphics are cute as hecc its simple to understand it looks so nice that you end up taking a screenshot before leaving every island behind yet still intricate enough to make ya think a bit 

1110 best purchase of this steam sale

#####

an excellent city builder whose minimalist and relaxing aesthetic belies a mechanically rich and satisfying experience i would highly recommend it to anyone that not only enjoys city builder games but to anyone who enjoys games

it looks like a city builder but its sort of more like a puzzle game islanders is very fully its own thing im not sure how to explain what genre this should fall in to i picked it up expecting miniaturised sim city and while it didnt satisfy that expectation it ended up being totally engrossing

this game is less than ten dollars if you were going to throw away your money for a new bit of fleeting amusement anyway you might as well get islanders instead ive never spent 115 hours at a movie theatre for 7 dollars know what i mean

#####

bireview copy provided by developerib

all cities are like puzzles if you think about it theyre composed of different pieces that fit together in many different ways and present solutions to problems like traffic and accessibility depending on how theyre arranged more than a few games have taken this as inspiration for their theme and islanders is the most recent to do just that playing out over an infinite string of placid picturesque islands your task is not to build the biggest or fanciest city but the one with the best synergy its far more puzzle than city builder when you get into it but that doesnt detract from the compelling challenges or adorable settlements they produce in the least

theres no story whatsoever here and ive already halfexplained the setup for this clever little title right from the start the game sticks you with a small island to colonize islands are completely random and may feature rolling hills craggy cliffs sandy beaches dusty mesas or even overgrown ruins youre given a choice between two packs of buildings themed sets like woodcutting brickmaking farming and city life using the buildings from your chosen pack you have to arrange them in a way to score as many points as possible if you reach the next point goal before you run out of buildings you earn another choice of packs this cycle of placement points and packs continues until you run out of buildings or score enough points to move on to the next island

its an incredibly simple premise which is good because the execution has a lot of detail to master every building you place has an area of effect within which other buildings and landscape features can add or subtract points from their value something like a field might only be worth 3 points but it gets another 2 points for each field near it and an extra 5 if near a mill however those mills lose points for being within each others areas so they must be arranged carefully around fields most of the buildings youll be working with have long lists of neighbors they like and neighbors they dont and a few even have negative base values that must be overcome by placing them near valuable bonuses

just starting out youre bound to build yourself into corners as you learn what likes being near what there are buildings like temples and taverns that dont show up until late into an island but must be planned for the whole time and thats sure to be an unpleasant surprise the first time youll also have some unexpected structures to work with like plateaus which take up lots of space but can support additional buildings on top of them the random islands can also confound your runs as they are very much randomized and can stick you with some unfavorable packs to place farm buildings cant be placed on ice or desert for example but theres nothing stopping the game from throwing you farm packs on islands that are completely dry or frozen on the bright side if you get an island with barely any habitable land the game will give you these neat pier puzzle pieces that allow you to build your very own venice

as much fun as it is to contend with the strategies of optimal placement its honestly the look and feel of islanders that makes it such a joy to come back to the smooth simple graphics pop with bright primary colors and bold palettes for the different islands features like grassy ruins and towering mesas give the game a creative fanciful richness that more grounded builders like banished or cities skylines lack this is by no means a simulator like those titles but you can certainly build cities that rival those in uniqueness and aesthetics i cant get enough of the gentle soundtrack and pleasant pops of the interface and the clean ui makes it a breeze to see what your buildings are touching and what theyre going to score you points with

after a few hours you might master the placement of the games 30odd buildings and have only the randomness of the islands to challenge you but its sure to be a soothing engrossing journey to get there and its not like the appeal of building tiny vibrant cities ever fades away islanders is entirely upfront about what a simple experience it is and it bears repeating that this is much more of a puzzle game than a city simulator really its a city playset at best and its among the best at it fans of puzzles points and picturesque places should not hesitate to snap this one up and enjoy hours of arranging charming settlements



did you enjoy this review i certainly hope so and i certainly hope youll check out more of them at httpsgoldplatedgamescom or on my urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator11322459curation pageurl

#####

the fact that you cant go back and viewkeep the old islands youve made really ruins it for me

#####

when you tilt in league come play this its very relaxing for its cheap price this is a wonderful game

#####

what a lovely chilled game to take people away from chaos and awfulness of whats happening around us a surprisingly challenging concept and one that keeps me coming back to try and beat my high score or figure out better placements for resources 

this game has no invading armies or military prowess but it does have seaweed beds and shaman huts i know which i prefer

#####

sometimes i just want to unwind and relax and this type of game is one of my go to plays a lot similar to dorfromantik

#####

i had my doubts when deciding whether to buy this game or not even when i played for the very first few minutes i was still unsure if i would really enjoy this game then the longer i played the more i ended up captured in a trance

the straight forward nature of the game keeps you calm while the gentle music and ambience creates a relaxed atmosphere that i think only a few games can achieve 

and of course the visuals are pretty much just pure eyecandy judging by the fact that i didnt get bored of looking at the same buildings over and over again

#####

this could be the best 5 game i have ever played first time i started it up bam 4 hours later everything about the game is simplistic but exquisitely wellexecuted

the basic idea is simple you pick from a themed collection of buildings then try to place them for points each building will tell you what it synergizes with positively or negatively ui does a great job of showing it when you go to place it  you need to collect enough points to be offered the next group choice before you use up your last building score enough and you get to move to another island to start building from a blank canvas again

this game is how i imagine the love child of bob ross and tetris

#####

what a wonderfully chill game
hours pass by in minutes while puzzling buildings into an island
the used colors are easy on the eyes the music is calming while your brain gets occupied with figuring out where to place a building for the highest efficiency 

islanders isnt a city building simulator like cities skylines its a puzzle game based purely on score each time you reach a set score by the game you get a new set of buildings each building has its effects which either induces positive or negative score to surrounding buildings its really easy to pick up the idea but somewhat difficult to master you will progress without mastering the game and have your fair share of a relaxed and rewarding experience the only reason to master the game is to gain a spot on the high score board 

all bugs i have found within 4 hours of gameplay revolve around the placement of buildings and were enhancing my score by a bit often i was able to place buildings inside of mountains to gain more points and save precious building space no hindering bugs were found

great game buy it

#####

i paid  238 for this in a sale and to be honest ive got more out of it than most game ive paid 10 times that for easy to pick up relaxing  but still engaging i can see myself returning to this game for years to come go  buy it its still a bargain at full price

#####

after a hard day emailing and posting memes i chill to this with the kids

#####

i love this super relaxing and fun but challenging enough to require strategy and evoke flow all of the satisfaction of building a simstyle settlement with none of the micromanagement stress

#####

beautiful and peaceful city builder initially i did not expect too much of it at purchase but i ended up spending a couple of hours enjoying the satisfying artstyle soothing soundtrack and addicting gameplay loop definitely worth a purchase if you are looking for a relaxing game to calm down with


#####

a very simple yet intriguing strategy game islander its the perfect choice for relax and killing time
in the base mode of islander you start in a procedurally generated isle with a pack of building to build each building will give you point based on the other surrounding elements such trees and other buildings and gives you the opportunity to unlock a new pack with new buildings to place on you island once reached a centain amount of points you can finally move on a new island and start again getting as much as points as you can get until you remain without buildings and ending the game every move need to be ponderated well as you want to obtain as much points from a single building that you can
or you can go on creative mode and just make the city you like a player even reproduced minas tirith
overall worth to play

#####

i never put reviews on anything but i love this game so much i have to

this game is extremely cozy its got enough challenge that its not a full open sandbox game and im going to fall asleep but its not so challenging that i cant enjoy the game im playing the music is relaxing and the game has friendly soft colors theres no time limit so its extremely low pressure ive been playing all weekend and its all i can think about right now

i think the best part about this game is that i noticably improve every time i play and i learn from my past mistakes so i feel like im really accomplishing something every time i play

#####

id give this a neutral rating if i could its eh

not really a city builder  theres no citizens to support or growth to stoke it doesnt feel alive its really just a puzzle of finding ideal combinations of buildings near each other to maximise your points i felt like id kinda seen it all pretty quickly



#####

probably the most meditative and peaceful citybuilder on the market you wont find yourself playing it over and over once youve reached the peak of it or after youve gotten all the achievements but if you find it on sale its definitely a nice few hours

#####

bino man is an island entire of itself  john donneib

no idea who that john donne personage is but i believe what he meant to say is people and islands are two entirely different things its very easy to tell them apart islands are majestic landmasses surrounded by water people are gross fleshy creatures surrounded by misery 
so its only fair that bislandersb doesnt actually feature any single living islander  

its a small serene city buildingpuzzle game gameplay is minimalistic and distilled every building in the game has a zone around it every other building or object that falls within this zone either grants adjacency bonus to your score or a score penalty thats pretty much it the system actually does a fairly good job of representing production chains on a tiny scale topography is a limiting factor some islands are better suited for large city clusters others support more farming you keep getting packs of buildings for score milestones until you run out of score and move on to the next procedurally generated island 

bislandersb is a simple game there isnt a huge variety of building types available no management nothing to worry about except aesthetics andor getting enough score to unlock the next island doesnt mean its not a smart enough game though a great deal of planning may go into maximizing the score

complex city builder it is not devious puzzle it isnt either but the games just such a pleasant and chill experience to relax to or reflect on all the mistakes of your life and get really depressed if thats your thing while throwing together some pretty structures on colourful islands
there is again nobody to ruin the mood bislandersb settlements are entirely devoid of people

#####

architecture meets tetris this game has simple rules and it does look simple at first but it can get quite complex id still classify it as a casual game as you can stop playing whenever or start a new game whenever this is not really a simulation game you dont build to have fun at building if that makes sense the strategic placement of buildings is the most important aspect youd have while playing

#####

playing this game actually relaxes me i come back to it often

#####

bought it randomly after asking a friend what game i should get for myself for christmas
it ended up being one of the best experiences ive had when it comes to videogames
its an absolutely amazing little game super chill and super comfy
in my personal opinion a true hidden gem

#####

this game is majestic
nice cartoonlike graphics easy and interesting gameplay relaxing background music

only one thing that bother me cities that you build looks dead there is no humananimal activity on the islands no people no fauna

oh this is fun ill just play for a few min   hours  very visually pleasing relaxing if you want it to be yet strategically puzzling if you want it to be  my only wish would be more color variations to provide more eye candy but i dont mean to let that sound like a complaint about how it looks now 

great deal even at full price but grab it on sale

#####

the calming effect of this game when you just wanting to ease your mind from all the daily stress is wonderful however this game is none you would play for hours maybe one hour at best before it can get very boring there is a lot you have to figure out by failure and it feels unbalanced because the game is rather unrewarding in the grand scheme no big goals to strive for just the curiosity what else there might be that keeps you going

overall not an overwhelming game but for the small price worth it anyway since youll always come back to it to relax

#####

really wonderful and charming game ive done a short six minute video review here which goes more indepth
httpsyoutubeztlp2xzkea0

but if thats not your thing heres the cliffnotes

islanders is a perfectly casual citybuilder with the only resource to worry about being points it almost plays like an endless mode in any other city builder  almost place buildings wherever you want however you want like perfect little jigsaw pieces and just try to accumulate the highest score  with the only stipulation being that your game ends when youre no longer gaining enough points

but the games not timed and theres no pressure  even when youre competing for the leaderboard you can walk away from the game and come back and your score remains and if you dont care about the leaderboard theres no real penalty for running shy on points you just start a new island with a fresh score counter and keep going

its a great citybuilder for just building cities  not overly complicated but still somehow with enough depth in the synergies between buildings that you can develop very legitimate strategies while also not having to worry about every little thing if you dont want to

and it looks and sounds beautiful too so honestly cant recommend it enough

#####

you can see everything this game has to offer in under 2 hours  additional plays will help you learn what building types come at different times and how to best place them for future points  then you realize that youre going to do the same thing every time because thats how you get points the game has everything it needs to be great except depth  it is  beautiful and simple has a great concept but lacks challenge and objectives  maybe people like it because it is relaxing and nonthreatening but for me that just means it is a repetitive game that quickly became boring


#####

excellent little puzzle game its exactly what it says on the box and thats a very good thing music is great too

#####

the game is really worth it its really fun you have to do something with the numbers and values of each building apart otherwise you can not reach a high score the price is definitely appropriate maybe even too low you can ask for more islanders is such a small secret favorite for me

still fun in nov 2019

#####

a short yet very satisfying minimalistic city builder game for a few hours of gameplay there is not much more to say about this title ive greatly enjoyed playing it and the price is just right for what it offers



if you liked my review you can find more of them on burlhttpssteamcommunitycomidarchiplrecommendedmy profileurlb and on my burlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator10639590curator pageurlb

#####

fun little game i am still learning how to best optimize my island layout which keeps me playing even more only made it up to around a rank of 23000 so far i got a ways to go

if you want a fun game that is completely non violent and focuses on rewarding good planning and strategy this is a must pick up

#####

godus is that you

seriously tho i didnt find this enjoyable its a weird space management puzzle game with proximityadjacency bonuses

its not actually a city building game sure you build cities in very literal sense but its not in the city building genre and especially not a colony sim as its been tagged with at the time of writing this

#####

this is a great game for 5  but genuinely just for casual play  its basically tetris with landscaping
it lacks depth and once youve maxed out a level you cant retry or make adjustments
ive play 8 hours over the course of a week and its not really compelling
kudos to the developers tho  great aesthetic and feel  just needs something to keep my attention other than a high score leaderboard

#####

a really cool idea with simple but neat presentation all about building synergies and antisynergies

it gives you the freedom to place and rotate buildings freely allowing you to achieve a more organic look than you could with in a gridbased game unfortunately that also means that if youre playing to win you will spend the majority of your time fiddling with placing buildings on this or that particular pixel so that their area of effect might intersect with this or that other building and then you rotate your building a little and try each individual pixel again until you determine the optimal location
the core strengths of the game are making you plan and making you enjoy the scenery you create but at least for me the gameplay also heavily incentivizes boring pixelfiddling and that just annoys me more than the rest of the game pleases

another issue to me is that even though islanders is highly abstract as far as city builders go and even though it may seem like all that matters for scoring is the final shape of your island it does actually make a scoring difference in what order you construct certain buildings which came as a bit of a nasty surprise buildings walls next to things may get you points but building things next to walls will lose you points yet both look the same in the end confusing business similarly you may receive some synergy bonuses when placing a and then b but not when placing b and then a in my opinion this asymmetry purely detracts from the game

entirely a matter of player type if you can ignore the fact that a more greedy optimal solution is just another eternity of checking individual pixels away and that many strategic intricacies require that you study some of the more unintuitive scoring arcana of the game then theres nothing to complain about it is pretty and it is fun and its really actually a good game  its just also annoying in a very particular way that may bother some players

#####

simple but challenging game a bit like tetris with buildings as you try to figure out how to place your buildings for the best possible score gain the rng of not knowing what kind of buildings you get next ads a layer of challenge to the game fully endorse the game even without a sale

#####

lovely little minimalist building game really chill and fun to get the achievements

#####

this is an amazing relaxing simple elegant and enjoyable game best 5 ive ever spent on steam will play it with my 6yo and post followup

#####

im sorry to be so drastic go not recommend this but it bothers me that the placement order has such a high role
what i mean is 
you start with a bunch of trees place a lumberjack next to them and get the points but after that you can remove the trees without the points being recalculated that seems very wrong to me

same goes for different range of buildings 
placing multiple houses and a faraway market gives big points
placing the market first and then adding the faraway houses gives no points

please recalculate bonuses of all entitys after each placement

#####

relaxing and visually pleasing game super worth the purchase great game for detilting and destressing too

#####

this is billed as a minimalist citybuilder but its really a puzzle game about maximizing your points with smart building placement you unlock more buildings as you reach certain point thresholds and the game is over once you run out of buildings to place you want to get enough points to unlock the next island which is basically just the next puzzle with a different layout and different building unlock progression theres not a lot of depth here but for people who like minesweeperhexcellsetc its a great puzzle game plus your cities start to look really cool

#####

therere many casual games available in the market what makes this one different than the others i believe its the unique approach it has

were talking about a title where you wont have to deal with a story characters or conflict whats your goal then well you receive a certain number of buildings and then you have to learn how to make the best out of them and how is that measured for each installed construction you receive some points after reaching a certain amount you get some new objects to work with when youve deployed enough of them you get the option to move on to a different map the difficulty only keeps increasing if for some reason youve screwed up and didnt get enough points to complete the quota its simply game over in other words its an endurance mission with the purpose of seeing how many points you can make until the end

the key of mastering this title is knowing how each individual structure works and how you can make the best out of them combined with other buildings and terrain around since theres not really any time limit you can take as much time as youd like before placing anything on the map

the graphics are wellmade with some beautiful colors and environmental details the sound effects are simple but effective and as for the soundtrack it only has one theme available but its so chill that i really didnt mind listening to it looping over and over again

overall although sometimes frustrating whenever a journey comes to an end if youre looking for a title which perfectly captures the essence of a casual experience combined with strategy  management elements then i surely recommend it to you

#####

incredibly relaxing game with addictive gameplay it was a nice change of pace

#####

truly exceptional little zen experience devs pls bring to mobile

#####

welp its a nice little game where you can build stuff and you have to think where you place certain things its nice to play for half an hour now and then but the game is gets boring really fast and i didnt find a single reason i should play other islands besides the first two  its more of the same

#####

people claim this is a relaxing game but ive spent 14 and a half hours in agony because i forgot to setup a place for my temple 1010 would get 100 points again

#####

a really cute and chill minimalistic building and strategy game that is very nopressure and fun to start up quit and return to at any time if youre looking for a nice game to pass the time that isnt a huge commitment this is a must have

#####

this game turns my brain into a serotonin generator

#####

in 2 minutes  bought game installed game took 9 seconds booted game finished tutorial took another 11 seconds and was on the first island
in 30 minutes  had played a few rounds learnt the basics and already loved the relaxing yet somewhat small challenge from planning and basic space management that comes with this amazing games fun and engaging gameplay the soundtrack is chill as well
the devs dont try to claim big they say exactly what the game is something you can sink 2030 minutes into and then move on every few days and all of a sudden you have 20 hours on this gem
also very well priced 8 australian which is about 5usd
definitely worth the purchase

#####

i like the highscore mode but the sandbox mode is fairly pointless because the buildings dont have boundaries ie you can put them down into and overlapping each other so its not at all straightforward to practice setting up buildings in the kind of arrangements you can have in highscore mode which are much more restricted

#####

meh i ended up getting bored of this game really fast i regret not refunding it sooner

theres 2 game modes
1 you have to reach a certain score each level to advance its pretty unforgiving and youll start over a lot playing easy boring levels over and over
2 sandbox mode where everything you do is completely pointless and there is no point system or anything to make the game interesting

its desperately lacking a mode in between one that isnt torturous to play and one that doesnt feel completely pointless

now theyre putting resources into making a vr version of the game which doesnt seem at all like something that will make this game any more interesting

#####

i wouldve liked it more if the game had levels so i could feel progress now that i have to start over i dont really feel any you could put another game mode in with levels where every level has another high score this way i wont have to start over and keep progressing either in levels or in my high score in certain levels

#####

the basic game play loop got boring real quick for me  very little satisfaction from doing things well  if there is a greater complexity then its hidden

#####

not what i was expecting at all  yes i read some reviews and saw the word puzzle a lot but in my head i thought puzzle city builder which was my mistake  i love city builder games and this does not scratch that itch  otherwise flawless for what it really is however  a puzzle game about putting complementing buildings next to each other in an increasingly smaller space in an effort to get the highest score possible

pros

 beautiful presentation graphics and sound
 surprisingly deep for a puzzle game
 very unique

cons

 misleading for those who do not research like me
 not a true citybuilder as it may seem
 difficult to plan your moves when youre not sure which building set youll get

#####

such an amazing game very relaxing solid in concept and gameplay brilliant

#####

when im stressed sitting down with half an hour of islanders is like its own kind of absolute bliss

#####

such a fun positional puzzler  no time limits so you can take as long as you want placing each building to earn enough points to gain your next pack of buildings

#####

my wife bought this game on my account and now she wont give me my login back

#####

one of the most relaxing and charming games i have played in a long time 1010

#####

a real gem of a game its slow paced gentle and addictive as hell just place buildings on the island and earn points easy right soon youll be agonising over whether to place something because itll look pretty on a hill top or squeeze it into your growing little antheap of a town to progress to the next island

building placement is easy and though the chain of building interactions seems bewildering at first the clearly numbered modifiers make it easy to experiment with where to place things i thought this was going to just be a pick up and put down game but i just keep coming back and discovering new islands 

this isnt a god game but a meditative placement puzzler with a clean and simple aesthetic adorable and highly enjoyable

#####

this game is really good for the price its cheap and youre always chasing your personal best high score and the leaderboard high score

#####

the wonderful indie game with simple exciting mechanics which gives you chill and unusual expirience
this costs your money

#####

funny little game you have tiny islands where you have to build your city some buildings match and give bonuses and some do not match and give handicaps how far can you travel your islands

#####

this is a really chill game im not sure ill ever get the strategy behind it but its easy to win without being too complicated i play it in small bursts between doing other things its very pretty and i like the colour schemes its easy to move around and i like the way all the pieces fit together  its satisfying and the soundtrack is very peaceful too

#####

incredibly charming in both game play and design islanders is a city builder puzzler and in my opinion a fantastic idle game both intuitive and simplistic the game plays a little like tetris a little like bad north you have modifiers based on buildings and environment a point pool for each level and spacing and placement is crucial with no timers or restrictive penalties you get a fun relaxing experience that continues to be enjoyable through each loss as the islands are randomly generated each playthrough and while the better and more challenging buildings come with progression it doesnt feel like an absolute grind to see them crop up and if you want to just chill out and build cities theres a great sandbox mode

#####

i really wanted to like it i love the aesthetic of the game but its just too minimalistic for me maybe if there was a bit more life to the cities or something i dont know it just felt too empty

#####

i like that there are some very clear patterns in the flow of things but that each island is a unique little creature almost i kindof like to think of them as little lumps on the back of a turtle or something

#####

simply put islanders is delightful  cant go wrong for five bucks

#####

this game is very satisfying its one of these games that dont require significant mental load but still delivers a good experience

#####

low stakes zen puzzle fun  pretty graphics  no bugs

#####

islanders is a very good looking and peaceful game nice visuals and soundtrack however you know that in some city builders you have to place your buildings veeeery precisely where just one single pixel to the left or to the right means a lot well this is pretty much the whole gameplay here not very fun and not that much relaxing either sadly im not recommending it because its just not the kind of game i was expecting it to be from the description

#####

islander is a beautiful relaxing slightly challenging worldcity building simulation game that i highly recommend for those who love city strategysimulation games but want to relax at the same time its so underrated it hurts please give it a go

#####

a nice chill game when you need to get your mind off things
wish there were a couple of new buildings but thats asking a lot for the price

#####

absolutely blooming lovely and worth every penny at a price point that can barely get you a half of dipa these days the most relaxing and destressing game i have ever come across except for when i have to place a shamans hut seriously that hut can do one which is ironic as this is basically meditation the video game

#####

edit this game does get more nuanced as it goes with more types of buildings and placement patterns  ive been playing it longer than i expected it to  sometime you get an island that just doesnt work with no space or none of the right kind of landscapes for the buildings  still a lot to enjoy here

good for the price on sale  the visuals are pretty nice but you can basically only do one thing and sometimes the rng prevents you from doing that very well  if youre expecting a nice small game to play for a while its fine  if you want a lot of control over strategy and want a city builder id look elsewhere

#####

perfect controls minimalistic gameplay colorful islands meditative experience game recommended

#####

its actually quite relaxing which is a welcome quality in 2020

#####

put on some relaxing music pour yourself a glass of red wine or a mug of hot tea and make an island your own thats about it and sometimes thats all you really need

if youre the kind of person that finds themselves starting new city building games restarting them and then restarting them a further 16 times because you find the initial founding and personalising of your budding creation far more compelling than the traffic simulation and budget management chore your game inevitably grows into then this could be a game for you

islanders offers little in the way of endgame complexity but is incredibly satisfying to just play thats not to say you can forego forethought  if you want to hit that leaderboard youll need both luck and skill on your side  but its not a requirement to simply enjoy what is ultimately a fine example of purity of design

#####

nothing is more disappointing than coming just a few points short of hopping to a new island the beautiful scenery only temporarily heals the pain

#####

is  
is this tetris
your very limited island space needs civilization so you chose builings and drop em down but in order to gain a lot of points so that you can progress to the next island you need synergies and preplanning the game is actually very well made has this clean simplistic style without being ugly and can consume your strategic brain for several hours in a row quite the steal for that low price too the music could be more diverse but that is about all of my negative criticism what a cool game

islanders is a 27h strategy city building game that features randomized islands various environments and sandboxlike qualities that will let you explore and challenge yourself created by a team of 3 people for 5 its a solid game that you can come back to time and time again placing buildings gives you points which unlocks new buildings and islands but beware  once you leave an island to create another you cannot return

i like this game its very enjoyable there really is only one issue i have with it placing buildings give you points placing them next to or far away from other buildings give you even more points and while there is a sandbox mode inevitably all my cities started blending together and looking the same this was somewhat offset by the creative uses of plateaus and the randomized environments but its also a notable downside regardless for its price and the fun you can get out of it its an easy buy even if you end up not putting a ton of hours into it

#####

islanders is a relatively unique puzzle game with a good concept that is burdened down heavily by a heavy reliance on rng and very finicky controls that make the game more about finagling the controls than about actually playing it

the game itself is basically sim city meets tetris you are given an empty island and then are given buildings at random to place on it each of which gives you points based on its proximity to other buildings and certain features on the island scoring enough points unlocks a new set of buildings until eventually you meet a threshold that allows you to move to another empty island while keeping your overall score the goal is to see how many islands you can fill without running out of buildings

the problem is that the game is very reliant on rng and doesnt incorporate it well each island is procedurally generated and broken down into one of three terrain types grass sand and rock the problem here is that some buildings can only be built on one type of terrain  farms can only be placed on grass and brickyards can only be placed on sand this can rapidly turn into a problem when the game generates you an island with a tiny spit of beach but keeps giving you brickyards that you are unable to place on the map while you can choose one of two building packs every time you hit the threshold for new buildings the issue is that youre eventually forced to choose every building type and once youve chosen all the packs the building distribution is entirely random 

the other problem is that the procedural generation and the lack of being able to know whats coming and when makes it very had to plan things out placing buildings is entirely freeform and some buildings water platforms houses and parks come in random shapes and sizes and this may or may not completely screw your run over  even if something looks like it should fit the game will often tell you it wont  sometimes finagling it will get the building into the place you want but sometimes not i really wish this game had a grid so you could tell for sure whether something will fit or not this becomes particularly egregious with the larger buildings that give you the most points but are encountered extremely late in an islands life cycle an example of this is the temple which gets points from houses and parks being around it the temple is a huge building that is very difficult to plan around unless you happen to get a certain type of platform early that happens to be exactly the right size for it the freeform placement combined with the random terrain also makes it really hard to pack buildings in and line them up

i cant say i dont recommend islanders but at the same time i wish theyd fix some of this stuff and make rng screwovers less likely

#####

ok this is my relaxing game now

#####

nice minimalistic relaxation game the achievements can offer a bit of extra challenge but overall there is not much to stress about worth it for the normal price as well but on sale with 5060 off its a steal

#####

im torn on whether to thumbs up or down this game on the one hand i got my moneys worth for the 3 sale price on the other hand the achievement ladder and only sense of progression in the game doesnt seem feasible to complete without some good rng as it pertains to the map seeds

the final achievement asks the player to get to the 21st island this involves going islandbyisland getting a progressively higher score prior to being able to proceed to the next randomly generated island i got to island 8 or 9 before getting a map that was very mountainous with little flat ground to build on this presents an issue for building sprawling cities that are required for high scores and despite minmaxing the possible scores for each building placement and taking plateaus when possible to get myself more flat ground i eventually was unable to get enough points to progress

i dont mind rng as it pertains to the deck offerings and cards given to the player this is what learning the game strategizing and planning for multiple pathways is all about but at a certain point a bad map seed cannot be worked around and will spell the end of your run most of my playtime is from my final run at the game so im definitely not interested in investing another 10 hours seeing if map seed rng will be on my side during another run

also minor annoyance its july and theres still an easter graphics pack applied to the game with no option to disable it

#####

a beautifully simplistic fun and enthralling minimalist city builder does what it says on the tin my goto chillout game that startsup quick and can be exited quickly so very easy for short play sessions 1010

#####

islanders is an interesting approach to the city builder with fantastic execution

playing more like a puzzle game with some rougelike elements thrown in the combination of these ideas merge together wonderfully into a charming little game

gameplay is all about strategic placement of buildings industry and agriculture with each ploppable object having its own conditions for scoring points score well and youll be given more objects to put down and eventually move onto the next island to do it all over again your score carries over until you cant build anymore

whilst some conditions for objects score points lumber jacks near trees for example others detract points as well lumber jacks near other lumber jacks as they no doubt enter a bitter rivaly over who can uproot a tree the best given how each island you visit is randomly generated they do fall into categories like flat plains uninabitable hills and my personal favorite 95 sea the game quickly takes a strategic turn as you survey the island you have its topography natrual resources ior just literally 95 seai to score the most points and keep you going until the next island

eventually youll hit a wall unable to score the points required to place more buildings and your run is over
but youll probably want to try immediately again the satisfying gaze you get as you pan across an island youre about to leave peppered with all kinds of buildings is reminicent of my time in games such as simcity 4 or cities skylines and drove me to start up another run determined to best my highscore but what takes hours in a traditional city builder takes no more than 3040 minutes here this game is by no means a substitute for simcity or skylines and id hesitate to even bundle islanders in with them

islanders is a fantastic example of combining elements from several different genres and making them work together sure it takes out all of the management aspects of a city builder but including them wouldve bogged this short and sweet experience down anyone can mangle genres how they please but having the design insight to know what works well together and what doesnt crafts wonderful little experiences like this that really shine on their own

i give islanders a score of

numericalvaluesdegradereviews

#####

meh gets old quick maybe fun for a quick game or two but i find it too repetitive not much going on islands feel dead

#####

its exactly what it should be for a 5 puzzle game with a zen atmosphere graphics are simple but nice music is relaxing gameplay is chill and no pressure youre arranging a randomized deck of buildings in a limited space for the most points i agree with the others who have said its not really a city builder though theres nothing to manage and since you dont know what youll draw next you cant always do a ton of pre planning and aesthetics tend to go out the window in the quest for more points but its still a very nice experience in moderate doses

#####

in terms of game design visual aesthetic design ui design this one is about as elegant as it gets its simcity x minimetro x 868hack x a zen garden at 5 full price  less than a quarter of a gig hd space if you have even a passing interest buy it now download it now play it now this is a very good game

#####

a nice little game that definitely deserves a thumbsup and a purchase

dont expect playing million of hours as it gets somewhat repetitive after a few hours but at the same time maps are always procedurally randomly generated so you never really play the same level ever

the one thing to know here is this is very much a puzzle game using a citybuilding thematic and not at all a city builder

there are some urban planning logic for example the fields yield more points if they are placed beside a mill but you dont have to worry about distance between houses and workplace or creating paths for your islandersbecause there are no citizens or islanders at all
but if you enjoy adding new achievements or trying to improve on your highscore and global ranking etc this is a very wellmade relaxing and chilled little game that you will for sure enjoy like many of us who have posted a review here

#####

really fun gentle relaxing city builder its complex enough to keep my interest and require a bit of strategy but simple enough to be played casually its well worth the low price if youre considering getting it absolutely do it

#####

very enjoyable game definitively worth what they devs are asking for at regular price this is the only game i have ever found myself asking is there a mobile version of it because it is very fast to play

buy this game

its worth the money you wont regret it will spend hours on this

#####

i bought this game on my switch and liked it so much i bought it here too super addicting but so calm and peaceful its really easy to get the hang of and theres a little bit of a challenge without it being rage inducing

#####

this is a little gem of a game do you like city builders do you like puzzles if you had to sum this game up in a nutshell it could be city builder meets tetris it is very easy to learn and quite difficult to master but as you play you learn and learn and learn and get better and that feels great

as someone with thousands upon thousands of hours in different city builder games from the classic sim city to the tropico series to banished islanders brought something new to the table for me with the point scoring system although im still unsure with whether or not it makes me 100 happy i have arguments with myself about whether or not i should go for maximum points or whats more aesthetically pleasing in placing things constantly it is certainly addictive with the just one more turn quality of civilization games ive lost hours to this game already

if i have any critique its that the very end stages of an island can get a little wobbly eventually its just walls walls walls that pop up for me i dislike the wall mechanic in real life walls naturally go next to each other so i dont find their point scoring makes much sense and i dislike the phase of just shove things in where they fit till i finally run out of stuff but honestly its a minor complaint compared to just how good the rest of it feels

i broke into the top 50 on the leaderboards ive been absolutely delighted watching my score go down as more people play and get better i hope this studio does well because they really made something their trailer with its humble honesty was also amazing and i wish all games did it that way seriously it is exactly what you get

also i never write reviews so that should say something about how i feel about this game the price is stupid good go get it

#####

islanders is a delightful timesink its made by the same people who did superflight the philosophy casual gaming procedural landscape generation is the same but the mechanics are very different in this game you get dealt a hand of random buildings each of which is worth certain points depending where you place it you keep placing buildings trying to maximize the amount of points for each placement until you are unable to hit the goal then you restart and build a new city

it sounds simple because it is but its also very relaxing theres something pleasant about building up a neat settlement getting to the end having a quick smile then wiping it clean and starting again the graphics are cute the music is inoffensive its just a wonderful little game for zwischendurch note that you will chew through a lot more playtime on this than superflight since once you get the hang of it you can keep going for an hour or more on one island

#####

this game is super chill its great to wind down with from work or even more stressful games i also really appreciate that i can always fit it in whether i have 5 minutes or 50 to play with 
the music is nice and chill and i really like the low poly art style  it makes for some really stunning almost abstract cities 
if a laidback city builderpuzzle game sounds up your alley i really cant recommend this highly enough

#####

figured id browse for under 10 dollar games to add to my list of 4690 games i dont play after clicking once

weeeel shit this ones actually a good one 

automatic 1010 somehow very zen and also when i click the power button to shut the game off it doesnt ask me if im sure

#####

this game is great if you are going to play it casually the game is pretty relaxed and the flow is fine 

as someone who likes to get 100 achievements in games the recent update is pretty terrible there is a singular way to maximize your score in this game and the game asks you to do this 21 times with ever increasing point requirements to reach the next level there are many many bad map seeds you can get and honestly the best way to work around this is to save file scum it until you get an island you know you can clear the points with 

the update after 4 years  of silence actually showed the issues with the game instead of enhancing the experience which i think the publishersdevelopers need to look at or at least consider in the future

#####

i personally dont ever touch strategy games as i find them to hard to get into but islanders is probably the first strategy game i really like its simplicity is a nice change from other strategy games and i found myself enjoying it from the start no complicated faction wars no balancing of 70 different resources but i still have the feeling of creating and building my own little civilizations

id really recommend this game to anyone who is scared of the complexity of the strategy genre but still wants to take a step into it

#####

there isnt really a whole lot to do in this game  there isnt really much chance to be creative and ultimately it feels like your island is just filling up with crap  tldr its boring

#####

tetris with buildings

#####

what a brilliant game its as much a puzzle game as it is a city builder i absolutely love it and the price is really low too there are games worse than this charging much more cant recommend this enough

english

islanders
 i wasnt sure if it catch me but it did

a small puzzle game where you have to think about where to place buildings you get after earning enaugh points
you need this points to get new and more buildings and to reach a new island

there are different islands with different difficulty but its random

a funny game for some relaxed hours to forget the time
with some nice comic grafics and i didnt see a bug

 ideas for an interesting gameplay while creating citys on islanders
mini events like click as fast as you can on goldmine in 15seconds or
gather all trees on this island to get extra points or some techtree 
for higher range or more efficiency of buildings or find hidden
chests or caves

buy recommendation yes



deutsch

islanders
ich war mir nicht sicher ob mich das spiel fesselt doch das tat es

ein kleines puzzelspiel wo man darüber nach denken muss wie man seine gebäude platziert damit man genug neue punkte verdient um neue gebäude sich zu verdienen und
neue inseln freizuschalten

es gibt unterschiedliche inseln mit unterschiedlichen schwierigkeitsgrad aber das ist zufällig

ein kleines und lustiges spiel für ein paar entspannte stunden
mit einer netten komikgrafik und fehler habe ich keine gesehen

ideen für ein interessanteren spielablauf während des erstellen von städten auf islanders
mini ereignisse wie klicke so schnell wie du kannst auf die goldmine in 15 sekunden oder
fälle alle bäume auf der insel aber es könnte auch ein forschungsbaum geben
um die reichweite oder effizienz der gebäude zu steigern um extra punkte zu kriegen
oder finde verstecke höhlen oder truhen

kaufempfehlung ja

relaxing and easy townbuildinggame after 43 hrs i got 100 of the achievements without tryharding

thumbs up

#####

relaxing city builder where you can build your city 
that it thats all 
no management no aivillagers no other staff  just pick the building and put it on the island thats all 
art style and ost are great idea is nice not my usual cup of tea to be honest but i like this game 


#####

beautiful game relaxing yet challenging and very well made

#####

they said its a minimalist strategy game minus the stressful resource management hence a game right up your alley
i say its a painful nightmare as the game is right up your azz

great game for minimalists but not for players with ocds nevertheless i will endure the butthurt

rating 81

#####

nice little strategy world builder my poor nongaming laptop struggles with it a bit but no serious lag very aesthetically pleasing and enough of a puzzle to keep me engaged my one bugbear is that when you lose you have to start over from the very first island  you cant retry from the last island it make sense in terms of how the game builds points i do like that the islands always regenerate so you dont feel like youre grinding

#####

this game is great very relaxing and well worth the few dollar price tag 9510

h1 islanders h1

b a variant touch to minimalist building games b

islanders is a strategy game developed and published by grizzlygames about building cities on colorful islands and attracts attention with its minimalist structure

however it does not contain the elements of city building we aim to collect points by placing the structures given to us side by side and discover new islands

#####

if youre looking for a peaceful city builder with cute art dont miss islanders we all know that you will challenge yourself trying to fit everything on that small island

#####

i returned this game after 50 minutes of playing 
if you are looking for something relaxing and beautiful to play to destress go ahead give it a try 
but if  like me  you bought this because you like other building simulators like banished or kingdoms and castles be warned that it is not really similar to those games

pros
 its beautiful if you like the style
 there is no stress or pressure so potentially very relaxing
 its very easy to learn but i guess to become good you need to plan ahead 

cons for me
 as it says there is no resource management whatsoever except for room and happiness makes it more boring for me than i hoped 
 it lacks any kind of complexity no upgrades or dependencies
 feels like a mobile game




#####

i wouldnt call islander a bad game by any margin its fun but the problem is its a score based game that when you run out of moves its game over thats not the kind of game i like to relax to and after about 16 minutes i had seen all it had to offer if youre super competitive and love games with leader boards youd go nuts for it me i refunded and went back to city builder games

#####

autism game

#####

it is a pleasant game although i can only wish that there was a faster way to play it let me explain

so you get tiny islands you build cities upon them
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890501226
an island is complete if you can get enough score which you get by placing buildings which depend on what is in the buildings range there is a bit of complexity to relationships between buildings
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890514065
which means that is beneficial to place things strategically and plan ahead

as you progress in the score mode score requirements and map difficulty increase and your cities get a little fancier
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890501813
and then a bit more
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890502755
eventually you have to get creative to cram everything in what little space the map might offer you
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890503397
it is a good challenge albeit the obvious implication is that it takes more and more time to beat each subsequent map
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890505141
and should you mess up or maybe the map is particularly tricky or maybe extremely unfortunate rng
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1890506478
youre back to square one and its hours of playtime to get to the interesting maps again

i cant think of why i would want to do that to myself  in fact i would have much preferred if the game offered an option of getting a short hard map so that you could play or fail to through that and go back to your other activities length of makeshift time trial vs regular runs in unexplored is a good example

alternatively an option of building and sharing custom levels with predesigned sets of buildings and goals and could be interesting as that would allow to very specifically focus on the puzzle aspect if the game doesnt already have a custom editor for its levels thats definitely more work though spoilermaybe ill make a tiny demake focusing on this idea or somethingspoiler

#####

a very fun and relaxing city builder no part of the game relies on timers so speed does not matter at all except for 2 achievements which arent too difficult to get the game is also very generous with the points allowing you to continue the highscore mode for a while before you start loosing 

the only major issue that i have with the game is that it can sometimes be frustrating to slot a building into a specific place as very minor movements can cause large differences in the points you earn as well as the collision being a finicky this is only a big issue if you are trying to go for high scores but it is a smooth system majority of the time

the sandbox mode is also really good for just creating fun and cool looking cities and has a ton of beautiful assets to use

btldrb a nice and relaxing city building as well as sandbox game to either build cool looking cities or try to earn points for the design of the city it can be slightly frustrating at times but it very enjoyable nonetheless it is a complete steal at this price and i highly recommend it to any sandboxcity builder fans or anyone that wants a chill game to wind down with

#####

this is a neat little game

its a twist on citybuilding in that its almost more of a spatial puzzle each building you place will interact with the buildings around it of a given radius to alter your score positively or negatively

not especially difficult though definitely difficult at times toward the end

great way to kill 510 hours if you like puzzlers andor city builders no real reason to replay it in the short term

#####

played 30 hours in 5 days it is very relaxing easy to get the hang of really nice graphics

#####

a very fun and relaxing game islanders is a good combination of a city builder and a puzzle game its pretty easy to learn but get more difficult the more you advance i am a huge fan of the minimalistic art style and the vibrant colours

#####

super chill

#####

i fancied a nice chilled out puzzle type game and i am super happy with this puppy its very very relaxing and yet interestingly taxing at the same time dont expect dynamic city building with this one  its more of a 3d jigsaw puzzle where you have to think and plan placement of your buildings and resources to score maximum points

my only slight con with it is that should you fail to achieve the required score for a given island its game over and you go back to the start it would be nice if youre given the opportunity to retry that level as starting at square one again feels a bit harsh and can make it seem like youre not getting anywhere but that said as the islands are built through procedural generation every one is different so you never feel like youre chomping back through old content over and over 

i definitely recommend this one just remember that this aint city skylines though but what it is is some wonderful chilled out gaming

#####

sit back and relax very nice game to pass time nice simple and relaxing with nice music as you play

#####

the best summary for this gem is the following the bob ross of cityplanning look at that little mountain let put a windmill on top of it oh no the windmill is lonely lets place some farmland arround it the mountain feel barren lets place a city below it to make the mountain beautyfull and every new island feels like a new bos ross painting

#####

its a chill cute way to kill some time not especially challenging or exciting but absolutely charming worth it at 250 and probably worth at full price if you want an idle game you can play while listening to critical role

small review for a small game

#####

i want to like this game but im so damn sick of zooms that dont let you see everything if you are going to give a limited space at least let the player zoom out far enough to see the entire space

#####

a really chill solitairelike city builder 

you advance a civilisations technology through placing buildings  usually starting with one of two types of farming and going up to temples and hot air balloons each building you place nets or loses you points depending on where its placed and what its placed next to two lumberjacks dont like to be in the same vicinity while houses and mansions get bonuses from being next to each other 

the first  and most immediate  thing your points go towards is your current techlevel  max it out and youre given another choice of tech advancement where youre given a selection of buildings from the new tech level plus those from previous levels as well 
the second thing is island completion  each island has a predefined score you need to reach before you can move to the next one  whenever you want want to keep advancing your current island great not happy with it and want a fresh start on a new one cool 

you cant however go back and visit islands youve already left so make sure to screenshot those you like

there isnt a whole lot to this game but what there is is really well crafted and enjoyable so despite me being fairly sure ive seen it all i keep coming back to it

#####

gorgeous art relaxing music and just the right level of challenging

bought on sale for 2 and feel like ive scammed the devs

#####

islanders is a minimalist puzzlestrategy game themed around city building its less accurate to call this a city builder or a city sim since youre not simming anything though the result is a built city there are no resources no disasters no needs to attend to your focus is entirely on creating building synergies with the space allotted to you in the randomly generated islands

the gameplay loop is simple you start off by choosing a pack of buildings you place these buildings which synergize positively and negatively both with the environment and other buildings and gain points at point thresholds you unlock a new choice of buildings and the loop continues with every loop you expand your building options and get a random set of buildings among those youve already picked in this way you can guide how your city grows  if you put off picking lumber camps youll never see lumber camps until the very end if you pick city buildings very early you can expect to see many many houses and mansions theres a level of strategy involved even from the very beginning groups of buildings want to be near each other and away from other building types circuses want to be near houses and breweries and jewelers want to be near gold mines and mansions but want to be far away from houses towers want to be near as many parks fields and residentials as possible and warehouses want to be near all your industry buildings and markets which themselves want to be near as many houses and mansions as possible 

the more you play the game the better you get at carving space out for all your districts and the aesthetics arise naturally creating satisfying combos and very aesthetic looking cities theres a variety of islands to build on from temperate to snow to ruinsfilled to tiny islets that you connect with plateaus and bridges each has their own challenges and building preferences so your progression through he technology tree differs every map changing up how your cities look and grow

when you reach a sufficient point barrier you can begin again on a newer slightly bigger island from scratch you then have to meet a slightly higher point threshold to continue to the island after that which is a little bigger and a little bigger and so on you continue until you dont reach the threshold needed to unlock a new pack of buildings and when you also do not have a new island to go to your score is tallied up and you begin again anew

the game is enjoyable and relaxing the only frustrating points for me are being one or two pixels off being able to fit a building where id hoped the game is entirely gridless so its possible to really hyper engineer exact placements but in the same way its possible to be just a few pixels short of fitting something in the perfect spot which can be maddening

the game tickles my aesthetic love of city builders but doesnt ask that i be any good at them it just asks me to get points i suck at infrastructure roads handling disasters sticking fire stations everywhere but points i can do and im rewarded with new and creative city designs on every island

strong recommend for people who like relaxing puzzly games that do require a bit of thought not super brainburny but enough to need foresight if you want to maximize scores and get to the really big metropolis island

#####

you build on an island and then up to one point you can or have to move to another one after you run out of space or the score required to get more buildings lose and you start again in a different island simple as that
not my cup of tea but still enjoyable

this is a beautiful work of art in its design implementation and presentation  it has a very gentle learning curve and as you progress from game to game you develop a deeper understanding of the relationships that exist between the components embedded within 

 the randomness in this game is wonderfully simple and genius at the same time  you are continually presented with 2 random choices both of which have very significant impacts on your designs which will be continually altered because of this fact  forward thinking can strongly mitigate against this randomness and its very rewarding to discover these facets

in short this is a masterpiece in game design  its awesome 
thank you

#####

super chill game you can play for aesthetics sake or you can find deeper strategy by playing for points

#####

easily the best 5 euros ive spent in a while the game is so chill and relaxing you just build your tiny civilizations on those ilsandsits like getting your own zen garden bit by bit

best played in short bits though very good at what it does

#####

uniquely fun game to play while mindlessly watching youtube one of my favorites easy to play keeps you engaged simple as fuck

#####

for the price it is a fun little game id say it is more of a puzzle game than city builder you need to fit random pieces in for points to keep growing and plan ahead space is limited on each island youll go on to the next if you have enough points and the points required keeps growing so you have to plan ahead i dont think id call a puzzle that looks like a city a city builder all you need is points there is absolutely no demand jobs citizens etc 

unfortunately the linux version has never been that reliable it is far slower and the colors are all off if you only have linux test it right away because you can return it if it doesnt run properly check the current time limit for returns first definitely worth checking

#####

refreshing little game about placing buildings theres not much other than placing stuff close to other stuff and getting points for it but it looks great and is a wonderful retreat from the harsh world outside great little piece for meditating

just dont let other humans invade your game and place buildings randomly ruining your perfection

definitely recommended if youre tired of killing mindless husks of flesh and bone and other materials

dont buy if you expect to conquer well anything other than leader boards

#####

my new goto for chillout gaming while i sip coffee and listen to podcasts the limited numbers of building are leading to some repetitive gameplay but the procedural islands keep it fresh just keep trying to beat you personal high score thats pretty much it i can see this staying installed for months and months

#####

bin shortb
it can be very misleading and disappointing to buy this game as a strategy and city builder its a relaxing nonchallenging puzzle with repetitive onemechanicbased gameplay

bto detailsb
this is not a strategy or city builder
this is a mobilelike puzzle where you need to place a set of objects to complete the task 
with a completion bar like 01000
when you fill the bar a new set of objects appears and so on

its not even a puzzle in the challenge sense more like fit objects to space kind of puzzle
depending on the type of object building the nearest buildungs will give you a positive or negative score so you need to fit it the way you avoid negative scores and gain as many positive scores as possible its the one and only gameplay mechanic you have here
when you fill the island with buildings and meet the required points goal you get the new island to fill the next island has higher points requirements than the previous one
if you dont meet required points goal you start anew from the simpliest basic island
its rather tedious and monotonous

and since it is mobilelike a very small number of objects on the screen are shown at the same time its more like series of closeups without a proper zoomout option for general view 
so it feels awkward and cramped and leaves too zoomedin impression

#####

pure zen

#####

very surprised at this i expected minimal replayability and maybe a couple hours for my five bucks instead this is a surprisingly deep city builder with a wonderful and relaxing aesthetic its very rare that a game can be both casual and strategic without compromising on either and this does that so well

this is a 30 game at a 5 price tag

#####

i bought this on sale and after playing id say its 100 worth full price im really enjoying the super relaxing easytolearn but hardtomaster gameplay also the music is bangin i know they say you dont need a sound card to enjoy the game but personally i think you should put some headphones on and vibe

#####

this game is worth way more than what i paid for it

#####

its great ive been addicted to this since buying it i love the random islands and building draws that combined with rules that are just complicated enough to be interesting but still simple enough to keep in my head leads to a game where the  island cities i end up making while playing the game are very pretty

overall im impressed  grizzly previously also made superflight which is also very good  but this is even better in my opinion

#####

islanders are described pretty good in its own trailer its a city builder for points its nice its relaxing it helps me with my anxiety at hard days

its not very hard to get and to master and its very pleasant to understand the best building combinations and try them out on a new island

i want to recommend this game if youre looking for something new and not very demanding of any resources that game lets you just have fun and does not punish you for making mistakes and learning build what you like what you want choose your own path on this island

if you do not want to score anything you can launch sandbox mode and build your own city as youd like which is very useful if you want to prepare for the dnd session for example 

have fun it is worth its price

#####

bought it because of the very honest dev trailer the game played like they described it would with zero bugs or glitches for the price point i cant find a single thing to complain about

well my first good run in highscore mode only ranked me 12000th in the world i guess ill complain about that and try again

#####

more achievements please completed them all quickly and would like more to reach for and keep me focused

#####

they ruined this game by adding the 10th and 21st island achievements

#####

beautiful visuals design and simplicity that is onehundred percent conducive to the game play experience islanders is a high quality zen gaming experience with a severely under valued price tag once you start a game within minutes you are opportune to a relaxing meditative fulfilling and true gaming experience 

the mechanics are simple you build and gain or lose points for each building you place depending on the type of buildings in its area of influence each building has its own unique attributes and range of influence in the form of a spherical radius from the building you gain points and get a new building set once you hit certain point goals as shown in the lower left while accumulating overall points and filling up the meter located in the lower right which allows you to continue on to the next location you can redo your last move infinitely but can not go back more than one if you run out of buildings before you fill the meter to continue the game is over and your score is recorded

islanders sounds almost too simple to be fun but that certainly is not the case it is simple and fun having played games similar and being disappointed in the past by other small games islanders does not disappoint and offers a vastly better and more enjoyable experience than the newest versions of an old fan favorite city builder to go even further with that thought it is also extremely better than the money gouging scam that is the disappointing mobile version of said game

it is apparent to me within the first 100 minutes of play that islanders is a fantastic game with a price tag at least half or one third what it should be the only negative things i can say about this game is that the developers grossly devalued their product and the lack of save feature which im sure will probably come

what i would like to see is a save feature and the ability save islands from the main game mode and take them into the creative it is not hard to get attached to a build which says a lot about what a great game islanders is currently and how much greater it can become having the building categorized by type in creative would also be a simple way to improve creative

i look forward to the continued development of islanders and will continue to play and support it and the team at grizzly games great work keep it up

#####

its a very selfexplanatory yet very enjoyable game whenever the city grows in size its very rewarding to observe and contemplate on how more it can develop 

#####

islanders is one of my goto relaxing games when i just want to enjoy some gorgeous atmosphere stressfree me time

#####

i mean this in the nicest way possible islanders is great at making me forget im a person its like city building tetris thats focused on synergy between constructions and graded by a points system so it just gets me into a zen city planner state i just cant shake out of

#####

this game will have you aggravated over small differences in numbers and constantly crazily shifting your mouse to fit buildings into singlepixel gaps for a onepoint bonus

minimalist beautiful absolutely rageinducing  and i absolutely loved it

#####

i got this game for free but that essentially doesnt matter with a price tag like this i played this game for a few hours now and expect my current #1 global high score to get crushed within the next few days or less p 

the procedurally generated islands and terrains are surprisingly diversified a lot more than the worlds in the brilliant superflight the last game of grizzlygames with the 30 or so buildings and probably more coming in future updates there is more than enough complexity for the kind of game islanders wants to be a laidback and minimalistic strategy game with addicting high score oriented gameplay 
definitely recommended

#####

beware that this almost certainly not a city builder
the game is more like a highscore dash where you place buildings that are just given to you in packs and then recieve score for quality placement of them there is no production resources etc in the general sense
overall this is a casual clicker dont get it if you are not expecting that

#####

beautiful and relaxing very stressful also 1010

#####

very simple well made game very calming and relaxing would highly recommend

#####

even though it only took my around 2½ hours to 100 this i really enjoyed this so far and am pretty sure ill play it at least a couple of hours more not only because i want to beat my current high score and optimize my building placement strategy but because it is basically a absolutely nice and relaxing game the graphics while simple are perfect in making sure that the map is easily readable the music is calming and while i think its only 3 or 4 shortish tracks it fits and doesnt distract or gets annoying

given all this i can recommend this game to anyone who doesnt mind a short casual game with light strategy  puzzleish elements from time to time but keep an eye on the clock one more island and what felt like 15 minutes quickly becomes an hour 

#####

this was initially a negative review following the december 21st 2022 update that caused a lot of issues with the lighting and ui i reported the bugs on the developers official discord and they were fixed within two days i truly hate having to join a discord and navigate my way through the various threads to find a place to report bugs and this discord in particular was pretty convoluted ibuti i think the response time more than makes up for it so heres my actual review

girl help im pack bonding with a citybuilding simulator

ive always bounced off of citybuilding sims in the past because they never felt very personal to me id pick the sims over sim city any day i like micromanagement but only a certain kind of it this is the right kind for me

there are two stages to this game the first as other people have said is more of a jigsaw puzzle than a traditional citybuilder you iarei building a city but you build it with just your score in mind simple numbers that determine where best to put your puzzle pieces rather than a robust internal system of plumbing and power lines and zoning

not that this game is without rules but all the rules are natural and they tell a story each type of building or resource has a base score that can be increased and decreased based on its surroundings as well as an area of effect mansions for example get a higher initial boost from a city center but their small area of effect means they contribute little to their surroundings and have diminishing returns houses on the other hand might seem less valuable at first but their greater area of effect compounds as you place more of them jewelry stores only benefit from mansions circuses only benefit from houses resorts want to be far away from everything else so on

as you learn the game and the unique rules of each little block that you can place you can plan ahead balance the desire for an immediate boost to your score versus what will help your city in the long run

this leads into the second part of the game when your focus shifts from the numbers and you see your abstract arrangement of shapes becomes a bustling little metropolis if youve got headphones on you can zoom in and hear the muted sounds of the people that inhabit the place youve built talking and laughing and going about their lives

ithati is what really got me about islanders even when im out of stuff to place and its time to move onto the next island it feels like i left something nice behind for the tiny people that i didnt even know were there inhabiting the structures that i arranged in pursuit of a high score people joke about how playing citybuilders is like playing god and in islanders i feel like a benevolent one

#####

chillin no killin

#####

super chill gameplay this is great for people who like town building but dont always wanna struggle with all the indepth mechanics recommend for a good wind down gaming session

#####

quite a noice small game it is at first it looks quite simple somewhat casual and maybe boring it leans stronger towards the likes of a puzzle than to those of a city building game hence i wouldnt say its relaxing as once we progress it gets more and more complex and that inevitably builds up tension  which isnt bad at all

as someone mentioned too islanders does remind me of mini metro as for the ability to lay down things the way i want in a fashion that in order to get the most of it i might have to give up on other things which mechanically speaking ends up coming to the desperate need well known in tetris of minmax pieces to succeed 

all of that on a canvas painted with colours and shapes a la godus yet the game itself is æons ahead in optimization compared to the aforementioned one

after seeing what it can deliver it starts to get repetitive but for its price tag its still worth it

#####

i bought this game thinking it would be lackluster because of the low price but i can genuinely say this is the best 99 cents i have spent the games graphics are very appealing and the soundtrack is very calming as is the base game 1010 would build island cities again
