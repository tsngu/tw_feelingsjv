loved it so much i showed my wife
she loved it so much she bought her own copy this was her first videogame
she loved it so much she spent over a 100 ingame hours trying to learn how to play videogames
she loved it so much she the person who rage quits little big planet stuck with it until she beat the game twice

1010 would give anything to find another game like this for me and wife

#####

this piece of art right here

game of the year for someone like me who loves platformers a great soundtrack and is a big fan of metroidvania style games oh yeah

game of the year for everyone else maybe

let me tell you some things about this game
offers a lengthy adventure i completed 100 in 28 hours and there is still more i could do if i wish
the combat is so tight not only are the mechanics themselves simple and crisp but they are also super deep with things like charms which you can equip to give certain abilities and other classic staples in these types of games like a dash  double jump  wall jump
the controls are very fine tuned and it always feels like it was my fault if i died and not simply poor game design
the bosses are sick af and they all have really cool moves  patterns  styles to them
the game manages to never feel linear at all it has no direct markers telling you where to go it simply throws you into the world hallownest it is called and leaves the exploring up to you
the soundtrack is bomb these indie company hits lately always offer a memorable and groovy soundtrack and this game is no different it offers a few solid themes for many of the fight scenes as well as beautiful atmospheric soundtracks which fit the areas so nicely
oh and did i mention the game looks beautiful go check images of this game right now like the area the city of tears and just marvel at the amount of detail put into the scenery for a game this big the art style and attention to detail is truly impressive

my real only problem with this game is not even so much a problem at all as it is a warning to those of you out there on the more casual end who may struggle with difficulty in this genre you have been warned while the game is mostly pretty forgiving with save points in most general areas i will say some of the combat gets pretty tough for someone like me i enjoyed it thoroughly as i felt the difficulty was just the right amount and it never felt cheap or unfair

fot those out there who arent as into these type of games as much i feel hollow knight is a great game to start you into the genre the price is very reasonable and it seems the devs are going to continue adding more content which is hype give it a try you wont be dissapointed

#####

i bought this game because my fouryearold daughter liked the creepy skeleton bug man 

im 40 and for the last 34 years or so i have consistently sucked at any game demanding any degree of speed or coordination i remember the first castlevania and the first metroid and i remember sucking at both of them i play rpgs or turnbased strategy games like civ i had never played a soulslike before and i had no idea what i was getting into this game is hard as hell when you beat it the game congratulates you on your achievement and i felt that word in my bones now 250 hours later i can beat absrad on ascended im at 109 with only pantheon 5 to go i beat the path of pain and im considering putting that on cv i think this game taught my kid that parents also struggle and must persevere to accomplish their goals but i enjoyed every minute of the grind because this game is a masterpiece from its level and art design to the music to the cryptic lore this is one of those games that reminds me why i love gaming and im glad i got to share something so special with my daughter we cant wait for silksong

yes youre seeing it correctly i have 300 hours on this game
that being said i played through about 250 of those hours and i can confidently say that this is and might always be my favorite game

ill start with the cons
 there is a lot of roaming around and exploration in this game although this can appeal to some people it can definitely make you feel lost and a little frustrated trying to find out where to go especially after greenpath at least for me
 many many points in the game where youll get stuck for literal hours trying to get past if you tilt easily or are an ardent completionist you might have a bad time you will probably never get to the land of storms
 sometimes the movement mechanics can feel really unfair especially at the most difficult platforming sections why does monarch wings send you down first although i think learning and mastering the mechanics is all just part of the game
 although ive never played dark souls ill get to it eventually ive heard that this games story feels very similar not sure how this is a con but felt that it was important to mention
 will destroy your macs battery seriously

now time for the pros ill admit im a little biased but i think theres a reason this is my favorite game

first of all this game is massive my first 112 of this game took me a little under 100 hours if not actually 100 hours now every other playthrough of this game that ive done took me significantly less time but considering that this game was made by a team of three people and that this game is a quarter the price of dark souls id say that the amount of content in this game is remarkable and that content isnt filler content few rooms in this game are almost every room will have something new in it either a new enemy a new mechanicupgrade a piece of the story or a secret since its initial release three free content packs have come out along with one major update with a paid dlc coming in 2019 every one of the content packs released so far has had so much new content including some of the most difficult bosses in the game hidden dreams came out with bosses that if beaten enough can kill you with a single blow the grimm troupe arrived with a dream variant on a new alreadydifficult boss that took me over three hours of attempts to beat along with the hardest platforming that you might ever come across finally strike gods and glory strike godmaster arrived adding a bossrush mode exciting variants on old bosses that made them even more difficult two more endings and a boss that easily overthrew the grimm troupe boss as the hardest enemy this game has to offer

speaking of enemies the bosses are tough welldesigned and the learning curve for them is quite good i can say that i can count the number of bosses that i actually disliked on one hand and thats being pretty harsh for a few of them and there are so many and so many variants 

the atmosphere of this game is incredible the music is perfect the color pallet for everything in each area is spot on and they all contribute a part to the amazing story so immersive and so fleshed out it looks and sounds so good bless you christopher larken bless you

the story is developed through the game so well at first the story seems to be very baseline just little bits of lore to piece together you dont even know who your character is although you just assume youre the hollow knight but slowly you learn about the devastating events that eventually leads to this beautiful worlds demise there are five endings and once you learn that there was more to do in order to fix this broken kingdom you feel compelled to keep going

it amazes me how relatively unknown this game is its so incredibly cheap for what it gets you and is one of the richest worlds you will ever dive into youll become a much better player just by getting through the game and youre likely to love nearly every moment of it this is the only game that ive encountered that has significant portion of its player base sad that they didnt pay more for this game in order to support the developers an amazing world with an even better soundtrack i highly recommend this game above all others

updates
whoops looks like i made it to 400
so turns out that team cherry the genius company behind this game decided not to make the dlc theyre instead making an entirely new game in its place this is also a pro for buying the game support this amazing company

also feels like steeling for how cheap and how much content is in the game

i didnt pay enough for this

aint no way gta 6 gonna be out before silk song

cons
so much content for 15 it feels like stealing

its 2020 im 29 years old
ive been playing video games since i was 8 ive had good times with some of the greatest titles ever made

this is the best game ive ever played
i robbed the developer by only paying 20 for such a masterpiece

dont get it on a sale because youll feel like you owe the devs money the price is outrageously low for what you get

h1tldrh1

it is the ultimate metroidvania with a rich setting extremely satisfying combat responsive controls and last but not least a unique world to explore that feels like a real adventure

h1full reviewh1

i think i owe this game a detailed review let me start it by telling you that i quit playing games and even gifted my various gaming accounts to my cousininlaw a couple of years ago i did it because i lost any interest in games whatsoever i dont remember how and when i acquired hollow knight what i remember is the feeling of wonderment i experienced when i launched the game i did it on my old mac that was not even suited for playing games the feeling was so strong so avid it lasted to the very end of my several walkthroughs one hundred ingame hours later this is how i found interest in games again this is why i consider hollow knight one of the best games ever made and probably the best metroidvania to this date it gave me what i thought i had lost forever  that childlike feel of the big adventure now lets talk about the details

the fantastic bug world of hollow knight grips you right away you arrive at the fabled kingdom of hallownest in its decline without any memory of who you are or where you are heading an empty vessel at first you have no clue of your purpose there is no map in your inventory  you have to acquire it later you proceed blindly into an unknown and strangely hostile environment because you feel some weird connection to this place something is not right you see it clearly with your black holes of eyes and you try to solve the mystery with each step you take with each new character you interact with the beautiful story slowly unfolds before your voiceless hero you dont speak at all the only thing you possess to cast your will is your sharp needle and fossilized bug shells called geo that serve as a local currency

the combat is tight diverse and highly customizable with different spells and charms do you remember those classic games where you have to play with a slow clumsy character that is efficient only when your timing is precise to the automation forget them hollow knight gives you the pleasure of fighting how you want and how you enjoy of course you still have to time your movements right but it all comes with more versatility and a lot more satisfaction it is so addicting that even fighting mobs in the same zones again and again is not a chore

controls are very efficient there are many moves powerups combos spells charms to learn and use and everything is easy to pick up later in the game you roam the vast world of hallownest like a deadly ninjawarlockparkourist as with combat the movement after some progress is also very satisfying

the art style and music are masterpieces in themselves the art style is very distinctive it has a powerful gothic feeling to it which looks unbelievably majestic in a world of militant bugs the music of christopher larkin is equally grand everyone praises orchestral music in ori and the blind forest  ori and the will of the wisps although i prefer hollow knights solemn and melancholic compositions they sound so soft so gentlelike a lullaby or a fairy tale it oddly fits the gameplay

this is one of the few games i will remember and love deeply for my whole life probably with ugly nostalgic sentiments along the line it is one thing when you experience this kind of bond with something when you are a kid it is another thing when the creation of human imagination manages to touch you similarly when you are long past your teenage years it means a lot to me thank you team cherry you did something truly exceptional here

#####

the game has alot of bugs but luckily most are easy to defeat

h1short reviewh1
biread this if you just want to hear what i think about the gameib
hollow knight is simply one of the most unique metroidvania titles on the market it features a combat system that isnt very complex but still incredibly satisfying the art style is charming and filled with dread at the same time making it one of the most visually appealing the interwoven areas of hallownest are as rewarding to explore as theyre exciting with each area offering something new both visually and mechanically even the few bugs cant ruin the momentum of this masterpiece of a game

h1pros and consh1

  satisfying combat with incredible enemy variety
  absolutely stunning art style unlike anything youve seen before

h1full reviewh1
biread this if you want all the detailsib
hollow knight is a 2d metroidvania set in hallownest a land of bugs hidden beneath the surface of the earth 

h2simple yet complexh2
hollow knights combat system is without a doubt not one of the more complex ones you start with only one normal attack and one spell functioning as your special move as you progress through the game youll slowly get more special moves known as nail arts but i didnt find myself using them very often since you first had to charge them before being able to unleash them upon your foes yet somehow hollow knight manages to pull off the nearimpossible to make its combat simple yet complex while this term is quite contradictory its how i would best describe the combat im going to compare it to dark souls if youve played any of those games youll know that the range of attacks you can perform is very limited where these games get their complexity from lies in the moves of the enemies all of which have unique movesets with each move being telegraphed allowing for the player to counter it before its too late the same can be said for hollow knight i was impressed at the sheer number of different enemies since i went in knowing that the game was made by a very small team of people according to the game itself there are over 100 different enemy types sure some of them are different variations of one kind but most of them are unique this creates an experience that never gets tiresome even though the game isnt that complex there are still some possibilities for those who want to specialize in certain character builds the game offers you a set of charms that you can equip to get different bonuses these could be extra range for your weapon or a shield that protects you while youre healing yourself charms can be found by exploring the environments of hallownest theres a lot of them and this causes the exploration to be rewarding and worth your time

h2its challenging and thats a good thingh2
its not a soulslike if it isnt challenging the game truly lives up to this requirement with bosses that will absolutely test your patience the satisfaction once you beat that boss youve been stuck on for the last few hours is like always incomparable to anything else i found the bosses to be surprisingly consistent i expected that there would be your usual irritating and unfair bosses but i didnt feel like i encountered any of that kind during my entire playthrough every single boss felt fair with telegraphed moves and a moveset that wasnt too hard to master 
the combat isnt the only thing youll find yourself struggling with theres a lot of platforming sequences in the game some of which are easy others brutally hard requiring high precision and wellplanned moves im not one whove got a big knack for platformers so i did sometimes find myself challenged by these sequences but they never seemed unfair 

h2the beauty of desolationh2
if youve ever heard anything about hollow knight you should be familiar with its charming art style its visually breathtaking and unique distinguishing hollow knight from any other game  it gives the game a feel of dread while also having a soothing almost cozy feeling to it i adored the design of the characters friend and foe alike instead of featuring humans hollow knight takes a unique turn having bugs serve as the main race of the game the game fully takes advantage of this with character designs that can only be described as exceptionally creative everything is simply so beautiful and it makes you want to stop up just to look at every little detail put into the world each animation feels precise and just as weighty as it needs to be everything from the attacks of you and your enemies to the movement looks incredible combine this with an almost depressingly sad soundtrack including a unique theme for almost every area in the game and youve got a game that nails everything to do with presentation

h2worthwhile explorationh2
hallownest consists of a wide range of both visually and mechanically unique areas each area feels refreshingly unique with their individual enemy types color schemes and platforming mechanics all of the areas are intertwoven into one complete world with a metroidvania level design theres multiple ways to access each area and theyre all satisfyingly connected inspired by the bonfires of dark souls resting at a bench will fully replenish your health and allow you to equip and unequip your charms these benches are far and few between and its reliefing whenever you find one some places also require special abilities to be accessed these are often found later in the game off the beaten path forcing you to take your time exploring carefully if you want to see everything the game has to offer its always satisfying when you finally find the ability you needed to get to an unaccesible area in one of the earlier locations youve visited you can also upgrade both your health amount of soul the essence you use to perform special moves and heal yourself and the damage of your weapon this is done by finding a specific number of the required item needed to upgrade them just like charms these items are hidden throughout all of hallownest and are often easy to miss 

while i have completed the game theres still a lot left for me to do i still need to defeat the bosses i missed fully upgrade my equipment and uncover the remaining secrets of the game i look forward to continuing my journey as hollow knight simply is incredible

h2the bugs of hallownesth2
unfortunately hollow knight doesnt come without some rare yet irritating bugs yes that header pun was intentional i encountered a bug where moving the joystick would open the map and begin scrolling to the left this happened a total of 2 times throughout a 60hour playthrough so it was very rare but still annoying the game also happened to not register my jumps a few times but im not sure if it was a problem with my controller or the game these are the only two cases of bugs and glitches i remember they didnt ruin the experience at all but they were still irritating to encounter 


bfor this review i tried experimenting with giving each section a header to make the review easier to read please let me know what you thinkb

there arent many games that have cast a longer shadow over the industry than dark souls and much like what youll find lurking within them its been a bit of a curse too many indie games have been overtuned to provide a similarly punishing experience narratives have been undercooked to mimic the subtle storytelling and action has been slowed to a crawl to imitate the methodical combat but some titles have taken the right bits of inspiration and mixed them with their own brew of mechanics and from just such a concoction you will find hollow knight and in many ways the mix team cherry has come up with is a richer taste than what inspired it

hollow knight is the tale of a little bug in a big dark scary world of bugs its bugs all the way down you see the kingdom of hallownest was once a great and powerful society spread across deep warrens beneath the surface but something went wrong long ago and the kingdom fell silent now only the tiny hamlet of dirtmouth remains to mark its location though recently bugs have found themselves drawn to the lost kingdom in search of something you will follow them down there meet them battle them and the unknown denizens and change the fate of the cursed kingdom forever

pretty heavy stuff right hollow knight gets that and thats one of its first and most prominent achievements the tone this title strikes is both unique and flawless an unexpected mix of charm despair humor and dread youve probably noticed already that your little dude is absolutely adorable nipping along with his little white mask and nail the other bugs nice enough to speak to you are often just as cute but sometimes have sinister edges to them or in a few cases are downright creepy friendly critters may crack jokes or help you out while others relay ominous portends or warn you of the many dangers in and around hallownest

this balance carries on to the environments in a big way the game world is massive for a metroidvania and each area has a distinct style and atmosphere that hits all the right notes to evoke powerful reactions from the first area of dark caves and ruins you may end up in a lush grotto of vines and creatures a pleasant change until you realize the water is acidic and every bush may hide terrible dangers or you could descend into the caverns of potent fungi with mysterious bulbous foes that must be approached with great caution later journeys take you to decaying cities silent graveyards bustling coliseums desolate wastes and two of the most horrifyingly oppressive places i have ever visited in a video game im not kidding here hollow knight has topped titles from halflife to soma in crafting locations that give me relentless anxiety

another achievement worth mentioning is how hollow knight can craft such an atmosphere without hobbling the player in how they approach it part of the dark souls experience is trundling around at a slow jog fighting battles and dodging traps at a measured pace team cherry wisely elected to ignore this aspect of their inspiration instead making your little knight swift nimble and refreshingly responsive the controls here are tight allowing you to execute your dashes and sword swings with ease as you dance around bugs both great and small airborne and grounded armed and fanged at no point was i frustrated with the pace at which i could move about and the fluid motion made the elaborate and creative battles against bosses and larger enemies all the more enjoyable

as a metroidvania theres a wealth of hidden items and powers to scrounge up across the world as well some are common pieces of the genre like health and magic upgrades weapon skills and wall climbing and such but even here there are unique implementations like one of your earliest powers being essentially unlimited horizontal flight uncovering this treasure so early on feels incredibly liberating and exciting but also reveals to you just how important verticality is to the game you can further augment your movement and combat with charms that can extend your sword reach change how you move when hit or attacking or grant you all sorts of additional effects i will admit a little disappointment here at how essential some charms are over others and how the limited slots for them tend to keep me from experimenting much though

i suppose i could gripe about a few other annoyances like the rare bug i get where my charged attacks dont work or how spread out the fast travel is that latter one is a bit of a pain in truth because the stations used for fast travel tend to be quite far from points of interest you certainly wont be relying on them as much as you would castlevania warp rooms or dark souls bonfire warps the map is another aspect that could be a drag but honestly i love it you dont fill in new areas of the map until you reach a save point and to get a map at all you have to locate an amateur cartographer in each area he tends to be near one of the logical entrances and has audio and visual cues to lead you to him so theres a bit of tension in each new locale as you seek him out

its details like the map that make me love the game more really hallownest isnt just a maze to run around its a functioning world with its own rules and requirements the things hollow knight asks you to do are never unreasonable and fit with the dark and unusual tone of the places you visit nothing is out of place here and it all works in concert to immerse you in this strange world of bugs and mysticism the characters and locations are far more memorable to me than those of similar games in large part because they can be funny or creepy or adorable and still fill their role in a seamless narrative theres a lot to unpack about hallownest but instead of just resting on riddles this game makes you want to puzzle it out

on top of everything that hollow knight does right it looks and sounds absolutely breathtaking the handdrawn aesthetic gives the enemies and environments an extra spark of life complimenting the strong lines and flat colors with impressive animated details the environments in particular are labors of love that bring together careful linework bold lighting and rich particle effects to make them feel deep and authentic and the sound design does just as well with appropriately subtle melancholy melodies and impactful effects theres so much going on here that it baffles me how it could all work together so perfectly and yet it does on and on for easily 20 hours or more hollow knight does what few games manage to do take clear inspiration from classics and find its own way to surpass them

 uyou dont enjoy being left alone without a quest  main plot map markeru
 you dont like looking for secondary quests and objectives

time required to finish the main game 20 hours without a game guide
time required to complete the main game at 100 32  35 hours
time required to get all the achievements 70 hours

verdict 9510 masterpiece read below if interested to know more and why

bdetailed versionb


1 bhk absolutely deserves its price tagb as the game soundtrack the boss fights the optional content and the game locations are insanely deep well designed and meaningful check my screenshot down below  no spoilers
2 the map is huge and you will be able to backtrack it with a nice and upgradable map with the help of fast travel skills and mechanics extremely useful to get to the most hidden and beautiful areas of the game
3 the bmain plotb deals with a grim topic however be prepared to be amused by some cool sometimes cheerful and pictoresque npcs that will certainly have a place in your heart for a while
4 bevery area and every secret locationb shrine temple etc is carefully shown to the player in a remarkable and unforgettable way i wont spoil them here feel free to check communitys screeshots though allowing the player to savor every area and to get empathically tuned with it even from a lore perspective
5 hk shows an binsane enemy and boss variety 100 with a curious and lorebestiary includedb
6 a new free dlc was added on the 4th of august with additional content  2 new bosses 1 new stag station and one teleport mechanic
7 every cosmetic aspect of the game even the game menu is well designed and carefully chiseled just to show no spoilerstheres even a kickstarter area as a tribute to the initial backers

httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid961371112

httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid961322424

bhowever be aware thatb
a enemies are skilled and extremely vicious they will prevent you from doing you usual set of moves often trying and with 
 success most of time to anticipate and neutralize you without any mercy
b platforming sessions are challenging but frequent and wont forgive too many mistakes and slips while completing them
c playing hk without a controller isnt a smart idea to say the least as there are too many commands to be mastered and used
d the game is not friendly for casual players as enemies are unforgiving and all the combatmovement abilities need to be all mastered at the same time

to sum up
buy this game only if you want to play a hard gorgeous platforming masterpiece that wont take your hand when youre feeling lost without knowing which your next game destination will be

do i recommend this maybe 

its gorgeous no doubt about it and very well done

however im not a great gamer i enjoy video games and play them a few times a week but  im not particularly good at them

and i found this game impossible i typically will try a boss about 10 times before i give up i loved this game to try more times than that even though the save points tend to be a distance away from the boss fights making it difficult to do so 

but this game was difficult enough that i decided as good as it was it wasnt worth it

so i recommend get this game if you are good at video games or extremely patient i do not recommend this game for casual gamers like me

the best game ive ever played amazing story fluid gameplay npcs well planned to the point that some of them become special for you dont try to find imperfections in this game its impossible except zote hes definitely a mistake the narrative of the game keeps you immersed for hours and with each new area discovered things got even more interesting i was moved by the story of some npcs and each ending is simply epic especially if you understood the whole story of the game until the end i started playing this game in the summer of 2021 in one of the worst phases of my life sinking into my depression day after day i didnt eat right and i just thought about getting home soon and going to sleep so my best friend encouraged me to play hollow knight on call with him each playing their own save and helping the other when one was stuck somewhere and its inexplicable how much this game did for me i came home from work exhausted and my moment of happiness was opening steam and playing the game until i needed to sleep as the days went by i was able to eat better i could handle the events that happened during the day i even managed to go back to college thats when i realized how much hollow knight did me good it gave me strength to continue at a time that i had already given up on myself recently after 142 hours of gameplay 103 hours on main save i finally completed the 63 achievements some friends called me crazy it was difficult and required a lot of dedication and practice but i feel like i should do this in gratitude and respect for the game that possibly changed my life hollow knight is amazing and i assure you that the money and time invested in this game is worth a lot all my thanks to team cherry for this wonderful game and to my best friend for always supporting me and also motivating me to play this masterpiece

hollow knight is a truly ambitious metroidvania released by small indie developer team cherry in adelaide south australia hollow knight includes many platforming elements as well as an arpg feel and looting mechanic all in a sidescrolling presentation from the beginning the player is overwhelmed by the magnificent handdrawn art unique style and darkly contrasting color palette this glorious world of bugs is overflowing with originality and well its just pure eye candy

the openworld feel of the game leaves the player free to explore in many directions yet its devoid of neon signs and go here instructions leaving the player free to explore and learn about this magnificent world all on his or her own this is truly a selfpaced game and it can be played in short increments or lengthy sittings according to the players individual gaming style and preferences

sooner or later the player will find that what felt like wide open space narrows a bit because its discovered that items or abilities are needed in order to progress from one area to another backtracking will become a staple until the player figures out whats missing or meets the requirement to progress into the new area for some players this is frustrating but for others its exhilarating a true adventure finding each areas cartographer to unlock the map for the area will be essential one of the most jawdropping moments for me as a gamer was to view the massive scale of the pieced together map for the game world once every area had been mapped it was truly aweinspiring

through the course of gameplay one encounters a multitude of majestic and downright ferociouslooking bugs the imagination leaps right out of this marvelous world and drags the player right down into this thoroughly encompassing environment from the shapes and colors to the music it all creates a fantasy world like i have yet to experience anywhere in games or literature ever before

spelunkers and treasure hunters will enjoy delving into the depths of this truly massive game world while adventurers and explorers will find a metric ton of secrets that is if theyre paying attention environmental cues abound so the player will learn to use andor hone observational skills during the course of gameplay from the sound of walking flying or running water to the pace of the accompanying musical tracks absolutely everything feels deliberate

it is a true rarity to find a game that is this enjoyable especially one built to such a massive scale and crammed so full of genius so it may come as a surprise to learn that even above and beyond all of that there is an extremely well thought out storyline the player wants to learn about these creatures most importantly the hollow knight and the masked hero and to discover how this world came to be in its current state and what will become of it

its impossible to encounter every variance on one playthrough there are certain charms that may lock out others if obtained in a particular order npcs that are to either be saved or killed hidden areas secret npcs collectibles to be found grubs to be freed and up to 4 different endings  with all the hidden pathways secret areas and hidden dialogue options used to discover the lore of this world its an amazing amount of content

combat is fluid and balanced and the upgrade method is as close to perfect as ive ever seen from the main weapon nail upgrade mechanic to the collection of charms each has its own mechanic use or benefit enemy bugs possess unique strengths and weaknesses as well as their own attack and defense systems timing is essential for a lot of these battles so dont be discouraged if your character dies frequently while you figure that out there is no permadeath or loss of items and upgrades with hollow knight so you are free to die die again until you get it right

hollow knight sports full controller support and it is indeed smooth a controller is definitely recommended for the game and i had no issues with either the xbox 360 or steam controller bosses can be truly brutal so to that end ive created a playlist to help you with some of the most challenging areas bosses and grubs 

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv8rna5azpyglistplh0_k6merfyphlhkzpr5bgodwkuxgchzd

there is also a fast travel mechanic accomplished by the stagway and railway systems and a separate storyline involving the stagway system so you wont want to neglect these fast traveling will save a great deal of time as you revisit areas to reach or access something you couldnt before

i did encounter just a couple of oddities or glitches that have been added to the #gamersrule hall of weird  

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchve0srqvvufglistplh0_k6merfyphlhkzpr5bgodwkuxgchzd

however with this amount of content i would have been concerned if i hadnt encountered at least something while exploring the world of hollow knight its mindboggling to me that team cherry created such an enormous game world and that its as close to perfect as this one appears to be i have over 260 hours ingame and yet i still have more to accomplish thanks to the upcoming update sometime this month which introduces a new method for fast travel dark gates and new bosses i have a feeling team cherry isnt done with this world quite yet and we may even see an expansion or sequel in the near future this reviewer sure hopes so until next time

there will be times when you only want to keep playing more and there will be times when you dont want anything to do with the game ever again there will be obstacles and there will be sweet moments of victory you will be amused and you will be frustrated you will cry and you will laugh you will say awww and you will say fuck this fucking piece of shit insect you will die and you will triumph

this is the video game known as hollow knight

1010



edit ive now spent 138 hours playing the game did 112 did absolutely everything in it including all pantheons with all bindings path of pain speedruns steel soul mode saw every ending got every steam achievement and i have slowly come to the conclusion that regardless of genre hollow knight is one of the best video games ever made it was developed by a team of only four people a game designerdirector an animator a programmer and a composersound designer and what those four people managed to create is something truly unique and amazing

all i can now do before the sequel comes out is to play the eternal ordeal over and over again

looks good plays good feels good beating path of pain is more pleasurable than sex

after 450 hours still cant dodge the primal aspid

hollow knight started out as a humble kickstarter campaign in november 2014 the publisherdeveloper team cherry from australia managed to raise just over 57000 au to fund their project after what seemed like a long and exhausting wait however update and content filled it may have been the indie project finally hit the digital shelf in february 2017 as it stands hollow knight has been deemed toptier of the metroidvania genre time and time again and for a very well rounded myriad of reasons

the story of hollow knight is vague and sparse yet it becomes somewhat easier to understand the further that one travels within the game rather than being given a direct story the plot unfolds throughout interactions with various creatures and objects talking to npcs multiple times over until they start repeating themselves is essential in a nutshell and without giving too much away our hero hollow knight has ventured to the land of hallownest first encountering the aboveground city of dirtmouth it soon becomes evident that he needs to break the three seals of the black temple in order to uncover the full truth of what happened to the now ruined and infested world the infection and fate of the residents becomes explained in further detail and the game houses a total of three endings to enjoy

as with all metroidvania titles hollow knight is hard theres absolutely no denying the challenge that it brings players regardless of their new or veteran status within the genre however rather than pummeling gamers with highoctane action the overall atmosphere is surprisingly relaxing yet at times utterly disturbing theres an odd sense of comfort within the bugridden landscapes and caverns thats mostly heralded by a dreamy ambience and matching soundtrack with that said dont be fooled into thinking that there arent a plethora of frantic platforming sections boss battles and minibosses not to mention the insane arena challenges that lay deep within the bowels of hallownest but know that fast action is not the primary focus of the gameplay

much of the difficulty can be compared to the dark souls series in that every death can cause the player irreversible agony charms addon skills and weapon upgrades are purchased with currency known as geo which is collected from nodes and foes whatever geo is on the player at the time of death is completely lost to the void but there is a bank where up to 4500 can be deposited it should also be noted that many charms are made to break upon death and once they are broken they are unusable for the rest of the game however one does have the potential to recover lost geo by returning to and claiming their death shroud at the place of their untimely demise

as players adventure and explore the world of hallownest and its many subsections they will both discover and be rewarded with new skills many of them allow access to new areas such as the ability to double jump dash use magic and hurtle through the air endlessly until striking a wall given the vastness of the world hollow knight has a great map system in place that can also be upgraded by purchasing upgrades from shopkeepers each section of the game requires an area map which also means that gamers must find the mapmaker in each location while the mapmaker fills out a small portion of each area on the map its up to players to fill out the rest of it by means of exploration there are also multiple ways to traverse the terrain whether it be by manual navigation or taking special stagway stations and trams from one side of the map to the other

to put it simply hollow knight is an outstanding title the art direction is rich with lavish detail yet still kept cartoony with a style thats reminiscent of edmund mcmillens work theres no words that can do justice to just how eerily aweinspiring the soundtrack is either each area of the game has its own set of tunes and every single one of them is haunting and brilliantly captivating team cherry are also still supporting hollow knight well over a year since its initial release by adding numerous free dlc packs with the final one coming in on august 23 2018 needless to say if youre a fan of metroidvania style games then picking up hollow knight is a nobrainer its even well worth it at full price heres to hoping that theres a second release in the future

we dont deserve this game

#####

near top of the list or possibly the best metroidvania game ive ever played the level of polish attention to detail and sheer scope of the game is borderline unbelievable ive enjoyed every hour ive played of hollow knight and highly recommend the game for fans of the genre the soundtrack is also fantastic and worth a purchase as well

#####

best indie game ever in my opinion

#####

this game is literally 100 hours of content for 15 dollars give team cherry your money please

#####

better than meth
1010

#####

i went into this game unable to tell if it was quite as great as everyone said it was also expecting a standard 15 hour indie game and yeah i liked some games like it i was definitely wrong about the amount of content i found 30 hours in where i still had so much left to do i spent a little while lost and feeling like i wasnt getting my powers quite as fast as i liked then it all started coming together the atmosphere already had me the vague and mysterious ways of breadcrumbing the lore was slowly getting to me and i found myself drawn more and more into the world i had my doubts and i definitely had my frustrations but i have to say this game is a masterstroke in video game world building and gameplay structure everything i did felt earned attainable all i had to do was explore it took a while to get there but i dont regret a bit of it its simple to pick up and play but much harder to master but this is one of the few games that i could notably feel myself getting better at within around 30 hours in and it feels incredible i dont replay a lot of games and i never expected myself to love this one this much but as i am finishing it up im seriously considering playing it again alrady not everyone will love this either but i think if you like the look and the simple mechanics enough its almost assured youll enjoy this

#####

this game is like crack just the right amount of challenge and reward also a classic metroidvania please ignore the comparisons to dark souls

so here i was 15 game sitting in my list for months decided to blow through it during my final week of summer holiday i was wrong 

you dont blow through ihollow knighti in a day if you dont know what youre doing youre going to be a broken manwoman when you come back from this ihollow knighti is so deceptively massive it puts other games to shame also take into account the consistent art style amazing music and captivating story and lore and youre looking at the most incredible bang for your buck

ihollow knighti throws you into the depths of hallownest a forgotten insect kingdom that has long since been reduced to destitute and ruin only a small town and divided tribes remain enter you a small stag beetle with a black cloak and a rusty nail devoid of memory and burdened with a purpose to seek out a great evil and seal it along the road youll meet many other characters who either sympathise with your quest to downright try to murder you slowly but surely youll uncover what has happened to hallownest and what your real goal is 

as a metroidvania ihollow knighti doesnt hold your hand too long it gives you the basics and immediately throws you into the deep end no thats not right it throws you in a pool with three deep ends and none of them warn you about the sudden dropoff ihollow knighti is entirely nonlinear certainly some obstacles need to be passed before youre able to clear some definite roadblocks but even then the game is not going to stop you from going about it exactly the way you want it this is incredible because it allows you to go on a real exploration this is also disheartening when you run into a brick wall and have no idea how to get around it without learning how to play at a level you were never eased into 

ihollow knighti can be quite hard the first time through not just idark soulsi hard but imegamani hard the only way to really clear some of the fights is by learning and getting better there are no real workarounds or cheese methods 
that doesnt mean ihollow knighti is impossible its just a surprising change from what youd expect from a game that looks like an early 80ies disney film concept i got stuck on a nasty boss with a lot of magical powers and a long walk to its room i couldnt beat without snapping my controller in half i decided to leave the area and explore other parts of the game eventually i went through roughly three times as many areas as i had already explored acquired a much stronger weapon more health and practice 

your character the knight starts out weak like samus would in imetroidi but gains more power and abilities over the course of the game however unlike the former trendsetter the knights options dont open up so clearly as they to do samus there are no brightly coloured doors or jumps that seem to far without an augment ihollow knighti has you chart your progress on a map since it only updates when you save itll often show blank spaces and gaps for you to try and find a way through with your new ability the map mechanic in general is very well designed and is used much more frequently than you would in imetroidi although that might be because i know imetroidi maps by heart these days 

combat in ihollow knighti is another important element to master you must come to respect all its aspects from jumping and slashing to focussing and pogo its essential you make yourself familiar with everything to even stand a chance to help you there are charms little upgrade tags you can equip in a limited capacity to augment your abilities however there are no hard counters to any enemy or boss in the game so youll still need to do the work yourself it becomes rewarding but can also be stressful

that doesnt mean it is all bad news from the moment you begin youre thrust into a beautiful world with so many mysteries to ponder youll be forgiven for dying while admiring the view dark caverns lush forests shining mines dreary cities and ghastly pits are all par for the course another thing to lose yourself over are the enemy animations which are clear and telegraph incoming attacks well making it possible to at least learn enemy patterns before being sent back to the bench furthermore there are over 150 different enemies so a lot of work went into preserving the variety so even in the furthest regions of hallownest youll be running into new threats 
the sound helps to sell this buginfested hell hole great care was taken to create a nuanced set of ambient and action effects that help sell the world however we cannot ignore the incredible soundtrack ihollow knighti is accompanied by very subtle but an effective score the soft tunes add incredible character to any scene the elegiac nature of the score makes the world so much more fleshed out its like walking into the phendrana drifts in imetroid primei over and over again

i think that a special mention has to go out the final boss not only is this bad boy hard but it is also a great case of boss design because it will test you on everything the boss attacks are straight out of the books from all the other bosses and even the insanely hard platforming gets a show

i managed to beat the game at 106 at the end of my first playthrough i didnt even do everything there was to do i didnt beat a hard boss from the second content pack i didnt fight all the rematches i also couldnt pull off a victory against the pantheon boss rush from the last content pack forget the path of pain or the steel soul mode its not for me however even after passing on those parts of the game the rest of the is so insanely rich in content youll be hardpressed to feel buyer remorse even if youre not into somewhat challenging massive nonlinear actionadventure games with compelling art style and beautiful music then at least you owe it to the industry to support this effort

a masterpiece
the dark and misty environment the story mainly underground and some moments reminding of tim burtons films may give a feeling of depression this is for me what makes the charm of the game
the melancholic music fits perfectly and polish this unhealthy atmosphere

the controls are very responsive and the spells enjoyable the icing on the cake is the high number of skills and all possible combinations
overall every associations are viable depending on how you play
customizing a character is always very welcome especially when the changes are so visible and smart

congratulations to team cherry for all the love and care they brought to their creation i highly recommend

	tdtheres basically 2 main things you do in the game combat and exploration both of them are just as engaging as the other finding shards grubs abilities notches charms and sometimes whole ass areas is extremely rewarding the boss fights are pristine as well and all the game systems feed into each other really really well i will say doe that the world enemies arent super engaging and the game does take its time to set up until you get the first couple abilities so some people might quit early on  but i promise its incredible after thattd

	tdwhether its the npcs levels design random monuments you find the items etc  everything keeps adding answers and questions youd have about the world im not too much of a lore guy for me its about how the world and its story feels overall with a vague interpretation of thats how it once was damn and hollow knight does that really well the little mini stories of the npcs are interesting and it even uses the dream nail mechanic for some little storytelling mixed with the gameplay when you fight with certain warriors in their peak and once you literally fight a girls image of this dude about how great a warrior he is lmao then theres subtle storytelling through the level design itself about how its always raining the city of tears and hence it has the royal waterways  a sewer level right below it little things like these add verisimilitude to the world  td

	tdextremely polished whether were talking about the basic movement the combat or the abilities the combat mechanics really hold their own even when you push em to their limit its very consistent and well done and synergize well with the dash double jump charms etc speaking of the dash though one hiccup i noticed was that if youre facing left and press dash  you dash left which is great but if you press right with the dash you still go left a lot of the times if you press right before the dash you always go right though so that middle ground where its shaky what direction you end up dashing in really only matters in very intense boss fights or challenges like the spoilerpath of painspoiler but its worth pointing out regardless apart from that i found it weird that the superdash thingy cannot be canceled once fully charged but a commenter just pointed out that there actually is a way to do this so wth ill just make this a 10 td

	tdim surprised how this game has nearly no weak bosses it kind of blows my mind how creatively they use the same 2d space to create so many unique boss fights that feel both mechanically and aesthetically unique i do wish there were more platforming challenges though i did do the spoilerwhite palace and path of painspoiler and that only made me want more since the mechanics have all this potential wish there was more of that the third kind of challenge was in the exploration which was amazing as well finding new paths making connections unlocking more of the map while feeling lost was a really engaging experience i do think it couldve been much better with 2 more things 1 the warp back to bonfire takes away a lot from the experience i didnt realize you could do this and when i did the tension was gone by a lot the game should start from exactly where you quit to menu and 2 the actual enemies you encounter while exploring are not difficult at all tbh and while i think the challenge was great in the game i almost never died at all outside of like 67 boss fights which were all optional and the platforming challenges while the boss fight difficulty is subjective i do think the normal enemies pose too less a challenge unless were talking about the trials overall still an excellent challenge designtd

back in b1986b in bjapanb bnintendob released the game called bmetroidb which instantly got the attention thanks to its nonlinear gameplay another famous nonlinear title that was released that year was bthe legend of zeldab but unlike bzeldab bmetroidb combined nonlinear gameplay with our usual sidescrolling one it looked and felt like typical sidescrolling shooter but it also had nonlinear gameplay which felt unexpectedly good actually it was so good that the second chapter in bthe legend of zeldab series tried to do exactly the same bzelda ii the adventure of linkb combined the big open world from the first game with bmetroidbs sidescrolling mechanics and guess what bzeldab wasnt even the only series that did that bakumajō draculab also known for benglishbspeaking people as bcastlevaniab the first game of which was also released in b1986b did exactly the same in its second game called bsimons questb which was absolutely fantastic but heavily ruined for benglishbspeaking players thanks to a very confusing translation anyway more time have passed bthe legend of zeldab switched back to its old meachanics in ba link to the pastb and then made a huge revolution in genre with bocarina of timeb bcastlevaniab on the other hand did exactly the opposite it kept playing with the formula to finally achieve something absolutely brilliant of course im talking about bcastlevania symphony of the nightb the game that everybody loves it was just that  a perfect blend between bmetroidb and bcastlevaniabs dark setting thats the story of the genre that people call metroidvania a genre in which sidescrolling gameplay is perfectly mixed with nonlinear exploration why am i telling you all that well thats because thats exactly what we have here a charming little imetroidvaniai

to be completely honest though i wasnt that excited when this game came out a lot of people were excited about it it got a lot of positive reviews from both press and the actual players but i was just sitting there looking at screenshots and thinking meh here comes another cute little indie something its hard to say why exactly but i wasnt really excited about it like iat alli screenshots looked cute but they didnt make me want to actually buy and play the game right away thankfully there was a friend of mine who just bought it to me and forced me to play it just because he loved the game ohsomuch and guess what it didnt took me long to fall in love with this game too

bhollow knightb just has that isomethingi that makes you love it right away right after you begin playing it you feel like you want to stay which i must admit isnt the most common thing among indie titles i mean i buy and play a lot of indie titles many of them are good some are iveryi good but still most of the time they dont have that isomethingi that makes your feelings click that something that makes you want to forget about everything and just keep sacrificing all of your free time to a single game bhollow knightb is the game that made me feel like a five years old kid with the bnesb all over again why well the answer isnt that simple just because there are many reasons for that

first of all bhollow knightb follows a formula of another popular franchise bdark soulsb in its way to tell you the story when youll arrive in the world of bhollow knightb youll be lost and confused but not in the bad way instead of feeling bad youll feel like you want to stay explore and get some answers and youll sure get them but again you wont get them directly by visiting different places and talking with different characters youll get the story in a form of scattered pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will you be able to connect them in the right way to get the full picture or not is entirely up to you such thing sure worked in the bfrom softwarebs series and it sure works here as great as it can be which feels even more good thanks to amazing atmosphere that is made of fantastic b2db backgrounds smooth handmade animation and the incredible soundtrack like bbastionb bhollow knightb is one of those games that will make you want to pay more just for the soundtrack while visuals feel way better in action thanks to how its never about still images bhollow knightb is full of beautoful animations that make it feel ialivei in other words bhollow knightb is one of those games that will make you want to ilivei in it

but like ive already said thats not the only reason why this game is so good the thing is even though it was literally made by only two people bari gibsonb and bwilliam pellenb the gameplay is so great and polished that it feels like youre playing one of those expensive titles from bnintendob im not kidding remember bmetroid samus returnsb from b3dsb bhollow knightb is something that you can seriously compare with it and it just blows my mind just think about it two guys made a metroidvania game that can be seriously compared with the real deal bboomb mind blown everything in bhollow knightb feels just right the difficulty depends only on how ambitious you are like in the bdark soulsb and bbloodborneb you can take your time and finish the game in the easy way or rush for all achievements and the hard battles the decision is entirely yours the controls are very responsive which means that even in the hardest battles itll be all about you and your skill not about dang the freakin controls made me die again like in some other games you know which ones i mean im sure the map is advanced enough to make you find your way easily but at the same time youll unlock it step by step which means that it wont ruin the exploration feeling at certain points youll probably need to draw some maps by hand like in the good old times which feels absolutely awesome the levels have enough variety and come with some really ireallyi nice design which is absolutely rare thing to see nowadays et cetera et cetera even in the small details this game shines very bright for example some of the hidden areas here are very well hidden ibuti it wont feel bad because every single time therell be a hint like some light coming through the wall some cracks on the rocks hello bthe legend of zeldab fans some sound hints bgold skulltulasb ho

the best thing about bhollow knightb at least in my opinion is that its a game that feels absolutely right in every place possible add the multiple endings free bdlcb that feel surprisingly good and wellintegrated into the main game full gamepad support and other things like that and youll see why everybody loves this game so much bhollow knightb feels like its creators didnt just want to make a iproducti to sell it feels like above everything else bari gibsonb and bwilliam pellenb wanted to make a game theyll enjoy playing iby themselvesi sure its not like we dint have enough metroidvanias already but its a iveryi rare thing to see the game that is as full of love and passion as this one the game that just feels absolutely and completely irighti and its iimpossiblei not to love it

game is incredible if you are a fan of metroidvanias buy it it is only 15 the amount of content here is astounding an average playthrough takes 2030 hours seriously one of if not my favorite game of 2017

 atmosphere and music are wonderful soundtrack is memorable each area in hollow nest feels different and masterfully designed it was an absolute blast to explore the depths the world is huge and allows the player to choose their path get ready to do some backtracking 

 beautiful hand drawn art style the cutscenes and characters designs are cute yet creepy there are tons of enemies and inventive bosses 130 enemies and 30 bosses

 tight controls with plenty of abilities to find the sense of progression is great you become stronger and more confident as you play you can also equip charms that give you unique traits

 challenging you will die a lot on boss fights learning enemies attack patterns are key to winning these fights only one boss felt unfair 

 h1 score h1

b 910 b

in conclusion hollow knight offers a solid experience through and through it is an outstanding value for 15 without any exaggeration it is one of the best metroidvania games ever made and one of the most prominent titles this year

#####

team cherry deserve so much praise for creating such a breathtaking experience hollow knight is so complex and ambitious on so many levels that most developers wouldnt dare to try half of the things they did in this game

the map is huge there are so many places to visit explore and find secrets all along the variety of enemies is astonishing there is a rich lore underneath all these layers of content the more you delve into it the more satisfying it becomes on top of that the ost is just phenomenal

some people consider this game as tough as nails type of game from my experience it is true there are some tough battles but the flexibility in strategies that charms allow make most of these a fascinating exercise of creativity and patience all in all the game is usually fair and you are just a combination away from finding the perfect strategy to succeed

such level of excellence can only mean that hollow knight is a multimillion production from one the biggest studios in the industry right well this is not the case it was developed by a small indie team through a successful kickstarter campaign thats why they deserve all the praise in the world this game can hold its ground against the best games in the genre or even history

godspeed to team cherry take all the time needed to make silksong another masterpiece

h1ihollow knighti is a game where a lauded reputation precedes it including that of being brutally difficult what was striking to me is that it does live up to this reputation in every wayh1

a mysterious bug emerges from the wilderness to discover an ancient village decrepit and with one sole inhabitant who points out a mysterious ruined city far below compelled by this mystery the small insect descends to discover the secrets beneath

listh1prosh1
rich lore and setting
gothic aesthetic that adds to the mood
intuitive and flexible playstyles
fair challenge that rewards increasing skill

h1consh1
immense amounts of backtracking
sometimes frustrating pathways back to the bosses if you need to retry the fight
not always clear about what to do or where to go next
list

h1storyh1
rich in archetypal symbolism from contrasting opposing forces to vague references to dreams and a creeping infestation and plague that results in madness ihollow knighti explores its themes of decay and decrepitude with you the player the knight gathering the last remnants of civilization even as you ultimately seal its own fate in one of four possible endings 

the motifs that ihollow knighti uses are sometimes subverted and sometimes remain the same even as the world descends into further chaos due to your actions which have a real and visible affect on a certain area of the game for instance light and illumination are here in the role of the jungian shadow just as the darkness or void and chaos are revealed to as the substance of the knight in a world of ruin anarchy becomes paramount and the swathes of destruction that you leave in your wake partially reveal you as an antihero just as much as the prophsized saviour its a beautifully complex tale and the lore is often revealed through poetic stanzas phrased and contextualized in prophetic forms its also subtle barely revealing the hints to the player until youve actually encountered it and realise what was being referred to at times this vagueness can be frustrating but it does lead to further impetus to explore to figure out the mysteries that surround the environs in which you are in

h1gameplayh1
its this notion of exploration and discovery that drive many elements of the game as such various motivators are used from various collectibles whether its slaughtering enemies to add to the bestiary or pursuing charms to gain additional advantages or unfolding the next segment of the story there is much to explore this is impeded by aforementioned enemies and the area designs themselves as interconnected as they might be with multiple entrances and two transport options the game itself will actively limit your exploration with a variety of hazards backtracking after gaining a new ability becomes essential as new parts of old areas will become accessible at times this can be immensely frustrating as you slowly wend your way back across the map praying for a bench to save your progress

the controls to accomplish all this are fluid and responsive i played with the keyboard that used the arrow keys to control movement and z x c  d that controlled various abilities such as dash and attack from this basic system emerges one that is far more complex jumping and swinging your sword in a down attack can result in a pogo like movement combining dash with an attack can result in a new move and the game slowly reveals its complexities its intuitive and flows easily which is a direct counterpart to the games other mechanics 

enemies come in a great variety all with distinct move sets to be memorized and unique strategies to defeat the environment itself becomes a tool defeating a flying enemy may mean avoiding it by jumping up a wall then dashing off of it to slice your enemy from the air or dodging incoming missiles by dashing behind part of the scenery so that it harmlessly hits the object instead enemies also at times explode so even a triumph might inadvertently turn into a defeat at times i found myself also luring enemies toward hazards such as water or acid making them dash towards me leaping overhead to watch them drown in the depths although this did lessen my financial reward notably the game does reward a more cautious playstyle than an aggressive one and this may not sit well with some players

the bosses are where the main struggle of the game also arises usually located fairly far from the benches you need to first get to them then attempt to defeat them soul which is used to heal yourself may be used up just before you get to them and so trying to harvest from the enemies on the way creating a balancing act between acquiring soul from hits and using it to heal damage becomes a delicate economical affair the bosses themselves have the familiar stages of attack patterns to them as well as unique attacks to each one  some bosses can be faced multiple times with the second iteration a far harder battle yet offering a greater reward

currency takes the form of geo which can be used to purchase additional charms or map markers it also acts as a toll fee to open up transport options and at times even benches which serve as rejuvenation and save points early game i struggled immensely with geo it was in short supply and even affording a map which are essential was often a struggle however my mid to late game it was in more plentiful supply 

the charms become essential midgame and finding unique interactions and boosts around them will aid in various play styles you can boost soul intake for more healing or spell casting or boost up your nail sword arts for more damaging attacks finding a set that suits your needs adds a slight rpg like feel to a game that doesnt really have true rpg mechanics in fact i began to find mid and late game to be far easier as i boosted myself with the charms and new earned abilities

h1graphicsh1
with its low system requirements ihollow knighti still manages to appear incredible this largely lies in the creative art design and small attention to details the colour palette is sombre and subdued yet the ornate and intricate fore and backgrounds great a gothic aesthetic that is hard to compare to it simultaneously creates the sense of decay a mood of despair whilst still portraying the decadence of the once great kingdom here are all the same hallmarks of art style that games like castlevania and dark souls also used to great effect 

the animations are fluid and each enemy can be clearly seen to have unique aspects so essential to knowing which attack theyll use and so how to avoid it this combined with the creativity of the designs makes for a game that is constantly providing feedback to the player about how to react in order to survive 

h1audioh1
the soundtrack is gorgeous and use of leitmotifs will occur at intervals to hint at new events as well as obviously each boss having their own unique track further increasing the intensity of the fight the calmness and tranquility of a few of the ordinary environmental tracks help calm you even as the frustration and high intense concentration required from the gameplay increase stress so this counterpoint was one i was rather grateful for

h1conclusionh1
ihollow knighti certainly lived up to the high acclaim it has received i was immensely surprised by it and despite the initial difficulty curve i found myself absorbed by its world environments gameplay and lore as they unfolded the exploration struck a wonderful balance between the extrinsic motivation i want that new charm to the intrinisic will i be skilled enough to overcome this gauntlet of traps its truly a wonderful experience and whilst it is hard it is rewarding immensely so

h1score 910 elegiac explorationh1

ii received this game as a gift many thanks to the donatori

cry because the soundtrack is so good thereby adding a couple of tears to the city
enjoy the game further down to the very end because it is a masterpiece

#####

ori and the blind forest is the best metroidvania i said being fascinated in its beautiful graphics expecting not to find a deeper metroidvania and then finding axiom verge
axiom verge is the best metroidvania i said being fascinated by deep lore and amazing hr gigerlike atmosphere
then i heard somebody say hollow knight is the best metroidvania and i was like oh graphics look way too simplistic and it probably does not have lore as deep as axiom verge     oh boy i were wrong
right now i say that this is the best metroidvania as i never felt anything similar as when i were going into the abyss below hallownest the feeling of exploration being afraid of going to the new locations i loved it

h1 descriptionh1
nowadays there are lots of metroidvania titles on the market but none can compare to hollow knight the famous 2d platformer combines rich lore with deceptively simple mechanics that work flawlessly in the oncethriving kingdom called hallownest its gorgeous art style and the many uniquely designed npcs create a cohesive world that provides lots of content secrets and  of course  unlimited freedom it is the perfect example of what sheer passion can create when a strong sense of purpose is shared among game developers

h1 settingh1
h3summaryh3
in an effort to uncover its origins and purpose the broken vessel returns to the lonely town of dirtmouth after a long wait the nameless knight with the shining nail on its back gazes upon the oncerevered kingdom that is threatened by an unknown spreading infection will the voiceless creature unravel the secrets of this hollow world or will it succumb to the perils that it will eventually encounter in its journey

h3storyh3
rather than bombarding the adventurer with numerous unskippable cutscenes hollow knight encourages exploration the world is vast and complex with numerous secrets and colourful characters that leave plenty of room for interpretation even though vague environmental storytelling can be also encountered in other souls game counterparts i find hollow knight exceptionally unique as each piece of the bigger puzzle has a distinctive sense of place and purpose

h1 gameplayh1
many things can be said about the gameplay because it is easy to learn and hard to master lets explore some of the features

h3combath3
the combat in hollow knight is supreme in every way the simple controls combined with the responsive environment reward skill and patience by leaving little room for error death is hidden in every corner and thus it is essential to get acquainted with various attack patterns as well as the many upgrades found around the world that will either boost the knights health or damage potential for those who are more interested in exploration rather than fighting hallownest also provides a wide range of platforming obstacles that test reflexes and fast reactions
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2848372864fileuploadsuccess1
h3enemiesh3
in the vast ecosystem of hallownest many bugs and species reside with different strengths and weaknesses certain enemies can be encountered only in specific terrains and areas so that they can blend in perfectly with the environment a good example of this concept is fog canyon where tight spaces leave the player more vulnerable to its explosive enemy variants as far as bosses are concerned i am amazed by their original movesets  from the small agile counterparts to the bigger more powerful ones each encounter feels unique and fair with specific patterns and themes that provide thrill and immersion
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2848374323fileuploadsuccess1
h3progressionh3 
there is no correct way of playing the game as the enormous intertwined map can be traversed through many nooks and crannies as the knight progresses through hallownest it will encounter various npcs and places providing new tools nail arts and charms are among the main upgrades that can customize the overall playstyle they range from small effects like increasing enemy recoil to large additions like transforming some basic spells into more complicated variants everything can be upgraded with geo the games currency by specific npc merchants scattered around the world it is essential to mention that geo drops upon defeating enemies

despite the many freedoms provided in the game i should also mention the players limitations like in any other soulslike title when the player dies they leave a shade behind that needs to be killed in order to collect all the geo lost in the process at the same time the knights soul meter mana is broken limiting it to 66 percent it is essential to mention that the shade can cast one additional spell for each soul vessel the player has collected making the encounters extremely dangerous

binteractive worldb
a staggering amount of content found in hollow knight is completely optional due to its impressive worldbuilding for example if the player feels overwhelmed by a specific path they can follow another route with hopes of finding new skills or upgrades thanks to fast travelling the broken vessel can overcome the oftentimes tedious task of traversing the enormous world of hallownest without losing any progression in the process another amazing feature is the numerous recognisable routes or secret passages that connect areas next to each other

h3difficultyh3
after completing the game for the first time a new game mode can be activated called steel soul mode in this particular scenario the knight does not respawn upon death and the game save file resets if the player wants to hone their skills on a specific boss or challenge their parkour techniques they can also visit various places like the hall of gods or the white palace

having bugs serve as the main civilization of the story the game provides a nice little twist that i appreciate every npc looks unique and different with vivid colours and patterns that seem pleasant to the eye similarly the same thing can be said about the luscious scenery that makes up the cohesive living world of hallownest rain effects picturesque buildings and humid green paths all merge perfectly with each other providing many references to the remnants of the fallen kingdom

h1 audioh1
amazed by the amount of effort put into the sound design im unable to express how wellpolished the game looks with the addition of a unique bug language along with recognizable character voices that even to this day have not been fully deciphered the orchestral music that plays in the background provides a breathtaking experience especially during boss fights on top of that it evokes emotions in patterns of tension and release depending on the scenery of the various places and the backstory of certain characters

h1 side notesh1
in the past various bugs were encountered in every playthrough pun intended with the majority of them having almost no effect on the overall experience thanks to the constant scheduled updates and content packs provided frequently by the developers the game runs smoothly even to this day

h1 verdicth1
by combining both visual and mechanical superiority in every way hollow knight remains one of its kind the enormous amount of quality and content offered for such a small price is simply staggering  and for that reason it deserves a special place in our gaming hearts

my favorite game ever i spent months convincing a friend to buy this game and when he finally did the first thing he said after playing was im sorry i waited so long dont be like him buy this game 

1010

#####

silksong is going to be announced this year for sure

source trust me bro

#####

words cannot describe how much i love this game but ill try
say you have a friend who wont stop bugging you about a certain game you decide to buy it just to get them to stop and its one of  if not the best  games you have ever played before the graphics are stunning the story is plentiful and the interactions between friendly npcs shape their personalities though not always clearly perfectly
hollow knight is that game for me
side note  the games community isnt full of screaming children at least not as far as ive seenbecause the game is difficult but not impossible and that level of difficulty works incredibly to discover that one player determined and willing to die a few times or a lot in my case i still occasionally run into attacks or fall directly onto spikes lol if it means they can come back and try againor just to get past that difficult boss or platforming bit
another side note  i would not recommend playing the harder difficulty after beating the game once directly after the final boss i was still warming up to the game then but go ahead if you feel ready 
absolutely would recommend i am right now p

i want to eat this game

i bought this game a year ago on sale for 749 and only just now got around to playing it 60 hours later i cant help but feel that i robbed the devs blind

ihollow knighti is a masterpiece as of this post over 97 of the reviews are positive  and for good reason theres almost nothing but positive things to say about it

youll come across 100 enemies 47 bosses 45 equippable charms and 20 locales or so plus a wide array of abilities and techniques dozens upon dozens of secrets and lots of lore 

the ost is so good it almost makes me angry and the visual art style is phenomenal they also really nailed the controls  everything is very intuitive responsive and fluid combat is immensely enjoyable

i had so much fun playing this game cant wait for silksong

#####

h1one of the best metroidvanias ever createdh1

i abolutely adore this game and everything about it i hardly ever play platformers and this was the first one i made it 100 of the way through its that good im more of a firstperson shooter or 3d adventure game type of person so this genre was a little different than what i was really used to i wouldnt have picked it up if my friend pumpkin head hadnt told me to and im really glad he recommended it to me hollow knight has easily become one of my favorite games of all time

as an artist i seriously appreciate the absoutley stunning style effort and craftsmanship of the backgrounds animation and character design the art style is magnificent and inspiring and has influenced my own art in a way i have always loved the theme of darkness pale face dark eyes and mystery this game includes all of the aesthetics i love into a wonderful looking platformer the main character the knight has such a simple yet cool design and i get pretty picky with my characters in videogames i typically will dismiss a game or show very quicky if i dont attach to or like any characters but in hollow knight ive fallen in love with the designs 

the mechanics in the game are so solid and feel so genuine a mix of sound animation and mechanics really make it feel like you have absolute control of your character everytime youd get a solid hit youd feel it and every time youd get hit youd feel that too every win or loss was by your hand and it never felt like the game had cheated you or it was was anyone elses doing besides your own the variety of ways you can play not only make the game feel more dynamic but it also means that it caters to the different playstyles of the person with the controller you have a choice to use certain charms abilities magic and the nail itself the variety of which you can play just makes it feel like the game never really ends

music is so important in videogames and the christopher larkin has done a phenomenal job creating the soundtrack for hollow knight the action and emotion behind his work fits flawlessly with the style of the game and the overall story i listen to the soundtrack all the time it inspires me and reminds me of all of the adventures i had ingame the variety of styles in music correlate perfectly with the play areas ingame and the mechanic of changing a few instruments in the song based on location was executed perfectly it really feels like the music follows you throughout the hallownest

tdlr i absolutely love the art style the mechanics are solid and have variety and the music brings the game together with the story flawlessly

10010 i definitely recommend anyone pick up this game and give it a try its not an easy game and it doesnt hold your hand and tell you where to go its an adventure but its your adventure the story is phenomenal and its worth more than the store price at least to me beautiful game best one ive played in a while

this game is literally so addictive its so good its worth my first ever review and ive been on steam for 4 years

great music
this game is handdrawn
reminds me of dark souls difficult bosses and free to explore and go your own way
hidden walls  secrets
multiple endings
play your style no one wa y to play the game

it is just a blast to play

#####

i didnt know where tf to go

#####

this is not a game this is art

#####

do you like exploring do you like smooth combat and do you like bugs if so play this


#####

cant sex zote but still a great game i guess

#####

this game has enough positive reviews that i doubt anyone will ever read this but we throw the term metroidvania around pretty loosely for anything with a semiopen map and obstacles that are only passable after youve gotten a new ability this game is different in that its truly about exploring the nooks and cranies of a big world 

im not sure this game is as good as symphony of night but i think its on par with the snes metroid as a single guy i can say with confidence that this is a game ill someday play with my kids

ive played several excellent games in my opinion in the past year undertale doom wuppo ori and the blind forest to name a few byet hollow knight has to be my favourite out of them allb the amount of content in this game is absolutely absurd i still cant believe that team cherry the developers is a team of only 3 people the dedication and hard work put into the creation of hollow knight are admirable team cherry has earned a spot on my radar 

h1positiveh1
there is so much that i love about this game from the gameplay to the musical decisions

 in my opinion hollow knight has perfected the controls for a 2d platformer there is no momentum thus your character moves exactly as you command him to while in the air downward slashing enemies causes you to pogo yourself slightly upwards you also gain the ability to wall jump double jump and dash while progressing in the game all adding complexity to your movement in addition to bosses there are several rooms in the game that will test your movement abilities both are challenging but quite fair taking damage or dying is almost entirely your fault 

 how your character plays and your fighting style is customizable you can equip charms badges that power you up in different ways ie attack faster improve melee magic defense offense or mobility it is completely up to you and can be changed at almost any time 

 the art style beautiful and it is hand drawn the amount of detail put into each and every room is astonishing i urge you to take the time to just observe look at the foreground the background the animations the developers must have put countless hours to make everything just right

 dont get me started on the music the ost is beautifully made and each track suits their respective environments so well example you visit a place called soul sanctum pale church with spirits roaming around organs play as background music youre in a forest soft piano the noises of leaves rustling as you brush by and faint insect noises in the background youre deep underground in a dead cave no music loud echoes you hear only enemies scuttling around your footsteps and dry plants brushing you need i say more

 there are a lot of optional content in hollow knight for example several powerups are optional but they improve your mobility or give you new spells even the lore is partially optional you know surprisingly little about the protagonist neither his motivations nor his past are very clear in the beginning i bet that you wont find several charms side quests bosses and more in your first run some achievements even require you to replay the game however if you pay enough attention or look carefully enough there are hints on how to find certain things for example there is a side quest where you must save all the grubs adorable fat green thing to help players find them the developers added two things 1 when you are near one you hear him cry louder 2 you can find a map addon that marks where they are on your map

 there is one specific detail that i thought was clever theres a large insect that carries you around to different stations fast travel when it drops you off at one station it waits for you there so if you go to a different station on foot you must first ring a bell to call your friendly neighbourhood taxi before you can fast travel

 the world is vast and full of surprises you are encouraged to explore in this game thus its very satisfying when you find breakable walls hidden passages or shortcuts

h1negativeh1
 items charms spells and abilities are in every corner of the map with so many areas at your disposal it can sometimes be difficult to find what to do next although i managed to complete the story without help i admit that i resorted to guides to reach 100 completion i dont necessarily think that this is a negative aspect of the game but it is very time consuming to find everything on your own

 some areas feel less developed than others perhaps due to the lack of a boss fight the hive comes to mind here granted this area looks stunning and has its own charm but it is a well known fact that the queen bee lies at the core of the bee hive naturally you would expect to encounter her as a giant boss unfortunately you are only met with her spirit  regardless i cant criticize team cherry much as they are still working hard to pump out new free content

in short hollow knight is the kind of game you iwill noti know in a few hours heck its a game you wont understand when youre taking your place at its peak and when you put it down in the end just make certain you leave it in reach because youll be kicking yourself later if not

alright now its time for a more detailed explanation the first piece of information i should say is everything about hollow knight is a spoiler the trailers are spoilers character memes are spoilers even the names of areas and creatures are spoilers yet they are spoilers in such a way that you can still talk about the game quite comfortably because frankly the game does a brilliant job of pretending to be a quarter of the size it actually is the story is almost perfectly detailed but its a work of art youll have to reveal for yourself because the game isnt going to give you a word of it without a fight

speaking of which  the combat in this game it is ibeautifuli or it will be when you get the hang of it which will take the entire game there are several layers to the combat plus a few which im pretty sure ive only touched when im at my peak and theyre only going to get better as you find more more importantly there isnt a single one of them which doesnt have a place in any given boss fight turning some of them into a competition of how much style you can use on your opponent at any one time  because in this game looking cool is very much equivalent to being it 

next up would be the difficulty i cant talk much about this as i dont really know what my skill level is compared to the average person but for the most part the fights are fun but challenging enough to keep you wellfocused for most of them a few have some specific flaw which lets you make them disappear in ten or fifteen seconds but the sheer strength of these enemies will make itself known in all the important places i believe ive beaten every boss now but i cant be certain  most bosses took me 12 attempts closer to ten for the hard ones then more like seventy or eighty for the hardest thats a spike though the rest have a decent curve the rest of the game has primarily quite easy platforming mixed in with traditional enemies but ill make it clear now normal enemies are only normal because they have fewer attacks and health sometimes just health sometimes some enemies can feel like bosses in their own right but as its not required to fight most of them any you find challenging can normally be skipped over by poking them as you run past there are some places in the game where platforming is the focus but you can be safe in knowing that theres nothing to cause you too much trouble well  not if you dont go looking for it

in terms of playtime for the game eh thats pretty up to how you play it my playtime is pretty skewed due to various circumstances but even the most copefuelled should get ten hours easily if theyre willing to do a bit of exploring its important to note here since a few might have missed it in the game tags that this is a metroidvania at the core of its world design  if you dont search for new areas map the world which thankfully can be done ingame and take on any challenges you find with confidence your playtime will nearcertainly be in single digits of course theres always the wiki but believe me when i say you want to experience this game firsthand

the last thing i should mention should probably be the worlds design and atmosphere which is universally igorgeousi the areas in the game all sparkle with character constantly and you can feel their pull on each other whenever you near a border  combine that with plenty of space to appreciate the views and music that subtly changes based on your location and remaining opposition and you can start to realise just how intricate this universe team cherrys created is its worth mentioning the amount of content hidden behind fake walls and other similar illusions which is frankly enormous  when you start to feel the weight of the worlds history leaning on your shoulders then youll know when to find some kind of spoilerfree map because you are inoti finding all these on your own and some of the peaks of this game can be found behind them keep your eyes peeled but dont be surprised if you hit a piece of wall identical to every other wall in the area and it shows a slash mark for a moment

so in summary this is a blisteringly good game but only if youre willing to give up your excuses and put some effort in curiosity killed the cat it drove the dog mad but its friends will find a treasure that is worth every moment of the time

spoiler map the world face the god embrace the void spoiler

smol bug go smack smack

i do not like platform games they are just not my thing i saw this on sale on steam and it has overwhelming positive reviews so i decided what the hell i will give it a shot amazing the music the gameplay the story endless secrets to discover so many sad moments and so many funny moments the art the music and the gameplay all come together so well that i forgot i was playing a platformer if all these things were not enough team cherry then releases multiple dlc updates for free a substantial amount of new quest and content free in this day and age of nickel and dime dlc and micro transactions this is a breath of fresh air and because of this it will ensure that i will buy team cherrys next game day one one of my all time favorite games of all time

#####

easy to start light to approach
first it dazzles you with adorable and cute bugs
then makes you gradually fall into deep story and dark atmosphere
the plot will be naturally understood through the storytelling with precision and delicacy organically designed level exquisite and elaborate detail throughout they slowly melt you into this world of hollow knight
like a tropical pitcher plant

#####

psa  buy this game
i do not care if you only know how to play sandbox tycoon games this game is beautiful in so many different ways if i were to write one of those lazy reviews were they just use check boxes it would be an injustice to this game because words cant describe this game in its entirety
another psa dont spoil it for yourself 
first play the game at least finish it once you dont have to 112 it to enjoy the story although you might miss some details here and there i had to finish this game a total of seven times all the way through to get all the achievements i had fun the entire time and still got the biggest smile on my face when i saw those credits the final time
also dont complain about being stuck on hornet where i come from we call that a skill issue
remember to always win your battles

no no i know how to do it

hollow knight is the tale of a little ghost that goes on a quest to solve the mystery of its creation within the depths of a fallen kingdom you meet friends and foes alike on the way as the mystery slowly unravels itself allowing you to explore yourself and forge your own path among gorgeous landscapes and secrets galore the art style is phenomenal incorporating just enough cute to balance the creepy and the music is outstanding and definitely worth listening to on its own on top of that there are hundreds of hours of gameplay and replayability making this what has to be my all time favorite game

h1prosh1
 for being made by only three people this game is honestly worth a whole lot more than 15 so the price is automatically a steal even more so when its on sale i almost feel bad paying so little almost hey im on a budget here
 the character design both physical and personality is very unique and pleasant and fits perfectly
 the story although at times difficult to decipher is phenomenal and such a delight to discover along the way
 the controls are very smooth and fluid
 most bosses are highly enjoyable even when tough
 they have added multiple dlcs bfor freeb with a ton of new content
 so many secrets to discover places dialogue actions endings cutscenes etc so many jokes honestly how could only 3 creators make a game thats this full of things to explore and find its incredible
 i believe there are 5 different endings to the game so there are even more choices
 they dont force you to take a particular path they only block off areas when necessary so you have a ton of freedom
 you can make the game as short or as long as youd like with hundreds of hours of gameplay to explore and get lost in
 again this is quite possibly my favorite game and im one to never really complete games this one i did
theres definitely more but im blanking right now so onto the cons

h1consh1
 that little bastard zote
 the beginning is tough and tends to put off a lot of players see other points below for why but persevere and you will be rewarded 
 the game teaches you most mechanics but a few you must learn on your own and it can be frustrating to figure them out spoilerthe ability to attack updown to nailpogo spikes mushrooms and enemies for example that one took me more than halfway through the game to figure outspoiler
 at times it is difficult to understand where to go next as the game never explicitly tells you spoilerelderbug does offer hints on where you should be going next when you talk to him but they are vaguespoiler
 some bosses and platforming can be frustrating but people dont compare this to a 2d darksouls for nothing if you need a nudge there are some great youtube tutorials and help videos out there
 in the beginning there is a lot of walking and backtracking since you havent opened up a lot of passageways yet but you will eventually

 unfortunately a lot of players try out hollow knight not understanding what a metroidvania is or equating the cute style to an easy game be sure of what youre playing before you try it out its not an easy game you will die geo will be hard to come by spoilerat first then you will be overflowing with itspoiler you will backtrack a lot at least at first you will be surprised but in my opinion its all worth it

all in all you will die a lot you will lose money but you will keep playing ba lotb quite honestly a 1010 game and i cannot wait for silksong still waiting at least theyre taking their time to make a good game though enjoy

#####

this game has a lot of bugs in it
but the bugs make the game amazing

#####

hollow knight changed the way i view video games just until now i was a naïve gamer with roots in taking movies really seriously that spilled into my other hobbies especially gaming if there was no ingame motivation to continue playing then i would lose the desire to continue its the reason why i dropped so many games that would be considered prestigious where platformers would never be a consideration again after my disappointment with mario odyssey and rayman origins not that these games were bad or not wellmade they could have had the best platforming mechanics for all i know but without the cinematic qualities of the games im used to  i dropped them 

then heres me on a whim hearing about the praise this game is getting and it sitting in my library for an unspecified amount of time i decided to play a game that was the complete antithesis to what i enjoyed  a 2d platformer metroidvania without a narrative ive tried to play this game at least a few times but i never got past 20 minutes due to me being confused

but for some reason i just felt the urge to try at least one more time at least one more to make sure i have an opinion on this game

went into it with low expectations

turns out i loved it this game is a top contender for why games can be considered art without trying to replicate other aspects of mediums it is a game that can only exist as a game that doesnt borrow anything else platforming controls are refined to a touch making movement and combat feel smooth and rewarding it may be simplistic but it is with this simplicity it excels the combat and movement incrementally upgrade but never complicate the fundamentals of the game

but the best part of this game is exploration and how rewarding it is to revisit locations that were once unattainable after getting an ability the game teases these locations frequently but there is no indication as to where and how you get there relying on the players intuition to put two and two together it does not hold your hand at all  which is why i was once lost when i first began but that is the point the game makes you feel lost but rewards the feeling of being rudderless as you explore new areas without a map at first 

each new area is expertly designed to be a challenge to navigate without being an annoyance but rewards exploration the game is not easy but its rewarding to venture through the caves and build a pathway in your mind as to how to venture through the caves this game relies on creating an atmosphere that is gloomy and dark without inducing a sense of dread it is mysterious with lore sprinkled throughout without much explanation as to what it may be it is there without calling attention to itself but rewards those who seek to find more information

my only major complaint with the game is the fact that enemies do damage to you when they shouldnt such as when they scurry away from you but this is a nitpick at most  it does increase the tension of every encounter

other than that hollow knight is art it is art that changed the way i view this medium and only furthered my appreciation for gaming without a story the most rewarding aspect is the way this game builds upon concepts and rewards intuition of the player this game is not easy  it may be one of the hardest games ive played but it is just so much fun to continue finding out with this game has to offer that it doesnt get in the way of enjoyment

#####

game is full of bugs

#####

i hated this game i quit this game for an entire year because i hated being so lost and hated dying so much 

but after i managed to change my attitude away from im failing so hard i found that i love this game and how it teaches me to get better if im patient with myself and let myself make progress by slow degrees the game constantly astonishes me at how much better i get simply by trying things so many times the size of this game is immense and instead of feeling im fucking lost again its im able to explore every single dead end in this area and mine every little thing out of it while learning how to platform in the way that makes the most sense and nearly every awful platforming section wins you a shortcut to bypass the worst of it

getting back to a boss to get killed by it for the umpteenth time teaches me the platforming needed to get there it replenishes my soul each and every time and i get so familiar with that part of the map it becomes a landmark for when i have to get through that area again to find something i didnt get the first time 

and i am getting better bit by bit when i first fought the laser dude in the crystal peaks i couldnt last seconds but after i went through three other areas killed a few ghosts and the broken vessel when i went back i beat the easy version the very first time i faced him again that amazed me given how much trouble i had with him of course then i tried the hard version and died immediately again  laughs but im now confident that if i do just a few more things that ill be able to do that one too 

i loved the two ori games and love the gradual addition of mobility skills and how those skills are the gates to various areas but compared to hollow knight the two ori games lead you by the nose along the particular plot and path you have to go this sprawling thing has a few mobility gates but its so nonlinear its amazing you have so many choices on what you can do and where you can go and how you can go through to the story end 

it really took me until the mantis lords to really figure out that i loved this game and what i loved the most was beating my head against the wall of precision that was what i had to do to beat them and seeing cracks in that wall as i gradually acquired the muscles memory and reactions that i needed bit by bit and then they were defeated and it felt so good and set me up to understand how i had to approach the other bosses

so yeah i would recommend this game especially if you already know youre bad at gaming but want to get good  xd  if you like platforming and youre already good at precise fighting youll probably go through it way faster than i am but im really happy that i have already had 40 hours of entertainment through this and am likely to get a lot more before i get to the end i want to get to and all for fifteen bucks yes the music is amazing the atmosphere is gorgeous and creepy in all the good ways and the plot line and lore are thick but ill admit that as impressive as all that is what im most impressed by is how it teaches me to be a more precise and better gamer

hollow knight is a video game

#####

cornifer is my friend and i love him

#####

this game is a masterpiece
its so hard do describe the feeling when i first entered crossroads resting grounds or other location and hear amazing music and seen beatiful backgrounds


#####

better then sex

#####

where to even begin this game may be my favorite of the last decade even edging out the witcher 3 i would struggle to think of a single negative point the aesthetic of the game works wonders at pulling you in a combination of cute and yet haunting the music art and design all create what feels like a true world that you are inhabiting that is much larger than youd normally feel while playing a platformer 

the souls like story telling also creates a world that you just want to dig deeper and deeper into but yet the game never once feels bogged down by the story you can choose to discover as much or as little as you choose every single thing you come across from npcs to charmsthe games version of equipment spells bosses and environment all tie into the lore and tell the story of a dying world and your place in it 

the combat  movement is simple at a glance but surprisingly deep and leaves a lot of room to create your own playstyle as is typical for the genre the world opens up the more you gain additional powers but through creativity you can even bypass some of those requirements due to the fluid nature of the games movement 

i could gush about the game forever but the final point is there is no good reason to avoid this game if you love dark souls style story telling this game is for you it might also be the best metroidvania i have ever played 

i let this one slip by me for years so dont make the same mistake play it you wont regret it if it doesnt pull you in you might not have a soul  that is okay equip the soul eater charm


#####

this game should not exist

its too perfect its too good i cant put any flaws on it

the artwork the soundtrack the enemies the exploration the lore my god

urlhttpstoresteampoweredcomcurator32296668casualgamereviewsmore reviews on our curator pageurl

developed by a small group of people the project that started as a stencyl game quickly gathered support on kickstart and moved to unity with a final launch price of 1499 a game that can deliver at least 50 hours of gameplay for such a price is clearly a fantastic deal but even with such a friendly price tag bhollow knightb may not be enjoyed by all due to the difficulty ambiguity and relentless 2d action

we play as the knight a buglike creature in a kingdom long forgotten by most of its inhabitants called hallownest once a populated place filled with busy roads and buglife at every corner hallownest is now just a shadow of its former glory a desolate place made of ruins and memories only the promise of knowledge treasures adventures and many other wonders that the mind can imagine allures one to make the dark descent into this kingdom theres one catch though many goes there but none comes back

the narrative is portrayed with unconventional unambiguous ways that set players to fill the voids of the storyline by either guessing or digging up the truth nonetheless this marvelous way of storytelling is not for everyone and can be halfway to put you off this adventure visuals can also tell you quite a bit about the lore and the events behind the game plot paying close attention to details in the environment may uncover more surprised than youd expect

as mysterious as it can be bhollow knightb is not unique to this writing as bdark soulsb did it before and plenty other works but when comes to videogames its still a refreshing approach npcs have their own agenda interests and memories their will may not reflect what they remember and as for their actions well its up to you to judge the story of bhollow knightb is a sad tale but also a wonder mix of mystery and drama the most efficient side of the games story is not the events themselves but how they are painted and characterized along the game

completely in 2d bhollow knightb is a beautiful hand drawn action platformer that features quite the vast environment covering diverse and unique lands as you descend to find the truth behind your quest each area feels and looks different from everything and the art direction surprises anyone delivering unexpected changes from dark gloomy rocky hills to beautiful green magicalareas or a mushroom based fungal underground area the wonders of the games design are not entirely visual as its also mechanical with areas exceptionally well constructed and shortcuts waiting to be unlocked

theres a conjunction of traces that define bhollow knightb and a strong one is the gameplay as its just not another action platformer instead it takes a classic genre into another level a pure metroidvania delivering the structure placement and length to be consistently proclaimed as one of the best metroidvanias the gameplay alone delivers entertainment for all sorts of players and that is something that i came to realize after 100 hours speedrunners can push themselves at every run adventures can explore freely across hallownest demystifying its secrets and the hardcore ones can push the game to its limits leaving a trail of devastation when completing the hardest challenge

understanding hollow knight and completely beat it requires a mental discipline that not everyone is willing to mutate into their minds decide if the time you want to apply is worth your efforts yet without such time you cant simply become good enough finishing the main path is possible for the majority nonetheless the game tends to teach more than it punishes if you pay close attention that is

across hallownest players will unlock new abilities skills and magic powers that become part of your character to progress or go back and unlock new passageways secrets or gather collectables skills such as a dash double jump or magic spells become instantly familiar and useful against all sorts of treats alongside a very solid and fluid gameplay its not flawless as i would personally like to be able to cancel moves such as the dash and have iframes when picking up objects so i wouldnt take damage for just collecting a charm while being attacked

bosses can quickly become the most important slice of the cake you either love them or hate em some are incredible well telegraphed with animations that anticipate behavior and attacks yet others use projectiles which quickly became almost as an excuse to dictate a necessity to inflict damage on the player such as the absolute last boss that was heavily criticized due to that another well justified critique is how a couple of bosses read your inputs away too soon and i totally agree

several buffs and extra stats for both types of attacks as well as defense can be used through charms these special items can be used to increase stats to use them players must buy or unlock notches and the more you have the more charms you can equip its a really nice way to add major strategic combos depending on the challenge ahead

even though the base game is already considerably cheap released dlc costs nothing yes on top of everything a lot of new content was added for free i personally think this was an act of goodwill but also arguably easier to deliver a consistent experience and equalizing the content structure aside from content that delivers new bosses and areas which were later integrated such as the hive players have the grimm troupe that includes new quests npcs and a boss the infamous godmaster dlc is where you truly put your skills to the test fighting every enemyboss in a very arcade challenge to reach a true ending

the soundtrack was composed by the australian composer urlwwwchristopherlarkinbandcampcomchristopher larkinurl and the choice was right with very melodic waves of neoclassic and simplistic chords the music of each area creates the perfect atmosphere and momentum definitely one of those soundtracks capable of creating nostalgic waves immediately as you hear the epic synphonic tunes without even playing the game highly recommended to be purchased separately

there are endless game studios but only a few can develop something such as this bhollow knightb is clearly one of my favorite games even though i recognize i lack the radiant willpower to finish the toughest challenge i also know this game will keep teaching me an amazing experience unique and made with passion bhollow knightb is a must you absolutely have to try

iif our life is but a spark in the eyes of gods let us blind them at least oncei  unnamed moth

h1ithis dreary place it reminds me of home how ghastlyi  zoteh1

you arrive in dirtmouth to what looks like an abandoned village sealed off from the rest of hallownest an elderly downturnedlipped and sorrowful looking bug shuffles forward to greet you he is elderbug one of the few inhabitants to have remained in the village he is happy to greet any weary traveller who passes on through what happened to the other dwellers the well to the right of the village is a the doorway to the forgotten crossroads almost all who snuck down it to seek adventure did not return

nameless silent and wielding a rusty nail you pitterpatter your way into these long forgotten crossroads 

what you do not realise as you wander in and peer at the deranged looking bugs that stagger back and forth with their oddly glowing orange eyes is that the forgotten kingdom of hallownest has been tainted with an infection that is driving the once peaceful bug populace towards insanity insanity and then a hollowness that would see them shuffling about the lands as empty husks

what is your purpose why are you here and why do you wear masks similar to those worn by some of the infected creatures who in some kind of pitiful attempt at vanity try to hide their disfigured faces

ih1in the deepest darkness there are beasts who wear faces stolen from your memories and pluck at the strings in your heart h1

ithe lands that lay beyond the glistening crystalline caves that echo with the desolate clanks of husk miners pickaxes the lush but deadly vegetation of greenpath the misty explosive jellyfish infested fog canyon the underground wastes where only the screaming fungals would think to reside the nightmarish royal waterways that you could wander into innocently without a lamp and quickly regret it once you hear terrifying suckling noises coming from the darkness could it be the dreaded and rarely seen flukemarm the enormous pulsating abomination of a maggot that spews its slimy offspring at you in its efforts to slow you down and no doubt eat you 

and what of deepnest the dank underground warren of narrow tunnels designed for the enormous garpedes to barrel on through not to mention the spiders and critters that skitter in the gloom counting your eye sockets and knowing you were not one of them but perhaps a willing and yet to be wrapped snack

i hear there is a city where the sky weeps named aptly the city of tears where the residents live in their plush and ornately decorated mansions high above and seemingly oblivious to the infection that is ravaging the wider world they continue hosting parties gossiping despite the glow of their infected eyes glistening back at them from their cold cups of tea they are fine they are rich they are untouchable or so they thought

as you make your way through these contrasting and disturbingly beautiful landscapes you find yourself getting stronger the nail masters teach you their ancient arts and soon you learn how to move at breakneck speeds flying over vast chasms and sprouting wings for a second so that you can get just high enough to rescue the many wailing grubs trapped in jars that seem to litter hallownest 

h1iperhaps dreams arent such bad things after alli  elder bugh1

your journey will not be easy you will be confronted and attacked by all manner of gigantic infected and wholly angry bugs why cant we sit down and talk through your problems over a cup of tea dung defender gah stop flinging dung at me you may be unfortunate enough to stumble upon the master of souls who tragically claimed my soul over and over and over and over his only desire being to bottle it and plink it onto a shelf to be admired within his haunted sanctum 

you will meet a crystal fiend who will refuse to share his bench with you and bless you if you manage to impress the leaders of the mantis tribe i hear there is also a gruz mother who if you prod while she is snoozing will start to hurl her swollen belly about with complete disregard for her many wiggling yet to be spewed offspring

there is also zote the mighty be sure to listen to all of his precepts they contain little nuggets of wisdom such as precept thirtyseven iborrow but do not lend if you lend and are repaid you gain nothing if you borrow but do not repay you gain everythingi

genius

h1conclusionh1

god how i love this game i cannot describe to you how immersed i felt when i was playing and how sad i felt when it dawned on me that it was all over the world is rich with lore and the history of what went on when hallownest was a thriving kingdom but it does not tug on your ear and force you to listen delve if you wish or fight your way through to the end without lifting a single stone to peek under

however i urge you to seek out the lore everyone needs to know what happened to hallownest on your way rescue the cute little grubs sit down and browse through the teachers archives and of course pay your respects at the resting grounds maybe if you are lucky a moth will give you the ability to rummage about through the hearts and minds of those around you although some do not take kindly to invasive mind intrusions

bosses hollow knight is jampackedfull of bosses around every corner there is a hulkering boss waiting to rip off your face you can sidestep most of them like a coward or you can show them some of your neat charm combinations that allow you to say dash through them like a sharp pointy shadow knife or how about summoning your own little band of weaverling spiders who both keep you company and mess up anyone who steps within a mile of you

charms are the most marvelous concept think of them as little collectibles that give you buffs and abilities that your otherwise cuteself lacked mix match combine them to your hearts content if you are lucky you will find a combination that hum perfectly together to bring about an unexpected transformative power some charms require hunting down tangling with bees and other nightmarish creatures but they are bloody well worth the investment

in short this is the best game i have ever played and i wait with a neverending stream of drool for the next instalment silksong time to find out hornets side of the tale

hollow knight is a masterpiece there ive said it no need to read the rest of the review  
  
but let me elaborate a bit more on that hollow knight is one of those games that really understands what made the earlier metroidvania titles so fun to play without sacrificing modern conveniences such as a good interface smoother controls and proper pacing this adds up to making hollow knight the greatest metroidvania ive ever played finally dethroning super metroid 
  
bgraphics  soundb

to get a good understanding of why hollow knight succeeds in the graphics department you need to look at it in action hollow knight has a strong consistent art style through the entire game with many beautiful locations but the most impressive thing is just how smooth everything looks the animations are smooth and fluid the background  foreground objects are well animated without being distracting and the game oozes of atmosphere its wonderful

with amazing graphics hows the sound pretty darn good as well i would say you get great audofeedback from everything you do and what the enemies do as well and this just helps every other part of the game shine even more the only thing that bothers me a bit about the sound are the sound certain friendly characters make which gets a bit repetitive after a while it could either use some more variety or be toned down a bit as for music the composer deserves a lot of credits for creating a varied and very fitting soundtrack its atmospheric and great   
  
bstory  settingb

hollow knight is set in a subterranean world full of insects its hard to tell exactly whats going on here in particular in the beginning and i really dont want to spoil too for anyone who wants to figure it out on their own but theres something wrong a disease seems to be spreading

a lot of the story is told through the environment much like super metroid  dark souls and it does a good job at hinting at things going on without spelling it out for you but still story is not the reason you would play hollow knight  
  
bgameplayb

hollow knight is a 2d platformer very much in the vein of super metroid or symphony of the night more so than metroid 1 or castlevania 2 a lot of the gameplay is built around exploration as you gain new powers new places opens up offering new challenges for you to figure out how to beat and heres where i say that hollow knight understands what made the holder style of metroidvania games so fun the game does not spell out where you need to go but nor does it just drop you into an unknown world with no direction hollow knight does an excellent job at nudging you in the right direction through good level design personally i find the map markers of games like metroid fusion  shadow complex to be terribly detrimental to the feeling of exploration with good level design you can guide your player to the right place and make them feel like they figure it out on their own hollow knight does this very well

as for the combat itself it feels impressively fluid combat is simply really fun in hollow knight with fast fluid movement that offers a lot of nuances the boss fight in particular are a joy to play as you dodge their attacks and swiftly strike at them the game also allows you a fare amount of customization of your character which further enhances the combat as you explore youll find items that you can equip that have different effects and finding both equipment combinations that suits you and the situation is a big part of the game a boss might seem nigh impossible at first but then you find the equipment combination that works for you and it becomes far more manageable

bclosing thoughtsb

ive been a fan of metroidvania games since i first played the first metroid its a genre that really appeals to me but a lot of the more recent ones have been rather lacking when it comes to exploration hollow knight and axiom verge really helped breath fresh new life in the genre for me dont get me wrong i do like games like ori and the blind forest metroid fusion and cave story but neither of those nails the exploration part hollow knight does and the fact that hollow knight is just an amazing game even outside of that makes it one of the best games ive ever played theres only one section of the game that i was not overly thrilled about and this is a sentiment that other people ive talked to have echoed as well and thats the fact that before the first real boss the game does not feel all that engaging but once the first boss is down hollow knight really starts to show its strengths and it becomes a joy to play if youve got the least bit of interest in metrodivania games you have to play hollow knight its that good 
  
  
edit since i first played the game the devs have been hard at work releasing several free content updates so not only is the game still amazing theres even more of it to enjoy

#####

alright this is my first review so bear with me here but i think i can do a pretty good job explaining how fantastic this game is and ill do it with food

so imagine you go to your favorite restaurant and take a look at the menu and everything there is exactly what youd expect because i mean its your favorite restaurant youve been here like a billion times the thing is its lost some of that charm that zest that zing from your first experience after all theres only so many ways to make a pizza but then you notice something theres a new item on the menu what is it well my friend its an everything pizza the whole thing all of it all at once now you might be all for it or you might be hesitant but either way you decide to give it a try

hollow knight is one of those dishes that draws ingredients from all over the place its got lots of metroidvania elements its got heavy influence from the omnipresent allencompassing dark souls it really is the dark souls of metroidvanias isnt it it has fun characters incredibly satisfying exploration theres beautiful art covering every inch of the screen it has one of the best if not the best soundtracks in any video game its got everything the only real negative ive heard is that its pretty tough but that varies from person to person and even if you do end up giving up halfway through its still a great deal i personally got 40 hours out of this game during the first week or two where it had me really pulled in as someone who usually speeds through the games they play thats real impressive plus i found myself playing more and more every time i came back to push further into the towering endgame content im looking at you godmaster dlc not to mention the alternate steelsoul playthrough ive yet to complete and all of that for the dirtcheap price of 15

if i had to pick my favorite thing about this game it would have to be the exploration this game manages to perfectly capture the satisfaction of mapping an area to completion and there is no feeling better than walking in on a brand new area seeing the colors shift and listening as the areas theme slowly fades in its just so good as with the rest of the game

so now that ive just remembered my restaurant analogy i give this dish a 1010 my compliments to the chef

#####

i have based my entire personality around this game

#####

h1higher beings these words are for you aloneh1

this is probably the best game ive ever played 

just buy it you wont regret it

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay

hollow knight is a metroidvaniastyle platformer that is good

the artwork is good

the music is good

the combat is good

the bosses are good

the difficulty is good

the atmosphere is good

the exploration is good

the secrets are good

the free dlc is good

the lore is probably good i cant say for sure since it does that dark souls thing where you just have to infer most of the details from the environment and snippets of dialogue and vaatividya hasnt done a video explaining it to me yet so i dunno

in fact youll probably see a lot of other references to dark souls in the other reviews and thats because both dark souls and hollow knight share a lot of similarities in their setting and mood and even with some of the characters not to mention explorey gameplay with an emphasis on combat the combat is challenging while still being simple and straightforward so dont be put off by the difficulty and dark souls comparisons if youre not normally into that kinda thing the only really hard parts of the game are the optional parts and by then youll have a good understanding of what youre doing anyway

im gonna take a second to reiterate what i said earlier about the secrets theyre good also theres lots of them lots even more than lots no even more than that theres ilotsi you will not find everything without a guide but thats ok because finding new things is fun and you will be rewarded every time some gut impulse tells you to check some random corner or smack some otherwisenormallooking wall dark souls does that too but enough about dark souls youre here because youre curious about this game

this game is good it does good things with just about everything and playing it feels good

good game is good

#####

ihollow knighti is an absolute masterpiece and definitely one of the most impressive 2017 titles it features crisp visuals both cute and unnerving incredible music and an absolutely insane amount of content for the price complete with three free dlcs any metroidvania hinges heavily on its world being big diverse and filled with secrets and boy does ihollow knighti deliver

as for the gameplay ihollow knighti achieves exactly what it sets out to do it is a challenging game that often delves into precise platforming territory which is why in the end i finished it on youtube do keep this in mind when making your purchasing decision

however even if like me you only complete 13 of the game id say its still worth it taking place in a longlost insect kingdom ihollow knighti is imorrowindi meets idark soulsi in terms of its impeccable mood and atmospheresad and desolate its just a perfect place to ibei in and in the end this is what video games are all about hell even the less than obvious plot told though descriptions and short npc ramblings is actually rather interesting

ihollow knighti is a very good game that wont be to everyones likingbut i think everyone should give it a try

if only to see whether the tragedy of small cute bugs mantises and caterpillars can make you feel bad

bedit may 2018b the game is so good it haunted me all this time so i went back and finished it improving my skill from struggling with simple jumps to beating the white palace was absolutely exhilarating 

im clearly a below average platformer player but if ive managed to do it so will you

#####

this gritty reboot of a bugs life deserves all the praise it gets

#####

this game is full of bugs

#####

h1 every gamer should try this h1
 highly immersive very intricately designed metroidvania with challenging combat overall game design is almost impeccable definitely should be studied if youre into game design maybe its not a genre defining or a groundbreaker at its core but executes everything needed to be done perfectly

 i love it so much yet cannot recommend blindly to everyone the game takes a lot time and want you to get used to it playing style i can see some people get frustrated a lot find some parts tedious or just straight up uninstall after getting lost or cant overcome the obstacle those are expected elements mostly due to the players skills and familiarity to games also long and hard game experiences you have to be prepared this is not an easy experience but its rewarding for no cost too great
 its content is huge like a aaa game ill try to cover some of the aspects without giving away spoilers and use the categories as i see fit

list
    b experience b
u tutorial u
 game will elegantly describe you how the mechanics work give platforms to teach them and offer opportunities to harm them if you dont take the time or not become curious some unmentioned mechanics will stay hidden it wants you to use your creativity and discover as you play

u choices u
 there is a faint and secret long tutorial you have to pass until you reach to an important point which summes up the core game loop actually its somewhat linear up to that point but veiled by the illusion of level design afterwards the path you can take branches out which makes the experience differ for players including the ton of optional things you can do it becomes a unique experience as whole giving player a lot of mechanics and story choices yet serves it cleverly not just design wise but also narratively freedom you shall feel but notice the value of it after finishing the game

u challenge u
 you will be challenged in every way navigation combat awareness reactions conscience confidence curiosity memory creativity and emotions it gives a lesson and makes you realize how amazing experience can an interaction based art product give it is not impossible to beat the game and the difficulty varies from person to person you may take the l over and over again in a boss fight or get lost in an area without any help that is full of traps and the anxiety of losing money or stuck in a platforming level with hopes of finding something valuable while questioning yourself you will be tested but definitely rewarded not just with ingame ones but also the satisfaction of achievement

    b gameplay b
u controls u
 movement is super smooth and makes up to some creative usage of abilities mechanics together combine incredibly well and creates a variety choice of play style supplemented by charms to a great extent it uses every way of 2d movement and deepen that with abilities animations and level design you can use combat abilities for moving and exploring too which add another layer 

 spells are dope but comes with a cost the dilemma youll face in the heat of moment makes the action great should you attack dodge heal or cast a spell which one should you target should you try running away to live to fight another day you have to keep an eye on your soul pool without taking an action you cannot overcome but must not be greedy this mechanic is really cool and shape your combat style 

 the difficulty will add up after you die youll need to be patient and vigilant all your money could lost your soul pool size will also be reduced to get them back you have to take down your shade but even in that situation game comes up with a creative design you can strike your shade to use it as a platform and open up a way to move otherwise not possible you can use this on some objects too being able to reach areas without needed abilities some next level places are inaccessible without essential abilities but some of them may just seem like it while theyre not but you gotta be sure

threats
 foes mechanic design of creatures are so well made and has a great variety a lot of 2d feature is used and implemented differently according to the creatures type and area it is in you will be tested sometimes overwhelmed or irritated youll have to learn their moveset damage and behavior then adapt youll be surprised in every area

 boss fights astonishing fights are awaiting you each with their own cool design moveset abilities to challenge you most of them are optional and unexpected game really does a good job of boss fights it should have its own review not just their design but the path you need to take to get them is also wondrous and special 

 platforms another wonderful element every area has its own platform characteristics combined with the creatures present some nice noncombat challenges will occur also you will get used to handle your abilities

u exploration u
 you will be rewarded for exploring its in the core of the game and the genre return to early areas after getting new abilities thatll allow you to reach new places 

u advancement u
 spells mask shards vessel fragments nail and nail arts charms abilities those are the rewards of advancement mostly granted thanks to your curiosity and exploration instead of milestones all of them will encourage you to fight or explore for more and keep the game fresh

all in all hollow knight executes most important aspect of a game on an amazing level in a creative and unique way

    b atmosphere b
u ui u 
 designed subtly captures the spirit of the game and dont disturb the immersion checking the map out is so fun too
u art u
 graphics style creatures objects decorations backgrounds effects gosh incredibly well done and most importantly their ties to the area how well suited it is easily one of the best art in the game history sui generis
u sound u
 sound design is fabulous grounds nail strikes and parrying soul abilities creatures effects everything is remarkable and appropriate and wont disturb unless it needs to you will feel relieved relaxed scared creeped out disgusted amazed immersion is so high in the game with all these elements it encourages the exploration and wanting to learn about things their background lore
u music u
 and the last element music the games marvelous ambiance and immersive environment enhances with the brilliant music themes and tones are matched so nicely which gives the feeling of being in another area also for the boss fights that improves the impact of the experience again almost every type of emotion

    b narrative b
u story u
 main story is very good the concept events and background captures that its a fantasy world mystic startling and makes you wonder about it more with every milestone you pass the way game uses narrative makes it cooler and more mysterious the details are there and you may ignore or get pass them but that makes discovering much more powerful dream nail is also such a nice idea
u characters u
 character designs are so cool and creative you will get some idea of them based on their bug type they have their own little stories some are to be discovered some are to encounter or introduced and others take place while you play depending on your choices and actions
u immersion u
 of all things this is the best one game does imho it takes you to next level setting is superb and creative areas and lore behind them is very deep and constructed so well after finishing the game you better deep dive into the lore

 funny its so hard to find wrong or weak side considering the price this game is masterpiece youll find more than you expect but do not give up when you face difficulties id like to write more but im about to pass the max limi

if you are a fan of the metroidvania genre as i am this is the game for you at least it was for me
hollow knight made me reflect about how awesome and beautifuly done a video game can be for so many reasons that i cant even stress out 

the ambientation and storytelling are pretty soulslike if you like that its a go for sure i mean the story itself is kinda subjective you get to know the lore of the world you are exploring thru details on the scenarios item descriptions and talking to npcs and that is done in truly amazing ways every playthrough if you are into lore you get to perceive a detail that you didnt notice before which adds a new piece to the puzzle its simply amazing sometimes it feels like nothing is there by chance i might be just overthinking everything but i do feel that way im not saying the story will make 100 sense to you without digging into lore videos and such but really trying to construe it into your own mind as you play by itself is an amazing ride

gameplay is also freaking awesome at least for me i stress that a million times because i know tastes vary between people and well it might not ring a bell at all for some players i love the physics of this game the options that you have regarding to mobility the way that you can bounce on many enemies and obstacles hitting them with the nail feels just amazing for me as well its a simple mechanic that became one of the selling points of gameplay for me 

the art is simply gorgeous i couldnt stress that enough even if i tried you can see the effort put on everything on the maps mobs npcs etc its just beautiful the level design is very nice as well didnt expect less from a metroidvania you can get lost a lot on the first playthrough but for me at least this wasnt boring or anything it just feels like really exploring a place you dont know well yet

soundtrack is also very nice i wouldnt say it has a lot of remarkable tunes thru the map exploration i mean it is well done all the way thru but some maps even for the sake of the ambientation doesnt have what you could call a music its more like they have a really nice and calm tune just to put you on the vibe which is pretty well done too but there are exceptions some map sections have really amazing background music that i could listen over and over and not to talk about the boss musics really most of the bosses have their own themes you dont have a unique boss theme on this game which are truly the masterpiece of this game musicwise

now the cherry on the cake for me and one of the aspects of the game that took me a while to realize how amazing it was bosses this games boss mechanics are simply brilliant and very well programmed you may not realize that in your first playthrough or going thru the easier bosses but every boss has patterns that can be learned and countered in very funny ways its such a pleasant challenge to git gud on this game because the learning curve becomes very tangible at some point when the last dlc came out with the godhome which gives you the opportunity to fight every boss in the game over and over as you wish i thought it was a lazy one since it only adds a minority of new bosses still amazing ones but after thinking about it and understanding what they wanted to do i can say it is simply one of the best stuff on this game and it also adds a lot to the lore most not to say all of the bosses are amazing fights and having all of them acessible to fight against in one place is really really funny that was the best part for me the pantheon challenges are incredible youll know what im talking about if you get there

tldr i cant believe this game is sold for the price it is it is worthy every cent even full price you can get at least 40 hours of gameplay on your first playthough and it took me 185h to get 100 achievements without getting sick of the game for a minute the ammount of content on this game is insane and it is just very very pleasant to play strongly recommended and as the community says  the world doesnt deserve team cherry

im now struggling to find a metroidvania game that goes near the same level as hollow knight and i think i wont find that game until the release of silksong

#####

higher beings these words are for you alone
be aware of the primal aspid
no bug can dodge this foe
beyond the rage and despair will be a calm and peaceful lake
do not rage and enjoy the amazing view of this piece of art work
bear witness to one of the greatest kingdoms you shall ever see

this is in my opinion one of the best games period forget your first person shooters forget your battle royales forget your actionrpgs or your brawlers  hollow knight says move over guys  its time for me to show you what a true masterpiece of gaming looks like there are other games that have defined genres harder there are other games that have been more explosive but there are very very few games that can stand up to hollow knight in terms of sheer mastery of its medium

h1gameplayh1 

hollow knight takes the metroidvania formula and gives it a fresh coat of paint and is the definitive title in its genre setting the bar so impossibly high for any other competition that no matter if its a classic staple or a modern attempt you will finish it and be left thinking that was pretty good  but hollow knight did it better

enemy variety is unmatched in the genre sporting too many bosses to easily list and dozens more unique enemies each sporting their own attacks and strategies for defeat

the controls are light intuitive and responsive matching the intense momenttomoment flow of movement and combat so well that it crosses the boundary between playing and acting  you will find yourself working entirely on reflex within hours without ever noticing the change

the fluid movement and controls are an absolute must as well as the game pits you up against environments and enemies that will force you to use every trick and tool at your disposal and bosses that brutally punish mistakes this makes your mastery over the games incredible depth of movement that much more satisfying as you learn to jump dash and dodge to a pinpoint level that few if any other games in this genre or otherwise have been able to emulate

h1difficultyh1

hollow knight is the difficulty curve of dark souls but without the abrupt infuriating spikes that populate the genre its the mastery depth of mario 64 except the game intends for you to master it as such its the progression system of an old school cartridge game with the powerups and collectibles of an early metroid while simultaneously being intuitive enough to push you forward without holding your hand and providing enough upgrades to feel that youre mastering the nooks and crannies but without falling into the trap of becoming a grindy collectathon

easy to pick up and intended to be mastered hollow knight pulls no punches in difficulty but simultaneously is able to guide even the most amateur player in such a way that theyll never feel overwhelmed as the difficulty progresses

h1aesthetic sound design setting graphics etch1

hollow knight stands out in more ways than just gameplay it takes place in a somber still world and makes the absolute most of its minimalist color palette and deliberatelyquiet sound design to paint a beautiful canvas that begs to be explored despite being one of the longest titles in its genre hollow knights setting always leaves you wanting more it captivates and delights with every new area whether thats the overgrown beauty of its wilds the somber peace of its hub town the bustling activity of its mines the sad forgotten love of its cities or even the dim terrifying depths below

h1conclusionh1

there is no one reason hollow knight is an amazing game it stands head and shoulders above the pack in every conceivable way from movement to enemy combat from sound design to visuals from boss variety to story the game is an absolute triumph the type of title that comes along once in a lifetime and says from the moment you start it to the moment you finish i will not be forgotten this game stands on the shoulders of its predecessors capturing the rare feel of actually being worthy of its time rather than 10 years old with a fresher coat of paint with its tiny development team and understated release the only question it leaves hanging is how the remainder of the industry has become so lost trying to keep up

i have played other games for longer than i have hollow knight across every genre  but none have stood out to me quite as incredibly as it has and i have no trouble believing that i will revisit it 50 years from now and be just as incredibly satisfied then as now it is a triumph a masterpiece and without a doubt one of the best games ive ever had the privilege of playing

#####

one of the best games i played if not the best

#####

i bought this in 2017 and quit in the crossroads i hated failing and i had thought this game would be a fun walk in the park based on the art style i was wrong
i had recently come back after being a real quitter thanks to a certain preistess and im loving every minute of it the platforming is seamless the combat is smooth the game teaches you to try and try again until you find a charm combination that lets you succeed everything in the game is so dark yet so colorful a certain mushroom even gives some good wisdom if you understand it 

this game is worth every penny and i look forward to the projects from team cherry to come
buy it

#####

this game is the definition of perfection everything about it is flawless

the music was excellent

the artstyle was wonderful 

the gameplay was smooth 

the combat was challenging 

the boss fights were epic

the lore was intriguing

the story was interesting 


i cant recommend this game enough 1010

grub

#####

this is hands down the best game i have ever played the controls are so precise and accurate the artwork is incredible and the soundtrack is moving you feel like you can truly get lost in the ruined kingdom realizing the knight knows just about as much as you do  which is nothing you gain abilities by exploring new areas you are never truly lost or trapped there is always a way out new abilites allow you to access new areas with new bosses stories and challenging platforming it is the golden standard of what a metroid should be there are breakable walls and secrets around each area there is boss rush and the pantheons will amaze you there is so much lore with this game i thought for the price tag it would tak eme a weekend to conquer yet i found myself lost in it for weeks it is not an easy game with dark souls like combat but well worth the time and effort i rate this game 1510

if i had to describe bhollow knightb in one word i would choose bitearjerkerib whether those tears come from being overwhelmed by its bsomber melancholyfilled atmosphereb and bsoundtrackb and its benigmatic heartwrenching storyb or from how many times you have died in the last hour that is itrulyi up to each persons experience but do not get misled by the bendearing art styleb our tiny knight finds himself in a bdesolate worldb filled with bipainfullyi challenging fightsb and several bplatformheavy areasb although from time to time it is bpossibleb for him to find bisomei respiteb from the iapparenti gloom which creates a bhealthy equilibrium between darker and lighter elementsb and thus pushing the game away from overused igrimdarki tropes although bnavigating its vast locationsb and bsaving your progressb can become bmaddeningb at times due to its bnonlinearityb bhollow knightb certainly brewards explorationb and ieveni bencourages itb for those who seek to piece together a clearer picture of what ireallyi happened in bihallownestib in the past did i get demolished often imaybei but underneath the bigit gudib surface there is a bwhole mystery waiting to be unveiledb and it is worth every damn defeat

#####

do you like very hard challenges or boss fights like dark souls that cause blood to get in your eyes anger by buying this game you will sign the death sentence 


the game is beautiful it has great soundtracks and emotions this game is very similar to ori game except that there is a system of attacks in this game and heavy boss fights the game has a lot of great maps and i think you need 50 to 100 hours of time play to complete this game in the game we have 3 examples of enemies which are ordinary enemies of several categories and are not very important very easy the next part is the bosses who are easy again and give light blows and you can easily defeat them with dodging blows and thinking subsequent bosses sometimes catch you suddenly while performing steps and you have no escape and you must fight him the game is not very expensive and you do not have to wait for discounts so i suggest you buy and enjoy this beautiful game

#####

an incredible masterpiece nowadays you need to pay 60 for uninspired aaa games

this isnt that this is the kind of game that you fall in love with you dont only invest into this game with your money you invest yourself into its world and enjoy every second of it

after studying game development playing games doesnt feel the same to me not necessarily a bad thing i can see how things are made little smart details that help improve player experience this and ori both blind forest  will of the wisps are the only two games that after learning all of that still makes me feel like kid seeing magic

bought this game on gog but i needed to buy the game here too
thank you team cherry you guys are great

#####

h1 bhollow knight is good go buy it bh1
epic game where you are very mad the whole way

#####

there are games that are left as projects abandoned

there are games that should have never seen the light of day but were released anyway

there are terrible games that are barely playable because of lack of effort

there are bad games

there are games that came close to being passable but failed to make the cut by the smallest margin

there are games that fade in with the rest not good nor bad simply not outstanding 

there are games that go a step above average but no more

there are good games

there are great games that couldve been even greater

there are very few games that go so far in what they provide in what limits they break that we call them masterpieces

then theres hollow knight

#####

here are some pros and cons

 pros

you can unplug your computer tear out your cpu and still run this game on 60 frames

epic soundtrack

deep lore

perfect difficulty

massive world that will feed you gameplay for almost 50 hours a run

free content releases that exceed human comprehension 

cons

the  map system is terrible you have to find a person to buy a new one for every area before you can begin updating it just means more backtracking and aimless wandering though

the games price doesnt fit its quality i would have happily paid 60 bucks for this masterpiece

score
 9610

#####

dont bother wasting time reading these reviews just do yourself a favour and buy the game you wont regret it

h1 uthe short of itu h1

uprosu
incredibly tight controls with difficult combat
the level of interaction you have with the environment in this game is amazing
an indirect narrative thats rooted into the very atmosphere of the game
well done sound design and music
beautiful 2d animation
dlc is free a practice i wish was more common

uconsu
the world is a bit too open ended personally speaking
not every boss is great in fact there are some that are just bad
the means to reach the latest ending is rather ridiculous

h1 umore indepthu h1

uchallengeu
lets start this off with the bread and butter of what hollow knight is all about the game is acclaimed for its difficulty and ive gotta say that the press is right the combat is both challenging but fair hollow knight features some of the tightest controls ive ever experienced ultimately making it so that any small misstep isnt anyones fault but your this is especially true with the platforming challenges in the game there are locations though i have one in particular in mind where not your ability to kill but your skill at maneuvering around in dangerous terrain is tested as far as metroidvanias go hollow knight sits at the summit when it comes to either fighting or platforming

uinteractionu
on the note of hollow knights tight controls an incredibly important factor that needs to be mentioned is the level of interactivity you have with the environment your basic slash attack can be used for so much more than just hacking at an enemy in this game the primary example i wish to give attention to is how you interact with spikes in the game normally in metroidvania if you fall into a pit of spikes youre left at the mercy of death however thats not the case here performing a downward slash will actually cause you to bounce off the spikes theres a fair amount of times when this comes in handy especially when youre missing certain abilities like the double jump the same applies to parrying enemy slash attacks its possible to simply stand your ground and not take damage if you have the appropriate timing

ustoryu
contrary to most games were probably used to hollow knight does very little in telling you what is exactly happening in the world many of these details are told through dialogues with npcs or given as hints in the many areas of hallownest the lore of hollow knights world runs deep and its evident in everything you see in the game indirect though it may be hollow knight gets the job done spectacularly

usoundu
every jump landing attack death etc are done with great precision in terms of the sound design in the simplest of terms id have to say that the sounds no every impact i make in this game sounds incredibly satisfying the music is no slouch either the darker atmosphere mixed with some of the more serene soundtracks is both an unnerving yet serene feeling

ugraphicsu
lets skip the formality on this the game just looks straight up amazing i love my 2d games and hollow knight just has many details in how everything looks from the environments to your attack animations to the multiple enemies and npcs its to the point i cant even try to say anything bad about it how the game looks is an important factor with any video game and seeing the art style of hollow knight i immediately had to give it a try one of the best decisions ive had the pleasure of making

ufree dlcu
again need i say more were living in an age where games arent really complete unless you have the game of the year edition most dlc is purchased or can be obtained cheaper collectively with a season pass all on top of the purchase of the base game but hollow knight yeah it has dlc but each one is basically a huge patch since its immediately installedupdated to the game with no purchase whatsoever team cherry has no real reason to be giving good content like this for free when no one else does it and for that their generosity alone deserves recognition

ulostu
the world of hollow knight is not only detailed but it is vast so vast in fact that i personally felt completely and utterly lost i as a player prefer to have at least some level of direction and hollow knight doesnt really provide any of that im sure that this is a point many people will feel differently on but the feeling of not knowing where to go is a far worse feeling than any boss destroying me ive only managed to get as far as i have with the occasional use of guides giving me general directions once i have an idea i went on my merry way to discovering and fighting whatever the area had to hold hollow knight truly is a wonderful experience but its one i wouldnt have enjoyed nearly as much if i didnt have some guidance

usome bossesu
not every boss you fight is great in fact some are plain terrible i will reference one particular fight as vague as possible to avoid spoilers but any who have met this boss will immediately know to what i am referring to one fight thats required story wise has almost nothing to do with your ability to play the game essentially the boss receives 0 damage until an npc performs an action that will allow you to hurt the boss for a brief amount of time this will have to occur several times maybe more depending on how much damage you when you reach it and theres no way to trigger this action yourself its essentially a waiting game and in a game that tests your reflexes yeah its a big no no from me i hate this fight the fight has been revamped in the dlc but i believe the story fight hasnt changed if it has then this point will be subject to change

ugodmaster dlcu
some spoilers ahead okay okay let me explain how can you say that the dlc is negative i hear you ask and its not however its the reward the dlc ending and how you must acquire it that i have a problem with godmaster introduced the ability to refight bosses in a boss rush mode as someone who has defeated the 4 main pantheons i can tell you how much i loved it except the fourth i got beaten down in that one pretty hard the thing is that theres a final fifth to access and you must beat that one to unlock the ending problem its ridiculous you must face every boss in the game with a few breaks here and there the bosses themselves are stronger than normal as well but thats not even my biggest gripe truth be told i could probably do it provided i put in the time and practice however a large majority of people cannot according to the global achievements less than 1 of players have defeated the fourth pantheon many players cant attempt it and even the ones who can will suffer the reason i put such a large precedence on this ending is because it is meant to be a foreshadowing of things to come in the next update allowing you to play as another character i welcome the challenge of the fifth pantheon but to lock the ending not behind a single difficult boss but a plethora of powered up bosses with the former included at the end in a free content update everyone has access to seems a bit over the top at the very least id imagine theyd try to make this ending a bit more accessible for its players

h1 uconclusionu h1

all in all hollow knight is a near masterpiece in the metroidvania genre but it isnt without its blemishes while some of these so called blemishes are a bit more based on personal taste id say everyones got a gripe or two to admit with the game that said these blemishes make up a very small percentage of the game ignoring the fact i felt utterly lost and on the whole is 100 worth getting

#####

this is one of the best games that ive ever played i really hope  silksong  comes out this year

#####

in my opinion this one indie game is better than almost every aaa game i have ever played the hundreds of hours of content this game offers to its players certainly makes its price skyrocket to around 60 right

wrong the game is only 15 and can go as low as 750 during a sale

team cherry did an outstanding job with this game this is definitely one of the best games ive ever played and without xbox game pass i wouldve never found this masterpiece in the first place

#####

this is like league of legends but if you remove everything from league of legends and then replace it with an indie metroidvania

#####

didnt expect much when i got this game
turned out to be one of the best games i have ever played
also very good soundtrack and lore


#####

you will constantly be bipolar during this game you could be loving this game and then just contemplating throwing your computer into a river amazing game 1010

#####

so hollow knight i just finished my first playthrough of the game and did absolutely every possible thing i could possibly do in a single run  gotta get a thorough idea of the game after all

in a sentence  hollow knight is the best game ive played for the first time in years 

it gave me the same aweinspiring rageinducing emotionplaying marvel of an experience that my first ever souls game did team cherry have succeeded in making an absolute masterpiece of a game that despite its small development team and backing defies all the odds and has turned out to be  well exactly that  a masterpiece

the game boasts a compelling and everthreatening story told through dialogue visual cues scattered items and enemies the complexity and secrecy of the characters task and the world about him is one of inimitably flawless design the lore of the world is rich the characters met are complex at times and simplistically beautiful at others  whilst ever providing the much needed if momentary companionship our lonesome little hero needs  even those that may wish to kill us one can expect to meet a fair number of friends and foes whom wish to speak with them and even share the journey  the character quests reveal much about their bearer and whilst rewarding at times they are most importantly a rollercoaster of emotions that which you ought hate might in truth be the saddest of them all

as can be expected of a 2d platformer hollow knight possesses a huge and sprawling world full of unique environments  each filled to bursting with enemies and threats of their own intricate maps that twist and turn on each other in relieving and at times frustrating ways expect to get lost a decent amount in the early stages until at last youve got a sense of geographical locations though maps are available for each area having progressed far enough into them the world is not only huge but interconnected  both geographically and lorewise every area plays its part and not one disappoints

hollow knight is anything but linear one can explore almost the entirety of the world whilst barely fighting any bosses at all should they choose to and all can be returned to at any time  and by a variety of means and directions the player will find themselves consistently revisiting areas to explore new previously unreachable paths find new secrets and encounter new enemies

beyond being filled with enemies traps dangerous landscapes and the occasional friend hollow knight is also filled with secrets secrets that hide items spells characters and secrets that hide more secrets that sometimes even hide more secrets explore everything hit every wall

 now we get to the grit of the game  though by no means are these bad points but ones which may turn people off hollow knight is hard not hard but bloody hard

generic mobs tend not to pose much of a problem perhaps when you first encounter them but soon youll find yourself used to their moves and now how to easily defeat them all then there are bosses hollow knight has many unique boss battles to test your mettle and indeed they shall bosses are no pushovers and can be extremely difficult for the unprepared equip the right items adopt the right tactics get used to their movesets and hope for the best

however the true challenge of hollow knight is the platforming while at times simple especially in the early areas many of the worlds secrets or best items are locked behind a platforming challenge or even a whole area of platforming until you learn all the tricks of the trade some of these will go from difficult to absolutely impossible expect to die many times trying to complete that one challenge locking you away from your last shard or fragment i wont tell you their full names of course

beyond the blatant aspects of the game hollow knight also possesses an amazing soundtrack composed by christopher larkin it really is fantastic and among my top list which i suppose is a fair few of game soundtracks  including everybodys gone to the rapture journey the last guardian the witcher iii demons souls nier and many many more point is its damn good

truly to encompass everything hollow knight is absolutely worth it to anyone even if 2d platformers arent your thing its still one to play it may drive you to the point of insanity at times namely platforming but everything is surpassable with perseverance

buy hollow knight play it struggle through it hate it beat it fall in love with it

edit  and of course steel soul is a biotch

#####

 beautiful graphics
 beautiful musics
 beautiful gameplay
 beatiful price

just buy it

#####

bi just feel bad for those people who completed this masterpiece earlier and are waiting for silksong longer than meb

at first i was hesitant to start this as this was not detecting my controller but thanks to my frend who told me the fix for that because of him i was able to experience one of the best game i have ever played in my life and i had never played anything like this before this was the first game ever where i felt compelled to achieve the full 112 completion and experience everything this has to offer before i wrote its review and moved on this starts off slowly but when we acquire some of the abilities and the world slowly becomes accessible for us to explore in parts and because of that it can get a little overwhelming without any waypoints or any information about what to do next but trust me and stick with this because that feeling of venturing into the unknown and finding something incredible like a boss fight a completely hidden area a npc with a little sidequest of its own and a powerup on your own is the best thing the map system in this is just unique af as when we first enter a new biome we are completely exploring in the dark and sometimes lost but after buying a unfinished map from a npc we get some idea of where we are and a goal of completing that map by ourselves

the artstyle is breathtaking and one of a kind the ost is just as incredible and just about everything about this game is just perfect the combat is tight and responsive some of the boss fights just makes your jawdrop i dont care about the lore in video games but this made me want to watch a lot of its lore videos because i was intrigued to learn the story behind this amazingly crafted world of bhollow knightb

wish me luck for the patheon of the hollownest ｔｔ 

#####

arguably the best metroidvania since metroid prime i cant recommend hollow knight highly enough  especially at its price point one of the greatest gaming experiences the genre has to offer backed with gorgeous visuals and a stunning ost by christopher larkin i very strongly recommend that you take the plunge and get lost in hallownest

#####

i like bugs

#####

i bought this game to spend some time during quarantine after all it was just 17 bucks or so little did i know i was buying one of my favorite games ever to this day i have played over 150 hours which will inevitably increase with time

hollow knight offers an unforgettable adventure woven into a vast world made of mystery and wonder bound together by beautifully tragic lore the masterful art and music will make you fall in love with every detail in your path although the game itself can be challenging the main content and storyline is achievable after some perseverance this balances a sweet spot between those players who want to finish the game for the story itself and those who are determined to find every secret in hallownest

team cherry really outdid themselves with this one adding challenging dlc for those who want more out of their game this game is worth at least double what they ask for it

i loved this game and believe it a must have for anyone interested on metroidvanias see you in silksong




#####

i believe everything to be said about this game has already been said by the other users game is fun challenging immersive addicting and very engaging there is a great attention to the art style and it probably has the the best parallax ive ever seen in a 2d game the music scores and effects are all superb controls are very responsive and thats really important for a game that relies heavily in platforming and combat the map is really big and full of interesting things to discover contrary to the title the game is crampacked would i recommend it ive played a lot of metroidvania game and i am confident to say hollow knight is now my 2nd best mv game next to symphony and followed by ori buy it especially if it is on sale this is a masterpiece worthy of being a sample of how a video game can be an art

h1prosh1
 rich lore albeit rather convoluted
 progression is done well it doesnt take long for you to arrive somewhere interesting
 difficulty is reasonable but can be insane if you want to achieve all endings
 gameplay relies on skill and patience not mindless button mashing or rng
 great soundtrack
 beautiful and expansive world
 enemies are all pretty unique
 tons of content
 worth more than its currently sold for

h1consh1
 protagonist looks a little bland
 your main attack is only a singlehit slash
 game can start off a little underwhelming


h1summaryh1
there are already a ton of well written reviews about this game so i wont go into much detail all i can say is that if you even remotely enjoy castlevaniametroid or the old mega man games theres no question in my mind that you would love hollow knight

if the first 15 mins of gameplay underwhelms you like it did for me give it a chance and youll find yourself slowly getting blown away

this ranks up high alongside dawn of sorrow as one of my favourite metroidvania games and the challenging platforming fills me with a sense of nostalgia of the old days of megaman 

the overwhelmingly positive reviews are not overrated but well merited hollow knight is a rich and rewarding adventure and very much deserving of being called a masterpiece

#####

brilliant game such a rewarding game to play and i have essentially nothing but praise for it the world team cherry has built is incredibly detailed and tells a story through its environment and characters similar to a souls game the gameplay is so smooth enjoyable and most of all rewarding there were times when i beat bosses like the dung defender broken vessel and i few others im not remembering on the first try but when it really feels rewarding is when you learn a boss to nearperfection and finally succeed after hours of attempts most notable for me was nightmare king grimm i failed at this fight for about 2 hours on multiple occasions getting to the final phase and choking when i finally beat him i jumped out of my chair and fully popped off 

part of learning in ihollow knighti is all the different charms they allow for a plethora of strategies using magic takes a bit more skill and nuance so of course i went for the nail build however it took me time to realize which charms are the best in each situation i ended up learning the cream of the crop at least for my play style was whatever the second nail reach charm was called quickstrike unbreakingfragile strength and steady body this allowed me to take on some of the games tougher challenges and bosses and find success but there were occasions when i tried out heal builds or used magic because i found windows for magic attacks within a bosses patterns they also allow you to better learn bosses my first house of nightmare king grimm attempts were with a pure health build so i could focus on dodging and learning his patterns after i had it down a bit i switched in sharp shadow for one of my health increases because i realized it could get me more damage for simply dodging his attacks 

exploration is another massive part of this game there are these little caterpillar dudes to save i found all of them and it was pretty rewarding spoilerbecause i got this dope charm for doing so which made my melee attacks ranged when i was at full health i certainly abused this on some bosses to take them out real quickspoiler beyond that finding all the charms is also very rewarding although i looked at guides for some of them often knowing where the charms are located isnt the hard part for example spoilercompleting one charm requires going through this white palace area which is essentially entirely a platforming area and the most difficult platforming area in the game at thatspoiler however there are some charms which make even the platforming sections much more trivial its one of those games where i got so sucked in that i had to go get 100 on my save file then i realized that the maximum save file  is actually 112 so i went and did that too

i loved my time with ihollow knighti and honestly i essentially played it for the entire time i was awake for three straight days im not the type of person who enjoys going for speedrun achievements or 1 death and its over achievements but i did enjoy the little bossrush challenges that ihollow knighti offers which give you the chance to face off against some characters that i wasnt expecting to fight this is easily one of the best metroidvania games i have ever played and probably that has ever been made and i cant wait for silk song i would highly recommend this to nearly anyone the base game isnt nearly as difficult as some make it out to be granted if you dont have experience with other platformers maybe it will whoop ya i only got stuck for a decent amount of time on one or two fights but its so worth it to push through that wall because these bosses are so well designed and their music is sick thats actually one of the main reasons i picked this game up i am a huge music fan and i took a class at my university on video game music we covered so many listening example from ihollow knighti including the title theme hollownest postgrimm theme and my absolute favorite the nightmare king grimm theme seriously i fought that dude for nearly 3 hours and it felt like 20 minutes in large part because of how good these jams are 

if i have any critique its that some of the resources needed to become stronger oremask shards were locked behind some pretty difficult challenges the flower quest and the arena challenge are two examples although i ended up finding ways to get around them pretty easily having one less mask and a lower damage nail makes some of the bosses that come later more challenging for many its no big deal but then again for those looking to get into this type of game for the first time it would be nice if those upgrades were a bit more accessible that is such a tiny critique though honestly i am just nitpicking this game is fantastic undoubtedly a mustplay and easily the best most satisfying and rewarding metroidvania i have ever played

primal aspids

#####

playing this as my first metroidvania was a mistake now every other game of this genre ill ever play will be a disappointment when compared to this masterpiece

tight and unforgiving gameplay huge variety of playstyles deep and fascinating lore gorgeous artstyle and amazing soundtrack enough content for a single playthrough to take about 40 hours and all of that for a very low price

and to add to that the developers behind this game are way too great theyve released four huge content packs that i would have been happy to buy as dlc however all of them came as free updates we dont deserve team cherry im really looking forward to silksong

imagine playing dark souls but its a 2d platformer now imagine youre a big booty latina haha thats hot

quotehollow knight is a must play experience that rewards exploration and risk with a rich and challenging world filled with varied boss battles and atmospheric locations finely tuned and responsive controls balanced powerups combined with a sometimes taxing but fair difficulty go hand in hand to provide an adventure that could well span 40 or 50 hours in the hands of a completionist highly recommendedquote


hollow knight is a game that concerns itself with wonder from the charming visuals to the moody score to the enormous world that is fully realised and constructed with a sense of logic it might not redefine the metroidvania genre it occupies but it polishes and refines to such an extent that it may well be the best example since symphony of the night and whilst that could very well be a bold claim and a giant task to live up to hollow knight is an engrossing experience that demands the players attention as they unlock the world of hallow nest piece by piece by piece

whats immediately striking is the visual aesthetic a cartoonlike almost hand drawn world populated by denizens with an immediately recognisable character hollow knights world is insectoid in the main and as such enemies are often almost half recognisable echoing a part remembered real world counterpart each area is markedly different with unique inhabitants and as a result exploration never feels too similar or repetitive the score ambient and often forboding is never overbearing and whilst not eternally memorable is a perfect accompaniment to the knights adventure and what an adventure that is with a living world and a story driven by hints and maybes lore drip fed in clues and by perhaps unreliable or malicious foes its not immediately clear what the grander goal of your quest could be but as the journey develops the finer details coalesce and it all comes together in a tale thats so much greater than is immediately apparent some people may find that initial lack of narrative push difficult but the pitch perfect gameplay is perfectly balanced to gently nudge the player in the right direction until the momentum builds enough to propel the player towards its conclusion 

so what does playing hollow knight actually involve fundamentally as a metroidvania the game sees you gradually explore a huge interconnected map jumping dodging and overcoming enemies to discover new areas and secrets some paths onwards could be visible but inaccessible blocked by environmental factors or seemingly impossible adversaries but for every direction thats a no go theres another trail to travel with potential rewards to be reaped which in turn might open up somewhere else to journey that refreshing lack of enforced linearity with no two players tackling the game in the same sequence allows for a refinement of technique and skill evolution that rewards the curious those aforementioned rewards generally come in the form of new abilities that usually give our protagonist additional movement options and sometimes additional combat options furthermore whilst the knights main combat tactic of sword swiping evolves little from his humble beginnings special charms can be acquired equipped and combined to bolster his offensive and defensive capabilities from sprinting a little faster to marking your position on the map or gathering up dropped currency known here as geo the charm mechanics can be tactically manipulated to provide an advantage whatever the situation be it a difficult boss or challenging platforming section 

collected geo can be spent on additional charms charm slots the starting allowance of 3 slots can be expanded up to 10 with better charms requiring more notches and later weapon upgrades combat is simple yet satisfying with the controls tight and responsive and deaths highlighting player inadequacy rather than an unfair game mechanic in addition to his melee attack the knight has a pool of magic that he can employ on learned spells or to focus on healing himself healing takes a little time to kick in and in having to remain motionless theres an immediate risk reward mechanic to tricky situations do you risk pushing on to finish off a flagging foe or do you heal and potentially be killed off or interrupted wasting your limited mana pool and its here that another oft talked about system crops upthe death penalty on meeting your maker the knight is restored at his last save spot minus his accumulated wealth and with around a third of his magic metre locked away a quick glance at the map will reveal that a ghostly shade now sits at the site of his death this is the soulslike aspect of the game that sees you able to defeat your ghostly shade in order to recover your riches and restore your magic and is a great touch that allows exploration without too much fear of punishment death can still happen in a moment and geo lost easily with the potential penalty increasing as the geo count grows but theres a wonderful freedom and challenge created by a system that punishes you for death but not irrevocably so

with its giant world the game is massive easily occupying 40 or 50 hours of playtime and yet with a precise critical path known in advance its quite possible to whiz through the game in a fraction of that time but its enticing not to do so the simple joy of exploration and unlocking additional powers and charms possessing an addictive quality seen only in the finest games however there is one aspect of the game that is initially jarring and takes a little getting used to in fact its possibly the closest thing the game has to a flawthe mapping system unlike many traditional metroidvanias the map doesnt draw itself in real time but relies upon resting at save benches to update additionally to display a current location marker an equipped charm is required this can in turn mean long spells of trekking around in unmapped areas looking for a point of safety admittedly this is jarring at first and given the size of the map and the potential avenues of exploration available takes some getting used to but as far as flaws are concerned thats about as far as they go perhaps some might criticise the lack of explicit storytelling and others the scope of the world but whilst hollow knight doesnt reinvent the genre it polishes and hones it into a must play masterwork and thats not even mentioning the additional dlc that expands the challenge the battle colosseum or the multiple endings that reward the curious player interested in the world he inhabits

hollow knight would be an accomplishment from any source but its a towering achievement for a first release from the small team cherry close the curtains dim the lights and dive headlong into the world of hallow nest

i did not expect what this game could make me feel
it has been a lot of years now since the last time i fell in love with a game indeed i do not even remember which was the last one
i have never been into this genre or kind of game but this game is something else i think that entirely changed my mind
from minute zero to after completing 100 of the game the travel it has supposed has been one of the most beautiful gaming experiences i have ever had
the mysterious story the multiple stages the exciting epic and sometimes melancholic soundtrack the movement the learning curve the foes the bosses and everything you could imagine this game has made it as complex epic and enjoyable as possible
some good news for me i still have a lot of things to do in this game even after completing it hahaha
simply a masterpiece
i have nothing new to add to this review just to let you know that this is an experience you should give a try

absolute masterpiece

the average hollow knight enjoyer


























#####

after more than 20 years of gaming hollow knight became instantly one of my alltime favourites

amazing how an indie game can have so much content and yet be indistinguishable from aaa games qualitywise the artistic direction is pure diamond visual and musical brilliance results in an exceptionally atmospheric game

platforming and combat are fluid and often fastpaced while requiring quick wits different charms spells and nail arts make the combat diverse enough to be interesting and still keep it relatively simple so skill is a major factor challenging but completely fair some parts especially optional content are actually pretty hardcore but oh so satisfying more casual players might not get to complete everything that is if they even find it all

secrets are all over the vast world and well hidden so that is not something to be taken for granted it is funny how youll find new things even in the very first area throughout the whole game hollow knight has a wonderful feeling of exploration you need to buy a map for each area they are not available instantly when entering a new one keep an eye out for shortcuts or stag stations

the games progression often requires you to revisit areas later when you have a certain ability or item acquired let me tell you the movement has quite a different feel in it during the late game when you have double jump wall jump and dash among other abilities this of course affects combat since movement is a crucial part of it you better master the abilities or you are in for a tough time with the many incredible bosses you will encounter

yes occasional fps drops are currently present but that is not a big problem and it is one of the very few update the game has been patched dont know if this is still true

there are way too many great things about this game to be written in one review hollow knight should be a strong contender for goty 2017 even if this seems to become such an excellent year for gaming

a beautifully sculpted game from art style animations sound design and music it is a journey through the mysteryshrouded remains of a fallen kingdom punctuated by challenging boss fights and platforming sections 

it is important to note a few things you will not have a map for a zone when you first encounter it there will be many paths unavailable to be taken until certain items or powerups are gained leading to quite a lot of backtracking the game features a soulsesque death system that leaves a spirit where you died that you must defeat to retrieve your currency lest it be gone forever should you die a second time and finally the game is really hard there are many walls youll come across that demand a level of familiarity or competency to beat and if youre anything like me youll die a whole lot

all of that being said i have found my experience with hollow knight thoroughly engaging every zone has a unique atmosphere and design each time i met a new npc was a delight upgrades always feel impactful changing where you can go but also how you can fight enemies and the lore taking the time to read item descriptions isnt everyones cup of tea but encountering areasnpcsbosses after reading a tiny reference about them 5 hours ago will never not have me exclaiming this is thatthem and ill always get a kick out of it

looking at it from a different lens i think it took me about 4050 hours to get a story ending 120130 hours to get all the achievements and i am currently doing unnecessary challenges like beating all the bosses without being hit edit i did it and im so happy at 165 hours
what i am saying is that this game is only au1750 often 50 off for au875 and you get a ludicrous amount of content to chew through if it strikes your fancy you cant go too wrong

i love this game and am looking forward to silksong so so much

#####

game good play game

#####

after playing this game for 105 hours i realized something i am the hollow knight
i started playing this so much to the point that going beyond extremely difficult bosses made me empty inside i have no more desires and no emotions while playing this because its like i suffered long term hypnosis and didnt realize that i spent every afternoon of my week playing again and again and again
it took me a long time to decide to write a review about this game but i cant blame myself for that as i was too busy getting hooked on it to remember to do anything else important in my life
i spent days forgetting to eat lunch while playing this wonder and after hollow knight became my favorite game i realized its a path of no return but not a path of pain like the one in the game but a path of emotion and happiness and thats why you should stop looking at the reviews and buy this work of art right away because every second looking at them its a second longer that youre away from hollow knight
stop waiting for promotions and buy the game soon then well go together embrace the void

edit 150 hours lmao silksong is not real its just a collective delirium

edit2 200 hours now and silksong is real

edit3 yes its the silksong month



















#####

just play it

#####

this game is a masterpiece

#####

1 scroll back up
2 buy it
3 thank me later

#####

holy crap this game is so good the atmosphere is amazing its got fluid combat and can be incredibly punishing until you learn the patterns it is an extremely well done platformeradventure game highly highly highly recommend it

the game progressively gets more difficult but it isnt the type of difficult that makes you leave forever you will need to quickly recognize patterns and take things slowly the first time you meet someone new 

bosses are a real challenge but the kind of challenge that is immensely satisfying once beaten you are always rewarded well in addition to the pride of the kill 

discovering new places becomes incredibly fun and finding new people in such a desolate place is memorable and often rewarding

overall out of 100 this game is easily a 95

#####

beautiful atmospheric infuriating

#####

oh so this is why people like metroidvanias i get it now

#####

a 10 ouf of 10 game and one of the best indie games of all time

beautiful hand drawn art
fun combat
great platforming
good boss fights
good music
controls are great
difficulty is just perfect
closest any game has ever gotten to being a 2d dark souls

its also one of the largest metroidvanias you will ever play an overachievement at every step of the way so go and play it now

#####

i hate the goverment

#####

love this game so damn much 3


























 
  

#####

a magical experience where no matter how much you conquer or how long you explore youll always be mesmerized by the sheer level of artistic prowess neverending challanges and absolute audiovisual pleasure from every corner 
i am incapable of finding a single thing i dislike of this excellent game that pushes the quality of its genre to a new level

#####

at first when i saw this game one year ago or so and read the description of the game i really hated the idea of it
you play as some kind of insect killing insect in a insect world how could it be fun in any way shape or form

oh boy how wrong i was it became easily one of my top favorite game ive ever played ive completed the game 4 time i even challenged myself to beat the game without dying and without upgrade that how much i love that game

and they have release so many small free expansion for this game too you have soooo many thing to do its got great art very fluid animation awesome music vague but really great storylore an amazing ambiance with a really well balanced gameplay with just enough challenge to always keep it fun  but it can get really really hard if you aim for the 112 completion 

there nothing i can say to describe how much i like it they could have asked us for 34 bucks for all those extension but they didnt the game only cost 15 euros and yet i feel like it deserved double of it

i know no one will read that anyway but i feel like this game deserve even more love

#####

probably the best metroidvania game in a while a must play
fantastic bosses great and mysterious story beautiful environment and great controls

#####

it made me interested in games again

i absolutely love this game the combat is simple and easy to use the charm system is great the atmosphere is wonderfully done the characters are unique the boss fights are incredibly fun and challenging and theres a good story to kick exploration is a huge part with an extensive map and many secret areas that make exploring all the more worthwhile there are also some side quests which open up new boss fights and other rewards they dont feel pointless at all in fact i wish there was more to the side quests than just a side quest a lot of the boss fights had my heart pounding and hands sweating which was a pretty addicting feeling considering the adrenaline rush the atmosphere of the game really drew me into the lore and i found that i was way too immersed and attached by the end of the game that i ended up bingeing mossbag and crying yes this game can be incredibly frustrating at times but it adds to the entire experience im pretty sure it has a reputation for being a difficult game so be prepared to die a lot i have no issues with this game and i am obsessed also the soundtrack is such a banger that i would listen to it for 8 hours straight while working although i was almost sick of a certain boss theme from hearing it so often ingame

tldr get the game its really good

#####

absolutely stunning game from its story to gameplay to sounddesign and to its beautifully wellmade art hollow knight makes for a heavily enjoyable metroidvania where one can expect to face tough challenges in quite an eerie yet cozy environment the combat always stays exciting addicting and is wellcrafted the more solidcolour characters blend in with the shaded depth of the backgrounds  while each area its leveldesign and the enemies always give a feeling of fresh wonderment when progressing through the game the free dlc on top of this are very entertaining bonuses to the overall content

it is clear to see the love that has been poured into hollow knight by its developers  and that has nurtured it into a game that should be iconic in the genre along with in video games overall this is a game created with passion which is clear from its unique attractiveness quality and homely feel and that is exactly the core of what a game should be

i strongly recommend this game

#####

this game quickly became one of my all time favorites for a few reasons ill talk about it in parts so that its easier for you to read

h1loreh1

hollow knight has an incredibly well developed lore the story is told not only through dialogues and cutscenes in fact there are very few cutscenes in this game so you dont feel like its just an interactive movie but also through the environment and item descriptions 
but lets emphasize the ienvironmenti its design is bamazingb the art direction in this game is impeccable you can see every tiny detail is well thought of although it has multiple areas and each area  has its very unique look they all fit in seamlessly and it doesnt feel like a patchwork world  the story of each area is told through its design be it in the dead bugs in the background or the spiders crawling all over your screen 
if youre interested in learning more about this world and its ruined kingdom there are plenty of secrets for you to find exploring the game its also highly recommended for you to talk to every npc possible and i promise you wont get bored of listening to them either in fact youll probably find yourself excited when a new one shows up and you can interact with them

h1art and sound designh1

i dont think you need me to tell you about it but im gonna do it anyway
this games sound design is simply bamazingb they did a wonderful job with the entire soundtrack it adds to the whole game experience and also to each areas overall feel    specially the city of tears ost
like i said before  the art direction in this game is impeccable everything is meticulously designed so that you feel completely immersed the animations are flawless the backgrounds are beautiful the characters have very clear personalities and nothing feels out of place

h1gameplay and level designh1

the brilliant level design of this game gives you a challenging experience but one that always makes you comfortable and confident spoiler except path of pain path of pain truly lives up to its name and its just not for the feint of heartspoiler
the player starts with the 3 most simple mechanics that most people are familiar with walk jump and slash attack you can gradually unlock new abilities and every time you do youre gonna have a chance to get used to it with no obvious tutorials the level design ensures you have a nice experience learning your new quirks
the controls feel totally natural and smooth and youre not gonna find yourself stuck in a hole because your double jump isnt triggering ive never had a problem with any delay in the controls or with hitbox bugs 
the enemies are varied and it takes more than just running facefirst into them to defeat them

h1tl drh1

this game not only looks amazing it also feels amazing with a lot of content you can play for hours exploring and fighting your way through the world it offers both very difficult challenges for players who enjoy such things and a generally nice experience for casual gamers who are here just to have a good time
its definitely worth trying whether youre an experienced player or just someone looking for some fun

update as i keep playing and exploring this games community i learn more and more about its lore and fall even more in love with it

#####

one of the best 2d actionadventure games i have ever played with one of the best music i have ever heard in any game genre 
this game understands the souls formula better than any other clones out there dark souls was never about its difficulty its about exploration atmosphere and the feeling of mystery and isolation which hollow knight nails

#####

game good

#####

the perfect metroidvania and one of the best games

#####

at first i had no interest in this game but after playing it my god do you know that feeling of playing the isymphony of the nighti for the first time thats what i felt is rly a godd metroidvania and soulslike maybe what are you waiting for buy now

#####

best metroidvania ever created 1010
also dont open a ingame bank account

#####

this game is absolutely incredible
the graphics are beautiful the world is stunning and the little details are amazing
the game does a great job of giving you the history of the world youre in without shoving the lore down your throat with cutscenes after every screen change
the bosses are amazing and just the right difficulty so many things to collect and places to explore
1010

absolute masterpiece

i really dont like 2d games but this one really took me the music sound effects the variety of landscapes and enemies everything about it was beautiful

#####

grimm is hot

for a while now ive been a fan of platformers both 2d  3d from the snes super metroid to the ps2s sly cooper trilogy to celeste  dead cells on pc they always tickled some sense of enjoyment a thrill of exploration however there was always something that was left unsaid some itch that needed scratching

hollow knight was the treatment to my ailment the scratch for my itch as it were sorry it sounded better in my head

hollow knight brought to me some sort of unfounded magic that i never thought existed from beginning to end hollow knight was a gripping adventure sucking me in like a black hole with a dedicated team of developers  the dlc they release im always crawling back to the game for fear that i missed something new  exciting

h1 pros h1

uartu all of the art for this game was handdrawn much like jotun cuphead  darkest dungeon the stunning settings of each region in hallownest were nothing short of breathtaking there was a solid level of detail for platforms  backgrounds things like grass  dust being kicked up by walking  dashing were a nice touch  hanging vines rustling when walking past them gives the player that sense of tangibility the characters of hallownest are cute yet elaborate  dynamic for example
list
the elderbug is the oldest resident of dirtmouth  a friendly face for new travelers seeking the kingdom hes wistful of how silent  empty dirtmouth has become what with the citizens all exploring the kingdom
quirrel is a strange lad with a strong sense of adventure yet troubled by a lack of remembrance of who he really is hes always happy to see the knight on his adventures through hallownest
cloth is a timid warrior with lockedaway courage begging to be teased out as you go out of your way to cross paths with her she awakens that bravery from how much you inspire her and shes so stinkin cute the whole time too
 iselda  cornifer are the helpful doting couple in hallownest supplying the knight with invaluable maps map pins  charms ill explain those soon to aid him on his journey
zote is the personification of everything you want to punch in the face hes pigheaded annoying boorish  condescending
list

the designs of hollow knights monsters are also a treat ranging from aww its adorable it couldnt hurt a soul to ibdear lord its disgusting kill it kill it kill the fucking thingbi this mixnmatch of design along with the fact that there are well over a hundred different monsters across hallownest keeps the player on their toes it makes them think a little in combat rather than blindly mashing the attack button nice to see team cherry say no to the tedious monotony of hooray theres only 7 different types of enemies

umusicu christopher larkins composition of hollow knights soundtrack which you can find urlhttpschristopherlarkinbandcampcomalbumhollowknightright hereurl is beyond diction if it was anyone else i dont think this game would have the same enjoyment factor one thing for sure is that the games original soundtrack was capable of bringing the player that sense of danger excitement or fear that should ensue when entering a new area or fighting a new boss lemme explain
list
the forgotten crossroads forges determination in an ominous abandoned land with the husks of hallownests bugs resurrected in a fit of bloodlust it incites you to see your mission through even if you didnt quite know what it is at the moment
greenpath generates that feeling of exploration  wonder fueled only by curiosity as the flora  fauna skitter about in lush greenery the monsters dont pose much a threat yet the walls of thorns  pools of acid will test your platforming
deepnest drills fear  paranoia into the player as all around you are the scattered carcasses of hallownests denizens with predatory spiders  pools of parasites itching to make you into their next meal
the city of tears crafts an eerily beautiful sorrowful setting as you wander the remnants of a bustling town reduced to a hotbed of reanimated husks all caught in an endless downpour
the abyss is pure chronic  sustained dread the very air around you wails get out  grows ever powerful as you descend when you finally hit the bottom the sense that you dont belong could crush diamonds to dust
list

there are many more examples of these moments but then we wouldnt get anywhere with this review if i listed them

ugameplayu now i know this is going to make me sound like a game journalist but the game can be boiled down to dark souls a bugs life edition while its an accurate trivialization of the game subjecting it to such abstraction just puts the game in a terrible light team cherry does do the soulslike label justice with the mechanic of in normal mode you lose your stuff if you die so respawn  get it you can regain it all if you defeat the ghost of your past life but if you die again a new ghost forms  the old one with your stuff is gone forever in steel soul mode though its just permadeath that alone will makes your gameplay  decisionmaking safer than the gold in fort knox

platforming in this game makes you come up with ingenious ways to get to different spots as your progress through the game you can dash in midair doublejump  even do nighendless charged dashes to unexplored regions which in a platformer that falls under the metroidvania label youre gonna be doing a lot of but will be rewarded for

the combat in hollow knight is fair i say fair because the knight suffers from short range  knockback from landing successful hits on enemies the soul meter mechanic makes you have to choose between casting spells at the cost of healing or healing at the cost of dealing spell damage boss fights dont pull punches either forcing you to think on your feet or get bopped real quick

charms give the knight combat buffs movement buffs or just qualityoflife buffs you have a specific amount of charm notches on you that you can raise throughout the game each charm you get has a special trait whether it be temporary hp dealing extra damage increasing your running speed or make reading the map less of a headache however charms cost a certain number of notches but by trying 5 times to equip a charm youll equip it  become overcharmed meaning that youll take double damage from everything only do this with a highcost charm  if you can read bosses harder than a college textbook

h1 cons h1

upacingu hollow knights lore is actually up for the players interpretation thus theres no proper lore only hints given through various sources no assumptions can be made  in what fashion these hints are pieced together in is totally for the player to decide while i appreciate that creative approach to storytelling hollow knights pacing is slower than i would like the game only really picks up after 90 minutes to 2 hours of play which i honestly am not comfortable with  your main objective is given to you after what 7 hours for players new to the genre let alone the game 7 hours before you figure out what the hell youre really supposed to do besides explore  bash some heads in can seem unappealing to most players discouraging them from continuing

h1 conclusion h1

all in all i give hollow knight a welldeserved 910 solid gameplay gorgeous soundtrack enthralling art  characters  diverse monster pool however the pacing of the story is much slower than what id like

nevertheless thank you team cherry this beautiful game is a testament to your hard work  dedication i look forward to further work from you

#####

mmm bug game

#####

simply great i wish i can relive the moments of playing this game for the first time

#####

since noone will find this inbetween all the trash of the review section ill just use bulletpoints

pros
pleasent aesthetics
great soundtrack i believe the first trailer doesnt use one of christopher larkins scores so watch another one
investive and surprisingly dark story and lore dont look it up keep playing and attempt to stitch it together
varied platforming through powerups except to only start of with a basic jump keep playing a little longer to widen your arsenal
interesting combat mainly through boss fights some powerups can really aid in combat but require skill to use
secrets you will find out
look at its price tag for the content this game offers 15 is ludacrously low

cons
punishing difficulty might through some players off so be up for the challenge
the controls are not precise enough for one endgame area

#####

i liked the part when hornet said its hornet time and horneted all over the place

hollow knight is great game with precious gameplay and amazing world youll meet with veryvery big map where sometimes you will think that you stuck and there are no way to go but you need to check the previous locations where might be the way you needed as metroidvanias use to do

ive never been this captivated by a video game in my entire life so much so that despite my original distaste of certain elements boss rushes and 1 death its over difficulties ive done everything the game has to offer and i enjoyed every single minute of it i cannot recommend this game enough buy it

#####

masterpiece

#####

is this game great
yes

do you need me to tell you that
no buy it already

theres something to be said about the persistence of a truly great piece of media i picked this game up and ragequit from the difficulty on at least 3 separate occasions  yet despite how much i said i hated it i still felt the pull to return to it again it was confusing and obscure i had no idea what i was doing or where to go and the bosses were completely kicking my ass i wanted to hate it and leave it at that but the game just wouldnt let it end there

recently i picked it up again and for whatever reason something just clicked and it felt like it came naturally i was finally able to appreciate how finely tuned every single aspect of the game is from the movement to the combat to the environments to the music to the storytelling themes its all just immaculate beyond all words i found myself enthralled i even managed to stick with it until full 112 completion and having completed the games greatest challenges in the dlc

years after i first picked up the game and put it down out of frustration i can say hollow knight is now one of my alltime favorite games i cannot recommend it enough though i will always stress just how difficult this game can be for those who have a harder time with difficult platforming and soulsesque bosses not to mention a lack of clear objectives or anything explicitly pointing your way its a tough time in the beginning and you may want to put it down out of frustration but if youre like me then the game wont let you set it down for long 



#####

having finished this beast of a game with 100 completion after two weeks without checking the internet for spoilers of any type i can attest to the fact that this is the greatest metroidvania game ever created it is better than the classic super metroid it is better than the classic symphony of the night

the experience of this game the art of its creation and composition affected me deeply i hope you enjoy the same reaction this is one of the best games i have ever played in my life

good luck

        tdhollow knight is proof that the metroidvania is still alive and well team cherry did a great job making a game that has not only great 2d art but fun gameplay this game controls are so tight and responsive that if you fall in a pit or get hit then it is your fault and not the game the world of the game is very intriguing and has many mysteries that are still not solved but my favorite part of the game is the great soundtrack it is quite rare for a kickstarter game to not be terrible but i really enjoyed hollow knighttd

hollow knight is a work of art a masterpiece even yup sounds like an exaggeration but thats how i really feel about this game

everything about this game is just amazing gameplay story visuals ost sound design and content im not sure what to write since its better if you experience the game fully blindly for reference i didnt like the genre before trying this game after that im eager to try more

but if you want to know heres what i think about the game

b story b
at first you might know nothing about the story like nothing but as your progress goes on you will keep learning about the world its not handed out to you but rather youd have to explore and connect the dots but dont worry even if you dont understand there are tons of content on the internet that can help you understand better its worth it
characters are lovable and unique i myself feel attached to them theres voice acting in this game so it gives the characters more personality

b gameplay b
the gameplay in this game feels really satisfying the characters movement feels tight and not sluggish this makes platforming in the game feel nice  the combat is fastpaced and super fun dont let the difficult tag fool you it might be difficult but its not unfair with enough training you can win but if youre a hardcore player and wants something more challenging then dont worry because i think youll be satisfied  
hollow knight has skills and charms charms can give you bonuses such as more hp or more damage or more speed you can mix and match to your hearts content this means that your gameplay can feel a lot different than the others because we have our own preferences which lead us to using different charms oh controller is much more comfortable to use than keyboard unless youre really good at using keyboard so keep that in mind

b  visuals b
its just simply gorgeous take a look at the screenshots and trailers on the store page its so detailed and refreshing i say refreshing because there are too many games in the genre that use pixelarts now dont get me wrong i love pixelarts but seeing something different once in a while is nice

b music b
my oh my the soundtracks of this game are toptier christopher larkin really blessed us with various soundtracks that give you different vibes and makes you feel more immersed in the game honestly there are times where i deliberately let myself get killed by the boss just so i can listen to the boss music again and again even now i have the songs on loop its just that great it wouldnt be the same without chris music

b content b
the game is full of content there are lots of content in this game furthermore team cherry added more through free expansions namely godmaster lifeblood the grimm troupe and hidden dreams dont worry about the quality theyre all great

b tldr b 
hollow knight is amazing in terms of gameplay story visuals ost sound design and content you might like it even if you dont like the genre its tagged as a difficult game but the gameplay is very fair  lots of other players are giving this game a praise for example through steam reviews its overwhelmingly positive so if you have the time for it go check this gem out who knows maybe youll be the next one who writes a review praising this game  

after finishing the game i feel so i hollow i with all the content and the quality of the game itself i think buying this game at full price is worth it thank you team cherry for creating hollow knight i absolutely cannot wait for silksong

dark the depths of this accursed kingdom are so very very dark lanterns provide a form of solace but it seems as though the shadows themselves hunger for all which they do not already consume it tears and claws at the light with its oppressive shade through small flickers of light i catch glimpses of life blindingorange and harboring a hunger all its own i have walked this kingdom weak and weary for so so long every encounter with the fauna of this land is nervewracking a constant reminder that i should never have come here if only i had known

bugs really really gross me out

review
hollow knight

genre
metroidvania

originally appearing as a kickstarter project in november of 2014 hollow knight is a visually enthralling metroidvania with intuitive gameplay and an intriguing narrative developed by independent studio team cherry and released in february of 2017 hollow knight follows the story of the knight a mysterious traveler to the oncegreat kingdom of hallownest though his purpose in this land is originally unknown my purpose in writing this is most certainly the opposite what im here to do is unload my stream of consciousness onto the internet and hope that the end result resembles something of a recommendation or warning for the product im talking about see simple

speaking of simple hollow knight  like all good metroidvanias  begins with a very simple set of tools at the players disposal all of which are taught to you through a delightful and immersive tutorial you can jump either tapping the button to perform of a small hop or holding it for a graceful leap with generous aircontrol you can attack swinging you sword called a nail in the wonderfully rich fiction of this world directly in front of you above you or below you if youre airborne lastly you can use soul  a substance collected from attacking foes and stored in the topleft of the screen  to heal yourself should you take any damage thats the full scope your abilities from minute one but  like all good metroidvanias  you obviously gain loads more by the end of your journey whether combatbased or movementcentric every upgrade feels natural as it integrates with your starting arsenal and are both immediately understandable while still allowing for a number of complex applications

where complexity most rears its head is in hollow knights evercustomizable charm system throughout your journey you may find earn or purchase charms which will augment or otherwise improve your abilities and how they function from the wayward compass which allows the player to see their location on the map to the baldur shell which defends the knight from a limited number of attacks when they focus soul each charm allows the player to tailor their moveset to better suit their playstyle some even have synergy with one another making certain combinations of charms particularly interesting and deadly be careful though youve only got a set amount of charm slots and trying to force one that cant fit may lead to unforeseen outcomes

whats not unforseen is hollow knights incredible attention to detail with particular care given to the exploration of the game world almost every single time i said i wonder if i could use that to the answer would be of course you can and thats not even the best part backtracking  like all good metroidvanias  is central to discoverybased excitement of hollow knight every single nook and cranny in this insect kingdom begs to be explored and toyed with and team cherry is none too happy to heartilly reward the inquisitive player from the very first screen of the game hollow knight teaches its players that exploration is both encouraged and rewarded that rewarding feeling from exploration carries over into the combat side of the game as well providing players with a rush of adrenaline and accomplishment with each standout boss fight that presents itself from the clunky and beginner friendly false knight all the way to the overwhelming and challenging watcher knights hollow knight creates interesting encounters that both teach the player to master their tools and stand as memorable roadblocks to your progress as you progress

most memorable of all encounters in the game will be your interactions with the various denizens of hallownest sometimes cute most times creepy and at all times charming interacting with the various npc bugs of hollow knight is an absolute treat each interesting insect has an immediately recognizable design and personality that sticks with you from your very first encounter with them often times theyll have their own goals to climb toward as well and your paths may intersect in a variety of creative ways each one providing another snippet of dialogue while all the most important characters are designed by team cherry themselves a good amount are actually created by the very people that backed the game as a kickstarter in particular i have to give a shoutout to my bagheaded bestie cloth for being so wonderfully chummy and relatable having a generic avatar design sure does pay off in the long run eh 

hollow knight  has had quite the long run itself with four free expansion that come bundled with the base game proper and a seperate paid expansion that features a new playable character with their own quest and story the four expansion hidden dreams the grimm troupe lifeblood and godmaster all add a considerable amount of content to the base game though hidden dreams and lifeblood were more akin to updates than full expansions i would highly recommend seeking out all of the content added by these additions with the wholehearted exception of the final challenge of godmaster while the first 80 of the expansion is pulsepounding challenging and enjoyable the final 20 was so unbearably fun and dare i say poorly designed that i can only describe it as a wine stain on an otherwise purewhite shirt i finished the challenge on principle and completionist urge alone and that added a mindbendingly torturous 20 hours to my total playtime attempt godmasters finale at your own peril and for the love of god give up if its too difficult its not worth it

hollow knight as a whole however is absolutely worth the asking price and more i can say without a doubt in my mind that had i paid sixty dollars for this game instead of fifteen i would have been satisfied with my purchase wholesale this game is unbearably big and every moment of my playtime with the glaring exception of godmasters finale was spent in absolute joy and awe i bought this game in the tail end of 2017 and didnt truly play it until a full calendar year later hollow knight was an adventure worth having and one i would sincerely recommend to anyone who plays video games it is an instant classic a glimmering indie darling and a criminally underpriced masterpiece momodora allowed me to wade into the pool of metroidvania hollow knight threw me into the depths and taught me to swim

take that dive readers you might just fall in love
