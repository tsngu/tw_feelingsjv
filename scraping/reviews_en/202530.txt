sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 is what you get when you put people who dont have any idea what they are doing in charge of making a new sonic game what you probably have heard is right this game is really bad its a stain on the legacy of the blue hedgehog and the devs apparently knew this as well because they stopped supporting and patching this not long after its release let me explain what awaits you in this game step by step

h1the foreshadowing is realh1
in a very baffling move the developers chose java of all things to program the configuration tool so in order to run the game you need to have installed java runtime 160 which understandably a lot of people have not if you dont you wont be able to run the game the developers have also not updated the game to fix this

fortunately a thoughtful person has done the developers work for them and compiled a new launcher in c which you can download from pcgamingwiki so you can run the game without installing java but do take this act of ignorance as a foreshadowing of whats to come

h1the game is aesthetically all over the placeh1
this is one of the biggest issues youll have with the game the game is really colorful when it comes to its aesthetics and 2d models and some of the small details are praiseworthy but just after starting the first level youll be greeted by a hideously looking sonic model and the situation gets worse when you see the enemy models for some reason sonic 4 ep1 uses a very ugly shader that makes every 3d model look like they were put in oil so if you decide to buy this game do yourself a favor and get the fanreleased texture pack which contains the superior ios version models available here
httpssteamcommunitycomapp202530discussions0610574394228269099

other than that later levels become so confusing due to texture overuse when you get to the mad gear zone you might get into trouble differentiating between passable and nonpassable obstaclesplatforms in the environment because the devs did not bother themselves to make things clearer for you

h1thankfully the soundtrack is not that badh1
sonic 4 is one of those times the series used electronic music only but while the music quality has degraded compared to the rest of the games in the series and some tracks are mindbogglingly short boss theme is under 10 seconds long and loops constantly unlike sonic forces you can find a bunch of likable and even memorable music here splash hill zone act 1 is a good example for this

h1but dear god what is this level designh1
let me tell you something the moment you found out the developer of a platforming game is dimps get ready for bad level design and a boatload of endless pits for some unknown reason these guys love to put a lot of endless pits and badly placed hazards in a game and then make excuses and give you a lot of resources to help you get past them

you just have to take a simple look at the levels all of them have tons of springs bumpers useless gimmicks and endless pits in them and unlike s4ep2 you dont even get notified that you are approaching an endless pit the more you progress from the beginning of the game the more this gets worse and worse

nowhere this abomination of a level design is more visible than mad gear zone the final zone of the game youre going to absolutely hate this zone because of how bs it is the obstacleplatform clarity problem that i mentioned above is not the only thing youre going to bear with in this level there are endless pits obviously chase sequences so strict that require flawless navigation  one misstep or slowing down costs you a life utterly baseless and gimmicky platforming challenges and urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqd4mmrvresslicers everywhereurl so get ready for frustration and rage tons of it

even the enemy placement is horrible whenever sonic is running or gets launched by springs theres always a chance that you might run into an enemy or hazard and if your reaction time is not fast enough to do a homing attack or get out of the way you will hit them and will either lose all of your rings or fall into another endless pit however i believe the headaches caused by this issue could have been avoided to some degree if the devs didnt mess up other stuff

h1also what are these design decisionsh1
the moment we get to some design choices everything gets worse and i honestly dont know who in their right mind decided to do these to the game first the camera is way too close to sonic and does not offer a good field of view of what is coming next this is the exact reason why the enemy placement seems stupid and unfair if the camera was placed farther then the player could have seen the enemies and plan to react to them but such thing has unfortunately not happened

second all of sonics abilities are dumbed down not only the spindash does not provide enough speed to pass some sections one of them appears in casino street zone act 1 compared to running but also rolling does not give you enough protection because sonic does not remain in his rolling form if you press down to roll either to avoid enemies in your path or to increase speed you must expect sonic to get out of it after a set period of time why this happens no one knows

third the special stages have also changed for the worst and will annoy you enough to finally start cursing at the game its the same thing from the first sonic game but now they force you to rotate the stage yourself and try to get to the end under a very strict and very evil time limit but wait because thats not all these stages are also filled with tons of bumpers that constantly bounce you around and some of them are placed in locations where theres a near 100 possibility to be thrown straight to a goal sign and lose the stage did i also mention there are gates that remain locked until you get a certain amount of rings and the game does not warn you about their presence until you reach them and find out you have no time left to somehow salvage your attempt

fourth the boss fights have also changed for the worst eggman now has invulnerability frames after each time you hit him which means sometimes your next attack wont register other than that 4 out of 5 bosses are reused material from older sonic games this game has sonic 1s green hill boss sonic 2s carnival night and metropolis bosses and also who can forget the widely overused death egg robot as the final boss whats worse is some of these bosses have became more annoying  unfair here than before and you cant even use super sonic against them

h1but the version that youre getting here is not the worst that existedh1
yep you heard that right sonic 4 ep1 is better if played on pc or consoles because somehow the development team managed to offer a much more miserable experience to those who played this on mobile want to know why aside from a much smaller field of view and rampaging ads every time you run into a loop in the mobile version of this game the entire screen starts to spin instead of sonic normally passing them and that makes the experience unbearable if you ask me

h1so tldr should you get it or noth1
if you are a casual gamer have little experience in platformer games do not want to torture yourself want to keep your sanity intact or cant handle unfair situations do not bother with this game only get this if you want to complete your sonic games collection or you have the desire and determination to experience bad games and see how they were and be sure to only get this when its on a big sale

#####

an ok game but disappointing as the official fourth entry in the franchise

get sonic mania if you want the real sonic 4 and get this if you want a clunky reimagine of sonic 1

#####

sonic 4 part ones biggest issue is its name if the game was called sonic mobileportable something like that was the original idea for it one could go easier on it for being a variation on the tried and true formula of what makes a sonic platformer fun that unfortunately failed but being saddled with the expectations of it following in the original genesismegadrive classics well lets just say its almost blasphemous on just how badly it fails at being a proper continuation of that saga

having said that the game isnt horrible at least not until it gets to the third zone where theres cheap deaths a plenty to deal with and memorize to get through the levels and that makes a game that is already not very high on fun factor come to a grinding halt and ask you the question why are you not playing a far better sonic game like sonic mania

i got no good retorts to that query so i stopped playing i suggest if you already got the game give it a go since the first two zones are decent and got some fun moments and arent altogether annoying and frustrating like the third zone im not saying they are hard just the process of learning them so you dont get insta killed is no fun and the pay off just isnt there to continue dealing with that nonsense when the gameplay is substandard in the first place

also the tunes are just boring and feel like a bland copy of the classic tunes that forgot to copy the hooks

heres something for your troubles

you can get the same experience by bashing your head with a rock repeatedly for 90 minutes

#####

its like playing a gif

#####

just stop right here and get sonic mania instead you wont regret it one bit

just get mania

h1introh1
sonic the hedgehog 4
thats a title weve been wanting to hear for years

 unfortunately the classics would be ashamed of this game and it does not deserve the title

a new sidescroller sonic game with modern visuals  whats not to like
well terrible physics some of the worst music of a sonic game awful boss fights and level design and a bland rehash of the classics

sonic 4 is nothing more than that

h1gameplayh1 
sonic 4 has a traditional 2d gameplay style run from point a to b for the most part it plays okay and can be fun to go through some of the levels with that said the physics are horrible whether it be uncurling walking up slopes or the spindash lacking any form of power the level design isnt much better and we have dimps to thank for that who are somewhat notorious at bad sonic game designing 

the level themes and bosses are all reshashes from the first 2 sonic games you have green hill s1 casino night s2 labrynth s1 metropolis s2 and death egg s2 some of the levels have forced gimmicks that suck the emerald stages suck too theyre a rehash of sonic 1s but even worse

its really not that bad to play through it can be fun at times but its just not worth the money or the pain of playing the terribly boring boss fights gimmicky parts and bonus stages all while listening to that god awful soundtrack

h1musich1 
lol


the soundtrack tries to recreate some sort of classic sonic style music but the vst instrument choice is terrible it just sounds like cats and ducks and stupid shit like that the compositions are horribly bland as well and the boss music is an absolute joke

the worst music ive ever heard from a sonic game

h1visualsh1 
the game tries to be modern looking but it ends up rather hideous
terrible colors sprites and a complete lack of polish even sonics sprites look really shiny and jagged

this game is simply an eyesore and doesnt come close to matching the pixel art of the old games

h1storyh1 
generic sonic storyline

h1pc versionh1
i remember the port having some weird resolution issues playing on 1080p it all seemed to be fine now it runs without any problems but theres very little graphical options its pretty ugly so you might wanna force some aa through your graphics card

very little out there in the mod department

h1conclusionh1
sonic 4 isnt that terrible but it isnt good by any means a huge disappointment to most sonic fans

if youre new to the series play the classics on an emulator instead or wait for sonic mania
if youre a sonic fan that just wants more 2d gameplay check out sonic before the sequel and after the sequel

from what i remember ep2 was a much much better game but i havent replayed it yet so im not certain
definitely skip ep1

#####

lets make this as candid as possible 
sonic the hedgehog 4 episode i is not a great game it falls short of meeting its legacy by replacing charm with tech and that tech hasnt aged well since this was released roughly a decade ago the control physics and momentum that sonic is typically known for are a mere shadow and sonic being able to stand on a 45 degree angle never gets easier to swallow or accept 
yet here i am in 2020 in a post sonic mania world still thinking about going back playing and getting all the achievements for sonic 4 ep i and 12 hours later i did it and worse ii enjoyed iti 
youve seen these stages before youve fought these bosses and the special stages are similar enough that youve felt like youve done those before too but yet i still enjoy playing this for at least the fourth time and still having fun doing so maybe my shameful sonic trash tattoo is showing but i dont care 

in summery  this isnt as bad as people make it out to be is it the worst 2d sonic game besides sonic blast on the game gear probably is it still worth playing through if youre a fan of the series and can pick it up on the cheap also probably

#####

forgive me god for i have sinned i have 67 hours on sonic 4


#####

from sonic sonic 2 and sonic3knuckles comes the sequel we have all waited for sonic the hedgehog 4  episode i where the franchise goes back to its roots to try and redeliver the classic momentum based platformer that carried sega to success in 1991

unfortunately the game does not deserve the complement of its predecessors as for the most part the game insults the classic era of the franchise with a mediocre game that has a inferiority complex  trash cant disguise itself amongst gold 

the level design does not complement the momentum and even the momentum mechanics of the game are poor or rather broken and dont hold their own to the older brothers which will leave you with nothing but a sigh as the game spoonfeeds you dash panels so that you dont earn your speed and youre not punished for mistakes

the developers dont understand that earning your momentum gives you a fresh experience when you replay the level and you understand the layout well enough not to crash into badniks or spikes which is why the ring system is there in the first place so you can fail multiple times learn from your mistakes instead of punishing you downright so once you finally learn youre allowed to hold the reins of speed and all its goodness 

taking that away devalues what made the classic games in the first place the game also introduces the homing attack that is forced on you and drops every bit of speed youve gained so far

despite what has been said about the level design zone 4 takes a few steps towards the right direction but it doesnt stop the game from falling on its face you also have the terrible floaty physics and the poor redesigned bosses to also thank for that

the music however is great and with the beautiful visuals are very reminiscent of the classic sonic games are by far the strongest points of this product which thankfully dont collapse with the disappointment of the game even the 25d models are great other than sonics model itself oddly enough

what makes this game bearable is the fact that its a average platformer game when you dont compare it to its far superior prequels the length is very great for its price and the online time attack where you can compete against other players that can have you playing for hours to see who can break and exploit the game to the finish line the fastest

the game is by all means worth the 6 but youre better off spending a bit more of that money to buy games like ducktales remastered andor sonic 4 episode 2 despite them having lower scores on gaming review sites theyre superior in everyway

#####

just buy mania

#####

bad

#####

i had a long looong time without playing video games i created my steam account and looked for familiarity when i saw sonic 4 and the screenshots i just bought it immediately remembering how fun it was to play sonic 3 i did not look reviews or gameplay on youtube which now i always do thankfully it was in discount still not worthy

i am so sad that this game is so bad it is a rough slow cheap version of the sonic we love without the characteristic game flow or the cohesive style i just will keep the good sonic memories in my head and look for something new he is not coming back and i am not going to judge a game for the cover never again

#####

i dont know where i could possibly begin with my thoughts on this game my friend and i were casually talking about sonic and the topic of the sonic 4 games was brought up we were joking with each other about how the game was bad yadda yadda but when i checked my steam notifications not too long after that conversation ended i noticed that he had gifted it to me the full 10 price tag too he watched me play this game every moment of my misery playing this incredibly sorry excuse of a video game there is not a fun moment in this entire game every moment i had playing this game was either boring or filled with misery especially getting all the 7 chaos emeralds the worst aspect of the game by far i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone even for the people who wanna play this game ironically its not worth it believe me

tldr  a must play for any sonic fan

#####

my wife left me

#####

this game sucks i love it

#####

its like they based the physics on what if sonic ate 500 chili dogs and had to run afterward

#####

for the love of god just play sonic mania instead

#####

might as well start this off by saying that all the sonic games for the sega mega drive were the first videogames i ever played as a kid and i played them over and over for years so ive had quite a bit of experience when it comes to this type of sonic game now onto the review

sonic the hedgehog 4 really really does not live up to the standards of the original sonic games on the megadrive genesis quite a big letdown

theres quite a few problems i noticed as soon as i started playing the spindash is really really really slow even when rolling down hills and after using a speed booster and many times sonic juststopped right in the middle of rolling unrolling if you go over a ramp or an edge which left me too slow to make a jump a few times the physics just do not work well at all 

i only played splash hill zone til completion and some of casino street and both just feel like a copy of greenhill zone and emerald hill zone combined but not as good and casino night zone from the first boss battle is even the same as the end of green hill zone with dr robotnik now eggman in his egg mobileh with the swinging ball theres too much rehashing old ideas which the original games never really did

for the fastest hedgehog he sure has gotten slower things just really dont feel so inspired the levels look nice sure because graphics but just cmon make some new levels and dont just heavily reference the old ones to the point theyre almostbutnotquite the same 

this isnt sonic the hedgehog remastered its meant to be a continuation to sonic and knuckles just no

#####

h1sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1h1
uiwhat happenediu

regain control of the blue blur just not in this game as he is painfully slow

this game is not very fun as a sonic game and feels very under baked

i really dont want to spend to much time reviewing this the reviews speak for themselves

so here is an ascii of a disillusioned gordon ramsay

















iubtraildavebui
uiits rawiu

#####

its 2019 but this game still requires an old version of java to run

can we please get an update to this so it actually works

#####

absolute garbage port of an absolute garbage game i very stupidly bought it on launch on the ps3 and then picked it up during a sale in a pack with episode 2 on pc where to even begin with this trash

physics are wonky 
movement doesnt feel or look natural 
building up speed is less organic than it was in any of the mega drive games this makes precision platforming nighimpossible
graphics are some of the ugliest 25d platforming has to offer  
a series known among its fans for some pretty good or at least catchy music delivers an auditory snoozefest in this game 
the game calls itself sonic 4 but its too reminiscent of sonic 1 wth a little bit of 2 theres a throwback to nostalgia and then there is a ripoff 
this is pregenerations so this isnt classic sonic what he is is modern sonic with all the annoying modern sonic conveniences 
 the port is an absolute shitshow no graphics options beyond resolution no audio options beyond volume no way to fix keyboard controls weird default bindings d is jump but its also back but space is accept which is also jump and it requires you to separately download and install java for the game to run you shitting me sonic team

the thing that absolutely breaks the game and makes it a disaster though is the horrid level design accompanied by a completely broken homing attack that doesnt lock on properly and leads to constant deaths in pits or spikes and whatnot 

i usually look for the good things in games and make my recommendations based on whether or not the choice is good for the consumer im way past that point with this game its garbage its one of the worst things ive put myself through twice there is no pricepoint which would make sonic 4 episode 1 a justifiable purchase if given away for free it would still be too much it may as well be rebranded as a flashmade sanik game for it looks and plays like a parody of the real thing and contributes nothing to the brand or the series literally every other 2d sonic before it plays better go play those buy the mega drive collection instead

#####

wow its awful it literally plays like it is a parody of sonic 2 i say this as a person who considers sonic 2 one of their favorite games

one small thing to note though this game does not require java contrary to the reviews yes it demands java when you launch it from steam this is true but go digging through your steam folder find the sonic 4 directory then directly run sonic_xpexe it will run

if youre a huge sonic fan this does at least provide something to scratch the itch

#####

im editing this previously very short and precise review after some more playtime and consideration but rest assured the original point is still here just further down the line

so sonic 4 its been years now huh the 2006 game has been getting some second thoughts lately people are looking at it from a different perspective trying to understand the conditions it was made in and what it wanted to do a flawed result deeply flawed but evidently made with passion with this in mind perhaps there is merit in giving sonic 4 episode 1 a second chance

no it still sucks

i learned this the hard way for months sonic 4 sat on the back of my wishlist as something that i knew id eventually add to my library simply cuz its a sonic game i am helplessly ill lady luck have mercy it was a matter of time but still i knew this is something that i ought to be putting off but recently ive been having serious cravings for the blue blur and yet not enough green stuff to get the newer better games so the stinker it is

right at the title screen and menus it hit me just how lifeless this game is in my beloved jazz jackrabbit 2 fandom there was an era around the year 2000 when semirealistic tilesets made from 3d game textures and objects cropped from photos reigned supreme but it was something fans did as a technical flex and out of limited knowledge about some 2d plaftormer principles like readability and a consistent visual style well sonic 4 comes years after that and yet is stuck in that same unprofessional jank it looks like made out of stock assets and i cant rule out the possibility that it actually is see this game was initially made with mobile systems in mind and back then the mobile market was even worse than it is now this thing shouldve stayed there at home with all the other copy  paste horrors you look at mad gear and tell me these arent just textures processed from photos with minimal color correction and splash hill the only naturethemed level here seems made of plastic the objects are no better  they seem to be 2d sprites made out of 3d models like in sonic rush but that was a ds game why would anyone think the hideous color reduction was necessary or fitting maybe in a different setting but right on top of these hires overdetailed backgrounds the visuals of this game have no sense of style its a playable 90s prerender except prerenders at least get some funky camera shots and animations sonic 4s animations on the other hand are stiff like string puppets in the hands of an amateur enterpreneur

because of all this navigating the levels is literally straining on the eyes its a short episodic experience and yet i have to take breaks mad gear again is the worst example  so often the difficulty comes from searching with your eyes what could possibly be a wall or decoration while youre still running and if you mess up often fate worse than death repetition normally in 2d sonic games levels are broken up into floors so if youre doing well you stay on the stud path but make a mistake and you fall into the less groovy way until youre at rock bottom filled with obstacles that constantly slow you down but since all of sonic 4s gameplay is like that bottom floor we cant have nice things no almost all of this game is linear so either you man up and beat it segment by segment or youre thrown back to try again like its wario land 2 or something except this is a sonic game and it just makes the levels painful to beat theres no flow doesnt help that most gimmicks here seem made for a totally different type of platformer world of darkness stage 32 feels like an unholy amalgamate of sonic and spelunky and it sucks in fact fittingly with the artstyle theres no real originality here every stage is just an hd rehash of an existing one from sonic 1 or 2 splash hill is green hill casino street is casino night lost labyrinth is well labyrinth and mad gear is metropolis right down to all the badniks and obstacles acts 2  3 add some new stuff like the dark areas that you have to light up or a crusher that chases you but its still either nothing new to 2d sonic or just not really fitting also yes 3 acts why are we doing this 2 levels per area is the perfect number for a 2d platformer one for introduction of new things and another for making them challenging with slight twists theres a reason why no other sonic after the first one did this

speaking of early installment oddities coming back from the first game heres the part that this review started from as a completionist and an achievement hunter i feel like sonic 4 was specifically designed to torment a person like me getting all the chaos emeralds is some sorta sisyphus ordeal play the same stage over and over to enter a special stage that you never feel like you begin to master since theyre much like the dreaded sonic 1 special stages except they have a time limit you spin the level yourself while trying to not get dizzy from the trippy kaleidoscopelike background meanwhile the bumpers are creatures of chaos that send you flying wherever until you get kicked out of the stage so then you replay the same tedious and unpleasant regular level to try again and again and again and again all this after actually beating the game in like 30 minutes this would still be tedious but at least bearable in a better game but since this is sonic 4 its a chore its a job sega should pay people by hour for playing this

i did manage to beat everything though 90 luck 10 skill and a 100 reason to tell you not to bother theres no secret ending or whatever for unlocking super sonic instead he goes so fast and jumps so high that it feels like youre breaking the game  and in several instances i fell into a death pit since i flew right over all the springs and badniks so there was nothing to bounce me onto the correct path a pinnacle of game design wow speaking of that the homing attack itself something made for 3d games to reliably manouver in a 3d environment with early 3d game controls haha i cant even is a mess too this thing tends to be unreliable in most sonic games where it appears but here it feels like a quick time event come to think of it its inclusion and execution here makes most of the game feel like one big qte youre pavlovs dog and the homing attacks audio cue is the ringing bell and sometimes it just breaks gaining speed relies a lot on the midair throw aka the thok too since the physics here suck in general

oooh and the music i respect jun senoue i really do shadow the hedgehog probably has my favorite video game ost as clunky as the actual game is but you go back you listen to music from the actual genesis sonic games then you go back to sonic 4 and tell me this is good as nightdive made the acclaimed quake 2 remaster they later explained how much work it was to make the game feel as it did in 98  back when we still werent aware of how good games can really get  with some subtle fixes here and there to make it as our nostalgia sees it cool sonic 4 does the opposite of that itll make you think the old sonic games sounded horrible but no its just this one some of the melodies themselves are cool 13 feels very senoue but the production value throws any merit to that out the window

i dont know what sort of idiot demon of lunacy possessed me to add this game to my library just to sit there and mock me this product is not a game in that it does not feel designed as entertainment as something you have fun with its a soulless corporate barf that sticks a middle finger at longtime fans smugly safe in knowing people will eventually continue to buy it just like i did be smarter than me and stick to the good sonic games this one is completely irrelevant anyway

#####

it plays like a cheap sonic knock off 
if you really wanna real 2d sonic game you should save your money and wait for sonic mania

#####

to start this off ive 100 this game and i may not have that much playtime but i can say this the game is not that bad its a lot of fun and its not the worst sonic game by all means but its not the best if youre looking for a good sonic game id say mania that games a lot of fun and its good for me this game is fun but based off of what people say its not good and i dont blame them

#####

this game is like if you vaguely described the original sonic games to someone and then they tried to make a game loosely based on your description sonic is expertly recreated with suction cup feet and the boss music is just an mp3 someone recorded in line at the local carnival just like in the fan favorite sonic 06 there is no momentum whatsoever games in the 80s like super mario bros use played out tropes like that this game abandons all platformer logic and punishes intuition and reflexes im fairly certain adolf hitler is forced to play this in an endless loop in the 10th circle of hell with a copy of sonic boom rise of lyric lodged up his ass to provide him a glimpse of sweet relief between loading screens

tldr sega is a company filled with terrible people who hate fun and this game is proof at least they sent satan a free copy though

#####

my nephew loves this game god rest his soul

#####

after completing this game 100 with all the achievements and losing my mind for 3 hours trying to get the untouchable achievement ive come to the conclusion that i am a masochist but more importantly i think this game really isnt as bad as many make it seem i enjoyed my time with it and if you like sonic or are a fan of the series you probably will too i want to try episode 2 since alot of people say that one is better

#####

yeah they really did terrible on this episode

for starters every zone has either been copied or has no inspiration
splash hill is green hill
casino street is casino night
lost labyrinth is well labyrinth
mad gear is metropolis
and the special stages are just the ones from sonic 1 at least i wont get sick since the board doesnt move automatically
and the not even the bosses have inspiration one having a dick move that kills you instantly at the end of it

second the physics are fucking dogshit you dont even gain speed from rolling down hills thats why dashpads are everywhere

third the game just looks like shit sonic looks like plastic and the png filelike zones do not make up for it

and really it just sucks

#####

this is steam  the game is by sega  in 3 hours it will be 2019

and yet somehow this game requires java

#####

its just ok but it really doesnt deserve all the negative reviews i played through it without collecting all the chaos emeralds in just under 2 hours its a throwback to the original sonic games with the addition of the modern air dash move graphics look a little weird and the control feels a little off at times but it was a decent short romp as the blue hedgehog in more or less classic style the environments are largely based on the original game and the boss fights i believe are all taken directly from some of the old games still worth a play if youre a fan of the classic sonic games and can pick it up cheaply

#####

believe the reviews sonic fans may be deviants but they know the games

this is in no way a sequel it feels like a terrible reboot where theyve rehashed everything from the original without understanding what made it good then the final boss is repeating those rehashes all over again every boss even reused the same unfortunately in this case new forgettable music all the levels are familiar but worse the only thing new are gimmicks that break the flow

it doesnt look good it doesnt feel good it doesnt sound good even if you make a bad sonic game the least you can do is make a banger soundtrack to jam to this has no redeeming qualities its horribly slow it feels like your shoes have been dipped in molasses every time you try to move from a standstill position and the game forces you into that position as often as possible it actively doesnt want you to go fast 

the game heavily relies on the homing attack which was designed out of necessity for a 3d environment the spin dash is next to useless i got stuck in a half pipe for a while trying to spin dash my way out when i realised you can use your molasses shoes to slowly walk up a 90 degree wall 

just look at the achievements as of the time of writing this 775 of players completed the first act of the first zone and 495 of players beat the first boss theres less than 10 minutes of gameplay between those two achievements and its already lost that many players the game is over in less than 2 hours and only 11 of players got there

#####

sonic the hedgehog is such a simple concept yet its amazing that there are so many games starring the speedy rodent that completely miss the mark by now were all familiar with legendary missteps like sonic 2k6 sonic boom and shadow the hedgehog the game then there are other games like sonic unleashed sonic  the black knight sonic heroes and so on and so forth its like sega isnt interested in having sonic games be aboutwelljust running fast and jumping on stuff there needs to be a hundred dozen gimmicks special abilities shitty friendstm and dramatic gamedesign changes

i dont know whats best for sonic i just know what i like my favorite games are the 16bit titles sonic generations and bits  pieces of the other 3d games havent played enough of colors to form an opinion on that youre probably thinking he likes the earlier games it must be nostalgia maybe it is so whats a better way to play on my nostalgia than by making a sonic 4 for starters they shouldve just done nothing at all

episode 1 is comprised of 4 zones with three acts apiece 7 special stages and five boss battles its a tad on the lean side i guess but it overstays its welcome very early on the first thing that sticks out to me is the poor leveldesign splash hill zone is very messy with a lot of walls springs and corridors it feels awfully claustrophobic for a zone that supposedly takes place outside casino street zone is mostly just flashing lights and things to bounce off of the second act features a ton of cards that can be flipped for bonus lives thats all i can remember about it 

lost labyrinth zone is where i was stunned to silence act 1 features silly boulder balancing and not much else act 2 has sonic running around in near complete darkness with only a torch to guide his way there are also a couple cruddy mine cart sections why would sonic team create an act where players cant see much of anything when the concept is thoroughly flawed no implementation can save it all i can remember of act 3 is these weird rooms sonic is trapped underwater and the room has to be tilted but not too quickly or else hell get impaled on spikes this is just no good no darn good

mad gear zone is a ripoff of metropolis zone i knew i was going to be in for a good time because metropolis zone is my least favorite in sonic 2 somehow sonic team managed to make it more annoying with a bunch of mantis robots exploding starfish and grinding gears by this time i just wanted it all to end

the final zone is merely a bossrush followed by a climatic encounter straight out of sonic 2 eggman mixes it up a bit with the boss having a second form and a last ditch final attack its the hardest part of the game though i probably died more times on the first act of lost labyrinth apparently you cant use the dpad on the boulders its analog or fall off and die

the special stages are supposedly based on sonic 1 except with all of the simplistic wonderment and unique design stripped out ever play the arcade game cameltry you maneuver a ball by rotating a maze its a really fun game sonic 4s bonus stages are the same way except with all the fun stripped out worst of all theres this horrible lullaby that sounds like it came from an infants toy sonic 4 suffers from uncharacteristically awful music and the special stage tune is the cherry on top

the most damning thing i can say about sonic 4 is that all it does is poorly rip off its superior prequels if youre familiar with those games youll recognize everything that happens here youre seeing all of the same stuff except its poorly arranged with terrible physics sloppy controls while looking and sounding positively ghastly this is a title specifically made to cash in on gamers like me who are nostalgic for the early games before ridiculous anime plots and halfbaked concepts became the norm sega loves to sell their entire sonic steam library for a pittance so you probably already own this game

its evil dont touch it

sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 is the direct sequel to sonic  knuckles which in its own right evolved from sonic the hedgehog 3 why not sonic 5 you may be thinking a good question the next block of text will get those interested in crash course style up to speed the rest may scroll to paragraph four

watch episode 1 and 2 gameplay here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5sdweueyfs

the 16bit sounds of yesteryear may have made way for more modern techniques the simplicity  and therefore also the recognisability  has been left almost unchanged this in perfect harmony with the graphic style still that rainbowrival color palette and lustful use of basic shapes  but with four layers of depth a hefty chunk of polygonal work and fully in hd
the story itself just builds on that of sonic  knuckles not that anyone will lose any sleep over it you simply dont play sonic for its epic storyline and tension
although the game plays as smoothly as its 16yearold predecessor some details in the mechanics have changed since sonic 3  knuckles most notable is sonics homing attack
another change can be found in the momentum of that spiny mammal when sonic stops walking he effectively stops walking as if transfixed this change is a lot less obvious and to be honest i was very skeptical about this change in the beginning it felt awkward and didnt match the urge to follow the laws of physics so truthfully a few zones later however it starts to dawn omitting the friction factor gives you a lot more control over your hedgehog its the equivalent of the logic of why you shouldnt blast through the amazon with a bugatti veyron the main reason seems to me that the developers wanted to make the game more accessible something that also seeps into other aspects of the game
an old concept in a new guise without the developers taking it easy

#####

after having this game on some sort of platform for 7 years had it on wiiware first i can honestly say i wonder why i liked playing this so much  levels arent that good or inspired gameplay has zilch in the momentum department sonic looks like hes been dipped in shellac  its among the few sonic games i dont care for that much  id only really play it any more if i decide to marathon through all the games again

there are plenty of other sonic platformers on steam  sonic 1 sonic 2 sonic cd sonic 3  knuckles sonic adventure dx sonic adventure 2 sonic generations sonic 4 episode ii sonic lost world and sonic mania  all of them are much better than this sad excuse

h1urghh1
bisonic the hedgehog 4  episode 1ib is a 2d platformer attempting to recapture the simplicity and feel of the franchises sega genesisera games in a more modern package
h3describing how it looks confusing and confusedh3
the opening animation suggests that this title is more of a homage than a direct sequel to the 2d sonic trilogy already things are going wrong when the fingershake animation looks choppy and uncanny stage environment graphics are muddy and lowresolution with the opening levels backdrops resembling cheap bitmaps

during gameplay youre treated to the odd sight of sonic and the enemies  despite being modelled and animated in 3d  having this celshaded filter which only results in loss of detail and significant aliasing sonic himself seemingly glides on the ground as his walking and running animations are too slow to match the speed he travels at
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2575645655
no crashes or stability issues on my iryzen 9 3900x 64gb ram gtx 1070ti windows 10i system at 1440p the game runs at a locked 60fps actual settings are very barebones with the most youll get in the launcher being resolution a fullscreen toggle and changing your input methods while ingame you only have basic sound sliders to fiddle with said launcher also requires the installation of java which is peculiar
h3synthesized disasterh3
the soundtrack exists thats all the praise it deserves entirely done with synth instruments it features weak progression poor basstreble and is overall highly repetitive an example in its own right is the boss battle track which id sooner liken to a circus park theme quite fitting in an ironic fashion

at least the remaining sounds are not nearly as bad just the recognizable and still enjoyable sonic effects library of yore if only the diversity of foley were higher id consider this the sole strong suit of the audio component  if not the entire game
h3what could possibly go wrongh3
the gameplay formula seems simple enough momentumbased platforming in the vein of the sonic games on the sega genesis bisonic the hedgehog 4  episode 1ib simultaneously fails to meaningfully be its own unique experience and to be a worthy successor to the trilogy its paying homage to 

the blue hedgehogs own physics have an unpleasant degree of vagueness noticeable from the moment you first control him he accelerates slowly from a standstill but is still capable of scaling vertical walls with only a bit of runup and a halfpipe he also displays an alarming propensity to straighten back onto his feet from a rolling spin thus making himself an easy target for any enemies in his path the homing attack is a poorly implemented addition to his moveset both due to its very short attack range and the fact it also uncurls him from his spin attack unfair loss of rings lives and patience may ensue

by far the worst part of the primary loop is the field of view somehow for a title designed for widescreencapable consoles and portable devices its extremely claustrophobic this means sonic will crash into hazards that the player simply cannot see let alone react to on the first or seventh playthrough over 
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2575645027
h3blind leaps of faithh3
flowing green hills sparkling casino cities treacherous sunken caverns and oshauncompliant industrial parks none of this games stages elevate themselves past looking and playing like bootleg variants of sonic 1 and 2 the level design is seemingly done on a grid which keeps their traversal monotonous as youll go through the same halfpipes and slopes all throughout this title players may particularly grow tired of the rows of flying enemies all neatly lined up as an excuse to justify the homing attacks existence at the very least its the only time it works as intended

each zone features some kind of unique gimmick such as flipping platforms swinging vines ridable minecarts and torchbased puzzles at their best theyre unspectacular and dont make up for the deficient level design at their worst they grind the already unsteady pace to a halt with more cheap deaths the games difficulty oscillates between being way too easy and unfairly hard sonics general emphasis on speed turns at odds with the platforming that slowly demands increasing precision and tighter timing

in spite of that extra lives are highly abundant by the end of my first playthrough i was sitting at 35 extra lives  even on the hardest of levels i burned through only six and such losses can be recouped within the next act a second complete playthrough rewarded me with twice as many 
h3boisterous and boring villain does nothingh3
dr eggman steps in once more to fill the shoes of the bad guy to kick the crap out of in his four regular appearances the villain retreats after sustaining eight hits defeated and toonishly charred in his mech curiously all of the doctors machinations are plain rehashes of the franchises first boss fights just with alternate panic phases added when damaged sufficiently even if one looks past the lack of originality the sheer tedium of the fights cannot be ignored it says a lot about their presentation and engagement factor when theyre over and done within two minutes

for the most part anyway

the final stage is a boss rush against the previous eggmans mechs moderately less durable but otherwise completely unchanged at the end of this comes the actual final boss iyet another giant bipedal mechi as seen in sonic 2 this sonofagun has unreasonably high health his attacks have almost no tell and for two thirds of the fight the robot is unable to be harmed at all his final attack shatters the playing field and spells certain doom if you dont land the killing blow on him in time miss the window time to spend another ten or so minutes just on this rustbucket
h3like a fever dreamh3
annoyance still lingers special stages are accessible once sonic finishes a nonboss act with at least 50 rings in hand the player is supposed to rotate the entire psychedelic playing set  an easy path to complete disorientation or even nausea  and lead the spinning hedgehog to the emerald hidden somewhere within the maze 

later special stages include harsher time limits and ring requirements to pass through barriers these play terribly no thanks to dubious collision physics and aggravating obstacle placement in another stroke of irony the singular music track playing throughout resembles a lullaby  so if it wont make your blood boil itll put you to sleep
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2575643502
each zone has three regular acts plus one for the boss given the presence of only four acts five with the bossrush and in spite of all frustrations a first playthrough is unlikely to extend beyond three hours for even a beginner leaderboards are available in either score attack or time attack formats which can provide a welcome incentive to keep replaying the levels

collecting all seven chaos emeralds may take an hour extra such a feat unlocking the nowexpected super sonic with nearly doubled jump height and so much speed and acceleration that he can glide up steep inclines from a standstill theres a small sense of catharsis in beating the game as him 

unfortunately a cool golden hedgehog is still subject to poor level design and sleepinducing bosses

h3this is truly worse than you imaginedh3

iunsightly presentation vague physics and horrid design utterly fails at being a worthy entry into the franchise bavoidbi

after playing up to the final zone i can say that i definitely dont recommend this game i went in with zero expectations cause i know people especially sonic fans have a tendency to blow small flaws out of proportion but the game genuinely does not feel good to play the physics are extremely janky the music sounds like it was scraped off the newgrounds audio portal the special stages decided to reuse sonic 1s special stage you know the most hated one and make it worse with a time limit and ring gates the level design is really bad ive never been a fan of sonics level design but like look at this

httpsyoutubecomclipugkxn2rfzvklh0hpnm6yfpsteybyhzgftyx0

this section has you spinning the level while in water to make a block get spit out but i could not understand this puzzle when i was doing it at the moment the block is spit out one of two things happen and there is no rhyme or reason it just happens arbitrarily 1 you get spit out and make progress 2 you take damage and get knocked back even deeper into the water and the plug replugs the hole i always hated the labyrinth levels in sonic games but this just takes the cake

one redeeming factor is that you have a level select where you can retry levels so you can if you have the patience get all 7 emeralds to change 3 seconds of the ending and maybe get super sonic idk im not gonna bother you can also level select the special stages but only after you beat them so its useless if youre emerald grinding since you have to rebeat an act with 50 rings anyway to even get to the stage theres also an extremely stupid and grindy achievement for getting 100 lives which isnt hard to do you can just replay 11 over and over again and get 2 lives per run but do you really want to grind a level 50 times for an achievement thats obnoxiously tedious

if you are a sonic fan you will hate this game if you like me are not a sonic fan you will find this game very midtier and frustrating and janky spend your 10 on something more fun i have no opinion on episode 2 yet i hope its better than this

#####

i dont often review like this but this game is fucking dogshit the level design is trash the movement is very momentum based but it feels sluggish and delayed like im playing a 20fps game at 60fps this is heavily emphasised with levels with movingdropping platforms over bottomless pits and the boss rush at the end is absolute garbage to even pass with checkpoints one interesting thing that it does is include a homing attack but its too bad its implemented just as poorly as the rest of the game the music is good but thats about it somehow this game retains all the negatives of previous 2d sonic games and just adds a bunch more the main one being that you can often get blasted by something you cant see yet which is an impressive feat considering how fucking slow sonic moves in this game even when youre techdashing around 

its honestly embarrassing that sega ever released this ive played a handful of bottom of the barrel indie platformers that still felt better than this

#####

i liked this game wave of downvotes all i have to say is  you like 90s sonic games  you should try it you like modern sonic games you should try it i have no strong opinion on the graphism but the soundtrack is once again awesome the difficulty is perfectly balanced but it suddenly become sofa king hard during the final boss act

h1sonic 4 plays like a low quality and lifeless mobile gameh1
and thats because it is im not going to be blaming my numerous problems with sonic 4 on that fact i just find it incredibly funny plain and simple sonic 4 isnt good i think the fact that its a game ive never seen anyone religiously defend speaks volumes about its quality ive seen people defend boom forces shadow the hedgehog even 06 but the most i can get out of anyone with sonic 4 is that they liked it theres a good reason sonic 4 is no ones favorite sonic game

id like to say sonic 4 follows the classic sonic style formula youd think they would especially because its a numbered sonic title and it only half commits to it the game is in 2d but it uses modern sonic and his mechanics in the game the homing attack specifically is so out of place it was originally designed as a necessity in the 3d games and allowed for unique movement through timed button presses but in sonic 4 it just replaces the fact that youd jump on enemies i know badniks arent known for their difficulty but giving the player a skillless instakill on every enemy really doesnt help the level design is absolutely horrid too remember when sonic games had unique areas every level in this game is a reskin of another level from a classic sonic game splash hill zone is green hill casino streets is the hundredth casino level in the franchise and lost labyrinth is labyrinth zone generations and mania did the same thing but at least those games were both interesting and brought new things to the table and the new level mechanics dont fit sonics gameplay why would i want limited vision in a game where im supposed to go at the speed of sound lost labyrinth is host to most of the worst parts of this game the aforementioned torch mechanic the balancing balls you roll on and the stupid minecarts are all so jarring that i ended up hating every single one of them the torch puzzle especially wasted so much of my time that im never going to get back bosses are on the quality of sonic cd bosses arguably worst as the first and last bosses are both reused from older games oh and the final level isnt an actual zone its a boss gauntlet so those boring boss fights really overstay their welcome every gameplay element is somehow terrible and over half of them being recycled solidifies my opinion that sonic 4 has terrible gameplay

related to the gameplay but i feel like it deserves its own segment the controls the top speed in this game is equivalent to that of a mother pushing a baby carriage i feel confident in saying that sonic 4s sonic is one of the slowest in the franchise i feel like im dragging a metal rod across the stage not the fastest thing alive and the developers knew this because of the constant spam of boost pads in every stage even breaking your speed has been removed coming to a sudden stop at max speed or minimal speed makes no difference sonic will stop right there and then immediately the iconic spindash has also been nerfed into oblivion you build up so little speed from it that i barely ended up using it throughout the entire game and every form of challenging platforming is gone because now you can just air dash to anywhere so many of the problems presented in sonic 4 are patched up with an infinite get out of jail free card with the air dash and homing attack without those two moves the game feels like a slog and with them the game feels like its playing itself its not easy describing bad controls but sonic 4 feels clunky and automated at the same time

also the art style is so jarring in sonic 4 every part of this game just looks horrendous sonic especially his model looks like the cutscene model from sonic heroes with a drastically lower poly count his fur is so smooth and solid it looks like hes made out of plastic its honestly one of sonics worst appearances in the entire series the enemies are another perfect example that this game is just ugly they all use these 3d models that do not clash well with the 2d environments almost every robot has giant googly eyes attached to them too and that just makes things much worse the death egg robot also returns again with its worst design yet i find that the issues i have with the art and designs in sonic 4 come from the fact that they made a lot of the same mistakes pokemon did when transitioning to 3d instead of altering the initial design or working from the ground up the developers just took a 2d sprite and made it 3d well hopefully the soundtrack is alright i mean even bad sonic games are known for their soundtracks but i cant say the same for sonic 4 the most memorable song is the boss theme and thats because its annoying not because its good i would comment more on the soundtrack but i cannot remember any of the songs after i stopped hearing them in game
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2566015778 
and now for a bunch of final notes on the game that dont really have enough detail to be their own paragraph why is the game episodic nothing carries over from the two episodes other than you get to play as metal sonic if you own both all it does is make you buy the game twice and collect all the chaos emeralds again which is a painful process in its own right also why do i have to install java to run this game its so jarring to see a steam release force a java installation to me especially in 2021 on another note the camera was really zoomed in on sonic making it so the player cant see incoming hazards easily and it also forced me to look at that hideous sonic model in all its horrendous detail

breally though dont play sonic 4 if you really want to experience it just watch a youtube playthrough please i highly recommend watching cybershells video on this game as a lot of my problems with sonic 4 were mentioned in it and theres even more issues that i learned about through it like the physics surprised i never got that sonic standing upright on a wall myself theres even a very detailed coverage of episode 2 in it as well overall sonic 4 episode 1 is fittingly a 110 i fail to see any merit in this game and the only upside it has is that its playable which could be a downside if you think about itb

#####

i went into sonic 4 episode 1 expecting to hate it at first i did i saw all the nostalgia theyre trying to recreate the feeling old sonic levels with new technology and graphics it felt like there was nothing new the more i played the more it felt like there was a freshness to the old 2d platforming of sonic for those who have never played the old sonic games they are labyrinth levels that you need to make it to the end along the way you collect rings these rings let you take damage without dying the rings go spraying everywhere when you get hit if you have no rings you will die when you get hit the game is single player only and offers controller or keyboard support that you setup out of game

it feels the same as the original games and not much has changed control wise there is still one button controls the one button will make you jump while youre standing or running if you hold down and push the jump button you will perform a spin dash when you let go of the down when you are running you can press down to roll into a ball to kill enemies new to the series is what i feel is a game changer a mid air lock on dash just hit the jump button in mid air and sonic will immediately dart to whatever he has targeted usually the closest enemy spring board or item box this is a game changer because it adds constant momentum that is easy and more efficient than a spin dash that takes a second or so just jump and dart in mid air its easy and efficient not just that but attacking enemies in the air turns into platforming it feels like a lot less time wasted gaining momentum with this new mechanic i can see why tails wasnt included in this first episode

the game looks great it has detailed backgrounds and bright vibrant colors there are four main areas each with three levels and a boss fight each area has a theme from a previous sonic game there is no new territory consider it a best of rather than a new album with that said sonic 4 takes them in interesting new directions every so often unique to sonic 4 one level features a lot of cannons that sonic can hop in and control where he shoots out another level has sonic in a mine cart and keeping his balance on rolling boulders youll see sonic in the dark carrying a torch lighting things on the wall to open doors and activate platforms it all feels fresh even if it steps away from the genesis there are still classic sonic tropes like using pinball flippers bouncing off bumpers going through loops swinging from vines using zip lines sonic advance and so on  there are a few moments of going underwater while underwater sonic just moves slower he cant actually swim

the items feel limited to the ones found in sonic 1 and 2 you can get temporary invincibility ten rings an extra life super speed shoes and a bubble shield that lets sonic take an extra hit

even with only 4 areas to visit there are still 13 levels not including boss fights each level is around five minutes to complete i hate to say it but it feels like a full length sonic game even if this is only episode 1 it runs around the three hour mark the boss fights evoke nostalgia their patterns are like the original games but they add new twists

sonic 4 does a good job of utilizing sonics speed a lot of the previous 2d games had you go at your own pace but sonic 4 has you chased by boulders crushing walls running after dr robotnik in boss fights these reasons for sonic to run feel engaging more than typical exploring the levels it offers a variety

since you are collecting rings if you complete the level and have more than 50 rings youll see a giant ring to jump into that sends you to the bonus stage even the bonus stage feels good its a take off of the original sonic 1 bonus stage but this time you get to control the rotation of the level while sonic is just stuck in a ball there are barriers that need coins to pass through at the end of each bonus stage is a chaos emerald

as you progress you will unlock levels and areas as you progress so if you get stuck on a level you can skip it after each level it gives you a choice to jump to the next unfinished level that just feels odd while its helpful to have level selection id much rather progress to the next level instead of getting asked

while this might be a departure from the old sonic games it adds new life to what was a stale franchise if you include the genesis and gameboy advance platformers the challenge feels good its more difficult than the other old school games

#####

okay i wont even rant about the fact this should never be called sonic 4 to begin with it shouldve been called sonic mobile like the beta name and should have sticked as an iosandroid game and ported sonic 12s remake on steam instead

the physics graphisms and even the musics are bad the level design is very linear theres only 4 levels which are all available on the go for no reasons i prefer a postgame level select like in sonic 3knuckles and they are just reskin of old levels from previous sonic games

anyway everybody should play episode 2 instead or even better go buy mania the true sequel to the classic titles it even has tails and knuckles playable unlike this game

finally this really tells how dimps has become bad and sega has made this game for nostalgia sadly im really hoping there would be an official sonic 4 remake made with the mania engine but thats hopeless

#####

physics whats that sonic 4 devs

#####

quite literally one of the worst platformers ive ever played and a very soulless mobile game using a legacy name to drive up units say what you will about most of the recent sonic games but ive never felt like my soul was getting sucked out with most of the other games in the series only positive i can really give s4 is i like the idea of playable metal sonic just play sonic mania

#####

cheap mobile game tier mixed with infuriating design decisions anything fun to be found in this game has been been done better in other sonic games i only own it since i got it in a sonic humble bundle just play mania instead and forget this exists

#####

sonic mania is the true sonic 4  go play that instead

#####

sonic fans are used to disappointment there are endless titles that prove this point so much so youd be forgiven for thinking that by now the pain of yet another mediocre entry is hardly noteworthy yet to think this would be to miss the point for its really never the game itself that causes the heartbreak the real killer is the crushing of the hopes and dreams that have inevitably built up beforehand with announcement trailers and screenshots promising something incredible we dare to dream and then time and reality cruelly seep in to whisk everything away in the manner one would tease a cat with a piece of string such was the case with sonic 4  its the 2d sequel youve been waiting for sega cried theres no weird 3d gameplay no extra characters  just pure platforming action the jubilation was almost palpable parades were ready to fill the streets and then  episode one finally arrived the string was bluntly pulled away and this is what remains

and oh dear i sincerely dont know where to start explaining how sloppy and frustrating an experience this proves to be the only logical choice seems to be to start with the first thing to draw the eye the visuals to be reasonable most of whats on show here is entirely passable  neither outstanding nor offensive  where the oddity arises is sonic himself for he has ended up looking well downright iweirdi   his model is oddly unrefined lacking crispness and awkwardly contrasting with the background he also possesses a peculiar sheer to his person which can only be described as if hes had a fight with several layers of floor polish and lost miserably  the same issues plague robotnik although to a lesser extent and for all i tried to shake them off as a mere odd design choice and nothing else doing so proves impossible its incredibly jarring every time you take a moment to stare at it again

h1a screeching halth1

this is only the tip of the iceberg however as youll soon realise when you take your first steps forward  this is when the games biggest problem manifests itself  the fact that this mutant sonics physics and momentum are essentially broken everything feels as if youre moving through treacle killing off any sense of speed and making climbing any incline from a slow start an infuriating process decide to stop moving during midjump and the effect proves instantaneous making you plummet like a stone even doing the same thing over and over creates wildly unpredictable results one attempt to kill an enemy and land safety may prove a breeze while another can see you inexplicably fly past the droid and down the nearest bottomless pit nothing ends up making the slightest bit of sense

coupled with this is a choice of level design that feels downright vindictive there are so many occasions where enemies and traps suddenly appear in front of you without warning basically in a constant attempt to raise your blood pressure its made worse by the fact the game seems frequently aware that its doing this every level seems to end with a checkpoint post that precedes a miniature death course that seems imbalanced towards forcing your defeat and thats not even taking into consideration the fact youre still wrestling with the physics which are constantly lurking in the background ready to screw up your final jump to safety in an array of wild and impossible to predict manners 

h1dismal designsh1

if the levels arent trying to kill you at the very least theyre trying to make you as miserable as possible this depressing aura seems to be consistently present in some shape or form but really comes to a head in one zone where everything starts off pitch black and you have to clumsily light the way forward its not exactly the most stimulating thing ever to begin with but then you become trapped in a small area the only escape coming from carefully lighting a set of torches in the right order and with the right timing in short its a slow laborious puzzle iin a sonic gamei get through that and whats your reward the next level to spring up the words underwater maze escape which sounds like the worst idea ever even before you throw in all the other problems at times it honestly feels as is episode one was not only made by people who didnt understand the essence of the sonic series but actively set out to work against it its downright baffling

is there any silver lining to all of this not really some of the music is pleasing enough to the ear i guess but even then most of it takes the form of a 10 second melody thats simply placed on a constant loop thats no exaggeration by the way  theyre literally 10 seconds long secondly even though its clearly marked as episodic this is a title that still feels ridiculously short  it took me about three hours to complete and im not even kidding when i say a third of that alone was spent trying to beat the absurdly difficult final boss collecting the chaos emeralds is there to try and boost the play time but seriously i just didnt want to in many ways its briefness ended up proving a mercy 

its damning to say but honestly i kind of wish i has the same issue with running this title on pc as others have had because then i could have saved myself from this mental torture ive played many a dud sonic title but i cant think of any that have ever made me as infuriated and disheartened as this one has sonic mania exists nowadays go and play that just stay well away from this

no sex and bad game

dont waste your time with this title  get sonic mania instead 

it didnt take long at all for me to realize i didnt like sonic 4 ep 1 although it could be argued that i didnt give the game a fair chance i think good games often put their best foot forward  the first level of sonic 4 was not fun to play and i was confident that the experience would not improve 

given the name i felt that this game should have played like sonic 12 and 3 albeit with more modern graphics if thats the direction they wanted to go but the dev team clearly mishandled the project sonics movements feel slow and sluggish and the game incorporates the homing attack from the 3d games which doesnt work well in the 2d environment takes all skill out of the platforming and combat 

the music of sonic games has never been a huge deal for me but the sound of this game just seemsoffit has all of the sonicish sounds and musical style but it just seems bad in a way that im too inarticulate to describe properly 

even at a super cheap price or free i feel like playing this game would be a waste of time that could be better spent on more worthy titles

#####

this game does exactly what it set out to do and nothing more to satiate the thirst fans of the franchise crying out for a return to the original trilogy what is still considered to be one of the best games to date by many but the mark is missed by a want to set the game apart 

the visuals are adequate and pleasing but are not remarkable or noteworthy it looks like a derivative cash in on sonic the hedgehog 2s success yet manages to be less inspiring while vibrant and varied it still somehow manages to feel soulless on top of that the characters themselves seem to have a cell shaded sheen to them that clashes with the rest of the game and ends up looking awkward

controls are different from the original games this title was meant to bank on in order to keep momentum one must hold in the direction you intend to run in the spin dash does not gain traction and ends up being the worse option to gain speed in the long run its only useful for a short burst if youre looking not to get hit by enemies which by the way seem to be quite scarce and poorly placed otherwise the homing attack happens to be your best choice for a speed boost the stages themselves though did feel decently designed and were loyal to the original genesis games i myself ended up finding more enjoyment in the special stages though

for the audio much of sound effects and it almost felt like the soundboard itself was lifted from sonic the hedgehog 2 this would have been awesome if the music wasnt so forgettable nothing truly outstanding unlike the game from which inspired all its audio 

true i have been quite negative but dont take that as a reason not to play this game its still a decent experience worth giving a try once you get past the different controls you can enjoy the game much like you would in the original genesis titles if you go into this knowing its not those games but instead a game on its own inspired but not completely copied you can find enjoyment in playing it

#####

the final zone with like 4 impossible boss fights can eat my long and moist dump

#####

not good momentum feels absolutely terrible and the stages not enjoyable final boss is possibly the least fun ive had in a sonic game

ubquick reviewbu
sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 is a 2d platformer developed by sonic team and released jan 19 2012 sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 was supposed to be the successor to the generally beloved sonic the hedgehog 3 and knuckles igenerally because theres always that one guyi

httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid838981357

ubdetailed breakdown reviewbu
bstoryb theres no story really some people will be very pleased to hear theres no dialogue you dont hear eggman or sonic speak you dont see any characters other then sonic its just sonic chasing down eggman whos back to his old tricks turning the woodland creatures into robots

actually its borderline literally back to his old tricks because were back in green hills as the first 3 levels then boss and the boss is exactly the same as the first sonic boss with the wrecking ball and two platforms on my nolstalgia oh my heart 3
httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid840224015

bgameplayb the controls are beautifuly simple movement using directional keys or controller directional pad and then pressing a button to jump or holding down and pressing  a button to spin dash or pressing down while moving to go into ball form

the change in this rendition is the physics have been updated or wrecked depending on whom you ask i didnt care and didnt notice anything but ive never been very good at sonic games so this is coming from someone who just barely beats the game but rarely gets the complete ending by getting all the chaos emeralds iexcept for sonic 2 music chemical plant zone that level still gives me flash backs and is part of the reason im scared of wateri ii wish i was jokingi

the biggest change for me was the new homing attack feature i feel like its useful but often times too slow paced for sonic iwhom is supposed to go faaaaaaasti but while a bit slow i thought it was better then relying on my pinpointjumpingskills because those died when i stopped playing platformers every single day

regarding the levels and content of sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 there are 5 worlds each with 3 levels then a boss level after completing a score level you can replay it in time attack mode and then compare times with your friends is what id say if any of my friends had scores iwhat the heck ben i would have thought my brother who loves sonic games would have high scores alreadyi

bconclusionb to put it simply sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 was exactly what i was expecting going into it i wasnt remotely disappointed

however i would say that any of the classic sega sonic games 1 2 3 and knuckles is better then this one sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 wasnt as bad as many of the 3d games released for the ps2 and gamecube and certainly could have been worse you want to complain about bad physics go look at sonic 06

honestly at this point who knows what sonic fans even want i doubt they themselves know what they want some may agree with me some might right nasty messages on my wall regardless i like sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 see you in episode 2 ilooks like thats where tails has been hidingi

im atratzu and i approve this review

#####

i want to die

#####

i paid nothing for this game but the time i lost while playing it makes me want my nonexistent money back

#####

this game looks terrible and the physics are inconsistent the special stages are the god awful ones from sonic 1 except you have control over the background this time it just makes everything worse to be honest the music is not too great either do not purchase this game
edit apparently this game still runs in the background when you close it you have to go to task manager and look for sonic_visexe in the background processes to close it

#####

the long awaited sequel to the original trilogy of megadrive  genesis games
taking a page from the new super mario handbook on rebooting a classic gameplay formula except seemingly missing everything about what made the original games so great in the first place
the physics are janky sonic moves like hes drunk momentum straight up doesnt exist  the list goes on

avoid this one if you can  and if you cant at least wait until its on sale 
i feel like sega should have paid me to play this not the other way around

#####

to play this game java is required this game is not playable with a controller at least not with the controller i used and the controll settings are aweful

#####

get sonic mania or origins instead

#####

who can forget the exemplary levels this game has graced with which such classics as
notgreen hill zone
notcasino night zone
notlabyrinth zone
and finally notmetropolis zone 

is anything in this game even an original idea 
card effects on notcasino night zone were pretty cool but not enough to save this dumpster fire

#####

what did you like best about sonic 2 was it the original varied and yet level design the clever bosses that never repeated an idea the game design which is involved and challenging but still only uses one button well you better go play sonic 2 and 3 then because this steaming pile of refuse does the exact opposite of everything i mentioned

the sonic sprite is rendered with a shader to have only the three tones of blue in his sonic 3 sprites that clashes with everything else in the game including other images of sonic which are shown with normal shaders

the art design is recycled from previous games wholesale with tweaks to upscale it believably to modern resolutions and i dont mean like sonic 2s emerald hill zone compared to green hill zone splash hill zone straight up lifted the tileset from emerald hill and there isnt a single new enemy desgin until you get to the third zone

the boss designs are also copied shamelessly from the megadrive games i will grant sega that there is purpose in revisiting the classic ball and chain robotnik from green hill zone act 3 as it is one of the most iconic bosses from that era of gaming i vocally sighed when i saw the boss of casino street zone just what you think it is with a twinge of carnival night was the neon claw robotnik from casino night act 2

if thats not bad enough they completely missed the point of the bosses as well oldschool sonic bosses were great in how they were a quiz of the mechanics taught in the zone with ball and chain you had to have paitence and basic use of the platform to reach robotnik and avoid damage claw forced you to use the spin dash to go up the walls to avoid him grabbing you and sucking out your rings both of the aforementioned things can be completely ignored with the basic application of the homing attack begging their inclusion at all they do go into a different and new attack pattern after 5 hits but why not do something fully original if thats your goal

the addition of the homing attack adds nothing to the game other than removing any semblance of game design based challenge based upon platforming there is still plenty of hard work to do though fighting the incredibly buggy awful physics it is possible to walk around a loop with no momentum and puzzles

yes i said puzzles someone that developed this idea thought that placing a puzzle that completely forced you to a stop until you light up a specific set of torches that lowers a wall to allow you to continue in a franchise where speed and flow are paramount was a good idea

do not buy this game for any reason the fact that it was ever considered shippable is insulting if you want a good modern sonic game vote with your wallet for generations

#####

this game feelsderivative at best its essentially a fancreated flash game by someone who played sonic on the game gearonceand then suffered major brain damage and tried to recreate their experience

#####

ugly lazy barely any content the content thats there is either boring or terrible sonic controls like megaman to the point where if you dont hold a direction while being launched out of a cannon or minecart youll drop like a rock the music tries to sound like a genesis and succeeds in all the worst ways an allaround unpleasant experience really

#####

buy sonic mania instead

#####

the sequel fans have waited 16 years for is finally here

ha hahahha 

i dont believe this game is entirely a godawful mess like most of folks in the fandom tout it to be the game is fun to play but i am disgusted by the title of it nothing about it is original with the exception of questionabledecent gimmicks in act 2 and 3 of each respective zone 


nonetheless it doesnt take away the fact its a soulless cash grab and as a sequel to sonic 3 knuckles one of the greatest platformers of all time this aint it chief

#####

do not buy this game at full price you will regret it but if you find it on sale for like a couple bucks then maybe pick it up um people do not like this game and i can see why all the levels are pretty meh and sonic feels a lil weird to control but it is a sonic game so do what you will with that i like it kinda

#####

this game is infamously bad for a reason tried it myself because saw it in a sale and figured why not

the game was only iokayi in splash hill zone and casino street zone
it then proceeded to fall further apart in lost labyrinth zone and mad gear zone
and just proceeded to  its pants for the final level
the death egg robot is one of the worst bosses ive ever fought it takes so long to kill so long in fact i just gave up i have better uses of my time
also the special stages blow worse than their sonic 1 incarnation you would think rotating as opposed to controlling just sonic would give you more control but sonic is so sensitive floaty and bouncy

im honestly iimpressedi its like this game iactivelyi didnt try to learn from the mistakes of sonic 1 and 2 it not only has 0 original ideas but it makes them worse in the process

green hill but worse
casino night but not as good
labyrinth zone except 5x worse this zone is already hated why was it brought back
metropolis zone except worse see labyrinth
the death egg robot except worse
old 2d physics except worse rolling downhill loses momentum

also sonic looks like absolute trash and this look is completed with the shoddy prerendered tileset

but hey at least i finally satisfied my curiosity and it killed this cat

#####

honestly im on the fence with this game there are aspects that i like however others that make it not fun
firstly the graphics havent aged the best sonic looks pretty bad though i think hes well animated the enemies are fine and the backgrounds are actually full of life
the music while being composed by the legend jun sunoe could be better the drums sound good yet the synth isnt very pleasing honestly i wouldnt have minded if they used different instruments the compositions sound fine but the instrumental choices arent great
time for the rough part the gameplay
sonic is unbearably sluggish and takes way too long to get at full speed even at full speed he isnt too fast also many times it proved that walking up a slope was better than spin dashing spinning in general for gaining speed feels heavily nerfed plus this is made by dimps so expect much automation being flinged into homing attack chains and bottomless pits
one of the most things that boiled my blood were the special stages from sonic 1 which are awful and i hate them a lot plus dimps just loves to put cheap shots at the end of each zone to kill you or hurt you so you dont have enough rings for even entering them
honestly people give this game a lot of hate its not the worst sonic game out there but theres much better id highly recommend getting sonic 3 or mania before even glimpsing at this
and i know about the whole argument people dont like it because the different engine there have been countless of games with different engines that are great installments this though this sadly isnt one


#####

i bought this amazing game for 20 australian cents

#####

my dad walked in and said he was disappointed with me

#####

this game blows

#####

id rather rub 60 grit sandpaper on my balls for 20 minutes

#####

i really dont understand why some people have got a problem with this game and yes i openly confess to being biased this is just a modern take on the 2d classic sonic games of old ive seen a number of complaints about the games physics but ive never had a problem with it and im using the keyboard

the game looks good on my setup runs smoothly and overall provided an enjoyable experience during covid 19 lockdown i have also played this on console

if i have one complaint about this game its that they put a time limit on the special stages the sonic 1 style special stages are tricky enough with time limits

#####

i bought this just for episode metal

those 4 dlc levels are better than this entire game


#####

its the final fantasy 13 of the sonic the hedgehog series is it a good game sure is it a good sonic game nope

#####

go play sonic mania

#####

how to ruin the gameplay of classic sonic and make it uninteresting ask these guys this sonic is hellishly unresponsive due to the broken runspin dash mechanics you have to constantly stop and slow down or there will be a huge chance to bump into the same enemies and traps the level design is mostly just bad collecting all the chaos emeralds is where the real torment is you will suffer for hours with this controls and intermittent opportunities to get to the bonus stages otherwise the game is pretty easy you can collect up to 50 lives in one playthrough 2 hours and spend most of them on the final boss because sometimes sonic takes damage when he shouldnt

#####

awful remake of sonic 2 with half the stages 4

#####

stop it get some help

#####

i hate you

#####

honestly this game is not as bad as people say it is
it has great music interesting levels and fun special stages
its not one of my favourite sonic game but i honestly found it fun

#####

close very close to sonic 2  3 but its missing the responsivess of the earlier games it just feels flat and slugish looks pretty and graphically is true to the originals but the gameplay isnt there

#####

sonic held my family hostage and told me to play this game

#####

im over halfway through the game and ive only played 30 minutes i expected a fullblown sonic game but there are only 4 different stages 3 acts each with the fourth being a 1 minute boss if youre expecting a true sonic game with true sonic mechanics buy sonic mania this game is super clunky most of your deaths will feel cheap because you dont have full control over your character  hes very stiff and so platforming becomes a nightmare the homing attack is cool but hardly works and usually gets yourself killed if youre trying to platform lastly the 3d graphics are very poor and the shadowing is off  cant stress this enough but the 2d sprites look better than this half finished sonic to the customer do not buy at all costs to the developers anyone who helped develop this game should be ashamed of themselves for publishing such utter garbage

#####

the second you start controlling sonic you know something is wrong to make it short it just doesnt have that fluidity and tight physics as previous sonic games did the visuals look alright but this isnt an ideal look for a 2d game everything feels so slow in this game and the boss battles and music are very underwhelming youre better off getting the amazing sonic cd or other 2d sonic games or maybe even waiting for sonic mania

#####

horribly designed levels lead to endless frustration for a game that had potential 

to the games credit the first couple of levels were fun halfway through casino night zone the game soon shows poor design choices in the levels lots of pointless mechanics that just slow the game down and prevent it from being an enjoyable experience

if youre looking for a better 2d sonic experience go with mania

#####

remember those terrible mascot platformer titles that came in the wake of sonic during the 90s that poorly tried to imitate sonic games 

this game is another one of those shallow imitations the only difference being that this one actually features sonic

i was better off not remembering this game existed

#####

is this a real sonic game episode 1 sonic is an episodic story now it feels like a fan game like one of those flash knockoffs especially because of how short it is but im glad that theres not more

the main thing is the flow feels so off and sonic takes so long to start moving again lots of inertia on this little guy supposed to be the fastest thing ever the art style is weird and theres too many gimmicky mechanics all over the final boss is really bad too

#####

first and foremost id like to say id give this game a neutral review if there was such an option but since there isnt ill opt for a thumbs up as it has some redeeming qualities mostly allowing you to play episode metal in episode ii

so where to begin sonic 4 is supposed to be a sequel to the classic sonic games and as a huge fan of them sonic  knuckles was pretty much my first console game i had to get it and when i saw you could actually play as metal sonic in episode ii if you owned both episodes it was an instant purchase as a matter of fact episode ii is so far the only game ive ever preordered however it seems im talking too much about how i got the game and not about the actual game well plain and simple this is a subpar sonic game especially compared to the older titles in particular sonic 3  knuckles which felt huge at the time its rather short with only 4 zones 3 acts  boss fight and theyre all rehashes of zones found in previous sonic games the same goes for the bosses even the final boss feels uninspired especially when compared to the final boss in s3k yes ill talk about that game a lot

as for the soundtrack id like to say it was good but i honestly cant remember a single track whereas theres always a memorable track if  not the whole soundtrack in previous sonic games it feels kinda generic to me another problem with the game is the mechanics mostly when it comes to movement when you start moving sonic walks slowly before accelerating and while hes always walked a bit in previous games the acceleration in this one is slow not to mention it feels like sonics shoes had glue in them since he kind of sticks to the ground or even walls and i guess i should mention the complete lack of momentum which makes sonic suddenly stop mid jump if you stop pressing the movement keys

even then despite all its faults id say i had a fun time with this game i still wouldnt recommend it  on its own only get it if youre a huge sonic fan and want to play episode metal as well

#####

the controls in this game are so clunky for me it was unplayable

#####

pc version is stuck at 720p resolution other than that it runs well

the game itself is ok not as good as the old sonic games but if you liked them you will probably like this despite its flaws

#####

no idea why the game receives so much hate i played the mobile version and liked it so much that i also bought it on pc my only complaint about it is that the hd versions suffer from terrible cellshading but there exists a texture mod which makes the graphics much more enjoyable

#####

so the last time i really played this game was in 2010 i followed clementj64 on youtube back in the day so of course i was excited for this i was only 10 at the time so i had no idea of the controversy this game had back then i also only had a wii so i was stuck with that version of the game until this year i didnt remember really disliking it maybe being a bit bored with the four levels i had i decided to give it another shot see if it was really all that bad

yeah its that bad

first off the physics didnt present too much trouble for me except for this one part in casino street where you have to run out of a ushaped crevice my natural instinct was to spindash up and down the sides to try and gain speed but that just wasnt happening instead it turns out youre supposed to just run up the side thats pretty dumb especially for a sonic game

now the real problem with this game comes from the zones theres only four of them but hey for a 10 game when its not on sale thats not horrible right

it is when half the zones are terrible splash hill and casino street are clear rip offs of green hill and casino night but i think these are actually quite fine by themselves i even had some fun with them lost labyrinth and mad gear are based off of labyrinth zone and metropolis zone respectively dear god these two are awful lost labyrinth is basically what people who hate the original labyrinth zone think labyrinth zone is like mad gear zone somehow managed to make metropolis even worse getting through these levels is a complete hell with the different physics lost labyrinth act 2 in particular has a platforming puzzle in the middle that took me nearly six minutes to complete which is absurd for a game like this this isnt to mention the bosses which involve my least favorite boss types crushing boss and running boss 

when two out of the four zones in the game suck its just not worth it i couldnt even bring myself to finish the final boss since not only is it cheap but its just plain bad

overall not only is this game not worth full price its barely even worth 249 but worst of all this game was a waste of development time and energy easily the worst game dimps sonic game episode 2 isnt amazing but at least that isnt completely terrible buy that instead

#####

im gonna start off by saying i am a long long term sonic fan i have no idea how much time i put into the genesis sonic games i still love sonic and sometimes you really have to keep an open mind with the sonic franchise these days lol

that being said the problems with this game are immediately noticeable
 ball form has next to no purpose
 the momentum physics are all wrong to the point that sonic simply feels sluggish
 the color tone is dull not vibrant and energetic like you would expect from a sonic game
 the graphics feel like a cheap third party game sonics run animation is practically clip art pasted over his feet
 the zones i played and have looked up info on make the game seem like a bad sonic 2 clone
 a lot of the quality improvements to the game series that made sonic 3  sonicknuckles feel so good are gone

i dont know what went wrong here but the game feels like a bad fan installment i just cant recommend it

#####

much better off playing the original games or the newer sonic generations if you want some hedgepig in your life

apart from some of sonics older fans who last got to play the previous insalment of this series sonic the hedgehog 3 february 2nd 1994 the little blue begger doesnt seem to have aged well

physics have worsened graphics are just bluergh music is more childish and less innovative and shorter although doctor robotnik did surprise me in the first battle he came along with his massive balls and swung them about as usual and after you beat him normally he goes for one last massive overhead swing attack of ball crushing which was a nice twist i guess

i was 9 when i played the third game im now 30 either i should grow up or this timeline of sonic games should have tried to match me in some way probably the former but i wouldnt complain about the latter

the 30 year old in me is now going to go and get some work done the inner nine year old is going be a little upset about his favourite hedgehog and the inner teen is probably going to be thinking about tits



#####

sucks badly

#####

when sonic 4 launched in 2010 it marked the end to a 16 year drought of new 2d console sonic games promising a return to the blue blurs 16 bit roots sega sonic team and dimps had quite the legacy to live up to unfortunately while the game gets the things right there are enough glaring flaws to prevent this from being a recommendation 

after the events of sonic 3  knuckles sonic sets off to explore new territory alone meaning no tails or knuckles just like sonic 1 on the genesis however dr ivo eggman robotnik survived his last encounter with sonic and decides to take some of his previous creations slightly revise them and eliminate sonic once and for all as the first part of his new grandiose plan 

the gameplay is tried and true for the blue hedgehog you collect rings dodge spikes attack badnicks to free animal critters trapped inside while navigating the stage as quickly as you can if you collect enough rings you have the chance to get a chaos emerald at the end of each act collect all 7 and youll become the invincible super sonic who has access to a double jump and can go even faster than sonic normally can after a few acts of a zone you are presented with a boss battle featuring the aforementioned doctor always sporting a new contraption to try and kill sonic

as fans of sonics handheld outings know dimps has plenty of experience making 2d sonic games it may come as a surprise then that dimps efforts just fall short on a checklist sonic 4 episode 1 hits most of the things they tried to do incorporate elements from the old games add in the homing attack and appeal to genesis fans nostalgia the issue with that is that they didnt do much else the physics feel completely off from the genesis games and there is an issue with momentum sonic can be running up a slope and right when he reaches the top if he doesnt have enough speed he just stops sonic is now standing completely horizontal creating a 90 degree angle with the terrain he was just running up 

the level design also leaves something to be desired taking inspiration from sonic 1 and 2 the 4 main levels are heavily inspired by green hill casino night labyrinth zone and metropolis zone with signature elements from each zone often being recycled while these nods are nice they are done far too often to simply be paying homage this feeling is reinforced by the same badniks occupying the levels as the originals and the boss fights often being exactly the same but with a small change instead the game does sport some original ideas in zones but these ideas come across as being gimmicks instead of good level design

if you were hoping the special stages were spared i regret to inform you that they werent instead of using sonic 2s halfpipe that many a sonic game has used sonic 4 episode 1 goes back to the original special stage but they only proceeded to make it more frustrating by removing your control of sonic before you navigated sonic around the stage now you rotate the stage around sonic in addition to this frustrating change there is now a timer on the special stage and you need to reach the chaos emerald before you run out of time the inclusion of time boosting items in the stage helps but the equivalent of applying a bandage to a gunshot wound 

not even the soundtrack was spared in this release typically a sonic game may be terrible but still have an outstanding soundtrack but i personally found it lackluster compared to previous sonic soundtracks the same can be said for the graphics of the game while by no means bad they just arent that good either sadly the game looks better in screenshots than in motion

overall sonic 4 episode 1 is a mixed bag many mistakes were made along the way one of the biggest being drawing too much from the classics the lack of a proper physics engine and the momentum being off takes away enjoyment from the levels and the attached gimmicks do more harm than good i wish i could recommend this game i wish steam gave me the option to mark the game as mixed instead of recommend or dont recommend but there are so many glaring flaws that i cant recommend it if you are a sonic fan then you should pick up the game on sale at some point because youll probably still have some fun with the game if you arent then you shouldnt consider buying this game for any more than 5 dollars

#####

are you familiar with this dreadful feeling you sit at the toilet in the morning but your digestive system hasnt fully woken up yet thus you cant quite get everything out despite how much you feel you need to this is exactly the feeling this game evokes you see a sonic game and you really want to play and enjoy it but the game itself doesnt allow you to

controls are weird level design is frustrating enemy hitboxes are finicky graphics are atrocious music is like elevator music everything is insulting both to the franchise and to the player the developers were on a lazy day and were going for a quick cashgrab dont bother with this game if you want a retro feel play sonic generations

#####

game sucks ass

do not buy

buy mania instead

#####

the worst sonic game ive ever played bad graphics bad music bad controls bad level design bad gimmicks bad mechanics bad physics bad special stages bad bosses i literally cannot think of one thing this game does right

#####

a pretty enjoyable time actually and not even close to the travesty many sonic fans want you to believe this game was

#####

this game gave me an aneurysm

#####

sonic 4

#####

coming back years after playing it for the last time to review it i can safely say that what made the game come off as bad as it did on launch was probably the promise of its title

the original sega trilogy was among the best from the 1990s video games era to the point where its still played and remembered to this day it created one of the most beloved and recognizable mascots it set up the standard for fast paced platforming and it kept improving on itself sadly many bad decisions and releases came over the following decade leaving the series in a dismal state and the fans urging for a comeback taking all of that into account promoting a game as a continuation of the winning streak is definitely a bad move when in reality youre just remaking the first game

and as a remake its fine enough not great though as the physics feel floaty and delayed which isnt good when you try to go fast or fight bosses however by implementing a more reasonable saving system more approachable emerald levels a fresh coat of paint and an overall more accessible level design supported by the homing attack and the spin dash it can make for an entertaining time or even a moderately adequate entry to the 2d platforming branch of the series just in case you decided to skip the main trilogy or mania for some reason which i highly recommend in comparison the soundtrack is cool as well but not as memorable

all in all for those curious it is definitely not as bad of a game as maybe some fans make it out to be but i wouldnt recommend it nowadays over some of the more polished and content heavy options its serviceable enough to beat in a couple of hours though

#####

not the worst but also not the best sonic game  i think its fine 6510

#####

i played this game for 10 minutes

#####

good effort but still not worth it also soundtrack is subpar

#####

bad sonic game bad port mediocre platformer at best atrocious final boss at worst

no just dear no the price is justified for what you are getting a disappointing game

go with mania the classics instead if you really want your dimps sonic fix episode 2 the advance games or the rush games instead im happy if you enjoyed this because i just found it meh for the whole game until it turns into crap for the final boss

edit time to give this game a more justified review

as a sonic game
it has the right ideas take familiar stages add new gimmicks new level design etc take old bosses give them new attacks and a new coat of paint give sonic modern moves like homing attack i think an air dash sort of move was a good idea but the homing attack is used too much but it fails as a genesis style sonic game by just using automated level design that relys too much on the homing attack the physics being different wouldnt be a problem if they were good but that jump feels off and gaining speed on slopes too this games biggest mistake was calling itself sonic 4 instead of something like sonic remix overall the platforming is mediocre some stages do have some replay value as some do have alternate routes bosses are either as pitiful as their genesis counterparts or crap like the final boss the graphics are too plasticy for my tastes but not bad except for eggman his facial expressions on his sprites dont work as a model the explosions are also laughably bad if the game was just until mad gear was named sonic remix and was 5 bucks id think it would a pretty mediocre game it would be a 510 or as gaming journalists call it a 710 otherwise its 410 or 710 in gaming journalist lingoi hate how 710 means just a meh game nowadays but thats a rant for another time

as a port
it appears to be the wii version its not widescreen from what ive seen and its rendered at 720p and theres no way to change it without patches the lighting on sonic is also pretty bad it looks like hes wearing a weird blurry mess on his forehead that is way too bright the launcher supposedly uses java so you cant run it without as an added downside the game is capped at 60 fps not great but at least it isnt like adventure dx where frame rate was increased but enemy logic wasnt changed resulting in strange effects as a port 610 it ran without crashes for me no input lag or anything lack of options other than control configuration volume and window size but it is pc so mods with mods 710

as a game
if you played the best version of this game the ps3xbox 360 version then as a regular game its just kinda boring but not bad except for that final boss its 610

music
it mimics genesis music but not really i find it a little ear grating but episode 2 managed to give a genesis style soundtrack without sounding bad composition is eh tries too hard to mimic previous tracks without an equally good melody 510 not bad but could be much better as episode 2 proved

the final boss
ive been hyping it up it sucks the zone starts off with an ugly generic pipe tileset and a rematch against the first four bosses the first two start in their first phases while the latter two are in their final phases luckily there are rings and checkpoints in between so thats better than fighting mecha sonic after losing to the death egg robot in sonic 2 once all four are beaten you get to go to the final room the tileset is different and much nicer looking with earth or mobius depends on your headcanon in the background theres a checkpoint three rings and a spring after sonic jumps on the spring and lands on a platform you see eggman in his ugly sonic 4 model he runs into the final boss mech and the fight begins the first phase is pretty boring with sonic hitting eggman then eggman running away it takes forever but with the optimal strategy of hitting the mech with a basic jump then a homing attack after you rebound it goes by pretty fast he then enters his second phase where you have to hit back the spiked arm he launches at him to weaken him then you jump at him to deal proper damage sounds basic but it again takes forever once thats over with hell jump up then smash the ground youll have about one second to hit the mech before an instakill death yeah not great the final boss is slow boring reuses the same attacks over and over then an instakill attack 210 model looks ok and the music is ok

conclusion 
i got this at the humble bundle deal but still worst 077 076923076923 to be exact ive spent on a sonic game well so far

#####

my soul hurts

#####

this is not the sonic you remember the controls are clunky and slow the stages feel like a hd reskin of the old levels i didnt feel the team was as creative as they once were

#####

its alright if you get it super cheap i didnt really want to give it a thumbs down but its unfortunately such a missed opportunity you have to download a java patch just to start the game up the mechanics are stalestiff and handle really poorly compared to the classics the sonic model itself has a really ugly look to it the texture is poorly cell shaded it is also very frustrating when you miss a special stage ring after finishing a level you cant go back to jump through so you must replay the entire level 

overall definitely one to avoid unfortunately unless youre like me and are a huge sonic fan i would love to see this re done in the style of mania 410

#####

for some reason steam thinks ive played this monstrosity for over 150 hours awful physics and blood curdling sound track i couldnt handle it for any longer than the first play through calling it sonic 4 makes it sound like it should follow on from the classics  it doesnt genuinely irritates me that i have to see it placed so highly on my most played list

#####

it looks and feels like a fanmade game

#####

bad level design bad physics bad graphics subpar music short not much content dont buy get generations cd or just burn your money

#####

i feel like this game was made as a prank

#####

casino street just broke me

i couldnt enjoy the game at all no matter how hard i tried it feels so god damn wrong on so many levels and speaking of levels it really seems like the level designer has never touched a sonic game in his life before

it feels like a student project im sorry

#####

this game is terrible the physics are awful you have 0 momentum the instant you stop pressing forward regardless of if you are on the ground or in the air you come to a dead stop  its so incredibly awkward

the special stages are kinda interesting but the physics are still terrible you are rotating the entire world around you so you never ever move like you would expect

lastly the way the chaos emeralds work is bogus you can retry the special stage as many times as you like as long as you are able to pause  select retry if you let the time run out or touch the panels which cause you to fail the zone you are forced to play the entire normal stage again to get back into the special stage this encourages pausing every other frame to examine the level and if you see yourself heading for one of the exit panels just retry from the perspective of someone who grew up playing the original sonic games it might sound pretty forgiving to let you retry the special stages at all  but they are so terrible to control retrying them feels justified so losing your chance to retry just feels awful

its better than sonic shuffle i guess

#####

so why would anyone ever possibly like this game well lets look at the potential reasons

urlhttpsyoutubesjp5unoqk4siervpoo5gvwyx6twvt4331url

#####

this game is an enormous slap to the face for any 2d sonic fan the great physics from the original classic games and advance games are gone the levels are automated as hell and filled with cheap enemy placement and bottomless pits and not even the music is that good you know that if even the music sucks in a sonic game its a bad sign and for all that is holy dont try to get all the achievements i did and it was insufferable in conclusion dont waste your money on this game go buy sonic mania instead because thats closer to a sonic 4 than this game will ever be

#####

at best the game is just mediocre at worst its full of horrible game design  unforseeable bottomless pits instant death from crushing getting hit by things that are unseeable because they are off screen  i
overall it ranges from boring to just bad and its shameful that they tried to pass this off as sonic 4 since its nothing like a classic sonic game

#####

why do i have over 300 hours in this

#####

its playable definitely a product of necessity for sega to have a big seller and a result of dimps wanting to make their own product episodic and short dimps was a weird choice for this product

 dimps reinvented the way a lot of people looked at 2d sonic for a very long time with advance integrating stylish play with tricks and rush going full ham on not just breakneck speed requiring perfect reflexes but a bulk of minigames midstage so you never have time to stall dimps is not the company anyone should have looked at for a traditional 2dinspired sonic when their claim to fame was doing the exact opposite of that especially not for a comeback strong enough to have the brass to put a 4 after the name

 so you have sonic 4 which looks terrible it looks like sonic and the enemies are just photoshopped over the levels between that and sub par music jsr composer did not come back from rush instead you get the bastardization of what a genesis soundchip sort of sounds like for some strictly ok tracks it doesnt start off strong add to that a really boring and generic green hill but not level to start off with and its pretty rough its plastic its safe looking almost no new ideas or locales creatively and i dont think it was dimps behind it the game is puddle deep its a sonic looking game i guess 

  as for gameplay the physics are wonky when walking ive seen the memes of sonic walking vertically but when played as its meant to to its credit its not bad the homing attack gave me no issues that many others have had and while splash hill was dull the last three zones really upped the interest for me lost palace in particular really had some great levels from minecarts to balancing on boulders to a really interesting torch sequence to light up the level that really brought oil ocean to mind from sonic 2 

 its this sort of stuff that really hurts about sonic 4 i can feel so many times i hit a part where dimps was allowed to have fun to make a sonic game the way they are good at but then its back to generic tedium with a sonic paintjob it feels like this game had the capacity to be something really good but the history and desire to be a sequel to the first three is holding it back 

 instead of you have this rush sense of game thats lurking beneath the sonic 4 ideal and you just get a mess of recycled sound effects and no visual cohesion it feels like a fangame not a bad fangame but a far cry from what this game should have been

 but its playable its not awful doesnt crash or anything like that its not offensive just so mediocre maybe get it for 2 bucks on sale there are worse options

#####

bad physics pretty poor level designespecially the casino area and it visually looks hideous to me and some of the music just sounds super strange to me at worst

#####

i kind of hate this game because it encapsulates everything thats been wrong with sonic the past 20 years

#####

this game gets a really bad rep its not that bad just mediocre

#####

dont play this if you want to have a good time otherwise have fun uwu

#####

this game just sucks i have tried my best to get into it several times and each time i do play it i end up hating it even more dont even bother playing this game even if you are a fan of the blue rat that likes to go fast it just rehashes old stages from the classic games it has no imagination in its levels with broken physics you will just see sonic casually walk up a steep hill this game has no sense no the momentum whatsoever and special stages will make you want to vomit 

im not even mad that they use sonics modern appearance what gets me mad is that they name it sonic 4 when this game does absolutely nothing to improve or even adapt any of the gameplay styles or flow of the original 3 classic games so it just comes out as a big mess witch really sucks just give this game a miss 

#####

a fun throwback to the the days when sonic was in his prime on the sega genesis this game is not at the same level as the older sonic games but it is still a fun game if you liked the old 2d sidescrolling sonic games then you will probably enjoy this one

#####

i believe that people are more passionate about the things they hate compared to the things they love and sonic the hedgehog 4  episode 1 is further evidence to my claim

upon booting up and playing the game i was greeted with a mediocre albeit passable first world i was far from impressed nor was i having fun but i could see where some people could find enjoyment here despite the fleamarket knockoff physics compared to the original games its fun having a homing attack when playing in the classic sonic the hedgehog gameplay style however it functions terribly and inconsistently a lot of the time causing me multiple game overs in my playthrough

level design is my passion the creators of this dog turd must have said as they created some of the worst atrocities that have ever graced my eyes as ive said the first world is okay but the second world started showing some cracks and the third and fourth worlds left me feeling more miserable than any breakup or postnut clarity ever could constant pacebreaking level gimmicks and frustrating enemy placements made the flow of going fast appear impossible to achieve even for a player who knows what they are doing this isnt even accounting for multiple areas being heavily trialanderror focused in the latter half of the game

the game looks worse than a human intestinal tract after eating copious amounts of taco bell i cannot overstate that this is the worst looking game i have ever played a lot of this review is somewhat hyperbolic because its funnier that way but this is not a joke sonics model looks like a turd and most level elements and backgrounds have an incredibly cheap look to them as if they were from an old flash game or something

and do not get me started on the music as a musician i am offended to even call this a soundtrack with some of the most eargrating synths your ears will ever be subject to even if the tracks were transposed onto different instrumentssynths id still imagined theyd sound boring and uninspired the ost only helped to make me angrier as i was trying to cross through the dookie level design ive already mentioned

another nitpick is that the game wont even play upon installing and forces you to download java externally for some reason its a small thing but still sets the mood when you begin playing

overall it took me less than two hours to get to the end of the game and i just got tired once i got to the final boss not only are you forced to refight all of the other bosses again but then the actual final fight requires some trial and error to beat and i ran out of lives on my first attempt so i just gave up because i really did not want to play this game anymore

i got this game on sale only payed a few dollars and i still felt ripped off the short length just contributes to how little content is present in this package however it is more of a blessing than a curse as any additional minute of playing this game feels like it sheds a month off your expected lifetime i highly recommend to purchase anything else not a single element of this game shows even a semblance of quality in my opinion

#####

story 510
gameplay 410
music 510
final boss and ending 510
post game content 410

overall 510 mediocre at best

#####

not as good as i thought


#####

sosonic 4 the true bastard child of the series among mosts eyes
gotta say i couldnt agree more

sonic controls like crap the special stages are designed in a way that dont accomodate for the frustrating zones that precede them
the music though i thought most wasnt really terrible is rather lackluster and the boss battles are just downright frustrating more than enjoyable therein is my entire problem with this game its a frustrating mess usually sonic games at the very least teach you through your failures but this game at times feels like pure trial and error and it makes you wonder if the designers even tested this thing before it was released

usually even when a sonic game is bad i at least try to finish itbut this one i find myself really wincing whenever i consider coming back to it the game is completely broken in the gameplay department and i feel i am just wasting my time trying to learn its quirks it just isnt fun 
when i found out the final boss of episode 1 was literally just a repeat of all bosses mashed together in a gauntlet i couldnt really bring myself to keep playing once i lost all my lives it was just exhausting after a while and did not feel rewarding whatsoever

what an absolute disaster really disappointing

#####

both of these are god awful theyre not even funny bad like 06 theyre just boring soulless video games dont waste your money

#####

is this game good may be
is this game bad no its not bad

while the game failed to become what it was supposed to be but it does not make it bad the game is fun

just if you are a normal person you will enjoy this game it doesnt have that much flaws
but if you are a sonic fanboy bitching about everything then go away  yo are not welcome here

i reccommend this game just for chilling out you can just grab the pad and play

#####

lol this game sucks but im still gonna get the acheivements

#####

everything youve heard about this game is true its slow boring and ugly this game fucking suck

#####

go get sonic mania

#####

ah sonic 4 this game came out around the time i lovingly refer to as the 8bit and 16bit renaissance period when titles such as earthworm jim got an hd rerelease rocket knight adventures received a third entry in the series and mega man had come back to the scene with mega man 9 and 10 

that being said the mechanics arebroken you can tell what dimps was going for in this game and honestly at times it actually does play really well the other times well having come from sonic rush and sonic rush adventure i was a bit surprised that dimps didnt carry the same gusto with this title it actually feels more similar to sonic pocket adventure on the neo geo pocket color than it does to the previous sonic games on genesis and game gear it tries a bit too hard to be old school but now new school and i think thats where the problems emerge from the game is by no means a bad titlei actually had quite a bit of fun with this title when the controls wanted to work for me not to mention the game had multiple console releases including the wii 

unfortunately the story doesnt really feel like a continuation with what wed seen in the original trilogy if sonic 1 gave us the aesthetics that would define sonic with its chequered patterns and loopdeloops if sonic 2 gave us faster gameplay brighter colours and the spin dash if sonic 3 gave us shields with effects dashing with the fire shield bouncing with the bubble shield gaining extra ground with the electric shield and different ways to play flying with tails climbing with knuckles sonic 4 rewinds us back to more of a sonic 15 feeling to it 

its quick to judge this title based on the controls but if youre a bit more patient with it this game still holds up pretty well its a bit more of a casual sonic title again like pocket adventure but i think for what its worth the game is worth checking out

#####

it looks and plays like a bad fan remake avoid

#####

sonic the hedgehog 4 is a disaster in trying to recapture the fun fast paced action of the genesis classics the game is only about an hour long the graphics and music are bland and the level design feels like a fan project more than an official sequel to sonic 3 give both episode 1 and 2 a hard pass and pick up sonic mania generations or any of the classic games instead

#####

i found this disappointing sonic 3  knuckles were amazing i completed them multiple times 
the levels were poorly designed the graphics average and the physics engine was a let down

#####

annoying and slow

#####

the game is alright i guess but it should have not been called sonic the hedgehog 4

#####

hell nah lol

#####

very fun 2d sonic game good zones can be a bit difficult at first though

#####

as a day one sonic fan who played the original genesis titles as soon as they came out this is a really good sonic game the game took old concepts for levels and created something fresh and new with platforming puzzles that would use old mechanics in a brand new and interesting way

after 1015 years of bare bones turn your brain off sonic gameplay i feel the audience for sonic just didnt want a game like this episode 1 will actually challenge you a little bit youll find platforming puzzles because sonic is a platformer a shocker to some i know i feel thats the main reason why people preferred episode2 over ep1 ep2 looks gorgeous and is completely brain dead

also its worth noting the nitpicks about the physics and earning speed are misguided the physics are 90 the same and theres no meaningful difference between this and the classics earning speed is also a talking point parroted by people who didnt want to take the time to figure out what was really bothering them for example who complained the spindash in sonic 2 took the earning speed element out of the game the real reason why it didnt feel like a genesis sonic game was the save system

this game was designed to be played through once without having to replay levels theres no muscle memory or memorization of level layouts unlike there was in sonic 12

#####

sonic the hedgehog 4 proves that when sequels exist there are high chances that it will not live up to the expectations of long time fans of the series just take the movie airbud and its sequels for example with low budget graphics wall standing physics that makes sonic 06s wall standing physics look like a masterpiece lack of actual momemtum and a midi soundtrack that somehow still exists in 2023 its a promomatic expierence overall but let me tell you without this game we wouldnt get sonic superstars thank you sonic 4

#####

sonic 4

#####

what the fuck were they thinking

#####

huh so steam has reviews okay why not try my hand at it
so sonic the hedgehog 4 episode i seemed to be segas way of returning sonic to his roots for people to enjoy
does it do a good job eh its fun could of used better physics than the sonic rush engine personally i prefer the wii version of the game as sonic isnt as shiny the music sounds closer to an actual sega genesismega drive and the controls are much more simplistic not to mention i had to get a button mapping program because while my controller had enough buttons it wasnt an xbox 360 controller so it decided not to have compatiblity the only reason why i recomend getting this on anything besides a wii is for sonic the hedgehog 4 episode iis episode metal which requires both games on the same memory and episode ii never saw a nintendo port but even though i do recommend getting for the reason just mentioned wait for it to go on sale the game isnt worth its current price tag

#####

i have never played a modern sonic game i adored the orginals back in my 16 bit days and played sonic 2 into dust i was acutely aware of the issues many people have with the franchise as it has gone on but i decided to be impartial particularly as it was on sale for an insanely small ammount during the sale

all goodwill aside however this game has serious problems the controls are very sticky and the homing addition to gameplay does nothing but make it easier in earlier sonic games bouncing from one enemy to another to both protect yourself and also take them out was an act of skill now its almost a glorified qte the pace of the action never quite hits that of the orginals either you begin to gather the frenetic momentum that sonic is famous for and it will suddenly drag to a snails pace

the graphics arent much cop either although the zones look pleasant enough sonic himself looks utterly awful and his running animations in relation to where he is running from dont seem to make sense at all if i were to try and define it id say to looked cheap

finally for a game that also had an amazing score it seems to have been relegated to substandard childrens pop which although i have no issue with it isnt mystic caves quality music

all in all im a tad disapointed if not surprised from what i heard of others if you really want a recommendation id say steer well clear and get a copy of rayman its incredibly solid and beautiful and has had great ammounts of attention lavished on it this however sadly has not

#####

this was just a huge disappointment from sonic 3 the levels are all rehashed versions of previous sonic games even the bosses are reused from previous games this does not feel like a new version of the game it is more like a remastered compilation of prevous games

the only innovation i saw was in the labrynth zone where you can use your torch to light the explosives the music was just very short loops that became annoying especially at the end levels

the only way you should buyplay this game is if it is on sale i picked mine up at humblebundle so at least somebody is getting my money for a good cause

#####

can you imagine if nintendo took some random flash fangame of mario made by a 16 year old in their spare time and said this is super mario bros 4 because even that would probably go over better than sonic the hedgehog 4 and yet somehow this is like the eighth or ninth time ive played through it i couldnt tell you why

#####

i lasted until the end of act 1 before i uninstalled this the physics are terrible and heaven forbid you dont push a direction while running or jumping youll rapidly just slow mid direction into a stop the graphics were better in even sonic 3d blast for genesis than this id have rather looked at the original sonic from the very first one than the mediocre reproduction in this game

#####

project needlemouse

#####

lets just tap the brakes on the sonic hate train for a second

after beating this game and doing a few speedruns i can say the level design is well done and the speeds you acheive are well earned the new physics arent the same as the old games theyre different but different does not equate to bad so dont go into the game expecting to replay sonic 1 if you want to do that go replay sonic 1 

there are some grossly subpar sonic games out there but this is not one of them its an essential throwback to the original games but to compare it as 1 to 1 with them is ridiculous if the developers wanted to rehash the exact same sonics 20 year old games thatd be all too easy instead sonic 4  episode 1 is a new spin on an old style and its good and episode 2 is even better

#####

overhated

#####

this game is straight trash sonic team looked at the history of sonic and asked how about instead of making a sequel to the good sonic games we make a sequel to the first one the answer is that you get this as many others have mentioned the game is very slow handles like garbage makes poor use of more modern sonic mechanics namely the lock on dash attack and mostly just requires you to hold right while occasionally double tapping jump

anyone who recommends this game is a liar an idiot or a brainwashed sonic die hard who would fish one of his blue turds out of the toilet gobble it up and call it a five star dinner avoid at all costs

#####

ive been a sonic fan since the original on genesis and ive played a lot of sonic games over the years including some fan made ones  sonic 4 episode 1 is not good and seems more like a bad imitation than anything  i dont know why they decided to slap a 4 on a game that brings less to the table than its predecessors  

sonic 4 brings nothing new to the series  besides some pretty out of place level gimmicks they brought in sonics homing attack from the adventure universe  the homing attack works and makes sense in those games because the games environment and the movements are in 3d but in this game the physics lock you in place after hitting a target grinding you to a halt for a few seconds if you dont have another immediate target  the alternative is that after hitting a target with a homing attack youll be launched the opposite direction in an animation and path you can not control which will happen on bosses a lot  at the end of the game i actually found that doing homing attacks usually gave me less chances to attack a boss  sonic has very slow acceleration on his own and i found the gameplay as a whole honestly not fun  

the level design is punishing to new players as there are strange gimmicks traps and tons of pitfalls that will instant ko you  there also not enough chances to appreciate sonics speed and momentum outside of the first level  i will say that some of the background designs were ok in certain levels but every level looks like a redesigned level that sonic fans have previously seen  

the graphics are bad  putting 3d models in a 2d space is usually somewhat jarring but even more so for sonic  none of his animations look good and sonic actually seems to be missing a layer of color to me  

while some of the music is ok some of the tracks that play through out the game are surprisingly bad for a sonic the hedgehog game  none of it is memorable and i noticed that some of the themes are 20second loops   also the quality of the music sounded like unused music tracks from the sonic advance library  

all in all id say get it on sale or borrow it from a friend if youre a die hard sonic fan but this game does not deliver and does not deserve the title of sonic 4 in my humble opinion  510

#####

alright so i dont normally do this but since this is probably my most controversial opinion on my steam page and since the original review was already kinda semiserious anyways i thought it should make it a tad more professional

as im sure most of you know sonic 4 episode 1 was segas response to the fans desire for a sequel to the original genesis trilogy while also responding to the criticism they experienced of having too many characters which i personally believe to be bogus but thats sorta how reviews were back then restoring itself to the classic 2d sidescrolling action similar to said trilogy while also giving it the homing attack basically making it play like the ds sonic trilogy aka the rush trilogy but without any of the boost mechanics
which makes sense as all of the games development was handled by dimps

however i just lied to you
partially

see sonic 4 iisi called sonic 4 in order to respond to the fans desires to have a sequel to the original trilogy
but this was inoti the games original intent in the background of casino street zone you can see a board say sonic the portable why you may ask

because this game was never meant to be sonic 4
sonic 4 was made to be a standalone game released on mobile devices and was never meant to be called sonic 4

this is the key point im going to make in this review bthis game is not sonic 4b 
if youre going into this expecting another genesis sonic game you iwilli be disappointed

if you want a proper conclusion to the genesis games id suggest playing either sonic mania or sonic superstars i dont particularly enjoy superstars but i know theres people who do

as a standalone game iii personally believe that sonic 4 is one of the better sonic games i know most people will disagree with me when i say that and i will always respect that there tons of reasons why i can see people would dislike this game 
basically if you dislike this game cool if you like this game also cool both are two sides of the same coin and i can see both

speaking of which enough with that starting fluff lets actually get into the game itself shall we

i feel like its important to mention this first before i get anywhere we need to talk about the bad stuff

h2the bad stuffh2

 lost labyrinth zone act 2 is by far the worst level in the game it features long cramped dark hallways with torches you need to light every now and then theres also minecart intermissions and the first ones arent telegraphed well and although i honestly accept it since the punishment here isnt death what i idonti accept is how it leads into a torch puzzle which is not only highly confusing but also highly precise 
now in all honesty the solution i found to the puzzle is pretty fun to preform but regardless it is not fitting in the act due to its massive difficulty spike and overwhelming confusion

 lost labyrinth zone act 3 and mad gear zone act 2 are sorta just alright theyre not amazing but theyre also easily the weakest levels in the game as their level design isnt really the most interesting

 the games music and graphics are of heavily debatable quality personally i enjoy the oddlyrealistic look of the levels and also the odd genesisinspired music except for the boss theme which is ironic since its an unused track from sonic 3d blast look on the prototypes page for it on tcrf if youre curious but i will admit it looks pretty bad at some parts

 the title screen is probably the worst first impression to any game i have ever played sonic literally looks like those old flash animations where they just rotate the sprites

 all of the leaderboards were hacked to get the shortest possible time not necessarily fault of the developers though i guess you could say they could be held accountable for not preventing this but still a problem with the game

 the boss design is the same dies fast or lasts 5 million years as most sonic games are thankfully most of the boss design leans on the dies fast half which is the lesser of two evils except for the death egg robot which is probably a contender for one of the worst sonic final bosses in the franchise have fun spending 5 years in a fight where you have three rings and can die incredibly easy and ends with an instakill death attack which will make you restart the entire fight if you dont hit it in time if anyone is thinking about it egg king and ghost titan from the sonic rush games get passes because their instakill attacks are easy enough to cancel out

 the physics are highly different from the genesis games different isnt necessarily bad and all it takes is getting used to it but another reason why this games biggest problem is
 bthe game is called sonic 4b



there now weve gotten the bad stuff out of the way time for the stuff i like about sonic 4

h2the good stuffh2

 sonics moveset is perfect for speed if youre ever slow then you can just do a quickhoming attack dash to immediately get back up on your feet ive seen a lot of people talk about the spindash nerf but honestly i dont think its that bad if you use it correctly

 the special stage design is honestly some of the most creative in a sonic game it follows a proper difficulty curve and every special stage after the second one has its own idea and identity attached to it debatable if you even enjoy them due to the controls but the design itself is very good

 speaking of which something a lot of people dont really talk about with sonic 4 the level design sonic 4s level design almost always has a faster route for speed like for example did you know that at the start of lost labyrinth zone act 1 you can homingattack chain to reach a spring which sends you further into the level then combo the springs momentum into bouncing off of an enemy to send you flying through the section yeah a lot of the game is designed like that and nobody talks about it splash hill zone act 2 casino street zone act 2 and the aforementioned lost labyrinth zone act 1 are definitely my favorites for this give speedrunning them a try if you can

 say what you will about giving old zones new names and reimagining them but the fact that every level has its own unique title is something more sonic games should do like seeing the first act of mad gear zone be called dr eggmans secret base really gives it a whole lot more personality yknow like youve finally arrived at his front door uninvited and youre taking it over that is if his base wasnt clearly visible from the sky but

 as i stated earlier although the soundtrack and graphics are highly debatable the melodies are definitely good for the most part and the levels feel like realistic yet still cartoony representations of each area plus that view in lost labyrinth is gorgeous and you cant convince me otherwise

 ive seen people talk about how sonic 4 follows a 3 actbasis and can agree its a bit odd but thats all it is sonic advance 3 and sonic lost world 3ds both have three acts per world why cant sonic 4 plus all of the zones in the game except for casino night zone had 3 acts anyways and it gives the zones a bit more time to shine with their ideas

 mad gear zone is what metropolis zone wishes it couldve been its not even my favorite zone in sonic 4 i just wanted to say that

basically my thoughts on the game boil down to great game but absolutely not sonic 4
if you see the game when its cheap id recommend getting it and the last time i saw it on sale it was like 2 dollars so it probably wouldnt hurt to try it out

#####

this game is not good the graphics are an assault to my eyes the physics are wonky the idea of momentum is nonexistent the zones are stolen from other sonic games the level design is passable at best the boss fights are abysmal the only saving grace this game has is how embarrassingly short it is sonic 4 does absolutely nothing to follow up sonic 3  knuckles it is unworthy of its title

#####

if you are gonna make a game that half of it consists of boss fights then at least make them good and not rng garbage that gives you a twist at the end and makes you die forcing you to repeat that torture all over again
shame because most of the game is actually decent its a fine remake of the old sonic games

#####

this game really is the definition of seeing is believing you cannot understand how poorly this game plays unless you play it yourself and for that alone i think everyone should play this game even for just 30 minutes

#####

one of the worst pieces of fucking dog shit i have ever experienced in my life having explosive diarrhoea is genuinely more fun than playing this piece of shit absolutely zero redeeming qualities in this game sonic is extremely floaty and unreliable the level design is some of the worst in a 2d sonic game and there is zero originality in any of the zones literally every single zone is a carbon copy from one in either sonic 1 or 2 the special stages are the worst in any sonic game which is extremely impressive because almost all sonic special stages are awful the sound design and most of the tracks in the ost sound years behind the quality of even the first sonic and gets extremely grating after around 20 minutes of playing

the bosses are an absolute joke all of them being ripped from one or two of the actual good 2d sonic games and then completely stripped of any personality and then made ten times easier the graphics and art design look awful the shading looking incredibly off and weird that you never get used to it the animations are worse than the 16bit games on the genesis and looks incredibly cheap to the point where they look like theyre from a flash fan game

one of the most soulless awful ugly and irritating games i have ever played a 7 game that i beat in just about 2 hours and didnt have any fun in even one second of that time never play this game and keep anyone you know from playing it because its so bad you could probably contract cancer from it no idea how the devs released this thinking it was a finished game

#####

i retract my earlier review this game is stinky

#####

errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

#####

this may very well be one of the only positive reviews on steam for this game and i leave it shamelessly i just got done with the task of collecting all 7 choas emeralds and was filled with a sweet frustration i have not experienced since i was a tiny boy of 8 years old playing sonic the hedgehog 2 trying and succeeding in beating all those special stages the sense of nostalgia is undeniable i cant believe the entitlement that the gaming community has sometimes especially sonic the hedgehog fans if you want the old games go ahead and just play those if you want a love letter from sonic team as they try to give fans a familiar but fresh experience at least give this a shot 

thanks sonic team i appreciate the feels 

#####

why doesnt this game support controllers right at the get go like cmon its a platformer

#####

this game is genuinely ass

#####

this actually happened to my friends ears

#####

i was honestly looking forward to this then my hopes were shot to the ground

i wasnt fully expecting much as reviews were mixed but this game is god awful i couldnt even find a reason to continue playing after the first zone 

glitchy platforming a screen that looked like pixels and the music felt kinda attrocious  every zone is a blatant ripoff of the past three games speaking of which theres only four zones 

the homing attack was absolute bullcrap legitimately took me four minutes to make one chain near the end of splash hill 2 involving vines even those sucked

when i looked at other reasonings from developers they were making up excuses

its a 410

#####

i would rather file my taxes than play more of this game thats how boring it is

#####

this is least like the other 2d sonic games holding down to go into ball form isnt that effective neither is the spin dash at most points holding the stick to move youll notice sonics first few steps are extremely slow youre better off double jumping and holding a direction to gain speed you also want to take advantage of the autolock on to kill enemies and advance if you dont adapt to the new control system youll hate this game

its good though theres funhard challenges 

just know that the enemy hunter achievement is bugged you have to kill all 1000 without exiting the game also know that you can retry the special stages by pausing and selecting retry so if you know youre failing just quickly start over instead of having to beat a level with 50 rings again

#####

this game is a big stinky bady poopy doopy

#####

this game despite its flaws does have some enjoyable moments in it

for one you can blaze through the stages pretty fast if you know how to utilise the homing ability well however in some stages there are some very questionable design choices specifically with enemy placement i found myself getting hit by something i had no control or ability to predict several times during my playthrough

the graphics are definitely odd and even ugly at times my biggest complaint that more complicated stages sometimes lack visual clarity between interactable objects and stage geometry

i would say its worth picking this game up if its on a discount as the length and quality of the game does not come close to the standards of previous sonic games

#####

what the hell have they done to sonic once you start the game you notice that he seems to have lead in his shoes and though he speeds up quite fast it feels so odd compared to the old games talking about the original megadrive games here the level design is awful sonic had some cheap deaths but this game is either way too easy or just unfair the third act of the first zone has a segment where you have to progress using a chain of sonics aimed spin attacks but to start the chain you jump on a bumper and you have only two moments when the cursor appears on the first enemy hit the button too early or too late  instant death this feels more like a qte than a sonic game the first boss doesnt really have a pattern you simply stand to the very edge of the screen and time your attacks

this game looks like a sonic game but it certainly doesnt feel like one at all

#####

not so good

#####

would rather kill myself than play this shit

#####

this game is a lot of fun and personally i think a lot of the dislike is unwarranted but has a lot to do with the fact that the game shows its true promise far past the first playthrough i 100 believe that if this game was not explicitly titled sonic 4 the game would be more appreciated to be fair i rightfully will agree this isnt a successor to the classic sonic series though its better treated as its own separate thing

this game has

 actual fasts way faster than isonic the hedgehog 4  episode iii where youre forced to use tails a lot
 a mere 4 main zones making it short and sweet instead of too long like isonic 3  knucklesi is
 no glitches at time of writing this making it automatically better than 90 of sonic games including isonic maniai i must disclaimer by mentioning the possible crash right after you obtain all the emeralds tho only a thing on pc for some reason
 the most fluid special stage in all of sonic special stage 5 seriously check out a run and marvel at the sexy freefloating for much of the level
 speaking of special stages sonic 1style stages that put you more in control  with time limits
 a labyrinth boss that actually is fun and challenging
 shortcuts that make you wonder why you ever did the puzzle room in lost labyrinth 2
 a final boss that has a trick that makes you wonder why you ever struggled with phase 2
 a simplistic fairly lenient and fun scoring system that gets even better when you turn super
 an actually fun casino level

and much much more

by all means get it on sale though its been super low priced many times already

decent but not as good as the predecessor by a mile the visuals and soundtrack are amazing but the spindash for example doesnt feel like a real spindash the momentum and physics that made the old ones good is gone here you could play through it and be like its ok for the most part but even tho its slightly underrated by the community if it had another name rather than sonic four like sonic freedom im bad at names it probably would not had this much flack

if youre a hardcore sonic fan buy this you might enjoy some of it if youre not a sonic fan skip this and wait till sonic mania or buy sonic 4 episode 2 since its a much better game than this one

#####

this game does not deserve the title of sonic 4 aside from the visuals and graphics that improve naturally over time it doesnt hold a candle to the original 3 sonic titles

as many have already mentioned the physics are no fun you can gain speed but it is so easy to lose it whether its because of the rather bad level design or the forced homing attack segments of the stages

despite the pace sonic is capable of reaching his animations make him look slow and sluggish on top of this using the homing attack on an enemy makes you unable to immediately chain in another meaning there is a forced delay between each enemy hit really unnecessary

stick to the old original 3 sth 1 2 3k andor generations

#####

this game right here son too great for pants sonic has no pants

#####

sonic 4 is a real mixed bag  best parts are graphics and music looks fantastic and the tunes are great  the more i played the game the less i enjoyed it  final boss is terrible just terrible  as other reviews state the momentum is totally wrong in comparison to prior games  what tips the scale to a no is that it requires java installation to run a major error for a game in 2021  worst of the 2d sonic games not awful but not recommended

#####

terrible art direction excessive use of gradient shading with graphics that look like they belong in a flash game that lacks the character of either the classic games or generations more importantly they completely screwed up the physics and momentum and the game has a distinct lack of the speed that sonic games are known for as a result the only upsides are that 1 its quite short several hours long and 2 it faithfully recreates the look of classic sonic levels like green hill zone casino nights and labyrinth zone

#####

wellthis is a sonic game and i marked it as not recommended but i wouldnt flat out say its bad it is however absolutely frustrating the game has got some cool levels and it is fun overall but why oh why are the controls so damn sluggish 
never has sonic stopped cold in the middle of a jump when theres momentum thats what momentum is there for same with running so many cheap deaths because i was expecting to land ahead only to just fall also when has the spin dash ever slowed down on hills or steeps its unbelievable that having perfected the sonic formula and made 2d sonic games for the best part of a decade sega would mess this up so badly there are games with bad controls which manage to be good regardless but a huge part of sonic are the controls and physics i pushed through and finished it and yeah i had fun butnot all was sunshine and rainbows dont even get me started on the secret maze cave thing or its boss battle do i recommend it wellto absolutely diehard sonic fans only and with a price cut as i got it otherwise skip to part 2 which plays exactly like sonic should play

#####

ill leave my original review below ive changed my thumbs down to thumbs up buuuut not because its a good game more so because i think there is a lot of value in the unique experience offered by this game when compared to the rest of the 2d series basically i came back and wanted to beat the game and to do so i had to learn how to play it theres a whole learning how to play a game in order to appreciate it discussion but i will boil it down to this this game does not handle as i would have expected a traditional 2d sonic game to handle the engine is different every game is different and i now think that that should not be a fault held against the game however i dont think im at fault for expecting a sonic game to handle similarly to other sonic games still when you get used to how this game handles and plays it is fun its fun blasting through the stages when you know how sonic handles 

that said i didnt really care for the level designs the music was mostly forgettable it was good but i lead with forgetable for a reason i cant remember it at all id still listen to it outside of the game and ugh the bosses they cover a range and theyre mostly fine but i despise the design of the last boss zone  the boss rush  the final boss i burned through something like 5070 lives just learning the patterns for the final boss it was time consuming and is responsible for the brunt of my time spent coming back to the game between farming the lives to deal with it and then the boss itself there wasnt so much a challenge to it as just getting a little farther learning a few new things and then starting the whole final boss over its a long fight i clocked it at about 5 minutes 16 hits or something and a final timed attack with all of that i dont know how i would improve upon it the phases need so many hits so that you have time to experience the whole of the phase and not just blast through it and even then i was breezing through the first and then second phase without much issue after doing them so many times the main thing that bothered me was restarting the whole fight over due to little mistakes that felt like they were beyond my control at times but hey you can also beat the whole boss rush without taking damage if youre skilled enough

i wouldnt make changes to the game i think as a stand alone game it is fine and i think a lot of my issues are internal rather than external to reiterate i do think the game is responsible for creating an environment where that is the case sonic 4 is unique in its existence and i will cherish it for that

and now for the initial review where i gave this a thumb down

yeah no  sorry  the princess is in another castle  bahahaha video game jokez

man i really wanted to like this game because yeah i like sonic  hes really only worked in 2d though i didnt care for sonic adventures personally  when i saw this a few years ago i was like oh man exciting  a new potentially good sonic game  and then all of the disappointment

the two biggest factors as to why i dont recommend this game the engine and the level design  graphics are a close third

the engine is just kind of meh  sonic feels very bulky heavy and slow in this game  more than once ive stood on a hill and after losing momentum could not actually finish climbing said hill  i had to go back get a running start and then run up  it didnt feel very sonic like and it very much breaks pacingimmersionfun

however the level design is what kept me from wanting to finish  its just kind of meh overall like a  bland cutcopypaste of what a marketing person thinks a sonic game should look like having looked at the statistics and level design of previous games  it feels very soulless much like the new super mario brothers series  sure it looks similar to the original sonic games but it lacks its own character or creativity  you can usually safely call where a spike trap will be for example because  the placements are so obvious  thats not bad necessarily  you should be able to tell where the pitfalls are going to come up  but theyre predictable in the way that makes the game boring

what really broke my spirits though was the third level the fucking water level  water levels always kind of suck in sonic but in the past i at least appreciated their uniqueness as they did some cool things  this one doesnt  one stage has a massive pain in the ass puzzle where you light specific torches at specific times in order to make platforms rise and fall but the torches burn out so quickly that sonics slow impercise ass cant easily get onto these ledges before they disappear  i personally was stuck on one part of a stage for a good 510 minutes just trying to get sonic to do what i wanted him to do  thats not a good game  worse still is the boss fight for that stage which is a race to catch and damage robotnik  except you know the race involves very specific jumps while water is rising  of course the water slows you down and at that point why even bother

no i had a pretty bad time with this game and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you really wanted to see how to fuck up a 2d sonic game  it just doesnt do much right  even sonic colors  a game i also do not like  was designed better than this  i really want to like it but its just not very good  if you want a good sonic game go check out sonic generations instead

#####

this game is pretty good i recommend

#####

i dont know why people hate this one its a lot of fun and the physics that everyone complains about are more like sonic rush rather than the genesis games so if you like rush youll love this one and even if you havent youll still like it if you remember that it isnt a carbon copy of the genesis games it is a good game and although i agree the sequel is superior and the levels are mostly rehashed themes its still an enjoyable experience id give this one an 810 definitely worth the money

#####

sonic drops like a brick if you stop holding leftright for a second makes the precision platforming hell

#####

its pretty meh i guess

#####

i rather read two babies one fox than to play this again10

as an addendum heres a list of better 2d platformer sonic games you could be playing right now instead of wasting your hard earned 2 bucks on this pile of hedgehog shit sonic 1 sonic 1 sms sonic cd sonic 2 sonic 2 sms sonic 3 sonic and knuckles sonic 3 and knuckles sonic mania sonic chaos sonic triple trouble sonic blast sonic advance sonic advance 2 sonic advance 3 knuckles chaotix tails adventure tails skypatrol sonic pocket adventure sonic rush rush adventure sonic colours ds sonic generations 3ds sonic rivals sonic rivals 2 sonic boom shattered crystal sonic boom fire and ice likely sonic superstars

#####

wow as a new sonic fan and mainly a 3d sonic fan i can clearly see why this game has poor reviews and only is about an hour long dont buy just go replay sonic dx or 2 for the fifth time in a row

#####

this is a very bad game how did it ever pass quality testing the controls are clunky the movement is not smooth and fluid having smooth movement is at the core of the classic 2d sonic games do yourself a favour and avoid this game

#####

sonic the hedgehog 4 takes place in a bizarre cyberpunk future where orcs elves and vampires coexist with technology and grim industrial cityscapes you are sonic the hedgehog a courier in seattle who is critically wounded by assassins 

you awake in a morgue plagued by amnesia your goal is to uncover exactly who you are and who wants you dead based on the pen and paper rpg of the same name

#####

if you dont have a controller this game is very bad with an unbelievably stupid control scheme which cant be changed and the game plays just like the first one which is not a good thing considering sonic 1 might already be like 20 years old

#####

got it on sale for 75 off

wait for 90 sale on this if you really want it 95 off is probably the ideal price for this if you arent a sonic fan and even then you could get better games for that price

i installed java and everything

it just doesnt feel right insert picture of sonic standing on a wall

like it functions as a game but as an official entry in the sonic franchise its awful

#####

sonic 4i is a game with a long history of memes see that 910 score for sonic 4ii on steam 4i is a very similar game with many of the same traits but the memes keep it from ever rising above 610 4ii is ever so slightly better in some small ways but its not anywhere near enough for the sharp divide that we routinely see with these two games

sonic 4i has some cool level design interesting tweaks on bosses especially in a series that traditionally has poor bosses and a really great redesign of sonic 1s special stage theres not much in the way of drawbacks and the developers even threw in a cool metal sonic mode if you own the second game i have no idea why this game was run into the ground especially when the largely similar sonic advance and sonic rush games have a decent reputation if i could have been there to play this on release date i probably would have been pretty satisfied with the game

and lets be real numbers are questionable 6s and 7s are supposed to be good games that are worth your time but arent amazing hidden gems or works of art thats not what the numbers are ever used for and anyone who thinks they are is an overly idealistic idiot 6s and 7s to the vast majority of human beings mean worthless trash that isnt even bad enough to laugh at oh wait thats what everyone calls sonic 4i go fucking figure

if anything the entire sonic series has some fundamental game design problems that people cling to out of a sense of nostalgia the series hit them where it hurts i cant even say that without being called a hipster or whatever and there are too many people who think they can say the same about the mario series which doesnt have such problems at all

this game deserves nothing less than a plain old but still shiny blue positive rating and thats coming from someone who doesnt particularly care for the sonic series as a whole

#####

sonic had a rough transition back to 2d

#####

somebody slit my throat today definitely more entertaining than sonic 4

#####

in my experience this is one of the most overhated sonic games in the entire franchise and for completely idiotic reasons duhh he stands on the wall why is there a homing attack in 2d completely ignoring that the homing attackair dash has been in every game in the series with 2d in it since 2005 why is it called sonic 4 and so on and so forth

yes the name is stupid this game doesnt play anything like sonic 1 sonic 2 sonic cd sonic 3 or sonic  knuckles and the developers themselves know it since the achievement for beating the first level within a certain timeframe is literally impossible without using the speed gained from the airdash

lets talk about that shall we unlike the classic games which relied on using the terrain to go fast sonic 4 follows a formula more similar to the sonic rush series where speed is gained and maintained by the players own accord put sonic from 4 on a completely flat stretch of ground and he will hit top speed in no time wheras the classic series sonic will be stuck on a speed cap because he relies on terrain to go faster this is the fundamental difference between the two

use that airdash extend those jumps control yourself perfectly in midair go fast faster faster this is a sonic game made for sick speedrunning above all else just like the rush games

while somewhat brief and visually underwhelming this game really is a treat for those willing to give it a chance

#####

just your normal sonic the dog game
if you can manage to beat dr eggman on the last world then good job

#####

every time i try to give this game another chance im reminded at how terrible and tedious it is to play you should never fight the game to get it to do what you want and whatever they did with this totally not a mobile game mobile game is a travesty i just dont have the patience to keep going

#####

fantastic addition to the good old side scrolling sonic the hedgehog series

bgraphicsb are more or less the same on all platforms unfortunately the game has a fixed internal resolution of 720p and no aa so all the 3d models have jaggies galore i managed to get some aa going with an injector radeon pro i think it may be possible to force aa in windowed mode as well

bsoundb is pretty standard sonic fare everything you would expect for a sonic game

bgameplayb is essentially unchanged from the original games aside from some extra spin dash moves plays pretty much the same as the old games and i would rate the difficulty as pretty similar which means that it is quite challenging the game  takes much longer than the older games to finish it took me a few afternoons whereas the older titles could be completed in less than an hour

a well put together game worth the modest price and the next episode ticks all the same boxes

#####

if i keep telling myself its still 2d sonic i can apparently overlook a lot

im biased i grew up on 2d sonic so im a sucker for it weird not necessarily bad pc port needs java installed a less than ideally applied homing jump attack kinda clunky controls in back and forth areas absurdly easy stages endless amounts of lives 100 by the end for me one hundred a slow clunky end boss its only half a game and even a soundtrack that misses the mark all of it and plenty more nitpicks wasnt enough to ruin my day because its still 2d sonic  the game is definitely not great though and arguably doesnt deserve the 4 

you shouldnt have to make your own fun in a game coughlookinatyouachievementscough but for sonic ill put in the effort chaos emeralds were a must for any sort of challenge and the rewarded super sonic is a blast the controls and speed are near perfection over powered though he may be that was plain fun and then i even hunted down a couple achievements which is outside my normal as well its still a 2d sonic ill also note that i appreciated some of the level design in parts and the more subtle small homages to the predecessors 

i dunno i had some thrills but i had to actively hunt them down a very weak effort from the sonic folks they set their own bar high by making it 4 the game deserves the criticism it gets for sure but it isnt complete garbage maybe ive gone soft but i do softly recommend it on steep sale or bundled 

its still 2d sonic

#####

wen i play this game i feel like im playing some bad flash game form 2005

#####

i bought this game for two reasons i love sonic the hedgehog and nostalgia when i started up the game it reminded me of when i was five years old playing this game almost all the time however i wasnt so thrilled about the slow start sonic has when he moves at certain points this becomes bothersome and once nearly got me hit by the first boss still putting that small bit aside its not a bad game and it is better than sonic 06 though any sonic game is better than that particular game as for the music its catchy and i quite like it then again ive always been a fan of the music in most sonic games would i recommend this game its really hard to say i mean if youre a diehard sonic fan then by all means knock yourself out if noti would suggest watching a lets play on youtube then decide if this is for you

#####

sonic has overall had a very rough time as a franchise and while some could say hes been on this upward trend the past few games this game which came out around sonic colors is generally not included in that this game graphically speaking looks fine nothing earth shattering at all but the assets that are there are fine sonic is a full 3d model while everything else minus eggman and badniks appear to be very hd sprites they dont exactly blend together easily but it isnt bad everything else however leaves a lot to be desired plot eggman did a bad sonic stops him to jump the gun a bit the final level is apparently made to revive metal sonic from sonic cd in the next game but thats the only real link between the games and it isnt even brought up in this game music i used to enjoy this soundtrack a lot but it is definitely on the weaker side of sonic music granted the weaker side of sonic music can be very good still but this is trying to emulate the genesis music and it doesnt work too well

gameplay this is whats truly terrible about the game sonic has no momentum whatsoever he stops on a dime the moment you let go of the controls a far cry from what he was like in the games this is framed to be a follow up to the classics on the genesis he also has the homing attack which serves no purpose if the levels werent designed to use it constantly overall gameplay feels clunky and not great

i dont think this is a good jumping in point for the sonic series if youre a sonic fan you likely already have this game and thats fine i spent maybe 2 hours playing through the game just to beat it the rest of my 20 hours was spent trying to get all the achievements which i did and do not recommend overall id say wait for a sale if you truly want to get it sonic games go on sale fairly often here on steam and this one normally drops significantly from its normal 10 price try it if you want you should be able to finish the game within the 2 hours before you can refund it

#####

erm what the xander this is what happens when the xander

#####

about an hourlong exhibit of dimps completely misunderstanding what sonic is a cringeworthy attempt at nostalgia by rehashing classic level themes with a poor plasticlike 3d art that is an eyesore music made out of melodies that are too short but loop in the most annoying way and arranged with the worst dyingcat synthetizers jun senoue could find nonexistent physics that make absolutely no creative use of the level design and whatever little speed you can get renders you no momentum at all bosses are just old bosses from the classic trilogy making a reappearance

the special stages are lifted straight from the first game that is to say the least interesting special stage in the history of the franchise and honestly youd think that a game that tries so hard to cash in the longings of classic sonic fans would not feature this insanely ugly stretchedout dark blue sonic sauntering away

if you must play this to see for yourself how truly awful this trainwreck is get it in a discount bundle

#####

absolute dross dont waste your time with it no originality and no charm

someone in sega had some real brass to call this sonic 4 when in fact it is a poor attempt to emulate sonic 2 with levels and enemies basically using the same tile sets from 25 years ago

sonic is slow to get moving which leads to some unfair instadeaths by getting caught between two platforms that you saw colliding well ahead of time but simply couldnt move fast enough to avoid they have also introduced a boss rush at the end which is tedious and lazy as you only beat those bosses 1020 mins ago

#####

i was excited for this but the controls are just wrong
it feels and plays like an old flash game from newgrounds or something 
the graphics look ok but the controls are a dealbreaker
fix the controls and im in

#####

heres the thingi quite enjoyed the game lmao but its a game that i think only someone with a heavy passion for sonic can endure and maybe appreciate its complicated not a good game but it is enough for you to have a good time but unless you really like sonic i dont recommend p

#####

dont buy unless on sale obviously

#####

a lot of people are way overzealous about this game acting like its the antichrist or something its not if it was an indie platformer and not a sonic game id probably call it flawed but charming but it is a sonic game and compared to the other 2d sonics available its just not fun to play the movement doesnt feel good and the graphics are not welldone why is sonics sprite so overexposed

if youve really wrung everything out of 1 2 3 k cd mania and at least the first two sonic advance games i never played the third or much of rush or rush adventure sure pick it up but if not id recommend any of those games over this any day

regarding the low playtime i first played through this game on 360 and got the pc version as part of a bundle

bad i only got this game cause it was on sale and i wanted to make my steam library look bigger tbh

#####

not horrendous buy if its on sale i guess or in a humble bundle or in that mega sonic pack thing

#####

i didnt think it could be as bad as people said 

i was wrong 

its laggy slow and awkward level design is poor barring a few gimmicks levels set you up for enemies out of nowhere
the screen is soomed in more than on previous games meaning even with a widescreen rather than an old 43 like the old genesis games you see less than on something like sonic cd 

bosses are recycled from old genesis games just with a tiny gimmick added

the first two zones are mostly recycled from genesis games 

music is uninspired and bland 

special stages have awful control cheat goal hits to knock you out of the level poorly designed too instead of get to the gem now its go get rings to open a gate then maybe you can get to the gem im sick of retrying the 7h special stage i quit with the sht laggy controls its not fun its not challenging its just bad 

this is garbage

#####

everything about this game is wrong it feels really slow sonic has been possessed by some cheap marketing team and is no longer a part of team sonic wtf sega why would you do this

#####

generally its a good game  but has one of worst boss levels in the series

seriously the developers were really being dks while making the boss levels 
making them random unpredictable and top of that you have to repeat longas sections to try your luck again really made me ragequit many times

music are ok visuals are beautiful level designs are alright not bad at all

its nerveracking sometimes but i recommend you to play it if you love sonic 2d games over the abysmal 3d ones

710

#####

after buying sonic generations and loving it i jumped at the chance to try sonic 4 a 2d based game that trys to capture the spirit of the original genesis games what could possibly go wrong

turns out a lot of things whilst its true that the games are 2d and that we play as sonic this doesnt feel like a sonic game the physics are unnatural in comparison to the originals or to generations it handles poorly and the implementation of the homing attack causes more problems than benefits created the music is rather dull and very repetitive it doesnt help that out of frustation i just alt tabbed out of the game and closed the game via my taskbar and that the music didnt stop playing despite the gaming having been closed map design is also sketchy on one map in particular i have just died three times in a row due to the necessity of using the homing attack on carefully placed opponents to pass a giant gap in which a fall will instantly kill you this is all fine and dandy except for the bit of the end platform being far away from the final monster in which you dash in to 

simply put im not having any fun playing this and if this were a modern players first experience with any sonic game then they are going to be left with a poor taste in their mouth

#####

all of the zones in this game are just remixes of past zones from the first two sonic games only with a different name  all of the bosses are just remixes of past bosses from the first two sonic games  the game manages to control worse than the original sonic games the game is kind of ugly to look at as well  only play it if you are an avid sonic fan who feels the need to beat every sonic game  sonic mania looks like a godsend compared to this

i remember playing this round the time it first came out and i didnt enjoy it one bit and that point still stands to this day sonic 4 episode 1 is something i wouldnt recommend in an honest opinion if you were to pick it up dirt cheap go wild but maybe try episode 2 or something like mania instead

i cant believe i liked this game as a kid

#####

man i wasnt expecting sonic 4 to be this horrible the graphics look like sonic 3d blast the music is not that good and the first two levels are obviously recreations of green hill and casino night renamed splash hill and casino street the controls and physics are weird letting go of the move stick in mid air just stops all of your momentum dead where you stand or float i say the spin dash is usually slower than just running and sonics running animation just looks plain unnatural i ragequitted on mad gear act 1 because sonics slow acceleration made it impossible for me to outrun the crushing platforms near the end

honestly im just glad i got this in the 25th anniversary humble bundle instead of spending 10 so im not even mad because i also received the classics sonic 1 2 3 and cd

#####

ive been a sonic fan for as long as i can remember ive played them all from sonic the hedgehog on the sega mega drive 1991 all the way to that mediocre racing game from 2019 to be honest around 90 of those games are pretty fucking atrocious this is no exception in fact this game kind of makes me want to commit mass genocide its bad associating this steaming pile of goat shit with the masterpiece that is sonic the hedgehog 3  knuckles and even going so far to consider it a sequel is absolutely abysmal in conclusion fuck you sega to be fair i dont think this game deserves all the shit people give it it isnt that bad especially compared to the likes of sonic 06 fuck that game

#####

apparently sonic 4 has covid  youll literally get a disease if you play this game  so make sure you wash your hands thoroughly ifwhen you somehow manage to finally complete this absolutely terrible physicsridden worst of the series sonic game

the worst thing about this game as said above are the physics  walking around is not responsive the sonic 2 style spindash somehow manages to work on walls you instantly stop moving leftright the very moment you release your finger and more

special stages somehow end up being worse than sonic 1s special stages and theyre even more annoying to control

also the configsetup uses redundant securityhole ridden out of date java  but someone remade it in c thankfully so make sure you find it  download it especially if you do not want to install  use java  the game itself does not use java however

if you are thinking about making sonic 4 your first platformer dont just dont  start your platforming with another sonic game instead or other platformer  not this  because sonic 4 might actually give you a bad impression of the platformer genre and turn you away from playing any other platforming game

not recommended  unless you want to literally torture yourself from how bad the game plays

#####

this game was very and i mean very mediocre
i had to force myself to finish it 100 the graphics made me legit sick the first time i played
and what were they thinking with reusing the unused sonic 3d blast boss theme
however mad gear zone is fun i guess 
all of the zones in the game are previous zones suffering from an identity crisis


#####

this game is really bad mobile game quality graphics terrible physics bad level design and a tedious final boss fight is the cherry on top playing the game is a chore

#####

its actually a bad game this isnt a meme review like its actually bad buy sonic mania instead

#####

uninstalled and went back to emulating the classics

#####

i have always been a fan of the classic sonic games and not the new ones too much however since this game looked similar to the classic games i bought it and gave it a try and what did i think it sucked balls dont waste your money on this game its just too boring and easy i rate this game 210

#####

wtf is this piece of shit

#####

being a huge fan of the classic sonic games i was looking foward to playing this but i dont know how to feel about this game one side of me is saying common its a throw back to the classics and a sequel to sonic 3 and knuckels but the other side is says noo why is there this horrible looking cellshading what these physics are horrible and why is every level just a ripoff of one from the classic games splash hill zonegreen hill zone  casino street zonecasino night zone lost labrinth zonelabrinth zone and mad gear zonemetropolis zone all though i have said these bad thing about this game i cant stop my self coming back to it and replaying it even though the physics are not right and every level is a rip off its a small 30 min and done platformer and i cant see anything wrong with that i will give it a nooo my childhood is ruined sonic has green eyes10

#####

ass

#####

its decidedly mediocre you wont come back to it much but whats there is interesting its also a pretty bad port ive given a link in the forums for a 1080p fix the game is native 720p with no options last time i played and of course the superior mobile textures for characters and sonic that get rid of the horrific light shading they have on all of them only in this game though and only for the better systems did they implement this horrible shader the mobile stuff at least restores the blue to sonic and the characters look much more appealing

the sonic 4 e2 doesnt need mods but this one definitely does make sure you get them in the discussion forums

so why do i recommend it well its currently mixed and sonic fans should at least give it a run through for super cheap nothing wrong about that and there are a couple nice levels in this game it does have a unique visual style among the modern games and while you might not prefer it its worth spending an hour or two on otherwise this is not one of the best sonic games episode 2 is much better

#####

avoid just avoid horrible horrible horrible game that somehow manages to have a physics engine that is worse than the 20 year old original sonic and when i say original sonic i dont mean mega drive sonic i mean master system sonic broken doesnt cover it

#####

sonic 4 may not be the best game out there but its not as bad as some reviews make it out to be if you do decide to get it i recommend installing a graphics mod to fix the lighting issues on the models which can be pretty bad when you first start playing also be sure to launch the game from the launcher sonic_launcherexe in its local files to adjust the controller support and window sizes

i didnt think sonic 4 episode 1 was as bad as people say it is sure the boss fights are really aggravating and the lost labyrinth boss is the worst fight to exist in a sonic game thanks to its amazing instantkill crushers but honestly sonic 4 feels like a lostintranslation lowquality love letter to sonic 1 or more closely sonic pocket adventure just with all the stars not aligning in its favour

i noticed that the game uses a lot of familiar level themes and ideas but as someone who started playing the series during sonic 4 i found the levels to be a unique and enjoyable set of reimaginings for instance egg station zone felt like a fresh take on the classic death egg zone with a new boss rush before the finale that made it even more exciting additionally the introduction of the pinch mode mechanics provides a greater challenge as the player fights against robotnik the new homing attack featured in this title is a great addition and is perfectly suited for this game i have found it to be very useful especially during highspeed sections when i need to escape dangerous obstacles or i just want to beat robotnik quicker

in terms of level design its decent overall the emphasis seems to be more on using bounce pads and springs rather than speed but its not the worstlevel design out there the stages often incorporate new gimmicks into old ones such as splash hill act 3s zip lines or mad gear zone act 3s crushing wall that follows the player throughout the level the physics of sonic in this title are not well done the game is about speed but often sonic moves too slowly it takes a while for sonic to start running and his ball form slows him down making spindash a less effective move to use

the music in sonic 4 is created in the style and with the same sound fonts as the genesis which i enjoy however with the release of sonic superstars the music can at times sound harsh to the ears i know of someone who got a headache from listening to music for too long despite this i appreciate sonic 4 for staying true to its original idea of being a new genesis game by incorporating this theme into its music

to sum up sonic 4 is not the finest game in the sonic franchise but it could be a decent choice for those who are interested in playing a mediocre game or are seeking a somewhat classic gaming experience however if you are looking for sharp pixel art physics that resembles the old titles better gameplay and special stages and the return of two classic characters then sonic mania plus would be a superior option for you

#####

im sorry to say but even for big sonic the hedgehog fans this game is overcomplicated has cheesy 3dgraphics and is quite annoying due to its bad pccontrols also the leveldesign on the misterious labyrinth is simply annoying

#####

i really love this game despite the negative critics its fun to play to 

#####

id request a refund but doing so would cause me to lose features in sonic 4 episode ii honestly id even say that i prefer the ios version as it seems to have tighter controls and a better stage selection 
this game is horse shit im dead serious its not the worst sonic game by any means but it is for damn sure the worst sonic game ive ever played i got it on discount thank god while getting all the other sonic games so i decided to give it a whirl

first 10 minutes were good splash hill despite being a green hill clone was pretty good so were the first 3 special stages they were somewhat challenging but still fair
and then it took a dive into a dumpster fire 
casino street act 1 was fine and special stage 4 was okay however act 2 was an absolute nightmare shitty homing attack chain placement bottomless pits over flipping platforms you cant memorize the only good thing about act 2 was the card decks but even then the stage wasnt good i went into special stage 5 and it wasnt fun
act 3 was mediocre to say at least spikes you cant see bad hazard placement but other than that it just felt like a lategame stage in the wrong place at the wrong time
lost labyrinth act 1 special stage 6 and mad gear 1 were the last stages i played before giving up
ll1 is ok bad boulder placement super gimmicky but other than that an ok stage
special stage 6 was a shitheap its a labyrinth a terrible one once you get to the end it bounces you into the goal if you even move a small bit
mg1 had terrible enemy placement and constantly damaged me just because i went off a spring crushers were bullshit and annoying to dodge and i only got about 910ths through the level before giving up
i decided to watch everything else the true ending isnt even satisfying and spoilers ive already fought all the bosses in the game on the ios version the final zone isnt even fun either
personally i think the ios version is better by an absolute fuckin longshot

dont buy this unless you want episode metal in sonic 4 ep ii this is a warning



i re downloaded it it just gets worse
i got the 7 emeralds lost labyrinth 2 has a fun gimmick its actually pretty good 3s alright just labyrinth and hydrocitys mistake child
mad gear 2 was good and special stage 7 is actually clever mad gear 3 was just cheap deaths and mad gear boss was fun egg station just sucks the final boss is fucking cheap and i hope whoever made this game got fired no matter how important they were i cant even comprehend how shitty this game is it hurts my body

the ending gimmick isnt even good either its pointless just like this game

#####

this is genuinely one of the worst things i have ever played the visuals caused me eye strain like i havent had since the virtual boy the controls are floaty and imprecise the game is just flat out terribly designed and even the music is not that good the fucking music in a sonic game the one thing they always get right the one saving grace are the special stages which are a very welcome distraction from the trash heap that is the rest of the game even if someone offers you this for free dont do it its not worth playing in the slightest

#####

the physics really are as bad as youve heard even if youve only played a little bit of sonic like ten years ago on a sega genesis youll probably still notice the problems right away it feels like a badly made flashbased fangame even that one doom mod somehow felt closer to correct than this heres a quick vid httpyoutubec0zesfxlp4y

the sad thing is that the level design does seem pretty good but since its such a chore to get around those levels that just doesnt matter much visually its a mixed bag much of the artwork is very good but at the same time it seems to lack any antialiasing which is needs and many of the animations are oddly bad the music is still pretty good though

if sega just patched in better more consistent physics this would suddenly become quite a good game but they havent and they probably wont so its not

#####

its fun enough but not nearly as good as generations thats for sure

#####

the physics and animations are sluggish a death knell for a game thats supposedly about speed sonics movement has a clumsy underwater feel to it

better to replay s3k and wait for sonic mania to come out

#####

ever since this game released i was wondering why was it so panned i can understand weird phisics but all the gameplay looked good enough and then i played today and now i realize why

green hill zone is the only area that had gameplay shown of this this game has angered me more than any other game not because its hard but because of how frustrating the levels become once you hit the casino zone i made it to the next area only to run into an even more frustrating puzzle

this was bad really bad after getting stuck in that puzzle i can tell you im done with this game this was advertised as a sequel for the classic sonic games yet this game brought elements that only slow sonic down the 10 minute time limit is insulting considering how unfair some of the obstacles are

im a fan of hard games i played and beat super meat boy with keyboard but this this game is just cheap difficulty im glad this was part of the sonic collection bundle if i had grabbed this individually i would have felt ripped off

just avoid this game i can only summarize it in one word annoying

#####

the sprite of sonic walking just feels like catwalking on greese

#####

its a good game the only problem with it is that the controls could be better if the physics was like on the genesis it actually would be a great game i think
the level design is great so thats a plus for me so unless you are a sonic purist i think this game is worth your while even if it is a bit too short

#####

i got this game for free so i cant complain too much about it but im still going to complain about it the special stages specifically the later ones are patience testing to say the least the stages themselves are not memorable except for maybe the second casino nights level which is memorable for all the wrong reasons the music is not great except for maybe two levels its just not a good game been fun to toy around with for free though i just wouldnt pay money on it

#####

so i never played any sonic games as a kid i started playing all the 2d sonic games sonic 1 sonic 2 sonic cd sonic 3 and sonic  knuckles i enjoyed all 5 games the play style was pretty similar so it was easy to go from one to the next after sonic  knuckles i was like okay on to sonic 4 it immediatey felt so different from its predecessors it felt like they tried to mix in game mechanics of 3d sonic games into a 2d sonic your walking speed feels incredibly slow it takes a while to get up to max running speed it isnt like old sonics where you charge up your spin dash and let it rip and keep going you constantly need to be holding right the homing attack kinda oversimplifies a lot of platforming so your basic game strategy is hold right and mash jump 

as far as graphics go it looks like it was a launch game for the dreamcast its still vastly superior to every other 2d sonic game 

the way momentum works or rather doesnt work is so different from all the classic games and also defies logic on a basic fundamental level that it almost completely ruins the game experience 
i got the game in a bundle but it isnt that enjoyable if youre a fan of the series it might be worth for you just because its easy and its still sonic but at a casual level its just less enjoyable

#####

just shut up and play sonic mania already

#####

за что мне всё это

#####

this game was made at a time when a lot of former sonic fans were becoming disenfranchised from the sonic brand  werehogs shadow sonic 360

so they said hey well make you guys sonic 4 just like the old days

yeah just like the old days  if you borrowed sonic 1 and 2 levels enemies bosses  i mean i understand throwbacks but this is just lazy  this is the most uninspired poor level designed buggy physics and lazily done shitfest of a game

saying this game was a hey thanks to all our long time fans who stayed with us even though we made sonic 360 nostalgia tribute would be like if i said hey remember those old dunkaroo snacks and then kick you in the fucking groin

#####

a poor imitation of the classic sonic titles the physics are absolutely appalling the level design is bad the graphical style looks terrible the level gimmicks are not good and all the levels and bosses are just rehashes of levels and bosses from sonic 1 and sonic 2

#####

this is not a sonic game this is a horror game

#####

side scroller made in 2012 with worse graphics than donkey kong country 1994
billed as a new sonic levels are poor remakes of old sonic 12 levels
episodic release means its more expensive than it should be
game crashes pc when exiting
just overall bad quality unfun

#####

the physics in this game is very off too slow to start running too fast to stop its very unnatural and annoying

#####

one of the video games of all time

#####

this game made me cry

#####

incredibly poor release textures are very low res including menu elements it looks like a direct rip from a wii game physics are extremely floaty and difficult to control with all of the usual sonic off screen hits youve come to expect this game is absolutely not worth your time or money

#####

puedes experimentar lo mismo golpeándote la cabeza con una roca repetidamente durante 90 minutos

#####

decent presentation and soundtrack
good sense of speed even better with super sonic
the homing attack feels like a natural addition and is utilised well
every level feels unique

too many springs and boosters to the point where the game plays itself at points
locations recycled from previous games
physics are not the same as the classics and can be hard to adjust to

7510

#####

as the title suggests sonic the hedgehog 4 episode 1 is a follow up from the classic mega drive trilogy we all know and love is it worthy of the name sonic 4 not really as the game features modern sonic with his homing attack and levels inspired from sonic 1 and 2 making them look like jokes the bosses are unoriginal as well as they are taken straight from the mega drive games and are complete jokes too even the final boss the soundtrack does have some catchy tunes splash hill and mad gear but it shouldve gone for more modern music instead of mega drive samples another major problem is the physics as it feels like sonic has no proper momentum half the time despite its flaws sonic 4 episode 1 is a good game and i really enjoyed it but if youre wanting innovation here look somewhere else 710

#####

this game lacks the amount of chromosones needed for a good and fun game design

#####

sonic the hedgehog 4  episode 1 is a challenging but enjoyable game

during the first playthrough seasoned sonic players will be able to complete most of the stages easily with the exception of the final boss which requires some practice to beat 

collecting the chaos emeralds in this game involves traversing a psycadelic maze where you control the gravity and let sonic fall through the maze collecting all seven chaos emerald allows sonic to transform into super sonic on the main levels

in addition to the story there is a small number of achievements to add to the experience some are unlockable just by playing the game while some are quite difficult there is also a leaderboard feature for those who want to compete with the best

here is how i would rate the game

graphics 710  not to much of a fan of the 3d sonic sprite or some of the enemy sprites otherwise graphics are nice

music 710  a good simple and oldschool sonic soundtrack would deduct some for casino street music and final boss music which sounds a bit like a ripoff from sonic 2

controls  1010  controls are simple and easy to master 

gameplay  810  gameplay is good most levels are possible to beat at the first try but often more rewarding paths can be found if you know the level deducting some points as some levels feel more streamlined than others and the fact that you can sometimes die from getting hit by an enemy in such a way that you fall into a death trap and get squished 

difficulty 710  certain aspects of the game require numerous tries which i think makes it good certain annoying enemies as well as death traps make it more difficult to reach the special stages some of these stages can also be quite difficult to beat not to mention the final boss

i have enjoyed playing this game so far and would recommend this over of sonic cd as it is possible to replay all stages as you want in sonic 4

final rating 710

crimsonr

spoiler

collecting the 7 chaos emeralds and defeating the final boss does not unlock a final battle instead it just reveals a cliffhanger as metal sonic is shown with the words to be continued in episode 2 decided to deduct a point on the final rating for this as collecting the chaos emeralds only to allow invulnability feels a bit wasted there is a couple of achievements yes but still

#####

not my kind of sonic game

#####

slow clunky horrible  one of the worst entries in the sonic franchise

#####

wow just wow they outdid themselves here please just buy sonic generations and play that instead

#####

nope engine sucks buy sonic mania instead

#####

well at long last im working up the guts to say goodbye to the franchise of the blue dynamo on whom i wasted so much fandom a mistake i hope not to sink into next fanding 

i have no right to jump in and make like i am with everyone on ratting this game as the disappointment it is said to be not when i have played it as much as i have for as long as i have and actually grinded it

simply if youre up for sonic but with different physics and this is on sale for cheap  i mean very cheap like 75 off  then maybe sonic 4  yes i say i like it but the name is ridiculous  could be a good time waster

to be fair they introduce some concepts in here i do like that actually made me a sucker while everyone else saw right through them level mechanics like running on a road of cards staying on top of the boulder to the end of a long roll and finally having a consistent homing attack in a strictly 2d game arent enough to make it a great sonic game but theyre satisfying when you get it down heck even the torches were satisfying the clear once i figured them out

i wont bother listing the cons because everyone else already has that down pat read any one of hundreds of reviews for those very good reasons not to get it but if you still want to give cheap a shot again i recommend it on a very very steep sale

#####

this game bugged when i was in middle school and it says i have 78 hours its really annoying

#####

woof segas had some real stinkers and this one is right up there with the greats sonic 4 looks and plays like a chinese knockoff of itself the graphics are so lowbudget its ridiculous stages looks like theyre made with some amateur game artists stock pngs while sonic is an ugly overly shiny 3d model honestly ive seen betterlooking platformers on the 3ds sonic 4s controls are also terrible the action is based around the homing attack where you react to an annoying little iblipi noise and accompanying red targeting reticules by pushing the jump button automatically sending you to the targetunless it bungs up or theres something in the way or something else goes wrong its outright frustrating to play doubly so if youve ieveri played any 2d sonic the momentum in sonic 4 is just idongsi its a truly baffling kind of bad the music is in my own personal opinion awful i hated the fake fmsynth instrumentation and every song i heard before i quit was headacheinducing

as a side note the casino zone okay so there are several long stretches of hazard in this stage where you have to make precise platforming jumpssomething difficult with these jank controlswhile under the gun of the platforms quickly turning on and off its very easy to die because one mistake usually means a fall and the platforms are all floating over these ilooooongi instantdeath pits its hard as hell and frustrating thanks to the wonk controls whats interesting is the stage also gives you an iassloadi of extra lives as a safety net hey we know this stage will cost like 15 lives so here you go i dont get that either make the stage easier or leave it hard as hell but dont just inegatei the difficulty by letting me try it a million times with no consequences why even have lives if youre just going to hand em out like candy

to put it bluntly this game is dildos all around i truly dislike it and i fucking ilovei sonic

#####

feels like a kids fan project speed and handling is all wrong the graphics are generic and flat and none of it feels good its even dependent on java to run

#####

basically  it looks like sonic but it doesnt play like sonic  there is no longer conservation of energy which was something sonic sonic 2 and sonic 3 all got right

#####

 

 no ta bueno




no lo compres


 





#####

while tolerable sonic 4 just doesnt feel right  movement is sluggish and devoid of fun partly due to the new physics and partly due to frustrating level design  overall it sometimes feels more like a cheap knockoff than the real thing

youre not going to poke out an eye by playing this but youre not going to gain much either  that said if you got episode i as part of a bundle its worth a go just please dont buy it

#####

i recommend this game only as a sonic fan the visuals are nice

other than that the game is  clunky sonic isnt very responsive  controls  feel dead and it  runs on java level design feels  like they were designed by interns and lack excitement

if you want to buy this play the older games first

#####

its a bit hard to write a review for this game because its just there anyways i gave it a go and heres the main points

pros
gameplay is for the most part perfectly okay
its a game i guess

yeah thats all i got lol

cons 
its sooooo ugly
the bosses are boring
the last boss is super boring
price is a bit high considering you dont really get that much playtime from it an hour or two at best basically
some of the mechanics are rather dull


overall the best way to explain the game is that its mid asf like just buy any other sonic game on steam theyre all better than this pretty much if youre a diehard sonic fan i guess this might a game worth getting but its just nothing special doesnt stick out at all and has no real reason to exist really

#####

sonic the hedgehog 4  episodes 1  2 are simply nothing more but a mere cashgrab to capitalize on the early 2010s retro revivals having modern sonic in classicstyled levels doesnt see like a bad idea on paper especially considering the success of dimps sonic advance titles it seems like a good ideafor a mobile game but the fact that they changed it to a multiconsole episodic release and changed the name from sonic the portable to the nowinfamous sonic the hedgehog 4 just makes the whole project really confusing with the clashing of modern sonic in the really plasticlooking classic level designs and other i better i releases that utilize classic sonic elements like generations mania and even superstars makes the whole sonic 4 project look dated and worse in hindsight

i wouldnt even call it absolutely horrible strike save for the eargrating soundtrack strike but i can call it boring its just a whole lot of nothing at least i got this and episode 2 while its on sale so its not a huge loss but if youre looking for a modern day classic sonic experience do yourself a favor and buy generations mania and superstars instead

#####

i dont think ive ever been so mixed on a game before one half of me is saying that it is pretty alright and is worth the money the other one says its garbage and should not be bought despite me picking to not recommend it i admit i had some fun with this game in fact ive played it more then sonic mania no really i haveim wierd i know but since most people are not like me and are not wierd ima say that its not worth it theres better games out there no doubt 

heck even if you are like me i would probably not recommend it since im not gonna return to this game ever again i had fun while i tried to complete it but after i beat it my will to play the game again quickly died if you really want a game like this the maybe sonic 4 episode 2 is betterhavent tried it myself though



#####

this game is absolute sht

#####

its not the worst game i have ever played i did have fun with it but there are a few places where i felt the game needed more  development or testing i found myself bouncing between having fun and saying  fuck this game 
on the one hand i enjoyed it enough  that i managed to 100 complete it even with some of the achievements having bugs on the other hand im not sure i ever want to play it again so take that as you will there are much worse things here on steam to waste your money on but i would say that if you plan on getting this make sure its during a sale

#####

note i played this game first on ps3

indeed sonic 4 does have messed up physics and controls the graphics look like a 1995 game in the worst way and the level visuals are rethreads of old levels however there is some truly excellent level design like we rarely see these days and the soundtrack is great if you can overlook the obvious flaws i had great fun with this game

#####

i enjoy this game its a solid platformer albeit an easy one i like the astedics and the gameplay

its not perfect though if you squint your eyes enough youll see it for what it really is a phone game and some of interactions and elements dont translate to a more powerful machine and the graphics are way too super shiny and almost gross to look at i had to convince myself it was an art style to prevent them from being distracting which is a right shame because the animation and models themselves arent bad 

but in the end its just another causual sonic game to add to my collection

#####

do i really need to explain why this game is bad

models  gross music  gross physics  standing on ceilings homing attack  why card level  why game  sonic the hedgehog 1 except with worse gameplay feel art p h y s i c s youd think over a decade later theyd get better at game making c

#####

i love this game and hate it at the same time crappy physics broken achievements and copypaste mix of the zones from sonic 1  2 spoiled the impressions but basically the game is not that bad

#####

since episode 1 and episode 2 cost the same i suggest you buy episode 2

#####

where do i even begin first of all this game is not sonic 4 that goes to sonic mania being the true sonic 4 remember playing the genesis versions of the first 3 classic sonic games and sonic cd well please for the love of god do not play this as everything has been butchered here i have several complaints other than it just being a rehashed sonic 1 and 2 but if you want to absolutely know my thoughts exactly please watch cybershells video why sonic 4 sucks oh yeah i forgot to mention the developers of arzest can make a better 2d sonic game using 3d assets better than this with sonic superstars which shows you how terrible this game truly was for the time my ranking 110 never ever play this game

#####

not as bad as people say it is not the greatest pretty short but i still give it a solid 710
you can also actually use super sonic in stages and it feels just right overpowered for sonic but not so much that youre no longer playing the game looking at you modern super sonic in generations xd

#####

they should pay you for playing this game

#####

this is like if they made a best of sonic genesis collection and then stomp it into the ground with the death egg robot the physics and controls are terrible and sluggish the level design is bland and extremely derivative the music is okay the graphics are ugly the 100ing journey is not fun everything about this game is bad and a huge wad of worthlessness that should never be played by anyone regardless if they are new to sonic or not this is without a doubt one of the worst games ever made and one of the worst 2d platforms i have ever played avoid it at all costs unless you have a death wish

#####

this game is so ass i cant even kill the fking final boss 1010

#####

playing sonic 4 feels like shoving a straw up my pee hole id rather do that than play this game

#####

this game is nothing new just a couple levels from sonic 1 and 2 in 3d but worse with the final boss being 3 times easier than the one in 2 sonic handles like trash and thats the game only good thing is the game can be beaten in under 30 minutes so you dont suffer long
