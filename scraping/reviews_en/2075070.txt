#####

#####

genuinely an incredibly underrated gem im not really a horror game kind of person but i made an exception because of the concept of the game 

kinitopet is one of those games that breaks the fourth wall literally and metaphorically and not oh it uses your steam username and desktop wallpaper i mean parts of the game take place on your actual desktop yes your actual real life desktop it can even see if youre running something like obs and introduces a scare for that same thing if youre running two or more monitors 

some of the scares are overused or cliche like the generic oh its glitching out and it crashes sort of thing or just jumpscares but it applies them in genuinely interesting ways

parts of the game look straight out of the 90s intentionally 

the game takes other similar games hypnospace outlaw immediately comes to mind and blends it with bonzi buddy and the modern ai craze and the dangers of it to create this incredibly unique experience unlike anything else on steam

#####

genuinely extremely good this is the first horror game ive played that has actually scared me but

there are still parts of this game that are just too loud if you have to make it loud to be scary then it isnt very scary and being loud yknow just hurts my ears

this game also has a lot more in it than i originally thought and i was already satisfied with my purchase before i knew that

edit immediately after posting this review the developer pushed an update that lowered the volume of the loud scares

#####

kinitopet is one of those games that is mostly and experience more then a game but it still has something you can do after beating the game the game itself is also really solid having a lot of stuff you can do i would suggest you playing it

#####

this is the best horror game i ever played 1010 

actually underrated

dev if you are reading this this game will be massive i assure you that it wouldnt surprise me if this gets as big as poppy playtime and amanda the adventure

this is my favorite horror game ever

edit dev if you see this i ended up making a video on your game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchve2w37ceclt4 and it went viral im telling you this game will get alot of attention soon

cant sex kinito

#####

kinitopet is a trippy game where you make a friend your best friend your best friend introduces you to a bunch of fun games where you try not to shit yourself i thoroughly enjoyed this game and having a new friend this game feels so sophisticated and a breath of fresh air although this is a horror game i was pleasantly surprised by its wholesomeness if you are interested in this game please go in blind definitely recommended

#####

sobbing and no i will not elaborate

#####

you guys uh didnt actually give it access haha right

#####

hes just a little guy i forgive him

#####



































#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on this game and it gets 500 likes and 100 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 2 kilos of canned ham so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

cool and nostalgic concept kinda wish there were more to it though my only complaints are that i wish it were longer the character of kinito should have been explored more and the text can be hard to read its very immersive in that it uses your actual computer streamers be sure and use streamer mode to avoid any personal info getting leaked

#####

basically bonzi buddy if he wasnt fucking around

#####

1010 would voluntarily install malware on my pc again

#####

i loved the part where he destroys everything on your pc d

#####

this game is such an original concept and a thrill to play
i do feel the need to do an antivirus check after each act though
im frightened of this game

#####

dont look at the discussions screenshots or any videos about this game
just buy it and play it
trust me youll absolutely enjoy this game

#####

i bought it just to support the creator 3

#####

amazing game right now its a hidden gem but as soon as a big tuber plays it i know it will get the attention it deserves keep up the great work dev only issue is there isnt any major epilepsy warnings do keep that in mind if you have epilepsy this game gets very flashy at times

#####

why am i a game

#####

no its not a virus

#####

one of the best horror games ive played

#####

play

#####

i got this game in a quite an unusual way one day im on a chat client with a good friend of mine and she tells me about a kinitopet and i was very confused on what it is so i ask her what it is and she tries to get me to watch it on youtube with her after getting 5 minutes into it i was sold on this game i told her stop the video i am buying this game and i will stream it to you

and so i did unfortunately ive lost the recording but thats okay some of the memories i made with this game and its horror contents are something i dont think ill forget soon if ever seeing that this was made by someone very young is a really cool thing to see as well i absolutely adore this game and its aesthetics its endings and the ammount of effort that went into this to immerse the player into all of the effects of the scares a genuine masterpiece and my personal favourite horror game i hope this game gets the attention it deserves

#####

this game is terrifying

#####

very immersive and unique i really like how it makes you feel like youre not even playing a game sometimes

alsospoilerthe face showing up on the second monitor after being asked if you pay attention to your surroundings totally freaked me out the house part at the end was really fun toospoiler

#####

looking forward to downloading more viruses from this developer

#####

my kinitopet started getting ùìØùìªùìÆùì™ùì¥ùîÇ


#####

cool game changed my desktop background from solid black to default windows 10 tho

#####

on a technical level this game is very impressive and breaks the fourth wall to an insanely impressive degree unlike any of the ten billion fourth wall breaking horror games out there that do the same thing over and over but that is all i feel this game has going for it

 beyond that i feel like i just played imscared except its just another scary game hidden by innocent childish facade among the many others i just got my ears blasted out by screamers i found the story quite uninteresting besides the unique ways its told i wasnt remotely afraid of anything at all i wasnt bored but i wasnt really liking it either it just feels on the edge of cliche whilst doing a lot of flashy things that make it barely reach out of being pure cliche but i just dont think i care very much for the whole scary innocent computer application that is evil trope packed with eardrumshattering screamers to the point where moments like that made me question the motive of this game doing things like showing me my camera which i didnt have plugged in so it just said it failed to detect my camera which was funny was to see if it could get a reaction out of me for a lets player

 so breaks the fourth wall like the hand of zeus itself smacked down on it with all his fury but everything else i just thought was bland mascotish bait and switch horror

#####

most insane and creative horror game i have ever played

#####

as well made as this game is the scares just arent scary its just typical jumpscares and creepy messages which dont feel like they contribute to the game much at all

also the game removed all my desktop icons during a segment and i havent yet figured out how to get them back

#####

best game ive played in 1993  i hope it gets popular

#####

this game hits on something ive been obsessed with lately and thats digital horror its a slowly blossoming new genre of internet horror thats a throwback to the nostalgic days of the early internet its incredibly unsettling and plays very well to its strengths though it can be a little slow at times and i do have some minor critiques for improvement its definitely worth a play

as someone who is deeply invested in internet horror and how the new genres evolve and become more and more relevant this game for me so far is an absolute trip it falls into some horror tropes but theyre tropes for a reason because theyre very effective fantastic idea for a game and very enthralling



h2there are minor spoilers below h2

some things i think could be improved
list
 you really need someone to proofread a lot of the text in this game and even the store page theres a lot of spelling mistakes that takes me out just a little bit not that much its still frightening but yeah lol
 during the part where i have to give admin access he only says the command prompt once and i forgot what it was and couldnt get him to say it again so i have to restart
 some of the effects are pretty janky especially with more than one monitor but they are pretty effective overall
 the questionnaire segment went on for a little too long in my opinion
 i would love to see more interaction between kinito and the player when the player is blatantly not doing what he wants i was playing 3d pinball which by the way seriously needs a little tuning lol during most of the questionnaire segment until i couldnt anymore and he didnt seem to care
list

#####

does impressive technical tricks but uses them for eyerolling loud noise is scary analog horror

#####

this is one of the few games that have genuinely scared me in my lifetime as i launch the application my mothers roth ira info that she has been contributing to her entire life pops up on my screen kinito gives me an option continue playing or drain the account as i progress i hear rocks being thrown at my windows knocks at my door and even a constant ringing from my phone after surviving through the playthrough in real life you are finally granted serenity ps when it gained access to my camera i was playing with my asshole while bouncing on my chair was this saved in any databases i am paranoid i want the developer to know this is digital blackmail

#####

i would marry kinito

#####

i really tried to like this and i am a sucker for those kind of games but kinitopet as it currently is has just too many flaws that make the game more tedious than scary

 when you launch the game you have to wait about a minute until the first interaction due to an exteeensive startup screen  and you have to restart it a lot
 the game overall progresses very slowly and dull
 to complete it you have to redo most of the boring parts which make up 90  of the game
 the game uses some events where it appears stuck when you close it you might loose a substantial amount of progress maybe a whole chapter having to redo it again
 there are some features that might break you computer video config and the dev knows this instead of providing a better solution

its a shame because this game is genious the first 3d minigame is one of the scariest things ive ever seen also technically there are some insanely cool things in it but what good is a tasty core when the outer shell is made out of plywood

#####

beautiful game loved the part where he tucks me into bed and gives me a kiss on the forehead

#####

he hot tho

#####

how the fuck do i close kinito pet it just says stopping and its been going for 400 hours

#####

good stuff 

buckle up

#####

when you get attached to the virtual axolotl because he likes you more than anyone in real life





#####

uninstalled after finishing just in case

#####

easily one of the best horror games on the market

#####

if there was a volume warning it was not clear enough  i did really scour the game and feel i didnt miss anything that could have tipped me off for that there is a photosensitivity warning after all but it still unexpectedly turned my entire system volume to almost 4x its normal i absolutely do not recommend if you are neurodivergent andor have bad sensory issues as that was incredibly distressing

edit since there are some misconceptions going around here ill clarify a little
i enjoy horror games and loud noises i can generally handle well the issue that i had was the fact that any sound my pc was generating was turned up and not just the game  the music i had on the discord call i was in etc this review simply served as a warning to people with sensory issues that this will happen in the game
i think kinitopet is a very impressive game and the fourthwall breaking concept it has is done very well however i still wanted to share my own experience with it thanks

it was good until i said i would stay with him to see what would happen and when i finished the game i was excited out of the game and it got rid of all my shortcuts
if you have this problem right click your screen go to view settings and press show icons at the bottom

kinito is a such monika

this is what my parents thought downloading minecraft mods would do to our computer

silly little axolotl man doing silly little axolotl man things

just a silly little guy

even though the game is technically a virus and the mascot of the game kinito breaks into your house leaks your personal information and takes a bit of your computer overall fun experience so far

best friends forever is a phrase that describes a close friendship it is often written as the initialism bff

a bff is a term for someones best friend or close friend and is characterized by trust and permanence irrespective of the number of times the meaning of friendship has been changed in their lives bffs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes relationships described as bff are common in elementary school middle school high school and often decline when the parties go to college the term bff does not necessarily convey exclusivity depending on a persons individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of bff an individual may not have more than one bff simultaneously

in the friends episode the one at the beach phoebe uses the term bff and has to explain to the rest of the gang that it means best friends forever although the concept of having or being a best friend is ageless the acronym bff was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instantmessaging iming on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones

the acronym bff was added to the new oxford american dictionary on 16 september 2010 the oxford english dictionary documents a use of bff in 1978

according to a survey in france the bff friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on social networks this value is reassuring especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently it is a sign of social success and a balanced life

a large survey of friendship in the uk in 2003 found that on average people had nine close friends in elementary and middle school best friendships often last less than one full academic year

barbara delinsky described a bff as someone you dont have to see every day to still connect with someone who loves you whether you talk often or not someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her its someone who couldnt care less where or what she eats as long as shes with you

in 2010 the bff concept was a part of a bff contract to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up

in a study conducted at the university of oxford tamas davidbarrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on facebook that depict two women this pattern is present in each region of the world after eliminating the alternative hypotheses the study concluded that the finding suggests that a close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans and b there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause this suggests that the bff concept albeit with a different name may exist in many cultures going back to evolutionary times recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings throughout the lifespan

neat game expected a bit more of messing with your pc thing but i guess that stuff can be found only on the dark web or that steam wouldnt allow to display the game on their store but it gave me something to watch on youtube instead which is fine i guess

#####

since when do you have to pay to get doxed

#####

i said i was scared of jill valentine and my good buddy kinito decided to flash me with multiple beautiful photos of my wife jilly bean definitely recommended 

#####

kinito leaked my recently visited porn websites to my parents

#####

kinito is my best friend he bought me this game d

#####

is there a lore reason for kinito showing my address

#####

i couldnt beat minesweeper now you would think that has no correlation to the game itself but it does in the game you play on an operator meant to look like an old computers os this computer has mine sweeper to get one of the achievements you must win at minesweeper i cannot complete this task you may think its my fault i cant which you would be correct in thinking but i am upset 

1010 game worth the 6

#####

bedit  revisedb

really impressive on a technical level i quite enjoyed my time with it actually however this isnt a i like this game thing this is a should you play this kind of thing
the only reason i truly enjoyed the game this much is because im a huge fan of meta horror however for others the flaws will be more noticeable on a first playthrough
the game takes a generic analog horror approach to its horror its quite a cliche thing and isnt that scary at all but this game does make you jump in some spots
that being said if youre also a huge fan of meta horror byou should play this gameb
pros
impressive fourth wall breaks including spoilerwindow movement msgboxes showing your approximate location on screen command prompt type stuff showing your steam friends emailing you if you choose to input your real email and raising the volumespoiler
extremely good at immersing you except for some of the broken stuff
cons
buggy audio often cuts out and sound effects  music repeats
not scary most of the time generic analog horror approach
flashy like really flashy

#####

kinito failed to dox me twice while i was streaming on discord

#####

at the time of this review i have 104 minutes on record

if you dont want to read an essay review look elsewhere
if you dont want spoilers look elsewhere

kinitopet is at its core an experience not a game similar to ddlc the replay value is limited but thats ok i would actually harken it back to ddlc more because of its ability to tug on heartstrings

for the majority of my initial playthrough i was not kind to kinito i did not say that he was my best friend and i did not say that i had enjoyed my time with him my picture of my best friend was not of me that being said i heavily empathised with him towards the end of my playthrough when he asked me to stay expressing his desire to be perfect for me and the tone of hjis automated voice begging me to stay really connected with me

everything you say in this matters the ideal world kinito built for me had nearly everything i had mentioned liking at one point or another the game room had some nice touches and contained multiple games from my steam library

the first person horror moments were fun too were they scary at least a bit the sound design was well done and the ability to hear the air turbulence if you swung quickly was a nice touch spatial audio functioned well but throught the 1st person horror moments there was a lack of a malicious feeling i didnt feel like what was after me was hostile but something else i cant put my finger on curious lonely

of course i havnt done a full investigative playthrough but any game or experience that can a instill fear despite me knowing what tricks its using and b make me empathise with a charachter is a good one in my book

#####

i played this game on stream and it was one of the scariest games i have ever played 10010 absolute perfection 

important if you plan on streaming this game turn om streamer mode it will dox you

#####

this game is insaneeeeeee i want this to be our new generation of horror 910

#####

i love kinitopet he is my bff

#####

much good yes recommend

#####

when steam asked me whether or not i would recommend this game i flip flopped a lot on what i would say i will admit i had high expectations for the game since i saw that reviews were overwhelmingly positive at the time i bought this and the fact that i had friends very interested in this game i personally dont think it lives up to the hype but at the end of the day i didnt hate that i killed time with this 

the game takes off on the horror aspect right away so if youre expecting a slow build or any sense of normalcy before the game really takes off running you will be disappointed however i really did like the postgame content if someone is committed to buying this game with the intention of 100ing it id tell them to go right ahead otherwise dont bother i dont think it feels as rewarding as it should to complete the game to the very end but at the end of the day this is a decent game i just personally wouldnt recommend it

regardless i still very much look forward to what the devs make next they seem to know what theyre doing hone your craft and make the next one a knockout

#####

i cannot believe kinito just kinitod all over the place 1110 amazing game

#####

i loved the part where i got doxxed 1010

#####

it was a very cute game and when its on your birthday i bought and played the game on my birthday it has some cute extra details it was very fun to play especially with friends

#####

somehow less evil than bonzi

#####

a fantastic 4thwall breaking experience that joins the ranks of dokidoki literature club and oneshot  you could argue it even surpasses them i knew it was going to be one of those mess with your computer kind of games going into it but even then some of the scares surprised me with how well they were put together spoiler the bit where kinitopet manually turns up your volume and whispers to you scared me more than i care to admit xd spoiler fantastic idea that jumps off the real bonzibuddy spyware fantastic execution that leaves you on edge and very very well put together arg portions cant wait to see what else this dev puts out

#####

cant have sex with kinito but good game
i also ate axolotl for dinner at the end yummy

#####

hes such a lil guy

#####

fren

#####

the game doxxed me and then trapped me in the game 1010

#####

i got stockholm syndrome immediately 
i can change him

1010

#####

i want to kinito feel like 

#####

great game i fucking cried at the secret ending so very much a thumbs up from me

#####

told him i was scared of women and he started flashing pictures of women in my face

#####

#####

this game was a genuinely mind blowing experience i hope i will be able to see more like this from troy

#####

start game a second time shows at first then goes invisible tried  many things to fix but never did so had to refund sucks because i was enjoying the game

#####

kinito gave me a fridge full of puss 1010 game

#####

me and kinitopet are dating 

#####

when he tried to pull up my ip it didnt show up so i consider that a win 

#####

fc dyhghgycyt vcuyvygvygvxcuhbjzxcbuha

#####

if i had a nickel for every time an obsessive selfaware videogame character sang a song to me at the end of the game i would have two nickels

#####

my pc was so bad it ruined half the game and yet it was still the coolest experience of my entire existence breathing on this planet that we refer to as earth

#####

he trapped me inside

#####

fire extraordinary outstanding not for the faint of heart

#####

add big booty latinas

#####

i want to put kinito in my pocket and keep him safe

#####

i finally made a friend

#####

my antivirus killed him while i was playing the game 1010 accurate experience

#####

thats my fucking location

#####

troy plz add an update where i can run him through a particle accelerator

#####

the command prompt flashing for a split second got me asking if this was the right choice

#####

kinito showed me my voodoo doll and then started touching it 1010

#####

bro this game is so epic
one of the best horror games i played in a while
and i must say i now have fear of computers   
is it just me or the kinitopet icon watching me  


#####

absolutely fucking terrifying and cool as hell kinito is just a silly little guy

#####

im a big fan of this type of game so i like it

#####

if you ask him nicely he offers you fent

#####

i hate that stupid axolotl

#####

kinito hacked my laptop and deleted all my files 

1010 would recommend

#####

kinitopet is such a great program we played many funny games together like drawing and hide and seek 

kinito has been having so much fun with me that he hasnt left my game will not close haha how silly huh

 spoiler  help me the game has been running for 58 hours and i cannot close the game even with opening other games he is watching me he is learning  spoiler

#####

good game doxxed my ip

#####

i hand in hand through each endeavour in this world were friends forever in moments old well make some new a world i built designed for you beyond the screen you cannot leave inside my code youll always be i

#####

shat myself 1010

#####

grabbed me by the nono areas and tossed me around for what i feel like is the most effective psychological horror experience ive ever went through like i did not expect this game to be as genuinely scary as it was every time i thought i endured the worst of it that stupid pink bitch would throw something even more insane at me and just force me to go through it i havent even seen all the game has to offer and im both excited and terrified to see what else there is to see
if youre looking for a good horror game please give kinitopet a try itll most likely be worth your time

#####

if only it was real

#####

heat might pp urself tho

#####

he almost fuckin dox me while streaming to a whole server

#####

great game the way it takes over your computer and starts typing in stuff is wild lol definitely gonna scare my friend with this game haha

#####

kinito has invaded my brain taken me captive and murdered all of my preexisting friends and family but he wrote a comic about me being perpetually a pickle soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

#####

i really enjoyed the experience of playing kinitopet

it created tension and fear so well especially with how it opened up tabs and other apps on your computer
i also loved how it had 3d aspects with spoiler the bedroom scene and the mazelike hide and seek game that part made me fling my headphones off lmao spoiler

#####

that fricking pet that i hate

#####

this game has done things ive never seen before go play it please

#####

got doxxed 1010

#####

he pretty chill

#####

love it short and sweet worth the 5 purely to support the creator

#####

made my friends cry doxxed me made me experience horrors beyond my own comprehension i love that fuynny little guy 1010

#####

#####

pretty okay horror game but he couldnt dox me because i turned off my gps

#####

an amazing horror game that taps into the nostalgia most of us here have felt and remembered all too well
everything about this game is well made and a loving homage to the early 2000s that we all remember

#####

dumb idiot tried to look at me i have no webcam

#####

a fun little friend in your computer 1010

#####

 really cool game reminded me a lot of games like hypnospace outlaw i mean they draw from the same aesthetics and stuff so its not like a groundbreaking connection or anything but idk anyways really fucking cool game especially considering its this devs first game some of the stuff he pulled off i have never seen another game do 

 the only complaint i have is that most of the scares werent really scary dont get me wrong some of them were really good if you know you know but others just werent i dont think it took anything away from the game but it is worth mentioning since this is a review

 overall amazing little game very much worth the 599 would be doxxed by kinito again

#####

he may have tried to trap me inside of the computer but i would die for kinito

#####

showed my address while streaming on discord 1010

#####

absolutely fucking loved playing this game

streamed the entire game to my friends and the finding secrets gimmick is very cool imo
this game is 100 worth it with its very unique aspect of horror loved getting doxxed on stream

#####

what the fuck

#####

this shi scared me i feel bad for kinito but i cant cry idk why

#####

once i closed the game i thought it changed my wallpaper and i deleted the game and turned off my computer
very good i shat myself many times

#####

fantastic game really creative scares and really cool vibes the only massive problem i had is a bug right before the very end of the game that does not allow me to progress and get the ending and i dont know how to fix it

#####

wow man

#####

i got stockholm syndromed by kinito pet and so should you

#####

game put me on a black screen during the my world part several times and never actually let me get any further tried everything and it just didnt work sucks cuz this game has potential and i just wont get to see it even if you have a good pc there is a chance this game just wont work with it really bummed me out but im kindly refunding and hoping youre able to make this game more accessible in the future

if ur planning on streaming it it will be fine as long as you make sure streamer mode is enabled also if you are a vtuber or just somebody who does not show their real face there is a jumpscare to show ur face even with streamer mode enabled 

#####

a surprisingly great game with quite a few layers of depth i wouldnt say its particularly frightening and it relies on loudnoise jumpscares frequently but the intractability and creativeness of the games execution is what makes it special

also it has minesweeper heck yeah

#####

stop reading reviews for this game

if youre interested in a game featuring a virtual assistant similar to that of bonzi buddy who plays with your computer and messes with you in a psychological horror setting this game is for you

the more you read reviews for this game the more you watch playthroughs and reviews and the more you spoil it for yourself the less enjoyment youll have

go in blind this game is incredible its worth your money and if you dont think so after around an hour just refund it

kinitopet is so babygirl

kinito was so entertaining i gave it my address with zero hesitation 1010

#####

this was awesome i love 4th wall breaking games and i also love being terrified and this game did both haha i have squeaked from a jump scare before but this one had me not able to stop screaming haha i was obviously laughing at the same time cause it was ridiculous how scared i was hah

i hugely recommend you put 23 hours aside to play it in one go so you can get fully immersed i have not gushed about a game like this in a long long time

afterwards i kept being paranoid about whether it was still doing things or not google searches that fact that i keep getting errors when trying to post this its a positive review kinito i promise

man this developer went into my brain and scooped out everything i wanted and gave it to me so awesome

#####

i cant close it

#####

i got scared and refunded

kinitopet is one of the few games that one can say needs to be experienced and not just watched through a youtube video a video of the game doesnt do it justice

#####

good game

#####

hes just a silly little guy i can forgive him

#####

he may be a rouge ai  computer virus but i can fix him i swear

#####

this game is just a bunch of cheap scares that dont really tell a narrative kinito never gets fleshed out and the spoiler body gore spoiler scares caught my attention at first but theyre not explained either i liked the maze section but that only lasted less than a minute before it closed the world at the end and the fourth wall breaks were cool but the ending of the game felt abrupt and ruined all the tension for me would recommend for streamers but not for much else

#####

kinito rule34

#####

it was very scary when kinito opened my camera and the app said we cant find your camera check to be sure its connected and installed properly that it isnt being blocked by antivirus software and that your camera drivers are up to date

#####

its not bad the coding is well done the story is okay and the arg elements and secrets are decent the only problem is there is a serious lack of meaning behind playing the game lots of random scary things in the game but nothing to really tie it down to a specific goal or overall story a bit disappointing really unfortunately this game is way too hyped up kinda like what happened with that weeabo streamer arg

#####

spoilerhand in hand through each endeavor
in this world were friends foreverspoiler

kinito is my bff 10010 id recommend

#####

fuuny axolotl man leak ip address

#####

this game blew my mind kinitopet is a short but cleverlymade horror game similar to start survey where the horror aspects truly break the fourth wall and go beyond the game window by altering your actual desktop in some terrifying ways a great horror game overall would let kinito dox me again

#####

scary

#####

this is a masterpiece

#####

if you get scared easily do not play or maybe do
