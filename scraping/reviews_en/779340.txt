my pedigree 500 hours shogun 2 darthmod 300 hours warhammer 1 mostly played very hard

im not a total war expert but i understand most of its principles though im only a few hours into three kingdoms id like to point out some highlights here as most reviews i read were too abstract and didnt signal the major differences 3k has from older total war games

ubmilitarybu
in general battles resemble shogun 2 with its spearswordrangedcavalrysiege basic archetypes units are arranged to maximize rockpaperscissors matchups and generally volume wins however there is the notable shakeup of

uromance modeu  this essentially makes the generals like heroes from warhammer for better or worse strong 1v1 generals will win battles period dueling and killing generals will crush morale and cheese fights just like targeted damage spam from warhammer the ai is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win and even when they reject them you can simply rightclick on them and get the same result so far i have not seen any troops be effective against highstat generals  its common to outmaneuver an invasion using your garrison troops to route the enemy only to have their general stick around and solo your remaining squads

of course if you dont like that you can simply play records mode which i havent tried yet

urosteru
although all units fall into classic archetypes there are more units than reviews insinuated most of these are gated behind general archetypes and technology i can see these units substantially affecting the outcome of fights if you can afford them an example autocrossbow units from highcunning generals will grant you a highly costeffective ranged unit at the expense of a very weak general this might be a good choice for a defensive army that has walls to garrison

umilitary supplyu
this is the largest difference from previous titles in terms of military all armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your own territory and rapidly drains in enemy territory and during the winter  30 lost to enemey territory another 25 for winter even in your own territory once your supplies hit zero you suffer massive attrition losses this can be improved with infrastructure and character traits but without significant investments the net effect is that distant campaigns and prolonged sieges are extremely highrisk aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion this combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense gone are the days of spamming ashigaru to handle an unexpected attack or endlessly raiding a territory while waiting for reinforcements likewise the ai cant use these strategies solving the catandmouse games everyone hated in warhammer

ubstrategy layerbu
this is where i feel this game really shines compared to its predecessors there are many new mechanics here that are brilliantly interlaced one decision often begets 6 more requiring lots of forethought

ucommanderies aka provincesu
this has been made far more complicated than previous titles the game features a massive web of building trees each replete with collateral effects and synergies that make you consider the province as a whole rather than the usual oneproblemonebuilding method were used to compounding this is the commanderies system  known as provinces in warhammer these are groups of territories that are designed to be held together one territory of a commandery will contain the city and most of the buildings while attached territories will contain an exclusive building tree because building synergies are so powerful you are highly incentivized to own an entire commandery instead of mere parts this adds more intrigue to expansionist aggression as well as the excellent diplomacy system  with good relations the ai will gladly trade territories of equal value with you

ustaffu
managing your administration is a large component of 3k even with optimal buildings you will not have enough income without the right staff multiplying their benefits each staffs personality quirks will play heavily into what managing them will entail  in general you want to hire likeminded people to reduce conflict and maximize satisfaction but it is also important to hire personalities who satisfy the needs of your economy vanguards are better for industry commanders for peasants etc black sheep can still be effective so long as theyre kept away from their associates failing to satisfy them can have heavy consequences  people with significant power in your government can even start a civil war in my first run i found myself occasionally firing people i hired with insufficient foresight to avoid showering them in promotions or letting tensions boil over

one final layer worth mentioning all of these characters are persistent and historied often having served other leaders before you this mostly has implications with espionage which im not experienced enough to talk about yet

udiplomacyu
in shogun 2 all of the leaders seemed like schizophrenics with borderline disorder refusing trade and breaking alliances randomly in warhammer diplomacy was hardly possible at all from that low bar 3k has made massive improvements leaders are generally more reasonable and fit their ascribed personalities well diplomatic intrigue has so far satisfied me more than any total war or 4x
the same diplomatic options from shogun and total war are present but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often items payments and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements and territories can be traded to mutual benefit enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall cao cao can stir the pot with the ability to start proxy wars
the confederation system is the icing on the cake forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully as new members must be approved by a majority of existing ones and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak that means order is important and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first all of this complicates your expansionism perhaps forcing you to take risks on distant campaigns rather than upset an ally or an allysally by attacking your borders

buperformanceub
if youre a total war veteran you know why this section is here im playing on urlhttpswwwuserbenchmarkcomuserrun15850243this rigurl and the game runs flawlessly on a 2k 144hz monitor and looks great even with swarms of units on screen if youre new to total war and dont have an ssd buy one the more battles you have the more time youll spend loading ive been enjoying 5 second loads on my m2


butldrub
in total the game becomes slow and deliberate compared to its predecessors which largely devolved into paintbynumbers spamfests controlled growth is key and many decisions will require you to think several turns ahead if youre playing total war with an emphasis on battles with diverse armies and lots of spectacle you will be more at home in warhammer but hardcore strategists will love this game

i hope this wall of text was useful

i am a chinese player and this is my first comment on steam

i just cant believe this game was made by nonchinese team because you cannot find any historical mistake

also the chinese voice actors are excellent i recoginised that the voice actor of zhengjiang 郑姜 is also for sylvanas in wow 

#####

conquered half of china and declared myself the emperor the remaining kingdoms united and declared war on me the war  was going in my favor in the beginning but they just kept coming and then they slowly turned the tide of war now they are deep in my territory and are laying siege on my capital right now they also killed my beloved son and heir to the throne 2010 would get destroyed by petty kingdoms again

#####

as a long time total war fan i wasnt looking forward to this one  i have no interest in the time period or location  my favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series  i decided to give three kingdoms a try and now i dont think i can ever go back  it is so good it makes every previous tw seem archaic  specifically diplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much  the choices you make affect so much more with coalitions alliances and vassals  there is a lot more character development to the point that you care so much about your council members family members and allies  these individuals become intertwined forcing you to really think about each negotiation  indeed if you lose a general you care about your other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationship

another impressive feat is performance  aside from a weird ui issue on the campaign map side battles play absolutely beautiful  i have engaged large battles as often as i can to really push my computers limit i7 7700k 16gb ram 1080 duke video card and i rarely get a noticable drop  

as a side note the music is awesome  whether its when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itself the fanfare really draws you in

three kingdoms has not just set a standard for the tw series its set a standard for strategy games  you can tell how much work went in to this game and how much attention to detail there is  it is truly an impressive experience and i cant recommend it enough

#####

 send a spy to spy on an enemy faction
 spy gains a position in the enemy factions noble court
 spy begins liking the enemy faction more than my faction
 spy resigns and becomes loyal to enemy faction
 ex spy becomes enemy factions leader
 declares war on me

1010

#####

lets hope all the detailed character focus and massively improved diplomacy lead to a medieval 3

#####

a total war game with great optomization i never thought id see the day

#####

before i start i would like to say this is my first total war game i also spent a significant chunk of time of my childhood growing up in china but i will leave the review in english both as a practice to my writing but also i feel like it might be interesting to portray my thoughts to people from a different culture about a game that takes place on my homeland 

the gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say one more turn before bed to yourself constantly one of the very first video game i touched was starcraft 2 back in 2010 so i really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game it feels refreshing after playing sc2 for years and hundreds hours of civilization

i also really really enjoy the music there are not many tracks which is a downside but i absolutely love how they did the music here is one of my favorite piece httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1myazrwrscq the music make use of several ancient chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece

the overall visual is very beautiful to look at not stunning but really easy on the eyes the campaign map of china uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers land and trees not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at there are also peasants working on the fields soldiers patrolling the main road  pandas eating bamboos and hunters hunting wild animals making the entire map feel alive small details goes a long way

now let me talk about something i feel is lacking about this game

the multiplayer is somewhat lacking when i play a coop match even after i signed the shared victory treaty i still cant reinforce my partners army i have to wait till i rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so doing so makes the fact that the first half of a coop game is just minding their own business its worse that sometimes you wont be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations

update 11222021 its been months since ca abandoned this game a shame but my review still stands that this is a good game please note to get the 171 bug fix mod on workshop as it fixes many of the bugs that ca will never fix

	i hope that this review helps to keep the memory of his brother robbie alive and show that even during the
toughest times even the smallest acts of kindness can make a huge difference in the lives of others



	my wish is that creative assembly makes a dlc that adds robbie into the game maybe as a general or officer 
i know i will buy it and it would be awesome if the funds from said dlc went to cancer research

ive played almost every total war title while i didnt play 3k until it was practically done with dlcpatches i have come to the conclusion this is the best and most complete total war game

the ui is very well thought out thematic and carefully done there isnt excessive  bloat and what is there is good

city manage is amazing it puts every tw title to shame and really drives home the vibrant ways to have a population thrive and create complex decisions on how you want to build building tall this is my favorite way to play

diplomacy where do i begin allies that treat you like allies you can disband armies and be safe the ai cares about allegiances and pacts amazing simply awesome 1010 whoever coded these to not be horribly frustrating like how tw titles

characters for once a character system that doesnt have tons of skill points for incremental changes or useless abilities i love romance mode and how characters need to actually like each other or you get negative penalties not horribly deep but as deep as id want it in a total war game  this isnt crusader kings and i dont want it to be

the battles it unfortunate that most people are not a huge fan of china was a theme but i love the huge unit variety and the execution of the battles it runs fantastic loads quickly and it has all the trappings of a proper tw experience without being bogged down

optimization i have a decent computer but i play coop a lot too this game is actually well optimized the file size of the actual game is even tiny compared to some tw titles this game clearly had a lot of love and care and ive never experienced a crash or wonky bug

conclusion for me i wish every tw title can steal gleam learn from the 3k title the settlement construction is a major selling point to me where all the usual tw titles cities are just a background element growing cities is fun managing them making tons of cash  i love kong rongs start  and forging real allies declaring emperor or helping someone become its just one of my favorite games i never knew i loved

i urge anyone who loves total war to try this title i too did not look at it because i wasnt thrilled about playing china as i assumed i wouldnt get any historical references or mythological it does not matter this game is insanely fun and id rather see another 3 kingdoms title over any game and i really want medieval total war 3 believe me

tldr this game is amazing and i have thousands of yours in total war both historicalog steam account hacked and in total warhammer

#####

short version its fantastic go play it 910


long version 

having played every total war except original shogun i can say that this is a really well done game however not without tiny issues here and there 

first off what does the game get right
atmosphere its amazing the production value is just a bit under shogun 2  despite the lack of cutscenes there is plenty to appreciate  the beautifully done technologic tree the music the sounds ambient architecture  its very well done 

optimisation  game runs silky smooth despite a large ammount of units however this is achieved by cutting from other places as a result you can get a whole lot of blurring even on ultra 

diplomacy is the best to date in tw its probably better then in stellaris  there are a lot of options personally my favourite interactions are buying out provinces and selling crops i will never forget how i traded a bunch of rice and clay figurines for a marriage with legendary lu bu agriculture10

game balancing just like it was in warhammer archers and artillery no longer suck hard they are very fieldable units that can and will do work moreover i have found that absolute majority of units are very much fieldable with respective expertise areas peasants still perform awfully but compared to shogun 2s ashigaru units they cost more and do more have infinitely more morale but less use 

factions i havent played many but from what i have seen they are fairly well balanced and each has unique predisposition i dont say playstyle because when i started as bandit queen i still had to rely on capturing territories while she does have predisposition to raiding and pillaging you wont be doing that forever also unique units

relationships seem very fun and innovative but imagine this  3 best pals in perfect harmony suddenly game awards me a perk and there is immediate disharmony and they are bickering game can be a bit silly but that rng adds to the unique nature of every run 

what did the game get wrong 

duels available only in romance mode they still give you barely any benefit  and only for the duration of battle  their best part is locking down an enemy hero so they wont bother your units not very exciting despite advertisements of permanent buffs they only last till battle ends which makes sense otherwise that 25 hp would have been a pain in the ass to deal with but that said i wish there was still a small permanent reward for a won duel like say 5 to dmg or 1 to block chance  depending on who you defeated  it should also be noted that its hard to get a duel started as often enemies will adamantly refuse to have one

heroes advancement gimped semi randomised trees which set hard lvl cap to 15 its a far cry from rome2 shogun2 warhammer  its just shitty in every way outside of multiple things in one ability any time a hero is lvled up im not excited you pretty much dont get stats best you can get is an ability on the field or some passive buff for administratorcommander thats about it not exciting 

items i absolutely adore the idea of item trading  this is fantastic items however are 99 hot garbage when i get nth rat figurine its like toss it with the others 

most of these issues will be solved when workshop is released by ca but that will take time 

as it is this is my 4th favourite tw right after
1 shogun 2
2 warhammer 2 very fun
3 medieval i will never forget 46 inquisitioner torturing my own sinfull generals to mold them into either a corpse or a walking saint 

but this is crisp new and i hope you will enjoy it




#####

i think by now i can safely say that this is the best total war game ive ever played

ubprosbu
 three kingdoms takes place during 3rd century china heavily based off the 14th century novel about the time period its absolutely beautiful and ancient china is as unique a setting as you can ask for
 the game adapts the game of thrones on steroids idea of the novel extremely well the game is very character focused and has similar elements from games such as crusader kings 2 think along the lines of marrying a generals daughter to a faction and then having her show up in a battle against that same general 5 years later
 the games main campaign mode romance allows for your generals to be much more powerful and heroic than they would regularly be means that they can single handedly take on units of enemies this allows for an added element of epicness in your battles and feels really fresh and fun in battle
 adding on to the above point the duel system in which your general calls out another to engage in a 1v1 duel is some of the coolest stuff ive ever seen
 diplomacy in 3k is probably the best in the series while it is a bit janky at times the amount of options you have for engaging in diplomacy with another faction makes it feel fun and essential to a campaign rather than being a means to an end
 since the novel is very characterdriven the different factions that you can play as all have their own unique playstyles while you can play as one of the three main characters you can also play bandits which can act as mercenaries traders which incredible manipulations skills warlords who are unmatched in battle lu bu  lu bae etc
 the progression system in the game is fantastic its hard to describe but something about it just feels brightb its very satisfying to work your way up from a small lumber yard to an empire
 the entire total war formula feels very refined in the game from battles to factions to campaigns it all feels very polished and at the peak of its potential

ubconsbu
 unit variety is limited there isnt a lot of variety after basic archers cavalry and infantry
 some mechanics in the game are slightly vague and take a bit of figuring out to understand for example you could have people in a city be extremely happy one turn and extremely angry in the next with the only indication being population
 while the customization system is great youre not given enough things to actually equip to your characters the chance of finding a weapon or armor that would actually benefit a character are maybe 4 times a playthrough 

ubverdictbu
three kingdoms is the most character driven and personal total war game to date the amount of new gameplay possibilities that come with that statement make the total war formula feel incredibly fresh and fun it really feels like ca hit the nail on the head with this one as all the total war mechanics we know and love feel extremely polished and welldone not only that but the new additions fit right into the game if i had to describe this game in one sentence it would be total war meets crusader kings 2 meets ancient china with a sprinkle of dynasty warriors

h1score 910h1

#####

in short words this might be one of the best total war games to date it connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that twwarhammer games are lacking im not fan of the setting and i was very sceptical about this title but since i bought it it grew on me

there are two game modes which differ a bit romance mod is the main with powerful single entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles records mode nerf heroes a bit they come with plenty of cavalry bodyguards more experienced your hero is larger bodyguards he have also you can equip all your heroes with weapons armors mounts ancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilities

battle ai is probably the best in the entire series maybe not extremely intelligent but ai does decent job trying to use their  missile units flank with cavalry protect archers with infantry rarely i see them doing something illogical or dumb battle ai is much more improved from warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range units when it notices that you have no ammo left ai comes back trying to defend the gates blocking any breakthroughs with units making it difficult to get inside even if you break the first line usually there is second line of troops trying to block the streets 

if ai garrison has an army inside it is much more difficult to assault even when attacking from few directions they spread more units to block other ways inside my onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty small smaller than minor towns garrisons so you need to build special bulding for more units but i think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this right

there is plenty of units there are militia one available for every faction and general there are few faction units each faction have usually 2 of them there are special units unlocked by tech tree reforms which are called dragons there are dragons with axes swords cavalry archers each call differently most interesting are azure dragons glaive infantry with bows they have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe it should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generals higher general rank better special units he can recruit for example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry you can have maximum three generals in one army 

campaign is much more interesting than in other tw games diplomacy for the first time works got that guy which you wanted to trade with but he said no everytime not anymore now you know exactly why they want peace or agreements game shows you how much points you need to make deal done for example if there is 50 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash if you crushed them in few battles the score might be 15 that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal there is also a great option with quick deal you click it and choose trade agreement and you see all guys who may want to trade with you it even says maybe or yes that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in return

moving on there is a food mechanic which affects you in many different ways you need food to replenish troops and make your towns growing but if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements if you have plenty of farms but not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution population is coming back bigger the town is the more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment you need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population cap

not everything is perfect and the worst part of the game is that there are many unique lords and generals but there is only few dozen of them when you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillar with same bad weapons and armor so in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interesting but it helps that when you reach king rank three kingdoms are formed leaders became emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital its pretty interesting mechanic because emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other if you have a slower start it might happen that ai trigger the event and you wont even be one of the emperors then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretender

there are few bugs and maybe few mechanics that dont work as intended but nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with it but your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhile

music is great in this game there are many tracks i think and each of them different that i dont hear them repeat too often even when playing long sessions for many hours music in battle is more tense and during campaign its more calm pleasant for ears there are also cool options to choose from like changing colour palettes you can use romance palette while playing in records mode etc there are unit cards and alternative unit cards english or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles not everyone might like it but characters do a bit trashtalking during battles some lines are a bit cringe but i mostly like them

tldr as long tw fan my first game was medieval 1 i can really recommend this game it isnt flawless but it is probably the best release of ca game in the studio history battles are good campaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting few small patches and mods should make this a masterpiece 

910

#####

surprised i didnt have to pay 499 to write a review

#####

if you are not chinese you probably have a hard time imagining what four masterpieces mean to us when i was a child i used to read romance of three kingdoms twice a year during holidays we were eager to experience that part of the history covered by the fog of war and politics via video games that was exactly the time when the art of war in ancient china has reached a whole new level during a very long time our only options are games developed by koei dont get me wrong their games are great well at least some of them are and you know what you changed this situation now if you ask a chinese player what is the best game based on the history of three kingdoms their answers are probably gonna switch to the total war series

#####

campaign ai plays by a different set of rules which limits your options to outplay them for example you cant destabilize your enemys public order by going for their food production in a prolonged war even a single city under siege manages positive food production and the upkeep necessary to maintain an army large enough to equal that of your 4 commanderies regions

youre only real option every time is direct military confrontation bad cheating as admitted by ca ai ruins replay value and severely limits strategic depth

#####

i am so glad they ditched whatever system they were trying to put together in thrones of britannia this installation of total war is absolutely phenomenal with a steep learning curve that is made pretty userfriendly via excellent tutorial this game brings city management character management and army builds to a whole new level theres a large gap between the kind of game this and previous historical total wars but this time unlike tob that gap is perfectly executed and finetuned into a game that has removed my skepticism of future total wars all together

now if only we could get them to remake medieval 2

#####

its has a much bigger map than normal total war games
pros  good total war game that will pass your time
           new scenario map
cons  feels like shogun total war where everyone has the same units
            most game mechanics dont mean to much  spies family tree

overall good game if you can get on discount  i would pay 20  to 30  for it  


#####

starts up game selects kong rong
turn 1 defeat rebels
turn 2 use the money in my coffers to expand my army to deal with the han and yellow turbans
turn 5 okay the siege of some of these towns are taking longer than i thought waiting it out shouldnt hurt
turn 7 liu beis power has grown he has signed a trade agreement with me as well as many deals in my favour
turn 10 liu beis vastly superior army is crushing my han opponents to the east of my small cluster of settlements good
turn 15 okay money is shrivelling up a bit i havent encountered enough factions to really benefit from kong rongs 
              trading perks and whilst food is not an issue because of the fishing ports and farms i prioritised taking at the start 
              of the campaign commerce is failing due to having only 1 trading port good thing liu bei always gives me good 
              deals
turn 30 my economy is really struggling i still have only farms and fishing ports liu bei has taken all of the territories 
               around me meaning that i cant expand kong rong is not supposed to be warlike therefore having many armies 
               isnt good therefore i only have my small army consisting of kong rong one sentinal and one commander i have 
               no hope of taking on the might of liu bei and he wont give me military access unless i give him all of the money 
               i have as well as regular payments of the tiny amount i will make in the future
turn 42 cao cao has started up trading deals with me amazing finally i can stop relying on liu bei and finally get my 
               economy back on track
turn 50 trading is thriving my monopoly has grown massively and liu bei can now no longer offer me the crazy unfair 
              deals he peddled to me before but now i have two powerful allies one in cao cao and one in liu bei who is also 
              allied with yuan shao this is great my lands are surrounded by allies my economy is booming this is the 
              situation kong rong was made for
turn 60 cao cao has broken treaties with me he is becoming increasingly hostile towards my lands due to the lack of 
              military capability at least i have liu bei as a buffer against him
turn 74 cao cao has declared war upon me and liu bei finally a chance to gain some land and increase my coffers
turn 80 liu bei has torn through cao caos initial forces giving way for my smaller force to pick at the scraps and gain 
              easy land
turn 81 cao cao has convinced liu bei to turn against me oh f
turn 83 the 2 giants come crashing down on me yuan shao joining the melee as the hounds fall upon the limping gazelle
turn 84 i am fighting desperately to hold my final settlement my capital i will not let it fall
turn 85 staring at the main menu you screen well f you cao cao


#####

meticulous beautiful and well optimised

this is what weve been asking for years since shoguntw and its worth waiting for you know what else weve been asking for years medieval 3 and tw lotr starwars wh40k would be absolutely fricking awesome

#####

this is one of those games where a fundamental change paid off unlike other total war titles this game is focused on diplomacy rather than the outcomes of the battles you are surrounded by nations on all sides and shifting alliances make conflict a dangerous gambit you are forced to negotiate like a human being rather than steamroll everything in sight with an army of heavy units

the ais actually feel fairly responsive and youll develop longterm alliances with certain neighbors a key difference between this game and previous titles is that youll almost never annex an entire faction in one war war is outright expensive and the longer it drags on the more the costs will weigh on you furthermore all nearby factions will watch the warring parties and the more devious ones might launch an incursion into your lands whilst you are occupied elsewhere

this game is like a pit of hungry cobras in that its a constant back and forth between you and your rivals youll eventually begin to develop something of a mutual respect for certain enemies and youll find that different enemies use different tactics in battle

id say this one is a winner

im writing this to level out these reviews and give some undecided players a balanced recommendation first off anyone who says this game is 1010 or the best of the total war series is just cheesing these type of reviews help no one and is the reason why steam reviews are so off now for three kingdoms

three kingdoms is a pretty good tw game and a solid game by itself it looks good runs well has more in depth politics and a satisfying character progression early on the reason why many players have burned out quicker than other tw games is because its shallower than you think sure some added features of having your small faction turn into a kingdom is cool but the mid to late game feels bland and kills a nice buzz set by the early game the units and factions seem largely the same this could have been solved by faction unique units however youll soon learn that you really dont need them they cost a lot and just dont compare to your cheaper and upgraded early units 

the campaign throws you into a fun and chaotic world of warring factions headed by largerthanlife characters problem is when these guys die of old age or battle they are replaced with a generic generals i cant tell you how bummed i was when my carefully positioned royal heir came of age to only look like a standard general its mind blowing how tw still does not put incentive on finishing a game sure you can go through the mindless slog of becoming emperor but when you finish a campaign you cant help but look around and ask yourself was that really worth my time

many of these earlier reviews were deceptive and didnt help me when i was on the fence about getting the game with all this said 3ks is a good game that will give you your moneys worth if you like strategy games for long time tw fans its a bit shallow behind all the hype and bravado of god leaders if the devs add more mid to late game incentives such as story unique generals and differentiated unit types i think the game will improve significantly

#####

im enjoying the game so far but the combat animations are pretty disappointing compared to shogun 2 and rome 2s sync 1v1 animations just a lot of air stabbing and when arrows hit individuals they dont fall just random individuals in the unit will randomly drop and im the one to always zoom into battles to watch the intense fights so to see no 1v1 animations again its a bit of a let down i know that the 1v1s caused some issues with the ai just standing and watching but i personally prefer that much more than a simple slash and the enemy falling down because it makes it feel more like a realistic setting also the duels can get pretty repetitive after a few times everything else seems like an improvement so if you dont mind that then you should love this game the campaign map is definitely a jump in the right direction which i much prefer over previous titles not going to give this game a bad review based solely on the combat animations but would like to see them introduced again in the future thanks for reading 

#####

decent enough that i had clocked over 1k hours kinda without knowing

i still feel like i have much to learn about the history and the characters that are presented in this game

history games and history itself is what i like i guess more than the gaming part of it

in that sense gaming is more of an interactive tool to learn about history

from this perspective though obviously romanticised hence not entirely a historically accurate sim of this chainofevents that happened nearly 2 millennia ago presented in part as it did in this game has been quite an enjoyable ride for me

i hope anyone who is kinda like me could enjoy it as well

itotal war three kingdomsi bgets my recommendationb

this was my 2 cents pls do as you will

#####

total war three kingdoms has the best diplomacy system of all total war games

i was able to win just by having a food monopoly starving others and simply purchasing all their lands in exchange for food  i always wanted to have this kind of victory

#####

ive been a fan of total war games but ive typically stayed away from ancientclassical warfare titles like rome shogun and medieval ive gravitated more to the earlymodern titles like empire and napoleon so by all logic i should have avoided this one 

why

well despite this being yet another rendition of ancient warfare its set in a period of history that i am not very familiar with the eponymous three kingdoms era of chinese history and the fall of the han dynasty based on the famous historical novel romance of the three kingdoms tw3k allows you to take on the role of one of many warlords during this period and forge a new dynasty for china this game was really my first true exposure to this period of history and all the fascinating characters that inhabited it i suspect the story is much the same for any other westerner playing this game i can say definitively that playing this game made me want to research more about the three kingdoms period and its prominent actors my personal favorites are the sun family

its obvious to me and anyone who plays this game that the dev team cared a great deal about the history behind the game and great care was taken in its portrayal of chinese culture i have to commend creative assembly for their fantastic presentation as i find it respectful fun and immersive for me its gotten to the point where ive grown so attached to characters that i will even restart a game if i lose one i really like not many total war titles cultivate that attachment to your army commanders and government ministers 

the games greatest strength is its personality in fact this is the first total war game ive ever played where character relationships and personalities play a vital role in government army composition and diplomacy in the total war games ive played character relationships didnt really matter you would just choose whichever characters traits best lined up for the job plopped them into a role and promptly forgot about them here you have constantly monitor your characters satisfaction their traits and their relationships with other characters in your faction ive seen characters who were oathsworn at the beginning of the game drift apart and become rivals and vice versa this adds to replayability as no two games play the same way thanks to the small changes in characters

not only that government management and army composition matter much more than previous titles you have to keep a balanced army if you want to win on the field usually this means cavalrymeleespear infantryarchersartillery and have to be considerate when building your generals retinues to better support each other it adds another layer of strategy in an already complex game because of the aforementioned character traits you have to keep a constant eye on your ministers and make sure theyre doing their job well and not developing traits that can give you debuffs it adds more complexity to an already complex game

finally diplomacy has been massively reworked and i love it all the more now diplomacy has historically been one of the more frustrating aspects of total war titles for me as i can never tell just what the other party wants in negotiations even when i think im giving them a good deal now thanks to modifiers quick deal options and the make this work button i have a much clearer idea of what factions look for in negotiations its made what was once the most irritating features of total war now become one of my most loved i can only hope that ca will maintain this model in its future games as its improvements are nothing short of invaluable

i never thought i would have this much fun with a game set in the ancient world let alone ancient china but i have been pleasantly surprised by tw3ks impeccable presentation colorful personality riveting gameplay and the dev teams great care in supporting this title ca if you read this thank you so much for making what may be my new favorite total war game

to everyone check this game out and above all else do not pursue lu bu

#####

id rather betray the world then let the world betray me

#####

amazing recreation of the ancient chinese history with the only downside that many famous characters diao chan xiahou ba etc did not have their unique portrait and that the wu dynasty cannot initiate naval battle which made them revered in history

they can be easily addressed in future patch or dlc and i hope that the developer is planning on doing this to produce the perfect three kingdoms game to date

#####

my first total war game was shogun total war 2000 the original title in the series i poured countless hours into it followed by medieval rome medieval ii rome ii and so on i played many of the titles which followed up to attila and ive even dumped a fair amount of time into warhammer and warhammer 2

heres the bottom line for me three kingdoms is one of the best games in the 21 year history of the franchise hands down its one of the most balanced and polished experiences overall with a fair amount of technical complexity but mechanics that are approachable and easy to learn battles in three kingdoms feel similarly easy to enjoy riding a line between strategic complexity and fun accessibility the strategy map ui features some dramatic changes that take getting used to but theyre good overall the updates feel geared towards refining an approach that had gotten messy and stale over the decades its slick and it makes sense

ultimately im looking for a total war experience that expertly rides a line  i want depth historical immersion and complexity but i also want to a polished experience that i can enjoy with ease there are total war games which lean harder into the former at the expense of refinement and accessibility there are titles which feel overlystreamlined and almost arcadelike i love the franchise but in truth its been a while since ive landed on a total war game that strikes the right balance for me

three kingdoms by contrast is my goldilocks total war its what im looking for deep but not byzantine accessible but not dumbeddown beautiful rich and immersive  and most of all fun

#####

im overall a huge fan of total war and this is a very very high quality video game from a technical artistic and packaging perspective creative assembly continues to make interesting beautiful and grand video games that are really strong titles

but as someone who has played the series for years playing three kingdoms is a bit disappointing

the art design is fantastic the campaign map is truly perhaps the most beautiful yet the building system is simplified in a very good way and the interaction between the characters in the campaign feels very natural and true to life the game is welloptimized and loading times are reasonable with an ssd the siege battles are very interesting and a lot of the big name characters in romance of the three kingdoms have unique abilities and really come alive

but

the battles themselves are often nowhere near as enjoyable as other total war games and thats a huge deal because its the fundamental draw of the game the main reason for this is that while on paper there is a reasonable amount of unit variety in practice youre almost always using the exact same units over and over and each one of the three generals in your army only has access to one of five groups of special units siege battles often turn into a game of running around and capturing the flag as the capture points are hilariously quick to change sides so while the new city structure is interesting the play ends up being very boring

now i dont manually play every battle but the whole enjoyment of total war is automatically resolving most of your onesided battles that you know youll either lose or win for sure and then finally getting to that one decisive battle between your major army and the enemy major army that settles the campaign for the next dozen turns then you play it and have the time of your life challenging yourself on how to not just win but win decisively in three kingdoms that feeling is gone for me

#####

all i do is play lu bu thanks dynasty warriors for indoctrinating me

still one of the best total war games imo shame it got axed when it has so much going for it this is simply put the most fun ive ever had on the campaign map and its due to the way the indepth mechanics of the campaign work the diplomacy system is deep accessable and rewarding to use the spying and subterfuge system lets you pull off schemes that would make sun tzu applaud the character relationships are dynamic and help create stories as well as changing how you play the economic possibilities are amazing as you can literally buy your way to emperorship with enough smart deals and good commandery management climbing the ranks of nobility through prestige feels good as you customize your government to suite your play style either covering up for a factions weaknesses or enhancing their existing strengths and each faction does have their own unique weaknesses and strengths that they specialize in making the replayability very high
now as much as i love gushing about the game it would be irresponsible to not talk about the weaknesses unit variety isnot the highest there are essentially 4 or 45 rosters in the game if you own the requisite dlcs these are the han base game roster the yellow turban remnant yellow turban dlc roster the original yellow turban rebellion mandate of heaven dlc roster and the nanman furious wild dlc roster theres also the bandits base game after a rework who get a small selection of kinda crappy base units and then access to a lot of units from the other rosters through their unique technology tree though you can only recruit a limited number of these outside of that every faction except the shi xie flc faction has about two to three units but some of these are better than others
second big con is that well some of the dlc isnt worth it as they add either only a couple new factions or take place in a completely different time period cough eight princes cough adding on to this is that some of the dlc and flc factions are not up to par with the base game factions either because the have gimmicky mechanics or because they lack something nearly every other faction has for example shi xie flc has no unique units and also lacks a unique building tree liu yan flc has no unique building tree and has an unintuitive inheritance mechanic meanwhile sun ce technically dlc if you want to start as him has a different mechanic from his father sun jian and two additional unique units but aside from the two units and his fates divided storyline youre essentially playing the same faction and arguably a less fun version of it
in summary i would definitely advise getting this game but be very picky when it comes to the dlc

#####

wow  this is  different the economy is very small and funds are tight at the beginning capturing cities does not automatically give a large income boost armies are very expensive still over time cities grow and income with it

the game uses reforms instead of technology but it works the same kingdoms get a new reform every 12 months or 5 turns

the emphasis is on the characters more than the units i was surprised to see very few character skills that are for the economy and not the military things are slow here as well in the beginning if you get too many characters they will become bored and leave your kingdom unless they have a job thing is it takes many reforms to open more jobs and character upkeep is very expensive

play style is slow with few battles early on and a lot of strategic planning and economy building

battles play out just as well as most total war games you have your basic infantry cavalry and ranged which can include siege weaponry

the overall feel and graphics for this game is unique for total war games i plan on playing more but for now this is a good game

edit later in the game it is getting really hard total victory requires almost the entire map under control however all the units have many variances and that is really cool

#####

why did they actually abandon this game like why

#####

deep enough to get lost in shallow enough for a guy like me to understand


#####

great game
ranks behind shogun 2 for the best total war title
personally i give it 910

pros
diplomacy actually works
dynamic campaign
in depth character relationship
record mode for those who want more traditional total war gameplay

cons
uninteresting and dull late gamei never complete a campaign
once i came close enough on my legendary cao cao playthrough but decided it was not worth the time
no settlement auto managemanaging all your commanderies at late game is a nightmare

im enjoying the hell out of this game and curious to see what ca gonna add in the future
one thing that all total war veteran really need right now is blood and gore
release the blood dlc asap xd


#####

my favorite total war

i started playing total war with the warhammer ones
i dont even remember why i bought this one

things i liked that are specific to tree kingdoms or change from warhammer
 art style
 ui
 duels between generals
 rpg elements that affect tactical gameplay night attacks weapon options flaming projectiles
 reform tree research but so vast you can make a different playthrough depending on which paths you chose
 cavalry weight cavalry and mounted generals actually being able to push through infantry somewhat is such a breath of fresh air in this series
 building up cities is very satisfying
 3 faction types despite everyone being from the same period warlords bandits and rebels add variety

dont ask about the 7 princes thing or the jungle tribes apart from these two that in my opinion arent pertinent the dlcs offer interesting additions

ca please make more romanced historical settings for total war with this games pattern ive seen how the troy and pharao ones play and im not impressed


#####

unless you plan on buying all of the overpriced dlc be prepared to have not exaggerating 80 of the content just showing as a lock symbol and constant purchase reminders what fun for a 60 product

#####

there is potential for a good game here but the postlaunch support of three kingdoms has been and is still downright awful most of my campaigns in 2020 have ended in frustration and abandoned because there was always some crash or bug preventing me from playing further updates were slow and somehow never failed to break more things than they fixed patch 151 caused frequent crashes and the hotfix somehow caused another gamebreaking bug itself so was rolled back after two weeks then it took another month for the real hotfix to finally go live which about sums up my experience with this game bugs present during launch that were fixed at some point have continued to resurface except now the devs and pr people seem to have given up because there is no acknowledgement or communication to people reporting the bugs 

so far there has only been one major bug fixing patch 13 that was not packaged with new dlc and that was over a year ago there has been a noticeable decrease in quality control follow up and communication as well as an increase in dlc prices and special sale promotions last year a patch was explicitly delayed months to coincide with chinese new year to increase dlc sales the devs claimed the extra time would give them more time to polish it yet mandate of heaven dlc remains the most broken dlc they have released and is still the most buggy campaign by far and this year it seems like they are once again planning to wait for cny before releasing any bug fixes 

at aaa pricing these business practices have felt very slimy ive lost faith a fix is just around the corner and in creative assemblies integrity i do not recommend this game due to the frustration and dont feel comfortable giving ca money for any of their products if this level of abandonment is normalized

#####

i have over 1700 hours in this game easily the best historical total war to date being a kid that grew up loving dynasty warriors and reading romance of the three kingdoms this game is an absolute dream the focus on characters in unlike any of the previous titles diplomacy is much better as well 1010

#####

more than 1500 hours of gameplay and i still have no clue how can anybody like ma teng

#####

best campaign map experience of all total wars ive playedand i have played all of them
pros
 best campaign map experience
 timeperiod which fits total war
 much immersion
 fun battles
 duelling is a fitting mechanic
 lovely graphics
 great tech tree
 colorful characters
cons
 might be harder to get into if you are unfamiliar with the bookhistorical period
 some redundant units
 southern part of map a bit bland



#####

this is by far the most complete total war game and extended content package they have ever released i have been playing since the original rome total war and i have not enjoyed one as much as this since then it was like rediscovering the first game all over again 

i hope they continue this trend we are in much need of good rts games to reinvigorate the genre

#####

finally someone did three kingdom significantly better than koei goty

#####

while i do agree with most people on how bad ca have schrewed up with cencoring mods and partnering with netease i will speak for the game and the game only

it has potential 
it has interest

but it falls short quite short

firstly three kingdoms do a lot of things right if you can ignore the bugs lets go over that before we tackle the bad

the foodsystem while i would have liked it to be more advanced is a nice toutch
diplomacy has a new coat of paint and seems to be a bit more smooth and easy to understand with personalities to each faction leader making them unique and interesting to negotiate with
the relationships between characters is quite interesting although taken a little too far it is too easy for two characters to hate each others or love each others because of one trait
duels in romance mode is something i cant help but love but i would like to be given some options when starting the duels like the option to only capture each other or simply chase each other away lower risk but simultaniously lower rewards
strategic resources having the need to get specific buildings regions or trade for them in order to advance your other buildings and your faction puts some more complexity to the grand strategy
the reform tree quite beautiful 
the visuals overall so good many likes

and now for the things i find bad

there is quite a low variety of troops available to me especially during the start of a campaign
speaking of troops while i like having characters as generals i do not like being forced to use them in order to field a retinue unless i am playing as a very specific faction
i am also finding myself being forced to use specific character classes in order to field specific types of units 
want a decent anticavalry unit better use the champion 
any archers of worth not unless you have the strategist
good cavalry depending on the type shock or meele you can only use the vanguard or the commander
that is unless you are willing to use tthe militia starting units who quite honestly are not that good anymore when you hit mid to late game or research the dragons elites which takes a very long time and they are quite expensive as they are meant to be elite units
the bugs oh dear lord ca fix your game before you start making new dlc please
the narrow path to victory the point of the game is to become the new emperor of china thats it nothing else 
even when i played as a governor type faction i was never allowed to rescue the emperor and try to reinstate him during some faction intros i was told how loyal this leader is to the han and how they wish to save the emperor but when i do get to the emperor i apparently take control of him as a puppetemperor just like everyone else kinda hard playing as a loyalist
not allowed to build or have forts of any kind to hold chokepoints on the campaign map only the encamped stance for me i guess
the sieges something that has been deteriorating ever since its glory days that was medieval 2 units bugging out and not finding their way on walls or in the streets makes me prefer to delegate auto resolve those fights simply because i dislike them so much
an empty campaign map everything seems to be focused in the north and the south is literally empty of factions being deserted 

overall it feels like they got a bit lazy in some areas of this game and focused too much on a few other things
so how do you make this game enjoyable 
mods get lots of mods to fix most of these issues and you are set for a good time but only if you are willing to overlook the rest of the bad stuff surrounding this game and its company

have a good day

#####

first there was the censoring of mods and mod creators
then there was the netease partnership
and now its the price hike of all the products in creative assemblys historical catalog in various regions some as much as 200

take your business elsewhere

boy this will be a hard one playing total war three kingdoms is an endless sine wave of having a lot of fun and having a lot of antifun my beloved total war game was the original rome total war 16 years ago and a lot will be a comparison to it the first super fun moment was realising that epic battle are still epic boy they are so much fun nothing much have changed except nothing much have changed in idiotic siege battles in 16 years you could not fix unit pathing in proximity to buildings or add any meaning to what happens on walls  ok i had some ranting but in fact with clever play on strategic map you can minimize the number of siege battles or just wait them out the strategic map is ok diplomacy at least somewhat works not paradox level yet but at least now you can somewhat trust ai and work them out in fact abandoning sun tzus principle of fighting only battles you are sure of winning and focusing on provoking big battles you can have a lot of fun and emotional campaigns after of course you get used to chinese characters names the game makes terrible job at differentiating 
what in the end decided for negative review is an idiotic and unfair dlc policy you open the game you paid full aaa price for and feel like in some f2p title you literally have to spend couple of minutes to find something that is not locked behind dlc it really ruins the game experience and in old times you unlocked factions by playing as a reward for conquering them you could play as them

#####

stop releasing new dlc or bug fix while some serious bug still exist for years for example httpsforumstotalwarcomdiscussion258821siegedefencebugcantfightdelegate
httpsforumstotalwarcomdiscussion287445aisiegebug
were reported years ago but still no response from ca at all totally incompetence their games are expensive while service not good disappointing
you may have seen that new patch 172 unfortunately still ca not fix that bug i have confirm by load my old save
also i have put a video confirm the bug  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuisbupcitwot48s

#####

i liked the game but i can not in good faith recommend something that was left incomplete pulling the rug out from underneath all the players by cutting support was a cynical lazy move

a review after having played for 175 hours as a native culture background player

    overall9210

    art 9510      
    music 9810
    strategy 910
    gameplay 910   
    
      
     pros beautiful and precisely accurate design of art fascinating background music and sound effect attractive game system and great experience in a war battle
     cons lacking portraiture in contrast with other games with the same kind and the 3d models of them dont fit their portrait and more they look ugly to some extent   the gender for da qiao and xiao qiao is wrong they are famous for their beauty in the three kingdoms period but in the game they are male and look lame in addition chinese people do not look like the appearance in the game it fell a little weird for this part please find references from koei game  in the end  the game is getting a little boring as you enter the late game for there are a massive cities to management and lot of trade to control  with repetitive operation
     
     suggestions adding more portraiture and skills for the character and adding different backgrounds music for various influences 
     please simplify the flow in the late game such as uniform the construction of city with auto management by the prime or magistrate 
     adding a calculator input when the player is changing the trade the number

     expects adding waterbattle because many famous battles such as battle of the red cliff was fought on the river  
     adding more geography constructions such as hu lao fort or qi shui fortbecause they were playing a very critical role in the ancient chinese battles
     offering a choice to the player to decide whether he or she needs to declare their emperor because the emperor was sensitive to the country in that time and it usually depended on right political time perfect situation and peoples support it was common for a vassal to not to claim the emperor instantly for political considerations 
i am expecting a well balanced and more abundant gameplay system

   and if you do  ill buy them twice thrice again and again thank you for your efforts



i have played the three kingdoms for about 700 hours its a good game for me and the latest dlc is also nice despite it has so many bugs

but bugs dont bother me too much my concern is it looks like ca has picked up mandate of heaven as the beginning of the three kingdoms and eight princes as the end of the story which is fair then start adding different dlc in between them to fill up the timeline and to tell complete the story which looks reasonable but in this way a player cant full experience the whole story once a time in the game from the beginning to the end instead they have been just put in different starting locations in the map and repeat the process of unification of china again and again in the end im not satisfied enough with the experience and i think i will get bored if you follow this routine next

in my view this separate narrative is fair in some ways easy to manage but it also breaks the continuity of the whole story the repetitive gameplay is a little tedious too i was wondering if you could connect all the dlc and their events all and integrate them with the gameplay in the future maybe after you have created enough dlc by following some guidelines in the game events will be triggered by achieving certain conditions in some ways then i can choose yes or no to trigger the event or ignore it i also can choose when and where i can step into the sandbox mode the logic between events is relative consistent integrated not just separate them in different dlc i do not appeal all factions will have this but at least make it happen on liu bei cao cao sun jian will be this will optimize the experience of gameplay great so the understanding of the story has improved a lot of players will love it the fiction romance of three kingdoms is a long epic wonderful historical novel and the story of liu cao sun is most attractive to the players your efforts will be worth

or another easier solution for discontinuous eventsnow dlc was separated by campaigns in a certain time of the three kingdoms period you can pick up all kinds of factions but lacks the depth of them what about independent dlc just made for only one faction like da wei shu han eastern wu yuan etc the dlc will focus on a few peoples stories and their fate correspondingly it crosses a long time span has several campaigns and successive events from the factions creation to its end

before a short period many factions now a long period one faction is it feasible

suggestion conclusion focus on independent factions dlc liu bei cao cao and sun jiansun quan etcsun quan actual build the emperor of wu and ruled his faction and wu state from 200 to 252 people believes more that he should be the representative leader of wu kingdom instead of sun jian if its possible please put all their events together add some critical historical events integrate them with the gameplay in the end theres a large number of players who want to have full gameplay and full experience in the game now its far from enough even new elements new portrait paintings are good not enough for they are unable to change the gameplay

in addition there are some small wishes i wish to speak see if there are supporters

1 can we make the way of earning rankstitles more complex and more reliable especially to declare the king

2 can we release some independent dlc for zhuge liang and sima yi in the future they are especially popular among players who are acquainted with the story and the story itself is wonderful

3 can we add a new assignment lobby by putting a character who has lobby skills to another factions cit if the lobby works the score of negotiation will raise and make it easier to accomplish agreements

4 can we add a jail system in the game

5 can we add an event for the married characters to have the chance to give birth to children who are able to inherit their parents skills and attributes

im writing this partially as a message to my future self because i am rapidly becoming a huge fan of this game however i have seen what huge fans of this game look like and they dont seem happy either with creative assembly as a whole or how theyve handled this specific game so in case that happens and i become someone furious at the lack of a northern expansion or the balance of the indigenous southern factions let me just say that i love this game ive played 30 hours ive finished a campaign and its the most fun ive had with any total war game for the first time total war is about people more than armies and anchoring this game around the magnetic personalities of the cast of romance of the three kingdoms gives this game an astonishing amount of character and life that colours so much of the experience with unique mechanics that reflect cao caos scheming or liu beis bonds of brotherhood placing the human faces of one of the most popular and influential works of fiction in human history on total war mechanics does so much to enliven them especially when they do superhuman feats of taking on entire regiments by themselves or seeing an ocean of armies part to allow two master swordsmen to duel for the fate of all china 

it has a lot of the same problems and limitations as most total war games but there are a lot of mechanical changes that i do like total warhammer 2 had even more asymmetrical factions but i found in my brief time with it that i was often frustrated at how often fights between individual units would drag on where it seemed like however i positioned my units however deftly i tried to flank or how many gaps i would leave in my lines the statistically better unit would win time after time and it eventually led to play where i would just line up my armies march them forward and let them fight it out in a big line because i felt so little effect from any attempts at ambush or cleverness here it feels like positioning and tactical play matters so much more ive won battles handily that the ai insisted i had absolutely no chance of winning through careful positioning of missiles spearmen and a lot of running horsemen around to charge into people from the back with my bro my homie my absolute guy xiaohou dun ive gotten cocky and turned convincing routs into embarrassing skirmishes that would force me to pull back and reinforce at least on normal difficulty this was not a game about composing the perfectly balanced army it was a game about being clever in the moment about the kind of tactical moves and big plays that someone like cao cao would pull off in the novel 

its a game about making you feel like a mastermind just like him about feeling like these largerthanlife figures and also the quiet sadness of these people dying and falling out of history replaced by people you dont recognise of the emptiness that comes when you defeat your most bitter enemy it is the game that for me has come the absolute closest to fulfilling the intoxicating promise of total war 

i could be wrong about this maybe in like 5 campaigns time ill see through the lines of code and into the artifice that underpins all of these kinds of games maybe the majesty and the fantasy will be gone by then but thats why this message exists future me that even though you may not be loving the game now the way you did back then the love that exists now burns so so bright and i dont want you to forget it

#####

first impressions of the game
beautiful map and setting 
city management is intuitive
the battles remind me of shogun 2
the best version of diplomacy in a total war game yet

thank you for delaying the release of this game the hard work and extra time clearly payed off

addendum i havent run into any optimization or graphical issues so far but i was one of the lucky few that didnt have problems in past total war games

#####

this game is abandoned and incomplete
they havent even been able to fix some exit bugs

h1total war three kingdomsh1

total war three kingdoms is the latest entry in the famous total war series this time well participate in the destiny of ancient china

ive played the first three total war games shogun medieval and rome for about 1000 hours and i spent around 150200 hours in several more medieval ii empire napoleon shogun 2 and rome ii but i havent played the latest ones so i cant tell you if the game has changed a lot since thrones of britannia boring and warhammers not my cup of tea

also im one of those people who use autoresolve a lot  the proud owner of the bronze armchair of comfort iwin any campaign by autoresolving battlesi achievement from napoleon thats why i cant say a lot about changes in rts battles as this part of the game is not my favourite but i really liked the romance mode where your generals have more impact on battles compared to the classic one  its refreshing and its the main reason i played rts battles more often in three kingdoms

so speaking about the good features
 as i mentioned before the romance mode is cool
 the game is really wellpolished i havent seen a single bug during almost 20 hours of my gameplay
 tutorials are very informative and pieces of advice are useful the interface is almost perfect for such a complex strategy game however at some point i got a feeling that some of this perfection was sacrificed for better visuals
 diplomacy is way better than it was before at least judging from my experience maybe there are some balance flaws but youll need dozens of hours to discover them in my opinion diplomacy is one of the reasons why youd want to replay the main campaign a few more times
 an interesting and long campaign with good replay values
 nice visuals on the global map in battles they are pretty much the same as before beautiful artwork

still i have some doubts about one thing
 a couple of gameplay aspects are overcomplicated for my taste and they have only minor impact on the gameplay items and some character interactions for example


bthree kingdomsb is a massive chapter in the total war franchise and it will be of particular interest to those who like the ancient china setting
its not a revolutionary game though  its just a really good total war title 910

the game is decent the developers are not they have a unique way of developing games known as take the money and run

#####

solid total war game artistically the best of them all gameplaywise an improvement of their core mechanics while i currently only have 439 hours in this game this has been consistently a game worth coming back to

replayability is a mixed bag  it almost always feels like the most action is in the north some factions feel the same whilst others feel completely different or provide for a greater challenge it would benefit from a random generation mode for the world and different factions

overall 6975 very good tai hao le

#####

so whats new this time apart from the chinese setting 
well first of all diplomacy has been greatly improved province management as well familycourt spy network and of course new character system 
soundtrack is top notch

all these new and updated features make campaign really very enjoyable and in my opinion one of the best ones of all total war games

battles are more or less the same that is if you play in records mode
i have no experience with romance mode yet since idea of op heroes doesnt sit well with me
naval battles are missing but i hope ca can bring them back in the next expansion

thanks to ca especially their campaign designers for not being afraid of making a more deep and complex campaign which has a bit of learning curve even for tw game veterans

total war three kingdoms takes the epic grand strategy franchise to ancient china around the end of the 2nd century the han dynasty has collapsed resulting in a civil war between a dozen characters who all want to become emperor this is the fifth total war game ive played after shogun 2 rome 2 and both warhammers

h1the goodh1

	gameplay follows the same format that has proven successful in previous games manage the overall needs of your empire on the world map including recruiting armies capturing territory constructing buildings researching upgrades improving your economy and maintaining public order and then fight against enemy armies on the battlefield in pauseable real time combat involving thousands of soldiers including swordaxe warriors spearmen cavalry archers crossbows and mounted archers

	there are 12 playable factions and each has a unique bonus which influences their playing style for example i played as sun jian who earns heroism by winning battles which can reduce army upkeep cost

	generals can be equipped with weapons armour mounts and other gear to make them stronger in combat and generals can be assigned to leadership positions in your court to provide empire wide bonuses as well as keeping them loyal to you

	enemy ai is usually quite good especially on the campaign map they would frequently attempt to capture my unguarded settlements instead of attacking me directly which gave me a few headaches with positioning my own armies

	the end game which has been a problem in some previous total war campaigns is strong in three kingdoms the campaign victory condition has two stages first you need to gain prestige points by winning battles capturing territory and constructing important buildings this will eventually allow your faction leader to become a king and the capital cities of the first three kings will become seats of power the second stage of the campaign requires a faction to simultaneously control all three cities to be declared emperor

	it took me 46 hours to complete the campaign the first 10 hours felt a bit underwhelming as i steamrolled over the han empire who had loads of territory but hardly any armies and most battles against basic garrisons ended in less than 5 minutes however when i started fighting against the full strength armies of the main factions the battles had the scale that i expected from a total war game after becoming a king the last 15 hours were really tough being at war with the two biggest factions who were also allied with each other and a third faction fighting multiple battles every turn and even though i won almost every battle there were so many enemy armies on the map that for a while it was difficult to actually push forward i controlled the entire south east quarter of the map but the other two seats were at the far north and north west so i needed to conquer almost the entire country it was exhausting and stressful but ultimately satisfying to finally win i was playing on normal difficulty

	diplomacy played a bigger role in my campaign than any other total war game ive played after i recognised that i needed help to break the stalemate i secured an alliance with two other factions and they both sent multiple armies to help me win what became a 3v3 war there are more diplomatic options such as exchanging territories loot and arranged marriages in addition to the usual trade deals and treaties

	i didnt notice any bugs or crashes my framerate would occasionally dip into the 40s during large battles especially city sieges during winter turns with snow falling however this isnt a problem like it would be for a fast paced first person shooter

h1the badh1

	i did notice one obvious problem with the ai during battles when the ai is the attacker and they have a second army providing reinforcements they will immediately rush the first army forward instead of waiting to attack together this meant that i could usually defeat each army separately even if they outnumbered me overall i guess its because the defender wins if the battle timer runs out when the ai is the defender they will stay back and combine armies but i had it set to 60 minutes per battle which meant there was no need to rush

	each type of settlement town city farmland mine lumberyard etc seemingly only has one map layout and i fought over 100 battles during my campaign when youre fighting on the same maps over and over again it can start to feel a bit repetitive especially when each faction has very similar units so the same tactics will win most battles it wouldnt be as big of a problem in warhammer where the different races feel significantly different

h1the recommendationh1

overall three kingdoms is a great game warhammer 2 is still my favourite total war but i enjoyed three kingdoms and i think most fans of total war would feel the same theres enough content and quality to justify a full price purchase my biggest complaints should be easy for the developers to fix if they wanted to

#####

i barely sleep for the last two weeks you know

#####

it could have been one of the greatest total war if they keep updating it

#####

bit is certainly a different total war from the others it is not only a strategy and rts but also has 4x elements i have read many complaints about the interface the unreadable map etc well you can get used to everything i think the developers designed the game very well however it is not for everyone first of all you need to like the chinese atmosphere it is good to read something about china and watch some movies hero house of flying daggers empress 14 blades or more recently shadow but especially three kingdoms red cliff from 2008 directed by john woo i get the impression that the games developers were heavily inspired by the latter film which worked out to the games advantage
3k has unconventional solutions when it comes to mechanics  especially on the strategic level it is designed according to the chinese wu xing theory of five transformations tree 木 pinyin mù fire 火 pinyin huǒ earth 土 pinyin tǔ metal 金 pinyin jīn and water 水 pinyin shuǐ the cycle of creation and destruction translates into the erection of buildings and the selection of military units and generals failure to follow this rule has real negative consequences for the functioning of the state and the army
playing 3k what i miss in the other installments of the series i have the feeling that the developers have given the player real tools to build an empire and manage it it couldnt have been otherwise by the way since imperial china was essentially the first state in history with an elaborate administration made up of topdown educated officials
but one step at a time
in the game regardless of the chosen leader and faction we lead a state with a monarchical system our ruler has broad prerogatives with them we conduct a policy of distribution and appointment creating the power elite of our kingdom from among various candidates we can appoint them to offices at two levels the central or court and the provincial level in the form of commandery administrators several ministers make up the monarchs advisory body the council which meets once a year to propose specific measures for internal and external policy candidates for office can combine civilian and military functions so there is no avoidance and conduct expansion in one or at most two directions due to the high cost of maintaining several armies it is not easy in the game to create an efficient and effective spy network but if successful there are plenty of options here from sabotaging enemy logistics to inciting rebellions in cities to disrupting the transfer of power within an enemy dynasty included however there is no option to send a recruited spy to the enemys territory with a preview of the map  a completely different solution from the one used so far instead we receive reports from our envoy
we recruit the army in a given commandery each army consists of three generals commanding a maximum of 6 troops which gives a total of 18 troops  3 bodyguard troops of each general this solution may seem strange after all in previous tws there was only one general however it is not an ahistorical solution from the point of view of military history given that armies were divided into two wings and a center here the player  the commanderinchief  is de facto in command anyway the diversity of units is in my opinion greater in 3k than in shogun 2 but lets not expect the unknown the battles themselves look quite nice and have something of a fairytale feel to them even in archive mode  in my opinion this fits in with the overall concept of the game on the other hand the troop morale system animations and damage dealing are a bit disappointing on the plus side however the game can be credited with the ability to create different infantry and cavalry formations on the battlefield as well as obstacles in the form of for example oil patches or palisades this undoubtedly gives more possibilities to use the terrain for example we can protect our wing from enemy cavalry by building various barriers and hiding archers or crossbowmen behind them relationships between generals also play an important role in battles one should think carefully about what to do with captured generals of the enemy army  their execution aggravates our relations with all factions due to the games treatment of war crimes as dishonorable
as for the audiovisual aspect i will say yes the music here is atmospheric and the graphics well what who likes im glad that the developers have moved away from the graphics known from rome ii attila and thrones of britannia which is to say the least strangely ugly due to fatally chosen colors and poor edge smoothing yes there is no revelation in 3k in this regard either but the character cards moving event cards troop icons beautiful tech tree and the overall interface based on exclusive black look great and aesthetically pleasing

i give it 910 im not looking forward to medieval 3 or empire 2 id prefer the thirty years war period of 16181648 but with equally developed management mechanics as in 3kb

#####

the game itself is fun to play for a bit like the civ games it gets repetitive really quick i give this a huge thumbs down because of the fact that spending 60 on the game only seems to unlock a small portion of the scenarioscharacters available im so tired of these games that just keep trying to milk you for more and more money after youve already paid for the main title

#####

i had fun playing this game but the greed is crazy characters that i was just playing yesterday were randomly put behind a paywall now ive bought 3 dlcs for this game and yet the longer i play the less characters are available to me how does this make sense

#####

i grew up playing total war games along with many others some of those being the dynasty warriors series which i loved 3  4 in particular 

that said i really enjoy the historical nature of the total war series and am a big fan of mods like ntw3 for napoleon tw which really add to that aspect

so when i purchased tw3ks i thought it was a beautiful game with an enjoyable campaign that is until i dropped into a battle and saw my entire army massacred by lu bu it really got under my skin that 1 person could do that and just made battles pointless 

but i gave the game some time and slowly came to realise that it combined my love of the total war series and dynasty warriors in a very satisfying way

in previous titles like rome ii or attila i didnt really care about my generals so long as my army was decent i felt like i could win regardless of who was commanding so investing in the military and buildings to support the armies was more important than any character in the game which i felt left me a bit detached  

in three kingdoms it hurt when i lost a general in battle or it felt awesome that through my hard work and movement along the skill tree i could see them overcome an enemy general in combat and lead their inspired troops on to a great victory cutting swathes through the enemy lines 

i just felt more of a connection with the characters a good general could really turn the tide of battle and that investing in them was important thats what brings the connection 

theres also a great deal of mods that can add to the depth giving characters a biography and individual portraits etc so that they really stand out 

overall i would recommend the game i thoroughly enjoy the mechanics battles campaign etc and for a historical player of the franchise it bridges the gap nicely between historical and fantasy 

that said i hope they dont do away with historical titles completely empire ii total war anyone 

enjoy cheers

#####

game was abandoned by devs in a pretty shitty state anti player bias in the ai is so bad youll have friendly factions refusing to trade with you because it would make you money random armies of looters will be spawned in the middle of your territory by events sacking your towns and destroying progress with no warning ai basically has infinite money because even if you manage to beat their doom stack they have from turn one they can just remake it next turn they always know where your armies are so they only walk into ambushes they have numerical advantage in and can stand a chance of at least causing massive casualties in your armies a faction that is being attack from two different sides will declare war on you and attack you if it sees a settlement unguarded just because fuck the player even with player mods to patch the game is pretty mediocre

#####

i have played every total war title from empire to three kingdoms this is by far the most difficult game to review in that lineup this game is highly polished in terms of its graphics voice acting and general aesthetics and settings there are lots of times when the game is extremely fun to play as you watch your characters level up and earn new weapons abilities and positions in your nations court 

that being said this game is also incredibly annoying and frustrating to play which does limit the overall experience probably the most annoying thing is the fact that right out of the gate you have a decent idea of how autoresolve battles will play out this does not incentivize me as a player to fight a lot of the larger battles because why would i if i already have a guaranteed victory why would i fight the battle myself and risk losing it my most recent campaign as liu bei i think i have fought 10 battles in 98 turns personally that is pathetic when compared to other total war titles such as shogun 2 i fought most battles unless i had pure overwhelming numbers 

the other thing that is frustrating is how the campaign ais operate they arent stupid like in past total wars instead they are hyper aggressive and will ruthlessly dogpile on the player while it does add to the challenge when you have to fight that many countries it becomes less and less rewarding as time goes on if anything it just feels discouraging and doesnt make me wanna keep playing 

the last thing that hurts this game is the lack of any real difference between nations unlike a lot of other total war games there are very few special units for each nation whereas in say rome 2 or shogun 2 each country had its own unique units in tk not every nation does this makes the battles feel very repetitive and the fact that unlocking more of the late game units feels like a chore rather than something to be excited about is pure agony 

just as a note ignore what ca calls the easy warlord cao cao is great at the start cause he can expand fast but once he gains his natural territories you are immediately surrounded by other major warlords and they are not afraid to gang up on you i suggest new players start with either lie bei or gongsun zun as they are relatively easy in the early and mid game stages

i just want to thank creative assembly for making this game    
my first total war game is shogun 2   later when the total war developer released a closed beta version of game called arena to their fans back in 2013  i asked them to make total war three kingdoms with emphasize on charactersgenerals or hero being able to work together as a group    the three kingdoms era was a really story rich time and fulfilled with variety of characters    
years later they really made this game and it exceeded my expectation   thank you so much

#####

the total war franchise has existed as a series of buggy optimization nightmares for the last twenty years the games are forgiven for the scope depth and dedication promised to follow each bumpy borderline beta release somehow they got everything right this time before launch which resulted in the perfection of their formula

ca celebrated this new and interesting approach by abandoning the game completely in favor of moving their teams to future unfinished products and warhammer iii which returned to the old format of releasing a dumpster fire has become the main focus for the foreseeable future 

its a shame because this games diplomacy may be some of the best out there intelligent ai a beautiful map and the historicalfantasy setting make for a turn based beautiful experience which can transform into intense real time battles whenever you want 
if youve heard the game lacks unit variety its true but the variety of unique generals makes for an interesting game of pokemon trying to collect them all into your empire

this game is worth a buy and if you can get the dlcs as part of a sale do so none of them are necessary but a world betrayed is probably the best one as it introduces new mechanics and favorite characters from the 3k story 

enjoy the game knowing that it will never receive the support it deserves

#####

took a lil while to grow on me but im a big fan of this title very solid entry by ca and id definitely recommend it to others 

first off to address the tw warhammeresque hero generals this can be turned off by disabling romance mode 3kingdoms isnt a straight historical tw as its based on both the historical three kingdoms period and the romance of the three kingdoms book and the legends on which it is based players choice for those who may want the more traditional realistic tw experience

the main criteria battles characters diplomacy building
battles
 units have access to a strong variety of abilities and formations as you progress so battles dont get stale
 generals are very well implemented imo they add a lot to battles the wu xing mechanic is also very interesting and adds an extra strategic and tactical layer to battles because not only are different general types are betterworse against others but each general type has access to  bonuses with different unit types eg only armies with strategists can build siege units but strategists themselves are passive and weak in pitched battle it also gives a nice layer of flavour to everything
 good mix of units for the most part but after a while the overall roster of units gets a bit samey when youve unlocked all the generic units most factions field more or less the same rosters so get used to seeing the same units a lot unit design is still good though would just have liked to see more variety and special units and stronger unit diversity between factions
 the formations are usually good and thank you ca for bringing a proper range of formations back though they can glitch out a bit sometimes ranges from mildly annoying to problematic in fast paced battles easily dealt with by pausing but if youre trying to play without pausing its a pain when your formation click goes wobbly and your spearwall decides to line up sideways to the enemy charge or your group move order causes your entire line to rotate out of position 

characters
i actually really like the romance mode legendary characters the relationships make sense and feel organic  characters can deepen relationships or form rivalries with each other which translate to buffs etc if they fight side by side or vs one another the wu xing general type mechanic comes in both at a battle level and in administration because different general types have access to different assignments different buffs depending on how the commandery province is built and so on you can equip items like in twwh which buff your characters or give access to certain abilities or formations the characters are varied and interesting based on real individuals legendary characters all have their own special buffs and the unique models are very nicely designed

diplomacy
finally a tw where the diplomacy is fluid no more clunky menus confused clicking etc moreso than the mechanics engaging in diplomacy is intuitive and well set out you get all the information you need and the ui is lovely theres a strong range of diplo options and special ones depending on what character you play great feature

building
good strategic map building mechanics commaderies represent your administrative provinces and there is a very diverse range of territory resources building types etc across china again wu xing comes in with certain building types supporting others synergistically unique buildings for different factions are also well done and genuinely influence playstyle strategic map is also v nice

#####

i purchased this game when it came out since ca finally focused their attention at upgrading the campaign and diplomacy ai their worked on the subject seemed to pay of and generally while the ai still get massive cheats and plays by different rules it seems like they did manage to improve 

however the game setting units variety only two player multiplayer campaign and so many other issues are left behind so ca did one step forward and a few steps back yet still took a full price on this game new aspects that ca where hyping about like the character of this world are empty and unrelatable and there isnt any word about future fixes for that issue they got screens in game with massive data that is basically useless and you can go through a campaign without opening those screens

but the real reason i am bothering to post this review is because yet again i find myself disappointed by ca  their community managers actions is disgusting to say the least their censorship of modders work is unethical and their support of a game that was sold at full price but is very light on content is a disgrace  

and now i see people rushing to post positive reviews flaming others that have legit concerns about the game  calling them by names despite of steam guidelines  well i have no choice but to right an honest review to make sure those people dont get away with their nasty immoral behavior

#####

i like this game but it has a very nasty crash bug that develops anywhere from turn 40 and up meaning you get invested and then your campaign is unplayable based on googling it its a relatively common issue unfortunately

#####

update for relevancy its been months and almost all the issues i talked about here are still a thing and nothing was ever really changed didnt stop them from shoving more dlc down your throat tho seriously i wish ca could get their heads out of their ass and give fans who appreciate the historical games a real historical game again theyve never managed to be able to capture the mechanics of rtwshogun 2 in any of the newer games and more and more the game feels more a slog hopefully we get something good soon because the cycle is continuing it seems with the release of troy and what a garbage piece of shit that game is idk why it even exists tbh

so i think after 140 hours and multiple legendary campaigns completed i can finally give my say here

do you recommend this game at full price no plain and simple buy warhammer 2

this review will get lost in the sea of 4 hours positive reviews from people with no real total war experience but hear me out for those of you tight on money and wanting to spend it properly

while at first i enjoyed the game i very quickly realized how shallow an experience this really is its clear to see that its unfinished not sure what that month of polishing accomplished but the ai and the amount of clear balance issues present on launch are staggering many legendary lords have gold names at level 1 but no modelportrait and some even have modeunique gear but no legendary traitsgold color its very confusing and is clearly a sign the game was released unfinished to get money day 1 dlc said dlc being the only faction thats even remotely diverse in the game since every other faction is basically a copy paste 

lets break it down like this

baib worst ai ive seen in total war in awhile quite easy to cheese and quite hard to lose to even on legendary once you get a decent stack i found it difficult to ever lose to the ai even with all its stat padding from difficulty i can even link videos of me winning battles where i was pitched against around 810k troops with a mere 2k and completely decimating the ai the biggest reason this is a big deal is because of the samey feel of all the factions everyone is using the same units so how is the ai losing such pitched battles using the same exact units as me with stat buffs you really only feel threatened at the very start of the game and after that you basically steam roll the game ai will literally let you shoot them with artillery and archers for free 90 of the time and despite a patch to address cav will no longer charged into braced spears they do it quite often my biggest complaint is how the ai cant organize itself at all and despite having a numbers advantage will chase your cav around like its a fucking cat in heat and instead of pressing its advantages in numbers will chase your cav around the map giving you free artarcher volleys you also cant take advantage of any ambushforest mechanics in this game since ca thought it be a good idea to give the ai no fog of war on the campaign mapbattle map meaning they will always just zoom at your hidden units

bunitsb this is by far the most disappointing thing in the game and im not crying that there is no real diversity in unit rosters because realistically there is but the problem is the way ca priced units recruitmentupkeep is just plain retarded its like they didnt play test anything or atleast have  competent people playtest the game because it makes no sense how for example lets just say x faction has unique spear units the main difference being mostly a slight stat buff between the two what ca decided would be smart is make the unique spear units twice the costupkeep as its only slightly worse counterparts making said unique units pointless to recruit this is the downside of not having unit recruitment tied to buildings anymore which honestly was a bad decision they basically didnt know how to properly balance recruiting so they just jacked up the prices on higher tier units essentially alienating them and making them pointless most unique units really have no reason to take over their dopplegangers because they cost way more and have mild stat boosts that are in general pointless once units reach rank 10 veterancy you basically never have a need to field the end game units 1 because they are mostly bad 2 they cost wayy to much 3 veterancy literally caps stats and makes almost all the units regardless if peasant or not literally the same

that all being said unit balance is terrible game is dominated by archersartillerycav and melee are pointless i laugh at all the assault type melee infantry who you would think would get lot of kills when flanking people but in fact get like 10 kills in a prolonged fight vs archers who can score over 200 kills a battle even a rank 1 and even against armored targets that they arent suppose to be good against not sure why the archers in this game fire like machine guns but they do cav are quite literally unstoppable you can actually run full vanguard armies with nothing but cav and shit stomp every stack in the game quite easily spears having to be locked in place to counter cav is a joke and easy to get around the funniest part about it is even heavy armored spear units lose to militia cav in a straight up fight if they dont get a charge deflection seriously who tested this game

bcampaignb while difficult at first because of all the new mechanics added they are quite easy to work around and once you figure out how everything works its hard not to snowball by turn 6070 and just steamroll the map i really enjoy the diplomacy upgrade they did but its also really easy to abuse and get massive incometerritory from taking advantage of the ais stupidity also lets talk about vassals holy fuck how can my vassals be dragging me into wars they shouldnt have any say in anything especially if im not giving them autonomy not to mention the ai tends to vassal everyone in fucking site whenever they can im not just talking about yuan shao either his mechanic is vassals so thats fine but in the late game anytime youre trying to clean up a smaller faction right before they get finished off they run off to a bigger faction and get vassaled making you unable to finish them off they then immediately re declare war on you with help now this makes the campaign a fucking slog to be honest i have 56 unfinished late game campaigns i just cant be bothered to finish because it got so grindy and boring to finish ive said it on stream multiple times that this game is quite simply not fun at all in the late game its not even difficult either its just annoying ca successfully made the most annoying total war end game outside of attilas


honestly theres lot more i wanna say but i cant be bothered because im pretty much over the game at this point i should of known seeing day 1 dlc that this was gonna be a cash grab similar to thrones this game is clearly just a way for them to easily farm the asian market a market ca has never been able to get into before i really wanted a new historical game but honestly dont think ca did they are still so stuck on warhammer that they even introduced warhammer style gameplay to their historical game with generals who can 1v1000 literally i personally dislike romance mode and think its very unbalanced and ruins the game but that being said there is no alternative because records feels untouched and literally exactly the same just with a generals bodyguard i guess the success of this game just helps fuel more polish content for warhammer 3 so should be happy about that but i certainly cant recommend this unfinished game to people for 60 dollars it makes sense why majority of the totalwar community youtuberscontent creators have already stopped playing this a week later and why ca pushed so hard for initial pre order sales with a massive pr campaign

#####

in light of the recent negative reviews which are predominantly about cas business practices heres a review on 3k as a game

total war three kingdoms revolves around the three kingdoms period in chinese history as someone who had no knowledge and interest in this period i wasnt sure what to expect it has however definitely surpassed my expectations

h1 gameplay h1
b diplomacy b
diplomacy is better than it ever has been you can trade territories and have more meaningful ways of increasing or decreasing relations other than trade agreement or offer to join war there are actual diplomatic repercussions to postbattle choices as well which means you have more options to weigh other than increased replenishment or money the potential for the recruitment of other characters also creates a tradeoff that has never existed in a previous title execute a powerful character or let them live but risk their continued presence on the battlefield

for the first time in a tw game allies and vassals actually feel as though they have a function allies can be depended on and unlike the engame collapse of shogun or whs vortex allies and vassals will absolutely help you also now have a reason to create vassals as well as helping to build up their strength previous titles meant vassals were just used for trade and buffer zones now vassals can help secure important objectives and reduce the new corruption mechanic

spies also confer interesting and potentially powerful bonuses in my 4 campaigns i personally never found a way of getting my spies to achieve their end goal ie becoming the heirleader of a faction having said that their bonuses which include boost to trade and speeding up character defection still made their investment interesting and worthwhile

b diversity b
faction diversity is an aspect which has been heavily criticised yes the game is no wh even compared against attila factional unique units dont distinguish themselves enough for me this wasnt a problem for players who want the diversity of rome 2 or wh this may be disappointing the game also suffers to an extent due to build staleness there is no reason not to take 2 trebuchets which when upgraded with flaming rounds will rack over 300 kills a battle making ranged diversity moot

b endgame b
the endgame is the best its been previous titles basically had paint the map as objectives vortex on wh2 is essentially a waiting game as you wait for rituals to finish and set up ambushes around key settlements now you are able to plan ahead and strategically take out key opponents to set up your endgame enemies as weaker and geographically closer factions 

h1 presentation and design h1
the artstyle and music as expected from a ca tw game is stellar the ui which at first seemed cluttered and confusing grows on you and in some respects feels simpler and clearer than wh the artstyle rivals that of shogun 2 and the voice acting is much better than expected theres little more to say in this respect other than that cas artdesign team has knocked it out of the park again

h1 buy or not to buy h1
in my opinion this is the best tw has been yet yes the game does not have the endless replayability that wh2s myriad of factions provide that said the campaign feels more complete and strategic than any tw ive played to date and it feels like the first tw where strategic decisions beyond the battlefield matter if this new layer of strategy appeals to you this is definitely a worthwhile buy at full price if unit diversity is critical this game will disappoint and waiting for the wh pack will be the better option

 a truly wonderful game well made and a great adaptation of three kingdoms  i totally recommend it if you like total war andor three kingdoms stuff   only thing that really pisses me off about this game is the pricing for 60 dollars you can get 30 percent of the full game and only 1 out of several time lines then theres like 20 dlcs for like 10 dollars each if your rich give it a try and you probably wont regret it  garbage marketing design  take a look around 60 is supposed to be a full game  not 2030 percent  the stupid dlcs barely add anything

#####

pros
 its a total war game so if you know what that entails and youre looking to scratch that itch you should enjoy whats on offer here
 it looks pretty and the way the heroes work adds a new dimension to the battles zooming in to watch individual soldiers fight is still enjoyable and satisfying with lots of cool battle animations
 the uiux design has been overhauled and is excellent for the most part for the first time in the series in a long while the character portraits look good the ui is intuitive and the f1 help overlay is a godsend for players new to the franchise whoever was responsible for overhauling the ui good job i imagine were now going to see variations of this ux for the next decade of total war games
 the diplomacy system is the best and most flexible in any tw game to date
 the flavour and overall localisation is excellent especially if you put all the audio in chinese though if youre looking for strict historical accuracy youre going to feel let down

cons
 the variety between units and factions isnt really there every faction essentially plays the same way with essentially the exact same set of units
 the unique units for factions dont feel unique or even particularly special and often theyre not really worth their huge purchaseupkeep costs compared with cheaper units
 compared with warhammer ii total war this game feels rather samey
 the battles have been made into a rockpaperscissors deal cavalry beats archers which beats infantry which beats cavalry and although this has made the battles simpler it also greatly limits your potential strategies
 the ai is pretty stupid and doesnt play by the same rules as you do and because of the way it works many factions have certain combinations of unique abilities that can basically break the single player game
 despite the diplomacy system being much improved unless you spend hours in the diplomacy screen every turn then every game will devolve into everyone ganging up on you your ability to manipulate enemies through any other means than direct confrontation is extremely limited
 although the ui is greatly improved from previous tw games there are some little inconsistencies or lack of considerations that are quite annoying  for example not being able to see how two generals get along unless you put them in an army together or the annoyingly long animation for loading the reform and some other screens
 you essentially end up building the same buildings at pretty much every settlement
 some fairly long load times and performance issues for large scale battles and lategame campaign
 they charge money to add bloodgore to the game which is pretty lame

ive played 180 hours of this game and feel very much like i got my value for money but at this point i feel like im done with it compared with other total war games 180 hours isnt that much while its by no means perfect overall id definitely recommend it particularly if this is your first tw game

total war three kingdoms begins in the year 190 ce in warravaged china and the han empire is in ruins the tyrant dong zhuo has taken the childemperor captive and in doing so holds the fate of millions in his cruel grasp

all across china warlords rise each with their own ambitions some seek to restore the han and others to see it burn it is an age of chaos and of war but also of justice and heroism it is up to you to lead your chosen faction to victory and in doing so rewrite history as you see fit

with total war three kingdoms developer creative assembly has perfected the formula they have been iterating on for almost 20 years the turnbased strategic layer in which you govern provinces and raise armies is finally as if not more compelling than the realtime battles in which you command thousands of soldiers in glorious battle

this is due to the focus on the characters that make up the leadership of your chosen faction of which there are 12 to choose from each faction plays differently some more subtle than others and this allows for incredible replay value the generals you employ are the larger than life characters from the chinese historical epic the romance of the three kingdoms and would be instantly recognizable to fans of the dynasty warriors series

these characters are bursting with personality and each can form complex relationships with their comrades and with the officers of every other faction on the map this leads to an insane spiderweb of relations of bitter rivalries and sworn brotherhoods that have real and impactful effects on your campaigns ensuring more than ever that no two playthroughs will be even remotely the same

this added strategic complexity something that longtime fans have been requesting for years in turn helps eliminate the stagnation that previous entries in the series suffered from in the late game that coupled with a truly exhilarating end game event means that you need to begin preparing for the conclusion of your campaign from the very first turn

the genius of three kingdoms is that the historical text that historians draw from is in itself fantastical its full of tales of heroes holding off entire armies by themselves or shouting so loudly that the enemy commander simply falls over dead this has allowed creative assembly to marry its grounded historical gameplay with the mechanics of their incredibly popular warhammer titles set in the grimdark fantasy world of the same name

when you start a new game you are given the choice between two game modes romance or records romance is a larger than life affair in which your generals are single units capable of laying waste to hundreds of soldiers each

the rpg aspect is more of a focus here too as generals level up and fill out skill trees unique to their class they can learn special techniques that drastically alter the course of the battle or provide benefits to your government or their own soldiers your generals can also call opposing commanders out dueling them in single combat while the battle rages around them

records mode meanwhile is the traditional total war experience your general is accompanied by a bodyguard and is much more likely to die during extended combat fatigue is also more of a factor you have to consider in romance your troops can run for extended periods in records you will have to walk your troops to ensure they have the stamina to fight

i think the most surprising aspect of the nearly 20 hours i spent playing three kingdoms for review was how much i enjoyed romance mode in fact i now prefer it in past total war games i would always make historical grounded choices wherever possible even employing my own house rules when the games systems seemed too well gamey

but the opportunity for rich and impactful roleplaying is at the heart of romance mode and history snob though i can be even i couldnt deny its appeal playing as liu bei i fought a bitter series of wars with my rival cao cao during the height of the conflict cao cao besieged my capital breached the walls with catapults and his assault infantry came flooding in

in the breach alone stood my champion guan yu the famed warrior held off several hundred men until xiahou dun cao caos champion forced his the way to the front in front of both armies and in view of both of their liege lords the two squared off despite his previous injuries guan yu smashed xiahou dun to the ground maiming him for life the cao army humiliated fled shortly afterward

this was an awesome enough narrative situation to have arrived at in an openended strategy simulation but it is the mechanical effects that truly sets three kingdoms above and beyond the wound he received in the duel would lessen xiahou duns combat effectiveness for the rest of the campaign his burning need to revenge himself upon his rival guan yu in turn would give him a combat buff anytime they encountered each other

nearly 5 hours of gameplay later guan yu finally killed xiahou dun it was a surprisingly affecting moment and xiahou yuan duns cousin now last of his line promptly swore an oath of vengeance

it is this kind of incidental storytelling that elevates three kingdoms beyond other total war games and makes it something grander presentation across the board is spectacular with the art team deserving special mention china is a diverse place and it is brought to life in vivid detail the central plains are an agricultural idyllic paradise and are a world away from the savage jungles of the southland

the score is full of booming militaristic drums and traditional chinese instrumentation that inspired me on the battlefield and changes to soothing tones during quieter moments or when strategizing on the campaign map the voice acting too is quality and you can change unit barks and the banter between generals to chinese for extra immersion which i highly recommend

creative assembly delayed the release of three kingdoms from march to may and this extra time allowed for a higher level of polish it not only looks better than any previous game in the series with the option for larger than ever before unit sizes but it performs better as well

total war three kingdoms sets a high watermark for the series and a new bar for the genre its attention to detail high level of polish and differing faction mechanics means you can blissfully spend hundreds even thousands of hours playing and still find something new and beautiful to engage with it blends larger than life characters with historical authenticity and technical polish with tactical finesse

i can see myself playing for years to come and i cant wait to see where the series goes next

score 1010  exemplary

great campaign but i am against mod censorship and partnering with the cancer that is netease ca got my money for this game but not my endorsement also free china

i love the three kingdoms era of chinese history ive played romance of the three kingdoms and dynasty warriors and i think that influenced my opinion of the game as a three kingdomsera game on its own its decent it does a good job of showing the tumult and chaos of the era and giving you a chance to allow some of the minor lords a chance at glory it struggles with the fact that about half of the map is left barren which reeks of future dlc

as a total war game its a bit of a disappointment the factions are very samey with minor changes to each factions gameplay unit variation is almost nonexistent and when you come up against even other historical titles the fact that you recruit practically the same units for every faction and i mean literally the same units makes playing a different lord feel not as exciting technology progression is done with reforms and can only be done every 5 turns for everyone which means nothing you do can help you get ahead technologically only the yellow turbans have the traditional tech tree and can actually gain a tech advantage over the rest of the world but then again the yellow turbans start the game pretty much at war with everyone

the game talks about epic battles but if you fight singlearmy against singlearmy youre looking at 3 of 21 units being single unit generals the other 18 are not on an epicly large scale but really square up with the size of other total war games if you bring several armies to bear then the battles can get quite epic however this does not seem to happen frequently as the ai tends to send small raiding parties into your lands rather than fullfledged armies or they cheat and somehow have 3 full armies with one farming province as their territory i also hate how the ai spams the forced march stance gets a huge movement bonus and when you go attack an army that somehow stays in range of your army they get another half screen of movement away engaging an army is literally one of the most difficult things to do in the game forced march stance needs penalties like the inability to retreat from engaged battles until the next turn this would cause the ai and players to use it more sparingly

the diplomacy gets an upgrade with the ability to form friendships and even cause proxy wars amongst your fellow lords this can help you weaken a potential threat so you can walk in and mop up the pieces you can also form coalitions to help defend against a lord whos getting a little too mighty or who will help you forge your path to the throne the diplomacy can add variability and replayability in the game

all of this is marred by the aforementioned sameness of the factions not much feels truly unique in this homogeneous world while beautifully detailed and immersive it lacks the pizzaz of titles like warhammer and rome if youre really into the three kingdoms era wait for the game to go on 50 sale at least before you buy youll get a few playthroughs in before you realize youre essentially playing the same thing no matter who you choose to rise to the throne

#####

910

we all hate delay but the result proves game were worth the wait 

#####

this was the first game of the total war series that i played  i was immediately hooked by the immersive story and the detailed campaign and battle strategy i have since played other games in the total war franchise but this remains my favorite i am a longtime fan of the civilization games but after playing three kingdoms when i go back to civilization it feels very high level and lacking in depth if you want a game that lets you run an empire act as a battlefield general and engage in diplomacy all while learning about a period of chinese history that i knew little about you will love three kingdoms

#####

this is my first total war game purchase but not my first romance of three kingdoms game  i played 3 kingdoms first on the super nes yes im oldhaha  then playstation 1  this game is what ive been waiting for like25 years  

i can highly recommend this game to any fellow gamer who enjoys strategy games  im the type of gamer who enjoys civ5 rimworld  stellaris  if you enjoy those titles you cant go wrong here

i cant wait to see how the game will develop over time with dlcs mods etc

the art is beautiful music is nice game play is smooth  the ai is decent enough to challenge me  great job devs  nothing but a big ol thumbs up from me 

#####

while there is still a lingering annoyance with cas decision to end support for this game early i honestly believe this is the best total war game to date diplomacy allows for creative gameplay the core narrative is not invasive and allows for a strong sandbox and mod support is fantastic

#####

they cut support for this game halfway through its cycle one of the best and fastest total war game many promises made and the dlc couldnt sell so they abandoned it i cant support any games from this company anymore and you shouldnt also if you want to know more there are youtube videos reddit etc up such a shame people are buying up troy please do yourself a favor and stop rewarding developers who do this kind of crap this game is half finished and abandoned its a shame a real shame

#####

ever since i noticed steam started censoring all reviews during a certain time frame i feel like i cant give this game a good review first when the negative reviews came in it was because they had just launched a dlc with horribly gamebreaking bugs and then announced after people complained that they would no longer work on it so an onslaught of negative reviews came steam for which i have no idea why they would censor it unless they are getting paid money to do so censored about 6 months of negative reviews which changed its 70 score up to 87 i do not support anyone censoring peoples voices because they dont like the uncomfortable truth

#####

abandoned by ca since may 2021 that is just 2 years after release indie games with skeleton crews get more support after release

buy beware

#####

one of the best total war games out there it does have a small learning curve to it but once you get the hang of it the game becomes so immersive and exciting i love how the game can throw things at you with no hesitation and make the game more challenging would definitely buy it again for a friend to give them a similar experience playing this game

#####

the best total war game i ever played if you like total war games civilization or age of empires type of games give it a try the new romance campaign option is something that i never thought it would work but it does its the same game with a alternative and awesome approach it feels more rpg you relate way better with your generals and politicians i got legitimately happy when i liu bei but in my mind was i had my first daughter my real wife was even a little jealous and concerned with my mental health 1010

#####

having played all the total wars for over 10 years this is definitely my favorite total war of all time hence the nearly 1000 hours of playing the game i have bought every dlc this game has offered and played almost every single faction and characters 

i like how the game fuses both the fantasy aspects of total war warhammer and the historical titles campaign is easily one of the best as a total war fan with the improved and added emphasis on diplomacy each faction has their own different style of playing and you may also collect all the legendary generals in your factions like catching and collecting pokemon

for battles the duel mechanic is enjoyable for me as i enjoy watching my generalsheroes duel in front of thousands of troops the battle mechanic is very similar to warhammer but with troops having to use formations which works well in certain situations cavalry are extremely deadly and fun to use in the game as they can obliterate whole elite troops from the back which a well time back charge

originally there were only the han factions to play with but over time ca has added the yellow turbans the southern tribes as well as the xiliang northern varities to play with and if you are bored of the units you can always mod in some troops from the steam workshop

id say get the game and all the dlc on a sale usually there is one at june or dec except for eight princes which is frankly just a reskin for 10

#####

first impressions are absurdly positive im really impressed with this one theres so much stuff in this game and its all so well presented and well put together

this really feels like a whole new level of grand strategy games setting the bar higher than ever

#####

so at the time im writing this review the mandate of heaven dlc has been out for a few weeks now and the game is on version 140 as a preface i should make it clear that i have read the romance of the three kingdoms played numerous games and watched numerous films and tv dramas about the period so i consider myself something of an enthusiast the only other total war game ive played is shogun 2 which i love and have a few hundred hours in over multiple campaigns

now that the qualifying info is out of the way i can get to the actual review this game is absolutely fantastic and possibly the best 3k related game ive played its very wellbalanced and concise for a game of its breadth with an actually functional diplomacy system for the first time in the series the artwork both 2d and 3d is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is great particularly the mandarin voice dub which i highly recommend using even if you dont speak mandarin the battles feel great to play and arent at all a slog

the downsides are the same thing everyone else cites lack of unit variety and thus tactical variety ranged and cavalry absolutely dominate the battlefield in this game unit variety is something thats very very likely to come with additional dlcs and patches and what currently exists in the game isnt limited enough to bother me my armies in three kingdoms are already much more diverse than the yari ashigarufest that was shogun 2 theres also a relatively small number of unique characters compared to other three kingdoms games which is again something that they have been actively adding more of in each patch as well as multiple popular mods to implement more however many of the unique characters that are in the game like the famous and very powerful zhuge liang and dian wei are only realistically usable by one particular faction in the campaign so the availability is limited

regarding complexity the game is easy to pick up and takes some time to master which i consider perfect for strategy games id easily recommend this game to newcomers to the genre and on that note you dont need to be as familiar with the history and the novel as i am i would absolutely still recommend this game to someone whos never heard the name guan yu in their life and so i give this game a strong recommendation to all and hope you enjoy the game as much as i have

#####

very good but 
shogun 2 is still a masterpiece 
i also like the dark tone of attila 
is an improvement 



make shogun 3

h1introductionh1
i could only describe it as an utmost pleasure seeing the total war series triumphantly returning to its asian warfare roots instead of medieval japan the title i shall review today is the most complex simulation of ancient china you may find in a video game at the time of this publishing i applaud developer creative assemblys decision to start the campaign three decades prior to the formation of the titular three kingdoms the backstabbing diplomatic scheming and military buildup sprouting from the decaying remains of the han empire all serve as an excellent introduction into a theme thats been mostly portrayed from a supernaturallike perspective im looking at you dynasty warriors instead of a pure historical one with a clear option to choose between fact and fiction what more can i say about this prolific developer this is their lucky 13th project under the total war banner and almost 19 years have passed since the initial shogun total war reached pcs around the world and changed how gamers would perceive grand strategy from that point onwards total war three kingdoms is by now affectionately dubbed as tw3k by many fans of the series

bthe empire long united must divide long divided must unite this is how it has always beenb                          romance of the three kingdoms by luo guanzhong

it is fitting that i start with a quote from the chinese writer which first documented the fall of the han empire and the subsequent tumultuous period known as the warring three kingdoms these were in fact empires in their own right by any other definition and naturally the source material was heavily fictionalized to enhance heroic feats and characters the year is 190 ad and the roman empires slow crumble is mirrored in the rapid fracturing of the han empire on the other side of the globe corruption and inefficient bureaucracy are the culprits in both cases yet ancient chinese customs and political system do make everything from europe pale in comparison at this date and time the han dynasty ruled for 426 years over most of the territory belonging to contemporary china rather than meeting its demise as the result of outside threats the empire collapsed under its proverbial weight as corruption and decentralization had eroded imperial authority to the point of state matters being handled entirely by inept bureaucrats eunuchs in this case as underage han emperors had a lesser life expectancy than a roman emperor

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1749797513

the true power was obviously held by various feudal lords which began to question the empires authority but the catalyst to the three kingdoms period was a popular rebellion with religious undertones which took decades to repel the yellow turbansscarves were the final drop for an already full glass which had now overflown spilling hate and atrocities that could no longer be prevented warlords of both common or noble descent finally took matters into their own hands civil war broke as chinese provinces commanderies were now caught between the yellow turban rebels and the han loyalists still clinging unto power the imperial capital of luoyang was razed to the ground as the treacherous former chancellor of state dong zhuo attempted to usurp the han empire in the ensuing chaos in which he took a young emperor hostage he obviously didnt achieve his goal and a coalition of equally ambitious warlords went right after dong as soon as they were done with the yellow turbans but you dont expect me to spoil the ongoing events from total war three kingdoms do you i wanted to offer proper context as an example of the sheer complexity within chinese history sadly a topic rarely touched by western media video games included

the initial phase of the campaign shall seem outright chaotic but from the smoldering ruins of an allencompassing empire a cunning ruler can forge his own destiny which may include imperial endeavours rather than revive the former han glory why not form a new empire within a smaller yet considerably more manageable space even if you wont pick the factions which historically formed the aforementioned three kingdoms cao wei shu han and dong wu you can still selfproclaim as emperor of a territory youve conquered by force of arms or coercive diplomacy indeed avoiding bloodshed will win hearts and minds much faster when you propose a wise and peaceful rule as the only viable alternative towards a merciless tyranny youre fighting against since most major faction leaders have unique abilities and traits no conquest path shall be the same if you decide to switch not only sides but culture groups and military doctrines as well

h1graphicsh1
creative assembly have updated their proprietary warscape engine once again and the performance increase is noticeable in total war three kingdoms as expected while i recommend you run it in 1080p even the higher resolution options provided smoother experiences than the previous two warhammer tw titles thrones of britannia used a modified version of the attilla strain of warscape so it shares little of its dna with our reviewed title in question now that the more stable frame rate has been addressed we can focus on the eye candy tw3k offers a near limitless pool of epic screenshots as it looks absolutely gorgeous on its maxed out details pressing the k button shall hide the hud and it also makes the battle interface as challenging as you may like it load times are adequately short on my ssd keep in mind that im still bothered by the slow booting of shogun 2 to this day and i really cant complain about seeing any glitches or encountering any crashes to desktop this game is a true far cry from the disastrous launch of total war rome ii in 2013

h1audioh1
authenticity thats the keyword for which tw3k went to great lengths and succeeded in offering a convincing set of sounds whether we refer to the voiceovers soundtrack or general effects in fact you can totally enjoy this title with mandarin voice acting and english subtitles and i went down this route in spite of barely speaking a few words in standard chinese and not being able to read it at all all factional banners showcase the symbol which i presume is the leaders last name you will notice that unlike the western naming conventions in most of asia the surname takes precedence over the given name seems logical considering  the importance of honoring ones ancestors and the manner in which family members support each other in a political context for our game you wont find flaws in the audio assets not even highly repetitive lines of dialogue such as the infamous  our men are running from the battlefield shameful display which rightfully became a meme

just one more turn
just one more turn

step back in time and walk in the shoes of legendary warlords in total war three kingdoms utilize tactics diplomacy and guile to unite ancient china under your rule

maneuver spearwielding troops into formation for devastating flanking strikes send your most charming emissary to convince a rival to join your growing kingdom through diplomacy spy on enemy camps to gain advantage before battle the possibilities are vast

duels between heroic generals capture the romanticism of the era in cinematic fashion liu beis sworn brotherhood with zhang fei and guan yu is palpable if only all workplace friendships were this epic

juggle decisions during key events like what to do when lu bu inevitably betrays you for the 3rd time that scamp perhaps let him charge headfirst into an ambush this round

three kingdoms brings historys heroes to life in vivid detail outsmart enemies forge alliances and carve your name onto the scrolls of legend in ancient china

#####

the devs are running from the battlefield
what a shameful display
fuck ca

#####

three kingdoms is definitely a step forward from previous total war games since the decline after shogun 2 it brings in a fresh new diplomacy menu with many options that allow negotiations to be a lot less static and a scoring system that allows you to properly understand what you can do to make a deal work the new generals are an interesting concept as you are hiring specific skills for your army that lead to specific units customizing the generals is enjoyable at first until you start to see the same swords and armour with only a few actually changing the look of your general the family tree has been refreshed and the court is once again something to stay involved with as you need to balance the relation of the generals in your court and army the campaign map is nice and battles last longer to actually be worth controlling the fight settlements have a wide variety of buildings as well to make it necessary to manage your settlements properly 

however unit variety is especially dull and limited midgame comes to a grinding halt once you have seen pretty much all the units worth seeing once you finally unlock the new stronger units they are incredibly overpriced so much so that it is worth keeping your older armies with the experience they have making them just as good sieges are back but very limited as well the first few are enjoyable but once you begin to notice more advance settlements you see they do not really change much in design or with the units guarding them even worse your men have the hardest time navigating around the castle as units bunch up around corners and move slower dragging on battles i experienced a few glitches of the map disappearing or visual issues but they were forgivable 

the real reason i am writing this review despite never doing so in the past is because of the failure to properly finish total war games as well as the reduction of quality once you become emperor spoilers if you really call it that two other nations will declare themselves emperor as well and null your alliances once you drag through another tedious campaign of claiming their seats you win the short campaign i guess you either then already have 95 settlements or must continue to drag on the repetition of playing wackamole by killing armies running straight into your territory or autoresolving capturing new settlements that have identical layouts by then too the legendary heroes have begun to die off and are being replaced by stock card generals that look and act the same this halt to enjoyment is brought by lack of unit variety lack of ai polish lack of city variety removal of the cutscenes that made total war games separate from the rest lack of a clear game objective as you are running around following a new one that could be the end game which takes way too long to complete and lack of other nations that i have read the han dynasty stretched to three kingdoms is definitely a step forward from previous games in some aspects but unfortunately the lack of polish makes it seem like more of a one time play dlc 


#####

this should be a 1010 positive review however the constant crashing and issues since the most recent update have made this game unplayable 

this is my first total war game but i was always a huge fan of the three kingdoms history  novels dynasty warriors was on of the first games i played on playstation and i played several of the dw  tk games that followed ive read romance of the three kingdoms books and they are still today one of my favorites when i first start playing twtk i thought it was the perfect game turn based strategy with live battles and a pretty in depth diplomacy system honestly a 1010 in my opinion i also did not experience any issues with the game at this time 

i quit playing the game for about a month and when i came back to it it would crash constantly sometimes it would crash all the way to the desktop and the game would have to be restarted sometimes it would flash to the desktop and then come back to the game however when it came back i would have no audio and the graphics would be all messed up no color on the map almost like everything was white out  this was not once in awhile either it was every time i played the game  crashes would happen during battles during diplomacy pretty much at every point of the game honestly i save often so i really didnt let the crashes get to me until i was in the middle of a battle where i was outnumber 31 and i was actually winning  nothing really ruins the immersion more than that  this game with a recent update  has become pretty much unplayable its a shame too because this was my all time favorite

i will absolutely update this to a positive review if the crashing is fixed

#####

ill cut it short so i wont waste your time 

cons 
feels very repetitive
some dlc definitely should be free
early game is extremely tedious and boring compared  to other total war games
lack of troop varieties made the game more boring 
will probably spends more time delegating battles since it really do get repetitive and tedious

pros  
good representation of ancient chinese history
my wish since 11 years of age
very fun when chasing for emperor ship in base game
items for generals
wet dream for 3kingdoms and dynasty warriors fans



#####

to some dumbass ca officals

i like this game but commenting whatever i want on this game is my right not my privilege

#####

i always wanted a three kingdoms total war ever since playing shogun 2 and being obsessed with romance of the three kingdoms games and dynasty warriors etc the game mostly met my expectations and i loved it probably the most fun on a historical title i have had

diplomacy is king in this game there are more options in this game than other total wars my favorite character is cao cao who can initiate proxy wars and thus can snidely weaken an ally you plan to backstab by forcing them into a war very much something the actual cao cao would do also funny that the ai seems to have similar behavior ai cao cao seems to love making friends with me only to turn around and kick me out of the alliance and hide behind my enemy when the time suits him

combat is fun but i had a hard time getting into it and i think i mostly fell out of playing the game because was burnt out on the repetition after playing several factions i felt like i was doing the same strategies and compositions for them all i rarely strayed outside of the basic units and the trebuchet and archers seemed to do most of the work have some good cavalry and heroes and the battle is pretty much won

however the game has updated several times since i last played maybe it has been rebalanced to be more interesting now

i like that the game is split between a historical and romance mode heroes are more like their portrayals in the novel and dynasty warriors in romance mode where they are capable of slaying hundreds if not thousands of troops on their own and may engage in one vs one duels with other generals these duels can be pretty interesting and strategic when they work when i played some people used mods to make duels always accepted since the ai liked to refuse them when they knew they would lose can use a general that is meant to stall to duel and waste another generals time instead of them plowing through your men or can use an expert duelist who is able to assassinate general after general on the battle field and quickly rout the enemy as the chain of command vaporizes before them

overall fun game and really fun entry i plan to play again when the burnout wears off and am looking forward to see what has been improved in updates even if minor quality of life changes the game did a great job at inspiring me to live and breathe ancient china i went on a binge through the three kingdoms show and many wikipedia entries after playing the game

#####

to be honest i am not a big fan of chinese history but the game just looked gorgeous and i still prefer historical over fantasy dont get me wrong i have immensely enjoyed warhammer  so i just recently gave this game a try and holy hell is it not what i was expecting   your normal total war game is combat first combat second combat third and then development  this game is much much more about individual character development and a game of thrones dune aspect   not in the fact that characters can solo an army a la warhammer but rather their intrigues have very strong consequences  it feels like a hybrid of total war and crusader kings in that regard which is a very refreshing change of pace   the game itself is stylistic and beautiful too  very highly recommended

#####

a total war game where your diplomacy matters

#####

a really polished game which was releaseplayable a rare feat from creative assembly

a working diplomacy system something i thought they would never manage this is the first game in the series i have to constantly check the diplomatic screen out every few turns

not the best graphically but i never play the game zoomed in and down so not an issue

romance mode really manage to capture the essence of 3k period as told in the classic novel

overall great job ca did here truly an example of a great game which did not shy from multiple delay just so they could bring out the best

ive played total war games since 2011 three kingdoms itself is a mix of history  literature and i think a fair addition to the series it is the goal of these games to either relive or more likely rewrite history

pros 
enormous unit sizes helps it feel like a chinese conflict it also lends itself well to longer battles as units take longer to shatter 
decent number of playable factions appropriate for the setting
dong zhuo is a t h i c c  boyee
units are tied to retinues which makes them feel more impactful imho musteringreplenishment are p neat gives you the option to either fully amass your army or mobilize early at a lesser capacity which feels more dynamic 
heroes are indepth enough with plenty of varietycolors mods add more unique ones too with player designs on art to make them less generic
duels are interesting enough

cons
some of the dlc factions are gimmicky finding trophiesbooks or getting lu bu specific kills are tough to accomplish if certain charactersfactions are killed off before you get around to fighting them yourself the map is generally far too chaotic to lend itself well to these mechanics
do not pursue lu bu
liu bei doesnt spike his children like footballs
only 3  cultures han yellow turban banditos so a lot of units are shared between factions not a terrible thing if you want more cultures perhaps warhammer is more to your liking tw shogun 2 also had a mostly singular culture and is regarded as top tier amongst its peers in the series 


#####

as a chinese player who grew up with the three kingdoms stories this game feels totally legit the people the items the stories the voice over the system all feel great i started with the english version as i didnt know they have the chinese version after a few hours feeling tired of mentally translating all the names and places back into chinese i found out they have it in chinese didnt expect much as they are usually awkward but wow it was surprisingly well done is there still awkwardness slightly but i would give the translation 910 because they used lots of ancient texts that makes you feel immersed into that time period

overall i would give a 9510 to this game great graphic great gameplay great system the 05 is the slight crashes like 3 times in 170 hrs and too hard low probability to some of the important storylines like zhao yun joining liu bei

updated on sep 13 2019
now i can give them a 1010 because they listened to the community and improved the storylines events totally worth the price for the game

#####

one of the greatest three kingdom games ive ever played in total war style 19 hours straight into it after purchase

#####

after the failure of britannia i was worried that 3k would be another failure but it proved to be a solid game with many new or returning features in the series that set the level of the title high this game makes you care about your characters and how you level them up the diplomacy received a buff that was sooooooooo much needed and tech tree and how it interact with the world is a nice new optic families are back from day one not year 3 and the game it self follows a solid difficult campaign with the plus that all factions play style is different few cons of course as some crashes autosaves end of turn so you do not loose anything except of course a battle maybe but they range from 1020 minutes anyway also very good rework on the autofire of ranged units

and i nominated the game of course for 2019

#####

didnt think i would like this very much given that the 3k period isnt something im super into but ill be damned if i dont love this game

okay so the battle ai is still pretty predictable but everything else has been improved massively so lots of great new mechanics diplomacy actually matters now campaign ai gave me a good run for my money the game looks gorgeous and is actually optimized so that it runs great as well its not that it hasnt got issues  it does  but compared to what were used to from a tw release its bonkers how polished this is well done creative assembly

i hope this is the new baseline for ca because if it is this series just reached a whole new level brings a wee tear to my eye thinking of how far the series has come since the original shogun

#####

i have been playing total war since the first rome in 2004 and this new game make it to my top 3 of all total war games they took the right decision to delay the game 3 times and fix the bugs it feels super polished as the way it should be at first there doesnt seems to be much to it but as you progress you find a lot of intricacies they basically took the best parts of the previous total war games and cemented it

ive played many total war games  three kingdoms stands out to me in its political and region managements systems   comparing it to twwarhammer games  each turn on the campaign i was putting a lot of thought into what buildings i was building where they were located what units and generals i was recruiting who was running my commanderies i was checking the diplomacy screen almost every turn   i was actually invested in watching the npc leaders  keeping track of who they were allying with and at war with  

the battle pacing feels good  graphics are good  a distinct art style on the map makes it very appealing 

the toughest thing about this game is if youre like me  you know little of china history and its geography   the large map is very large  and it is overwhelming at first  after about 15 hours of play i started to be familiar with my half of the map only to be lost again when i started a campaign on the other side of china  

a great total war game in all

#####

sells blood as dlc
sells chinese players out to shitty netease
sanitizing mods and banning mods that dont fit their family friendly vision

#####

lmao cant believe they have the audacity to say that this game is complete and doesnt require any further updates

#####

game breaking bug in the middle of campaign dont buy the expansions after reading threads httpssteamcommunitycomapp779340discussions01742267141100224784#c1742267141100290472 ive found problems appear after mandate of heaven this bug has apparently been in the game for at least two years the dev team is moving on to other games so i dont expect any updates for this game absolute garbage come on ca what are you doing with your money get your act together a terribly shameful display i mean my god this product simply doesnt work its broken dont buy it disgusting and not in a good way shame

edit steam recommended i revise my review after playing another 9 hours and since 3k had just crashed i thought it was fitting that i do so if you buy this game i both want to congratulate you and mourn the inevitable loss of your sanity this game is fun but it is sadly irreparably still brokensometimes dont expect any fixes for this game as the developers i believe are hard at work on their next title a follow up to this game rather than repairing the sorry state of this promising addicting exciting yet ultimately disappointing game 

#####

despite the loss of support for this game it remains my favorite in the series and i cant wait to put 1000 more hours into the followup game

#####

they pulled the plug years ago but it still has denuvo it should be removed also drop those prices another one is never unlock him but dong zhou if its forcing you to stay online just like wh3 bs make him offline too  stop punishing customers

#####

they keep asking me to review this game and look i dont have time to review it im spending too much time playing it its the best tw entry in the franchise thus far and this is coming from someone whos played rome and its expansions medieval ii empire etc etc now i could mention how great the diplomacy system is and how believable things have gotten since moving from rome and medieval or how its much better to know the actual strength of the army before initiating combat or autoresolving which this game provides i could say that its like chess but in 3 dimensions and using historical figures and that ive played almost every faction and sunk hundreds of hours in this game but i wont waste my time or yours because both of us need to get back to playing this game

#####

just buy it when on sale

#####

grew up on dynasty warriors  one of my first pc games was rome tw they combined my favorite things in this game

#####

ive tried to convince myself that i was just trying the wrong faction 45 times given all the positive reviews for three kingdoms but i cant get into this game ive played every total war game since the first shogun 1 and three kingdoms has the least intuitive ui ive seen if youre playing one of the easier factions youll do little more than hit end turn for dozens of turns on end the diplomacy is frustrating to navigate and while more in depth than ever it really pulls you out of any immersion to  be able to see hard number values for what youre trying to negotiate having to throw handfuls of clay animals at a faction to get them to agree to anything is obnoxious and feels very unrealistic wrangling the characters in your court is a chore and having to pay them salaries even when they sit around doing nothing and you didnt even ask for them to show up makes managing your economy a pain i hate that i have to have three generals to field a full stack army and that im supposed to keep track of whether theyre getting along like gossiping school children all the pseudorpg elements feel tacked on and are much worse than in the warhammer games that came before this i really dislike the trend in recent total war titles where defeated armies explode into piles of gold for no explicable reason and the game intends for that to be a vital part of your economy so if youre not constantly fighting like if you need to garrison settlements for a while like you have in every total war game and still do in this one youll have to choose between having a usable army and ever being able to construct anything armies move way too slow if you get attacked from an unexpected direction youll probably lose most of your territory before you can do anything about it i could grumble on and ill admit that despite hundreds of hours in the older total wars im no mastermind at the series i know there are better players than me maybe they enjoy this game and im just not able to figure out some core elements that make it work but for me three kingdoms is a frustrating chore to play id much rather go back to play pretty much any of the previous titles instead

#####

total war three kingdoms is the total war game i have been waiting for for a long time shogun 2 was my favorite but three kingdoms has taken that spot the diplomacy in this game is so in depth the characters are so unique and make the search for great officers so much fun spies oh my lord they are so amazing in this game the battles are top of the line for total war and i like the focus again on the officers officers play such an amazing role zooming in on your officer in a oneonone duel and watch him deliver that killing blow is just awesome the economy system is so deep that you can finance your realm in so many different ways so you could play the same character in many different ways to be successful i find myself eager at the end of one campaign to quickly get engulfed in another i cannot say enough good things about this game

#####

i just cant with this game any more between units just stopping midattack to the inability for the game to actually recognize the changes to battle maps its purely frustrating at this point to find any further enjoyment from this game

dont get me wrong i have always enjoyed the total war series but it feels like every update to this game makes the basics worse  ive had too many actively played battles that failed because the interface refused to properly recognize where i was directing troops literally battles where clicking on spot on the map directed troops backwards troops just stopping for no reason lack of response and i cant count how many times archers and siege weapons acted in melee mode when set to shoot when selecting a target to attack

beyond the battles its also mindboggling that with the amount of patches and updates that when you build a palace your city troops actually get downgraded if your building the palace after being declared an emperor which lets face it if youre building the palace sooner than that youre probably doing something wrong

if you enjoy strategy and can bare to delegate every battle then this game still has saving grace but if you enjoy turning the tides on close battles or reducing casualties from battles by playing them yourself this total war game has fallen a long wayi honestly dont feel like cavalry is even cavalry at times any more

these are just the most recently glaring issues ive had with this game  it all worked much better before the updates but now its just getting unbearable  i do hope rome remastered comes fully stocked and unneeding of countless addons and updates as out of all the total war series that one has felt the most polished

#####

read carefully well i have played this game for almost 6000 hours i have completed all the best campaigns with the best mods activated from trom to mtu to chibi turning the tide i have been an expert on total war games since the days of napoleon and rome ii this game tw3k is a very good game and gets excellent when you play it with mods the map is vast and awesome the visuals are great the units are historically accurate the age is one of the most wellknown in history and has many great heroes and characters and the diplomacy system is excellent both battles and sieges are breathtaking and very unique especially on romance mode and i have achieved many many heroic victories posted some on my profile this game is also great for multiplayer and does not lack replayability its sad that ca stopped supporting the game 25 years ago but the modding community has kept it alive much like rome ii and attila finally for those who are interested who is the best faction perhaps the strongest in the game is sun ce with his insane charge bonus low building and colonizing costs and great map range or sun jian and next are cao cao and liu bei cao caos game mechanics fit my own style of playing very much as i like to be a chessmaster controlling every situation and other factions and adapting to changes well while maintaining a supreme military and perhaps the best court he also has the great guo jia and cao pi in his faction and with these 2 combined you get a 25 corruption factionwide plus the replenishment bonus liu bei on the other hand has very high satisfaction in his faction very strong and capable generals and warriors like guan yu zhang fei zhao yun and peerless geniuses as chief advisors like zhuge liang xu shu fa zheng etc lastly the spies and their actions system is the best around as it requires no money to be paid and you can steal characters and whole commanderies from the enemy or even your allies

#####

this is the neglected stepchild of creative assembly 

910 relatable

#####

soa lot of people say this is the best total war gamei mean its good but not the best  im sorry but shogun ii and its exp fall of the samurai are far superior  obviously graphically this game is better and diplomacy in this game is drastically superior  i can easily say diplomacy in this game is the best its ever been in total war  rare was the time where i felt the ai was acting unfairly in regards to diplomatic proposals  

one of the highlights of this game is the romance mode  its great to follow these epic heroes and watch them fight it out  it would have been incredible if shogun ii had thatat the same time these heroes are way too ludicrously powerful  i managed to beat entire armies with just my one hero attacking them  i know there is another mode to basically nerf heroesbut still i would have preferred more of a middle ground  its also annoying because some heroes are clearly far superior to others  any support heroes are just going to get steamrolled here

i think my biggest complaint about this game is i just found the battles to be a slog  far more so then in warhammer total war or shogun ii  archers do very little damage and the range feels so close that infantry will just overrun them easily if you have skirmish mode turned on so you have to rely on infantrybut you cant really use calvary to combat infantry because both kind of suck at fighting each other  a good spear wall in this game isnt going to really do much against a calvary charge  so instead the calvary and melee unit will just kind of slowly stab at each other doing little damage and its just exhausting and boring  they should have kept similar counters from shogun ii where if calvary charge into a spear wall your entire calvary is wiped out and have infantry other than spearmen do high damage to all other ground units including heroes  meanwhile one hero unit just cuts into all these units like a knife through butterits just ridiculous

kind of in connection with the battle system the map i just find to be not very tactical  the map is basically wide open  everyone can attack you from every single direction  there are no real choke points to hold on the map  i mean i get it its modeled off of china but i still feel they could have used mountains forests and rivers to create better choke points to make the tactical map more interesting   defending from every direction is just exhausting you cant even ally with enough people to protect your borders as thats still too much area to defend  i also really appreciated in warhammer their seemed to be far fewer cities than in other total war games and instead you were attack key resources areas  maybe its just my imagination but it feels like three kingdoms has far more cities than these key resource areas  this especially became exhausting when i had to make the slow steady push to win the game just one siege after another of heavily defended cities ughit just was not fun

again though this game is gorgeous  the map looks beautiful diplomacy is fantastic i love the hero upgrade system romance mode is incredible this is in my opinion the 2nd best total war game ever made right behind shogun ii fall of the samurai  even if you skipped warhammer you should come back to total war for this game i felt it was far superior to warhammer  #worth any price


#####

 watch the 2010 three kingdoms series on youtube beforewhile playing this 
total war fans may find the unit types basic and the mostly land maps a little samey
that being said the diplomacy and characterbased campaign are well worth your time if you are a fan of tw strategy  or the three kingdoms era
the overworld economy and faction subsystems can be difficult to understand at first even overwhelming in the first 510 hours
watch a few guide videos on building trees and youll be fine
youll develop relationships and vendettas with factions in a way i havent quite experienced since medieval total war 
really enjoyed playing as cao cao for 70 hours especially while comparing the parallels and differences to the romanticised historynovel 
mandarin voice acting and artistic design is excellent as well 
strongly recommend

#####

do not buy this game for full price  it has been abandoned

#####

i love this game its easily my favorite total war game ive always loved the romance of the three kingdoms and the characters are beloved to me from things like dynasty warriors and red cliff but with a heavy heart this has to get a thumbs down from me the northern tribes arent going to happen anymore the upper parts of the map are going to remain as they are and the problems with the late game are going to see no tweaking 

 im not one of those people that is mega angry about this but its just not complete and we all know with the creation of its own studio that three kingdoms is going the way of warhammer so just sit back and be patient if you want to enjoy the three kingdoms setting and characters im sure a three kingdoms 2 will be out in a year or two that will just make those who bought the first game pay 60 again for a complete game or something close to it  so if you dont buy this now you wont have to also buy that later 

unless they lock some of the characters and factions and tie them to the purchase of three kingdoms 1

oh damn

#####

this is the best total war game that ca have made so far true strategy but having to consider terrain troop types and climateseasons 
the political system and economic building trees are clever 
also the colour system which probably isnt explained well enough in the game is really good 
note most of the poor reviews on this game are not due to the game but people being annoyed at the early point on nonsupport while this may be true  please consider that a few of the dlc drops were free 
fingers crossed for a total war empire 2 game following this approach

#####

do not buy this game this game is currently broken head to the discussion page and you will see many complains about save files issues and consistent crashing of the game late into the campaigns i myself have had all my save files being unreadable

again if you buy this game now you do it at your own risk of money and time you will likely run into issues late into the game it seems the developers tried to roll out unfinished patches to take advantage of the covid19 lockdown situation and end up breaking the game instead

#####

an otherwise potentially incredible game marred by abysmally poor understanding of difficulty scaling and a brazenly cheathappy ai

#####

the title is misleadingthey did not get to the three kingdoms part because they abandoned the game

#####

came from shogun 2 this game has way more mechanics and the artstyle is an acquired taste the battles are very weird imo where in shogun 2 a charge could wipe out a unit these charges feel very weak from all units other than cav and heroes i dont know why but every unit feels like theyre fighting with foam swords and constantly route with 90 of their guys alive only to run back in lose 5 more guys route run back in and repeat i still like it but mainly for the diplomacy now much better than shogun by miles

#####

whenever the character shouts for the china i shout it too in real life

1011 communism propaganda

#####

greed and abandoned

#####

creative assembly looked over at their biggest competitor paradox and tried their hand at designing a characterdriven grand campaign in the style of crusader kings the result is possibly their magnum opus a campaign dripping in personal drama and atmosphere 

any complaints i have are little post1000 hours nitpicks its hard to return to other tw entries now after enjoying the dynamic ai of this games factions honestly seeing an honourable but cowardly liege die and be replaced by his cunning and aggressive son and seeing how that ai faction changes behaviour accordingly imbues the game with a sense of realism that is hard to find elsewhere in the genre 

its a shame theyve cut support but hopefully the continuation of this ip will validate that decision in hindsight

#####

makes me feel not so alone

#####

i am a long time total war fan bought this game 15 years after release i played it for rougly 100 hours and finally i had enough on the technical side the game still freeze quit to desktop or just restarts your pc randomly but does it especially during sieges people have been complaining for it since release and looks like they wont fix it any time soon gameplaywise it have its positives but the negatives makes the game frustrating to play slow unit movement bug during siege battles have been reported to ca for a long time and no fix in sight infantry combat is basically non existent the outcome of clashes between units is unpredictable you can clash a unit into the same type of enemy unit that has been attacked with missle units for minutes yet your unit almost routes other times you have fresh troops on a hilltop yet the same kind of enemy unit can go toe to toe with it in a frontal attack cavalry and missle units rule the battlefield you only need 23 infantry units as baits for the enemy to blob on i like the romance style generals but the character types are inbalanced sentinels can easily kill any type of general in a duel you only need strategist beside them and only for the extra ammunition unique generals are cool but they rarely feature any unique abilities only increased stats sieges would be great expect you need to methodically destroy every defense tower othervise they would wipe 3040 of your army alone  even after they nerfed them it makes siege battles just a chore this game could have been a really great and polished game but the long list of bugs overcomplicated and inconsistent battlemechanics makes it mediocre at best

h1 total war three kingdoms reviewh1
h1introductionh1
btotal war three kingdomsb is an entry in the total war series it features immersive politics huge maps to control and spectacular battles as each faction tries to establish its regional power in three kingdoms the illustrious history of china takes center stage as it is an era filled with numerous battles of substantial proportions tasked with becoming one of the feudal lords the player will have to try their hand at uniting china and becoming emperor 

h1 the empire long divided must uniteh1
i am no stranger to total war games during my experience with three kingdoms i could notice some new mechanics that made the plans of conquering the land more interesting for example lords serving under the player can rebel if things dont go according to plan there is a need to manage not only your financial resources and armies a core of the series but also the dissatisfaction of your close allies in one of my runs gang ning desired a higher position in court or would otherwise become a thorn inside my forces that lead to me reevaluating my court positions and favoring gang ning in the long run

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2939557025

another addition is the possibility of demanding 1vs1 duels on the battlefield between lords it results in hightension moments with great details and many animations during the intense duels an honorable fight can allow the player to focus more on other aspects of the conflict such as managing a variety of units while checking on the 1vs1 from time to time there is the banter between those locked in single combat which further elevates the tension of it

h1 though the tortoise lives longh1
i played wei and wu during my experience with the title total war entries are massive sandbox games accompanied by stories and objectives these can take a long time to achieve so patience and a tactical mind must be necessary to plan for inconveniences such as snow draining your army food reserves with the three kingdoms entry sega is trying to get new players to jump into the franchise and has reinforced the tutorials and guides however the difficulty curve is still significant and newcomers are bound to struggle no matter how wellguided they are

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2939556511

graphically and technically three kingdoms is the most polished of the total war games with great visuals and animations the new mechanics add something new for veterans of the series and the romance mode is fascinating making your general a beast on the battlefield with incredible strength it does downplay the realism of the franchise but it is a welcome addition to enjoy should the player choose to go that route

h1 strong pointsh1
total war three kingdoms is the best total war experience of all the games in the franchise there is fantastic diversity when managing political and military affairs that expand on how much there is to do the courts have you arranging your officials and giving them a position of power to try to keep them happy at the risk of them being able to betray you china is rich in historical battle material shown in the experience and it plays out wonderfully the content can reach more volume by buying the dlcs and adding even more stagesofficers but it can be pricey however there is no need for dlc purchases as there is already plenty of content in the base game

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2939557296

h1some notesh1
i played with a keyboard and mouse which ran perfectly well on an rtx 2060 i didnt experience bugs or glitches during my time with the title and i could keep solid frames at 60 suppose you are a newbie trying to get into the total war series in that case this particular entry may not be the most suitable there is an extra effort to help new players but it doesnt pan out in the end if you are a veteran there is a lot for you to get this entry especially with the new mechanics and expanded management of resources

h1 conclusionh1
btotal war three kingdomsb is one of the most prominent games in the franchise of total war a clear example is that what a developer has to do is take the potential of their games to the highest level creative assembly outdid themselves with this and displayed that they can reach a masterpiece should they desire it if you are a fan of total war this is a mustbuy if you are a newcomer there is quite a learning curve but you can try it if you like the setting or know the story of the three kingdoms

ive been playing total war games for close to a decade now though recently ive mostly stuck with warhammer 2 the first thing i would like to say about this game is that it and the warhammer games are totally different although i expect warhammer 3 to derive frombuild on many aspects of three kingdoms i first tried playing this game a couple months ago at which point i was so overwhelmed by the different interfaces and game mechanics that i stopped  warhammerwarhammer 2 is much friendlier to new users and simpler than three kingdoms however i think the changes in this game are for the better

as i said warhammer and three kingdoms are very different games warhammer was a departure from a lot of the standard total wars in that it leaned much more in favor of combat refinement than administrationdiplomacy this dumbs down a lot of otherwise complex gameplay mechanics existing in other total war games which is nice when you are a new player but removes a lot of the substance and fundamental aspects of the total war series that keep things interesting beyond real time battles three kingdoms actually feels a lot like the shogun games in a good way you have an intricate courtfamily system and multifaceted characters that you have to manage and keep happy throughout the game which can at times be monotonous but generally adds to the game quality the hero upgrade system is similar to warhammer 2 where you have equiplooting skill trees upgradable stats etc the diplomacy system is also interesting in that you can trade equips with other factions and territory like with older games you can also become a vassal to other factions which is cool but not very useful

i said that warhammer was much more combatoriented  more specifically there is a focus on interesting units spells abilities attack animations among other things there are many aspects of combat in three kingdoms that are better than warhammer though the hero dueling mechanic is really cool adds to the atmosphere of the fights and is wellexecuted in terms of visuals despite it usually not being practical to use the sieges are also much better than warhammer and feel a lot like sieges in older games with more strategic options for engagement moreover this game brought back unit formations which is fun and it automatically organizes groups of units in usable formations if you select and move them together

as far as visuals the game is for the most part nice to look at the graphics are standard total war tier and they are about as good as i expected the interfaces look nice on the surface but they can be difficult to navigate at times the unit cards in battles are hard to distinguish from each other the campaign map interfaces are placed kind of unintuitively and the army movement range indicator is really hard to see as they made it a dark color for whatever reason

overall i would say the pros outweigh the cons this game brings back a lot of enjoyable elements from old total war games improves on things from recent games and adds a lot of its own new mechanics

cathay for warhammer 3 when

i would like to thank creative assembly on listening to the communitys feedbacks and suggestions during its delays for the list of things they did during the delays please check here

httpswwwredditcomrtotalwarcommentsbqwhyhmassive_appreciation_for_ca_on_listening_to_the 

i have been following ca and following all 3ks content since launch and also have written feedback and suggestions for the game most of the issues and concerns were fixed during the delays of the game ca have also responded to my issues and addressed them the game is in a much more polished state compared to rome 2 

the developers also have streams over 30 hours of content on their total war live channel as well as hours and hours of gameplay available from content creators unlike in rome 2 where we only saw a trailer and some battle thats it

the delayed have proved to have done the game justice thank you so much to ca for listening to the fans

loved the game but could you make the game less buggy it takes a while for me to load and crashes a lot sometimes it dosent even start properly this game i think has a lot of potential if you guys fixed the bugs and some other things

#####

i recently had a craving for an historical tw a game without singleentity monsters or magic where there is a deep strategic layer and lots of tactical options i love the warhammer tw series 1500 hours but wanted something more historically rooted so i sat down and tried shogun 2 after the latest patch it runs much better now but lacks the modern campaign mechanics and uiux i now appreciate i also gave rome 2 dei a go i love the historical period and cultural diversity but dont miss the rng nature of the senate likesdislikes and agent spam 

i had left 3k after mandate of heaven with 100ish hours what put me off was the lack of unit diversity and the romance mode where single characters can carry a battle i decided to pick up 3k again and installed a compilation mod trom  tup to give records mode a glow up

1 characters the legendary characters are now all unique with different weaponsarmors and customized skills we have to really take care to pick each character not only for compatibility with the court but also commandary effects given that the character level determines unit quality its so important to attract and retain talent a key way to damage an enemy is just to execute their best characters within a few battles they are down to just rookie officers

2 economic management managing the economy food public order income is complex but also quite satisfying having cities specialize in food industry andor commerce and having characters do assignments to boost incomepublic ordercharacter satisfaction and reduce corruption adds a fun empire management overlay to 3k this circles back to how important it is to acquire a diverse and talented character pool because getting 10 corruption and 5 satisfaction makes a huge different especially in the late game

3 diplomacy warhammer has pretty simplistic diplomacy where we sign up for nap alliances and vassalage in 3k you can build coalitions that are a stepping stone to full alliances and can established stronger relationships through strategic marriages my only wish was a way to offset the longterm diplomatic penalty as a strategic threat from empire development as i grow my empire i have to conquer some of the smaller players and i get 30 to 100 diplomatic penalty from exterminating their friends it also seems that executing generals is generally a net negative very few factions will like this but nearly all dislike this even cutting down universally disliked factions like nanman or bandits or yellow turbans

4 unit diversity instead of spear ji and sabre militia dominating most armies until imperialdragon units emerge tromtup introduces dozens of new units eg pirates twohanded hammerers glaivewielders with grenades with different unit caps and characterspecific regional recruitment there is a big spread between militia buqu and elite where even experienced militia units will break and run after 510 minute engagement so you really get what you pay for in the long run top end units dont unlock until level 6 so there isnt elite unit spam from the start and unit caps to maintain unit diversity well into the endgame 

5 battles the heavy cav charges of 3k are probably the best in the series rolling over yellow turban militia units with cataphracts has the same visceral feeling as grail guardians plowing through skanvenslaves in records mode there is a deemphasis on characters and more weight on unit role morale and fatigue so there is a strong emphasis on tactical considerations like unit matchups and generating a chain reaction rout characters still play an important role there are some characters with unique skills like fire explosions that can basically chunk a militia unit by 2030 and send them routing almost immediately

i have already put in 80 hours in the last three weeks 3k will be my mainstay historical tw until ca releases empire ii or medieval iii

#####

sadly no recommendation as ca have left this game to die it was killed after several mediocre dlc even though it is one of the most beautiful and best optimized total war games had a lot of potential

#####

its an unbalanced mess with poor ai and broken features that they will never fix  dont get me wrong i still think this game is the most comprehensive romance game ever produced but it needs a lot of work i both love and hate this game and it pains me to know how much better it could be if they put in the effort

theyve since  moved on to making tw3k2 and until they fix this game they wont be seeing a dime from me in the future

note  ive only ever played this game on legendary difficulty on records mode and have beaten the game with all recommended factions

update  theyve since done one update which is both extremely vague and fails to address many of the issues the game still has

update 2 tried fairplayai mod still not enough to polish this turd

#####

obligatory mod ban  negative review review you got my money but you wont get my endorsement

even without the dev drama though this title is on the fence on the plus side the campaign is goodish with more diplomatic and economic options compared to previous total war titles the campaign is still a far cry from more fleshedout strategy games like europa universalis or sid meiers civilization but ca is making some definite steps in the right direction

on the negative side the battles are as of now very lackluster and boring  which is especially problematic given the fact that battles are one of the core features of any total war game theres also very little in the way of campaign variety so once youve experienced one faction theres not a lot of incentive to replay it this will probably change in time as more factions and startdates are added but given cas policy of releasing tiny overpriced dlc combined with their current antifan attitude towards the modding community  well if youre thinking of purchasing this game in 2019 hold off on it for now 

wait for more content more sales and maybe a few sackings until then youre better off with cheaper more fullyfeatured titles in the series like warhammer shogun 2 or even the classics which now include all dlc for free

#####

you should respect the workshop mod makers those who trying to make this game better

#####

pulls support so people rightly leave negative reviews as they left the game in a broken state then proceed to censor reviews and have steam delete negative reviews just check the asterisk next to the very positive

#####

roses are red
violets are blue
it has to be said
do not pursue lu bu

total war has its ups and downs but if you liked the previous ones but hated any one of the following
1 nearly impossible inconsistent ai diplomacy
2 a lack of strategic design re provinces
3 the absence of angry men yelling in chinese
4 realm divide

youll enjoy this its good its pretty and its incredibly fun dlcflc is hopefully only going to improve what is a brilliant chassis

short campaign 1010 multiplayer 310 so the game for me is 610 if you play campaigns and dont bother with 1v1 pvp then this game is deff worth it

long
i am more of a mp so i will focus mostly on criticism mainly because ca focused on campaign and did nothing for mp
pros
amazing optimization 
lots of innovations in campaign
2 modes so that different communities could hf
different unit cards
duels look pretty nice 
characters actually matter
beautiful artwork
so basically everything in campaign lmao
cons
mp campaign is still limited by max number of players
there are some bugs like campaign map going all white fixed it by loading autosave
the balance in romance mode is pretty bad the abilities of some gens are insane like 100 morale global silence so 1 player cannot use any abilities during the battle etc
ranked can be played only in romance also when i start searching for ranked battles i cant go back so if i want to play campaign instead i have to altf4 and start the game again lol
records mode is boring because ca didnt add anything to it how i wish they reused avatar system for it
still no gen speeches even tho there are some scripted but medieval 2 gen speeches are 10x better
kinda chaotic tab in custom battle would have been much better to use the old faction system now ppl will get so confused what to pick with all of these heroes
last but not least the insane lagfest when europeans are playing withvs chinese 
having said that we need to keep in mind that tw games at release date have never been exactly balanced or polished and this is one of their best release to date

h1an empire of beauty and conquesth1

h2a conquerors canvash2
three kingdoms unfolds like a scroll of ancient chinese artistry an immersive gateway into a time where the echoes of war drums mingle with the rustling of silken robes its not just about being the bestlooking strategy game on the block its about stepping into a world where every hilltop and river bend is a masterpiece painted with the grand strokes of history and strategy this isnt your average war game  its like stepping into the terracotta army only to find theyve all got family issues and political ambitions

the games landscape is a vivid tapestry where every frame could be hung in an emperors palace the armor shines not just on the battlefield but in the brilliance of the court where generals and statesmen plot with the same intensity they battle the personal drama oh its there as thick as congee  every decision a stroke in the portrait of your empire every alliance a thread in the intricate brocade of alliances and betrayals if sun tzu wrote a soap opera this would be it  except every episode ends with a cliffhanger of arrows instead of words

h3diplomacy and deceptionh3
diplomacy is better  still odd like your uncle who brings a knife to a poetry fight  but a vast improvement from before remember trying to negotiate peace in past games now its like trying to convince a cat to swim  still tough but you wont lose an arm doing it the ai bless their hearts are still as bright as a blackout in changan 

h2characters and conflictsh2
character relations are the new spicy dumpling on the plate and i must say its tastier than not dealing with your generals midlife crises and teenage rebellions adds a whole new layer to family dinners and characterbased units a refreshing change like swapping your horse for a dragon midrace

h3lets talk about lu buh3
and lu bu  do not i repeat do not pursue lu bu its like chasing the wind or trying to outdrink dionysus youll end up with a headache and a lot of regrets

h2beauty and burnt citiesh2
fires will actually burn now which is great for pyromaniacs everywhere if youre dong zhuo you get to play everythings a candle with entire cities as for aesthetics most units have the same stylistic flair as a bowl of plain rice a bit more diversity wouldnt hurt right 

h3a formation faux pash3
sure formations in three kingdoms havent ridden off into the sunset but theyre playing hard to get like a cat thats just not that into you gone are the days of casually throwing your troops into a testudo or a shield wall now youve got to work for it convincing your strategist that yes this is indeed a good idea and no were not just doing it because it looks cool though it totally does its a bit like trying to order offmenu at a fancy banquet you can get that exquisite duck formation but youll need to schmooze the chef first

h2trebuchets and trinketsh2
trebuchets are the new celebrities on the battlefield op as they are using them feels dirtier than a street fight in the back alleys of luoyang but hey when in ancient china do as the warlords do  lob giant rocks at your problems

h3a grand tale left untoldh3
the game was sadly abandoned by ca like a dynasty without an heir it couldve been the best total war game ever but instead were left holding the emperors new clothes  stylish but incomplete

bgraphicsb u910u  so pretty you might forget youre here to conquer not to sightsee
bsoundb u910u  the soundtracks more epic than a homerian saga
bgameplayb u810u  as smooth as silk and twice as cunning
bstoryb u7510u  rich in lore if a little too keen on military conflicts

h2the verdict a kingdom of dreams drama and the occasional fireh2
boverallb u8410u  total war three kingdoms is a strategists banquet a visual spectacle with a side of character chaos its an empire of art drama and the odd military kerfuffle 

step into the boots of a warlord and get ready to play chess with history just watch out for the pawns  theyre all armed to the teeth and havent had their coffee

#####

regional restrictions of products published by sega can be very annoying sometimes
also the end of life support for this game definitely happened too soon

#####

this is easily my favorite total war game just because it doesnt have dev support anymore is not a good reason to not pick this game up its a fantastic game if you enjoy strategy total war games the three kingdoms or faction building games this game is for you

#####

i might be blocked by ca but i dont care anymore i used to love ca but this has gone too far
not only block the mod but also block the modder because is mod show a bit of skin not even that much of showing skin compare to twwarhammer 2
ca has distanced the mod community 
pandering to the east by making a mobileish mode
ca has distanced the western community
sell their soul to netease increase price in asia increase about 10 in vietnam which is a lot of money
ca has distanced the eastern community
legendary hero with no information dayone dlc blood dlc
ca has distance any of the new players
the game has good diplomacy system campaign mechanic is interesting a deeper characteristic system and a some what ok settlements system but that all it the unit roster is pitiful hero opness trebuchets are op balancing with ammo count ca dont understand how vassal work just look at eu4 a lot of bug unit locked to a certain type of general the south of the map literaly empty
ca has distanced its loyal fan

#####

ca abandoned this game

#####

i have always been a fan of total war  regardless of its fantasy or historical streams i love all of it but i especially love this game i was raised on stories of liu bei and his brothers and cao caos rise since i was very young played dynasty warriors and seen the fantastical versions of these legendary characters and read up on their history all of it i loved

this game is probably the best interpretation of this historicalmythical period with the character designs more in line with the stories than history itself but that makes the game all to more better a part of me appreciates the historical details that the game employs but another part of my is also really appreciative of how things have been changed for gameplay value and quality

this is one of the best total wars out there and the amount of support reworks changes and love put into this game is incredible from creative assembly from the realistic versions of the character designs from their traits and attributes to their character design and appearance  all of them are really well done and detailed 

this game is one of my favourites  and it will continue to be so highly recommend

pros
best diplomacy system yet
brilliant and beautiful character designs
battles are smoother than ever  featuring a unique generalunit grouping system
game is so well optimised that turn times are so short that its hard not to keep going
chinese voices  english subtitles make the game so much more authentic

rating 1010  this game is fantastic


#####

i dont really know what to make of this instalment of the total war series on the one hand it was quite interesting seeing the new heroes and duelling mechanics but that excitement was shortlived as that aspect soon becomes incredibly repetitive and annoying i liked the game enough to drag myself through 1 full campaign as liu bei but then quickly gave up on a second campaign as the yellow turbans as everything felt essentially identical and thus superfluous

pros
 the campaign map graphics are beautiful
 diplomacy is quite well fleshed out you can now do things like trade regions or ancillaries
 i like the 3 kingdoms time period and had fun recognising all of the famous heroes as they appeared
 they brought back small settlement battles yay

cons
 the battle graphics are truly ugly with some really horrendous lighting not sure how they managed to mess this up after how pretty wh2 was for battles battles were a real chore throughout this title
 the ais fondness for night battles meant that i played about 70 of my battles in the dark
 i really hated the way armies are now formed from 3 small retinues individually hired by 3 heroes per army it felt cheesy
 you cannot trade units between retinues  even within the same army ridiculous
 unit variety is pretty much nonexistent
 very little meaningful difference between any of the factions making replayability very low
 the narrators need to constantly talk over every single loading screen was annoying beyond belief especially when youve heard the same piece of narration for the 100th time
 the ai is so easy to beat both in the campaign and in battles its a total walkover
 building options have become so prescribed that it really requires no thought at all anymore the best tactic i found was to just spam the same few buildings in every single settlement
 managing heroes and their ancillaries quickly becomes tedious and i gave up even bothering with it halfway through
 hero skill trees are just a mess and barely worth worrying about there are really no clear career paths anymore

at the moment theres a small chance that i might play this game again one day but i doubt it the map of china is just one big circle making starting positions largely irrelevant and the various factions are all basically the same so i dont see the point in playing through again maybe when the mod tools come out ill try to fix the game to my liking a strategy game that i only end up playing once is a fail in my books

#####

very fun game ive played total war since the rome days and three kingdoms has the best campaign yet theres many unique factions each with their own different strengths and weaknesses you will actually be invested to care about your generals each play through in the campaign map will be different which will really increase the replayability allowing you to have even more unique single player campaigns

#####

i have been a total war fan since the early days even today i still enjoy playing the earlier titles like medieval 2 and it dlc over the years i have watched the series grow and develop into something far more greater than what the early days gave you 
this is what three kingdoms does like warhammer 2 it brings in a diverse area of character development in the fact that your heroes are singular units they are powerful and have the abilities to take on entire armies this is a fun concept if you have played any of the dynasty warriors games that follow the romance of the three kingdoms novel and not the actual historic accounts of china 
so like what it is with warhammer 2 this concept brings a whole new level of gameplay still new to the total war world yet if you interested in playing classic then three kingdoms also gives you that option 

the campaign itself is rather confusing and can take you some time to understand the concept behind it not just from the development points of the cities but the diplomacy council and other aspects of the campaign are difficult to master at first 
one feature that threw me off for some time was the use of reforms to this day i still have not fully understood the the concept behind these its a new way of doing things however i believe three kingdoms is still easier to understand then some titles like rome 2 i have not played rome 2 much but when i do play i end up with a headache very quickly

the battle system has been developed well and incorporates both concepts from rome 2 and warhammer 2 which really brings life to the battle of three kingdoms from duels taking place between generals to never before seen unit tactic and formations three kingdoms brings you hours of fun that make you need to stay one step ahead of the ai or enemy player at all times one fatal error can spell the end of you entire army a mistake i have made a couple of times 

this brings me into a certain bad point of the game that is the choice and selection of units i understand that it is needing to follow as much of the history of that era as possible but the game can become somewhat dry by the time you reach the level to unlock the more unique legendary units

im not going to go into load of details about the pros and cons of the game what i have said is basics and you find out what this game has to offer on your own through playing it i do highly recommend this instalment of the total war world for you will not be disappointed and like me can have hours of fun playing it 

thanks for taking the time to read this

what you do in life echos in eternity

#####

within the top 3 best tws of all time and easily the most polished historical title since shogun 2 the campaign mechanics graphics and the attention to detail is second to none within the tw franchise 

the game is very very well optimized i have been running the game on a five year old pc and it was honestly shocking how well i was able to run the game even on extreme unit sizes run the game using the romance color filter its better

the ai can still be goofy during battles especially sieges but overall the ai has been better at attacking as a group in land battles the campaign ai is unforgiving unless you play it carefully vhvh was playing as dong zhuo and i had a half dozen full stacks charging right down my throat it was probably the most hectic and exciting campaign i have played since my time playing as hattori in shogun 2

i havent encountered any bugs as of yet i havent had any crashes no matter what you think of china ca or the three kingdoms period ca deserves praise for this release

8510 at the very least

#####

liu beis bizarre adventure is my favourite historical novel so naturally this game is a certified han classic

#####

the asian guy will betray you 1010

best experienced while alternating between playing this and watching the 2010 campy chinese three kingdoms tv series if youre not familiar with the setting to begin with as was the case for myself the characters make more sense that way and become much more likable

recruitable unique some historical mostly randomly generated characters and their relations are a major focus in the game  your faction does not exist without them even your armies are inherently bound to them they also influence diplomacy which is the other major focus the focus on character relations is largely only relevant to gameplay mechanics however theres some spoken dialogue between specific characters but it all feels very loweffort forget about historical accuracy too the games based on romanticized fiction and takes some further steps for gender equality  notable changes coming from shogun 2 as my previous total war game not that i mind any of that since the gameplay and atmosphere are both very good

speaking of campy the game at times feels like a campy mess of a different kind  it appears to be perpetually quite buggy things get fixed broken fixed again and new content patches introduce new bugs though most of the important stuff works as of the last time i checked i got into the game early and over time ive abandoned several campaigns because of a new patch that fixes something particularly annoying like endgame diplomacy being permanently gimped for my yellow turban faction but hey so far things have been getting fixed the earlymid game is the most interesting part of the campaign anyway and all the factions have some unique mechanic to figure out

while some aspects of the game on their own are either somewhat simplistic like the balance between combat units or needlessly convoluted like the reform tree and building chains once youve taken the time to figure them out they also become quite straightforward the diplomacy shines compared to the rest of the series or even compared to many 4x games theres a huge amount of variables and theyre often intuitive and something you can affect and predict the campaign map is huge it feels very dynamic and its gorgeous to look at on a positive note about the combat coming from shogun 2 i greatly appreciate how smoothly the units follow orders and find their place

so yeah its a grand time highlights being the campaign map itself and the diplomacy favorite total war game along with shogun 1

#####

best diplomacy system of any total war game

#####

this game is broken and half the mechanics just dont work right many of the leaders and factions have unrewarding playstyles and records mode is an unfinished joke once you get past the shiny lights and sounds exploding during battle there is a hollow soulless strategy game that takes no skill to play aside from patience for busywork

i love the timeline the history and the romance of this era but this game is missing the latter two of these please avoid this game which will nickel and dime you for content already in the game since day one they have released dlcs that break the core game whether you owned the in question dlc or not i dont think these guys test any of their patches because many of the updates corrupt your save files also

ca has also announced their next historical game is exclusive to a competing platform so today i announce the next strategy game i play will be from a better developer i have been with the series since shogun total war and this is the final installment ill purchase of the once proud franchise

#####

i good total war game that has gotten better with patches 

the campaign is among the finest in the series the character and building mechanics make for interesting strategic play on the campaign map theres strategically more than one way to skin a cat for most factions

diplomacy is the best it has ever been in the total war series as the ai makes intelligible but sometimes unexpected moves 

i only have two complaints

1 the dlc isnt as varied as other total war games more often than not it introduces a new start time in the same story but at different plot points if youre a fan of the subject matter you love it me i see no reason to drop 10 so i can play sun ce or lu bu at some different point along the timeline 

mandate of heaven is pretty cool though 

2 the battles and recruitment system kinda suck compared to other titles heroes render few perceptible changes to their troops while on the battlefield but as duelists red herrings and ammo sponges they work wonders theyve become the centerpiece of battles without any real means to counter them except other heroes 

not my cup of tea but your mileage may vary 

all in all this is a great strategy title to get on sale id probably enjoy the battles some too if i didnt spoil myself with other titles

#####

in short

its good now 810 buy it if you like strategy games but some of the things i said in the past still stands read the review after the mandate dlc i am leaving my past review so that you see how this company works they launch a game with not much to do and then add the rest of the content with dlc and some freelc

past review

pros

 chinese history is cool
 game runs very smoothly zero crashes hats off to you on this ca
 every faction has unique abilities some are op some are useless
 battles are closer to historical total war games if you are in to that with the romance mode you get a mix of warhammer and historical battles as in the romance mode generals are very powerful
 campaign map looks incredible
 new diplomacy choices but diplomacy is not good read below

cons grab popcorn boys this is gonna be good

 the ugly i dont know what they were thinking but the ai is horrendously cheating in this game how bad is it its worse than warhammer ai cheats they get endless cash so they improve cities faster than you they get more armies whereas i can barely field 6 full stacks late game when i form one of the 3 kingdoms but the ai gets 10 or more oh and btw literally everyone declares war on you in the game sometimes a faction you signed non agression pact 5 turns ago decides to declare war on you late game everyone declares war on you even your best buddy liu bei with 100 opinion non agression pact and trade agreement btw worst ai in tw history how can you fix this give the players more income less corruption and cheaper armies 

 vassal system is absolutely stupendously broken as a veteran who only plays on very hard or legendary difficulty every game i played late game my rivals basically vassalised the whole country of chinea where i had to fight them on my own plus you cant vassalise the factions but the ai can do it with ease make vassalisation limited like the trade agreements or let the players vassalise too by removing cheating ai or making it easier for players

 i actually tested the game on normal difficulty too a guy who never even touches hard is actually playing on normal now can you imagine how broken the ai is and guess what they just declare war on you for no reason on normal difficulty too jesus christ ca

 building system is meh can be improved a lot

 faction court is not impressive after a couple of hours you notice how hollow it is

finally

this is the best total war in its launch date no crashes no problems no errors but the negatives are more than positives right now and the stupid retarded backstabbing ai with endless armies and cash is just frustrating where you just try to survive against all of china
i believe that the devs will fix these problems in the future if not the modders will definitely fix the game in the future 
i dont know who will fix it buy if these issues are fixed this can be the best total war game ever yes it can actually be better than medieval ii if the problems are fixed

120 hours in

i just beat the game in legendary difficulty with campaign and battles on legendary and i noticed that the ai is much better on legendary difficulty enemy archers do not attack your infantry with shield wall and the enemy cavalry doesnt charge on your spears for no reason  just kidding yes they do so that is a great improvement ca thanks but the game is still not balanced

im probably gonna recommend this game in 6 months when they properly balance it and add dlcs and freelcs 

review after mandate of heaven dlc

and here we are after awhile and i am recommending this game after a dlc ca things amirite  i can say that they fixed some of the problems i stated above with the mandate of heaven dlcs you get alot of new units and balancing to certain factions very fun new factions however the ai is still retarded i was playing in the north and ai faction to the south declared war on me and sent a stack to the north just to fight me while they were at war with other ai factions yes yes i know i can just give 1 food to the ai if i dont want to fight them but that is just exploiting the game the vassalization of every country by the ai is still annoying in the base game but less so in the mandate timeline economy is fixed the yellow turban factions in the mandate of heaven dlc are very fun to play as all in all i recommend this game now but there is still room for improvement i give it a solid 810

#####

first things first about the game itself

game was not bad at all one of the better total wars ai wasnt horrendous the gameplay wasnt too bad quite a nice variety of units in the base game its really fun to play with your favorite 3k characters

localization was made professionally they speak an older traditional chinese properly in fact i switched the audio to chinese as it sounds better

would it be a thumbs up no due to corporate greed

the story behind the scores of negative reviews can be summarized as

creative assembly made quite a bit of money through steam especially on chinese players as a matter of fact 3k was targeted towards the chinese market since its a nobrainer chinese culture  good for chinese players hence why fantasy genres are good for a whole population in this case it is naturally advantageous to place it in chinese markets

after making bank af profits from china creative assembly sold off the title to netease which is essentially regulatory body for video games in china they say they are a reseller but they censor both the game and mods ex china pm xi shows up as  so it ends up with your characters being named  chu

the chinese players got the play the same uncensored retail version as us now they have to go through a censored version if ca wasnt that greedy they would keep the titles rights to themselves and keep distributing it but hey ca grace can promise how many times she wants that things wont change for the chinese players but they already have gotten censored and they dont have the right to use the game mods as the west

this is infuriating you are segregating the west from the east again you still took the chinese video gamers money at full price on release didnt you im pretty sure if you disclosed that in the long run you would leave distribution to a chinese retailer you wouldnt get a lot of sales on release eh

on top of this you can add 8 princes suck you remove all notable characters and dump us in a side story chapter where we cant carerecognize anyone with a bunch of generics in a sandbox and charge us 15cad 

shamful dispray

if you are listening to the community i hope you will take this feedback of your fan who bought all of your games except warhammer2 seriously before your 20th anniversary

1 rometotal war the first total war game i played and one of my favourites it had excellent campaign battles 
strong side  characters overall you were getting passionate about your charactersgenerals they lived long and you were trying to make them better and better character traits ancillaries were meaningful and easily readable like cavalry general it did make sense for example to have mostly cavalry in your army to obtain such a trait which makes you even more stronger with cavalry  heroic battles provided strong generals you were feeling greatly rewarded about winning a battle that was impossible to win by getting several starred general   senate elections was fun players were passionate about getting your characters elected onto senate in three kingdoms you are getting passionate about your characters you work on upgrading those but the random traits are not as good and are not readable

schools were educating your generals you were moving all your young generals to a city with a good school and letting them stay there for several years and only then giving some soldiers to them  in kingdoms i dont feel the bonus of building educational buildings
walls could have been constructed in any city wonders provided good bonuses having ability to recruit superb spartan units only in spartha and syracuse cities you could build many cities with really good income there was a great sense of culture for every nation

you could have recruited as many spies as you wanted and send them wherever you wanted bridges narrow passes you could have stayed your armies on such locations to defend your critical areas and prevent enemy armies from entering your country
horse archers pikes legionaries cataphracts chariots there was a lot of unique units and every faction was different from another

bad diplomacy was very bad it was a total war with everyone the more bigger and bigger you were becoming the less interesting it was to play in three kingdoms it is different from just being able to survive in the beginning up to three kingdoms stage where you understand the other factions are already too big and it is going to be very hard and very long to defeat them this makes you more careful and you just try to make your economy stonger before going onto war with them 
fighting battles was great although units were moving very fast your entire army could have routed in few seconds combining all your cavalry into one big chunk was better as if units were not hindering each other this was different in rome 2 where if you charge with one of your cavalry units your second cavalry unit would have been hindered by your first unit and will not have much impact this is done more or less good in three kingdoms except that the speed of units is way too slow i like the rome 2 units speed most

2 total war medieval ii
strong side  campaign characters overall you were getting passionate about upgrading your princesses merchants priests getting guilds in your cities you couldnt make your cities as wealthy as you could in rometotal war but having merchants and controlling resources of other factions seizing other merchants was making game very interesting there was a great sense of culture for every nation in three kingdoms except certain units the rest looks all the same and boring at lest cities in provinces with wonders could have had different look 
pope faction was another thing bringing a unique taste to this game pope had a great impact on all factions and could have immediately make all other factions go to war on you as a leader you were trying to maintain good relations with pope crusades was another thing making this game very interesting it could have helped you to recruit huge armies travel long areas not spend money on those armies and fight other cultures there is no any such sense in three kingdoms mongol invasions timurids invasions were devastating by that time you would have grown larger and this was making a good challenge even for large and strong countries you had to really prepare large amount of strong armies to be able to hold on such feeling of large invasions exists only in attila this game has 3398 active players count even though it was released in 2006
bad diplomacy was still bad your allies could betray you no matter how good relationships you had with them although overall the diplomacy was bad but still you could have formed diplomatic marriages to improve the relationship

3 without going to much into details for every rest of the games empire brought first naval battles shogun 2 was overall a much better version of empire and napoleon rome2 having better graphics and diplomacy than rome1defensive alliances factions finally not betraying each others not able to sell regions though but the rest is much much worse than rome1 a turn based game with every possible upgrades or technology research giving only negligible increments characters dying too soon before you could upgrade them much you dont even desire to click on next turn button as you know you are not going to get too much bonus bugs in battle mechanics where entire charging unit with many soldiers abrupt stops with just a single solder hitting them things got fixed only in empiredivided dlc but not on the main campaign but still i like the battles in this game very much and about 6000 the rest of the active players of this game in warhammer finally long living characters returned back the game engine and mechanics all look good in this game it is just that i dont like such fantacy genre much thrones of britannia i liked this game because it was historic and it had a sense of quests like in warhammer brings new taste to total war games regretfully there was not much cavalry in this game overall it is hard to differentiate units from above in battle map except for their banners the same is in three kingdoms where all units look absolutely same from above this makes battles very awful in rome 2 for example you could easily distinguish pikes archers cavalry horse archers maybe the issue is in camera height 


finally three kingdoms diplomacy got greatly improved in this game giving things that were not existing in old versions of the game like instigating proxy wars selling food ancillaries coalitions alliances across multiple factions good side is there are unique characters luckily long living you get a unique sense of your faction growing bigger and bigger it is interesting challenge to assigning characters to court assigning administrators to reduce corruption to make sure you get most bonus and ensure they are all in harmony but there is no pleasant feeling of side quests like things existing in older games senate elections pope merchants or trying to survive invasions there is nothing significant in destroying yellow turban rebellion or capturing the the emperor there is finally a sense of military supplies which wasnt even existing in any of older games but to me there are still things that could be improved in military supplies concept for example in romance of three kingdoms sima yi and sleeping dragon were fighting over a single city which was critical in transporting the supplies bonuses provided by upgrading buildings seems to be not significant enough you get just 100 every time after upgrading the mine but spending much more money for every upgrade playing with sun jian you expand and capture more and more of the han territory but i didnt felt of becoming very reach you dont get much trade income from controlling many ports

#####

cons as a huge fan of the romance of the three kingdoms franchise and era its a little hard for me to swallow that im limited to one scenario year setting while the rest is locked behind dlc including other lordscivilizations it basically feels like i bought the game for full price but only received 25 of the game in this regard the dlc content is nothing like dlc content and is more of a paywall personally speaking i feel like a strong dlc would have been when the sima family comes into power beginning the jin dynasty and putting an end to the three kingdoms era or like how in shogun 2 the dlc could have taken place in a different era such as the spring and autumn period or warring states eras in terms of gameplay the ui for the overworld is honestly more confusing than it is helpful theres important information that isnt easily accessible such as peace treaty duration 

pros if you like three kingdoms era content youll like this game whats not to like about historical fiction simulation and realtime strategy now you can watch your generals run the map down like theyre playing their own dynasty warriors game while you play total war on the side

update as of 492024 with 240 hours

now that ive played multiple factions in various scenarios i can now understand why other lordscivilizations were locked as dlc content and thats because each lordcivilization has unique units and buildings some of which are complete overhauls of the normal infrastructure that is available ive cleared the game on legendarylegendary over 9 times now and its been a blast exploring through all of the different technologies and ingame mechanics im addicted and show no signs of stopping just yet haha

pros if youre a fan of warcraft 3 the generals in this game are like heroes from wc3 each general has a rank level and by ranking up theyre given a skill point to use to tech into a skill tree some of these skills range from passive to active abilities that can be used in battle but there are many other skills or traits that also affect how these characters interact with their world as well there are five general classes sentinel champion vanguard strategist and commander along with these classes every general has five stats expertise resolve instinct cunning and authority and specialize in one stat based on their class similar to how in wc3 all heroes had three main stats strength agility intelligence but focused on one just because generals share the same class however does not mean that they will have the same skill tree every general has a different skill tree layout and some generals have access to unique abilities what makes this game so fun to me is that along with building your characters trees to your liking you can also manage their equipment like an rpg so the game hits many notes beautifully regarding civilization simulation realtime strategy and roleplaying 

the game is beautiful its a shame that the developers dropped this gem of a game i hope that they learn from their failures in this experience and include the scenarios and characters that most three kingdoms fans are looking for that being said if you are a fan of the three kingdoms era this game is a mustbuy

#####

the crème de la crème when it comes to single player gameplay unfortunately not in terms of multiplayer and postlaunch support this game is a true masterpiece with campaign mechanics and complexity far surpassing all other total war titles in addition the artistic design and the great soundtrack create an absolutely unique atmosphere

#####

game still crashes in 2023

done all the stupid fixes  brand new gaming pc with windows 11 pro

ca wont fix this and steam wont give me a refund when i purchased it on summer sale i thought 173 was supposed to have fixed all the issues which is why i never bought this title before

rome 2 attila shogun 2 empire and all three warhammer games work with no issues

#####

the first total war game to give me that one more turn urge since shogun 2

h1total war three kingdoms reviewh1
total war three kingdoms is turnbased realtime management and grand warfare strategy game developed by creative assembly and published by sega it is the 13th addition to the famous total war franchise that released on may 23 2019 on windows mac and linux it sets in the three kingdoms period of ancient china where you lead one among 12 warlord factions to form an empire and eliminate the others to become chinas ultimate ruler it features both the singleplayer campaign with two game modes  romance and records along with multiplayer gameplay

h1modesh1
the game features two modes which differ a bit from each other 
romance is based on the romance of the three kingdoms novel wherein generals are extra powerful along with plenty of cavalry bodyguards who will increase with your experience levels you can also equip all your heroes with weapons armors mounts ancillaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilities
records its based on records of the three kingdoms and presents a more historically authentic version in this mode the generals no longer have superhuman powers and can no longer be commanded separately in addition to changing specific equipment ingame to be more authentic to history

h1campaign gameplayh1
three kingdoms has a deep intense and yet balanced gameplay it requires excellent strategy and diplomacy to win battles or keep the peace the atmosphere is impressive alongside with its music and ambiance the voice acting is terrific in chinese mandarin the battles in the game resemble total war shogun 2 with its spear sword ranged cavalry siege basic archetypes each army features generals who are powerful heroes with abilities that can change the tide of the battles in siege battles players can command both infantry and cavalry units these units are divided into different entourages each led by a commanding generalhero the player can deploy up to three generals into the battlefield at once along with three in reserve the player can also command each general separately and they can engage in oneonone duels only in romance mode that ends when either one of them dies or flees dueling and killing generals will crush morale although the ai in three kingdoms is quick to accept and propose duels it cannot win

h1whats differenth1
the game introduced a new gameplay mechanic guanxi system in the game which generals can use to form social connections and relationships with other characters based on this other characters will form positivenegative opinions between each other based on the experience that they had with each other including past events friendshipjealousy faction friendlinesshostility etc 
unlike previous total war games all armies have a pool of 100 supplies that slowly fills in your territory and rapidly drains in enemies territory once your supplies hits zero youll suffer massive attrition  losses running out military supplies in between prolonged sieges is extremely risky so aside from conquering armies and settlements there are no effective ways of replenishing your supplies during an invasion this combined with the very slow replenishment of supplies and mustering of replacements it forces you to be very deliberate with your aggression and defense

h1diplomacyh1
three kingdoms improved the diplomatic options far better from shogun 2 and previous total wars games but you will find yourself taking advantage of them more often and outwit your rivals by bluffing bullying and flattery items  payments and marriages can be used to appease leaders into treaties and trade agreements and territories can be traded to mutual benefit enemies can be effectively extorted when their backs are against the wall
the confederation system is the icing on the cake forging large confederations will require you to navigate carefully as a majority of existing ones must approve new members and voting in opposition of members will sour your relations furthermore people will not be interested in joining if your confederation is weak that means the order is essential and you will want to confederate with the most widely liked and powerful factions first

h1graphicsh1
three kingdoms is wholly committed to its theme the game revels in its chinese setting with a wonderfully bold color palette lighting up the map gorgeously varied battle maps and appropriate music without getting corny particularly the design of the tech tree the overall visual is very beautiful to look at not stunning but easy on the eyes the campaign map of china uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers land and trees not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at there are also peasants working on the fields soldiers patrolling the main road pandas eating bamboos and hunters hunting wild animals making the entire map feel alive small details go a long way

h1whats lackingh1
there are a few bugs and maybe a few mechanics that dont work as intended but nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make you stop playing there are many unique lords and generals but there is only few dozen of them when you play and recruit more they almost always look very similar with the same bad weapons and armor so in the lategame when your heroes die of old age the game becomes a bit less appealing and boring

h1verdicth1
total war three kingdoms proved to be a worthy successor and not just another total war game it is highly optimized and improved performance combined with its enhanced ai its constant ability to provide hostile and challenging battles  its breathtaking the campaign design is brilliant along with unexpected turns and twists its the best game to start with if you are new to total war and smoothly immerses into its complexities better than any of its predecessors overall its a colossal hit allinone package since shogun 2 and warhammer the campaign has over 20 hours of gameplay potential with its 5 dlcs to add even more i highly recommend it

rating 910

#####

huffing hopium for them to release more dlc for one of the best tw titles

#####

as a chinese player its such a shame to ask all the devs not to join the dirty course with bad taste chinese internet giants

we try to escape from that bad taste environment and that is why we play on steam

working with netease and tencent will only make devs as evil as they are

down with the chinese internet giants

tldr the game is mostly decent if you ignore the fact that ca abandoned it before fixing a slue of bugs and crushes or just neglected a general polish that you would expect from any product what so ever that you are expected to pay for there are a lot of visual glitches and campaign bugs that require reloading the save for something to take effect or allow you to use certain faction mechanic that meet requirements but the game doesnt realize that until you reload granted the battles them selves look and play amazing barring the occasional visual glitch right after loading into battle like you would expect from tw game



my biggest problem with it at the time of this review is that their last patch 171 kinda broke the trade agreements for liu hong campaign in mandate of heaven this is just an example for a faction available from mandate of heaven dlc but the issues mentioned here concern the base game and other dlcs as well mainly every or almost every faction that is supposed to use rivers for their trade agreements that are locatad in the western half of the map in fact im pretty sure they forgot to game test this faction at all and probably a lot of other factions too nothing in liu hongs starting situation makes sense i didnt play as every faction just yet but there is a general sense that big chunks of the game feel unfinished not just bugs and crushes but the gameplay itself so here is a little rant

the trade port you suppose to take as liu hong at turn 1 has no purpose since its only purpose was to give access to trade agreements with the entire empire but now its situated between two impassable straits that block not only armies but also trade now your only option to unlock sea trading is to annex 3 counties all the way to dong that has a harbor which is nether fast nor easy nor as defendable as your capital commandery

and dont give me that game engine limitation crap a bug is still a bug its just an excuse for a lazy game design its their game and their game engine if they have a limitation then they should overcome it for instance leave it as a normal part of the river as far as the game engine is concerned but prevent the ai and player armies to ever use it for any reason with appropriate measures and presto you have piece of impassable terrain that trade can go through

devs did this stupid change all because they wanted for gate counties to have a purpose which they still dont have just like in other games in their franchise honestly this problem of nonstandard territories that their game engine cant handle persists in multiple games for many years now eg gates that can be starve sieged from one side in warhammer youd think theyd fix it already anyway in my game the big looter army that starts in liangxian went through hulao pass like it was never there i was possible probably because they went attacking my army that was just beyond the gate on the edge of luoyang sandwiching them selves between my army and luoyang garrison on one side and hulao pass garisson on the other yet another game engine limitation

buy the way that looter army doesnt make sense ether before 171 liangxian was part of luoyang commandery and you were supposed to attack that army with your beaten up imperial forces that dont replenish for shit which is fine to secure your first commandery as per mission but now its part of nanyang commandery beyond the mountain range that you dont need or want at all the aforementioned mission to secure 1 commandery that was supposed to compel you to go after them is given and finished at the same time by colonizing that useless trade port ca might as well just could have given the reward for free without this so called mission and because of that the looters are just another thing that doesnt have any purpose

and by the way whose insane idea was to bombard the player with missions that are finished ether immediately or in first 5 turns or so followed by missions that are so far into the future that you have nether time nor incentive to finish before you a achieve victory condition

if you can overlook all that then sure buy it as i said before the game is mostly decent and those kinds of annoyances dont kill the fun of most campaigns but still i would have asked for a refund if i didnt play as much time as i have before realizing the games many many flaws

ps dear ca we all know that you are money hungry after all every corporation is but can you please finish your products before you start spamming dlcs or abandoning them for a sequel were paying money for this crap its the least that we expect

pps i realize that game engine limitations can be hard and time consuming to deal with properly sometimes to the point of not being worth fixing for one particular product but they are no excuse for selling products with broken or nonsensical game mechanics for years

ppps whats up with that ai impostor liu hong who is a subject of emperor liu hong located on the south eastern sea shore is it historical or what

hello

three kingdoms is probably the best of the total war ive been playing to these since medieval ii and had bought rome i after that but neither rome ii which was my former favorite total war nor the following i didnt get thrones of b opuses did that impression to me

i got three kingdoms on january 2020 and the game has hugely evolved since that date  it already was a very interesting game which put you in the middle of some of the most legendary figures of ancient china the duel system is quite interesting and tactically useful if you want to fix some general while you fight against his army moreover the profoundly complex system of imperial flavorthe diplomatic panelthe spying networkthe microgestion of parameters propers to your faction such as credibility for cao cao etc deepen the consistence of the game transforming it in somewhat of an rpg while the former total war games were more flat 

there are some problems however for example arrows seem to be made of rubber and you can hardly kill more than 20 people of a unit with only your archers and crossbowmen if they are not of the imperial guard i only play on legendary so i dont know what they do in the other difficulties liu biao and the prince of runan sima liang eight princes are quite frustrating and it is merely impossible to win a campaign as them even if there gameplay is interesting jurisdiction  government  the game should adapt the campaign to these characters and make it easier to get cooperating warlords and to maintain your vassalage while it should be allowed to raise armies on client territory it takes 3 years to go from shandong to sichuan

i only tested mandate of heaven and eight princes dlc and if they are not a total innovation they remain part of a game and are not new ones they introduce some interesting features such as the quest to maintain the empire while being liu hong the ling emperor of han the alignment parameter from the eight princes is quite interesting and the sensation to be plunged in another warring period of the chinese ancient history even if related to the former is very amazing

some of the characters lack of variation but the differences between the groups of factions  yellow turbans warlords governors bandits  is enough to give you four great groups of campaigns i dont include the nanman campaign which is a whole new one with new objectives and enjoyable features so you can tell that there are merely eight campaigns in the game playing as dong zhuo the governors the warlords the yellow turbans the bandits the nanman petty kings the ling emperors or the eight princes i havent tried the 194 and 200 dlc but i think that the stakes are very different for at least cao cao liu bei and yuan shao than whith the 190 campaign

i would really like to see one day a xianbeixiongnu and a korean dlc and why not a tibetan one  stand alone dlc about the eighteen kingdoms the warring states the sixteen kingdomsnorthern and southern dynastiesfive dynasties and ten kingdomsfall of the tang may also be enjoyable even if i understand that sega and the creative assembly have other things to do

finally i would say that knowing even a little about the three kingdoms period is crucial to fully enjoy the game i got my older brother to play to it  at first he was not interested and playing as cao cao didnt ring any bell for him  then i showed him the wikipedia page about the timeline of this period and he began to love his campaign the final step being to read the romance of the three kingdoms

good day to you

#####

i very fun game i think i like the story line as it follows the romance of the three kingdoms and it also runs well and theres a lot of factions to play and replay since theres lots of different aproaches you can take either a dangerous warmonger emperor or a peaceful ruler which i like im not joking it took me liek 70 hours to finish 1 campaign which if you have that patience then it is good but late game does get hard as you have to micro manage every single commandery you own and i always lose my armies cus of how big the map is it also gets super easy once your really big and have a large econamy since no one can stand in your way but early game i would say is the best because all the factions are there and you can never know what the ai will do one game as tao qian cao cao attacked me following the story but then another time he didnt and we became best friends even though i killed his dad but anway i think it is a fun game with lots of replayability although teh dlc are pretty crap since its basically the same thing but whatever

#####

masterpiece deserved to be supported for longer

#####

shameful the way ca abandoned the game in the state that it is in 
beautiful setting and art design thematically this game is great but it suffers from way too many game breaking bugs and major issues that have not been corrected to this day campaign is intricate and a great way to sink time but i always have to save frequently because i never know if the game is going to crash when i press a button absolute shame

#####

game good

review bad

why because they added stupid censorship
my username elexis shows up in game as eles because ca are too lazy to implement proper censoring and also too lazy to only implement it where it questionably is needed  in china only

xi is the surname of the chinese secretary of state

#####

really good game sadly left to rot by the devs in favor of warhammer 3

#####

ca has abandoned the game but its still like a second home for me

#####

total war three kingdoms is a culmination of all the experiments made in the last few years with the series since rome 2 total war has struggled to find its footing in its historical titles attila had a lukewarm reception and thrones of britannia used the same engine while not providing a whole lot of new content aside from a change in factions and a few tweaks to gameplay over the years attila and rome 2 have both received numerous postlaunch updates changing many of the ways of how the game was originally played and for the better 

the other big thing to happen to total war in recent years was warhammer the fantasy based total war game breathed new light into the franchise and introduced some of the the most ambitious gameplay changes to the series while being well received critically and by players some total war fans were worried that this new title focusing on big heroes magic and myth would overshadow the historical titles in the future

which brings us to three kingdoms the romance of the three kingdoms is a sprawling novel focusing on the turbulent years towards the end of the han dynasty and the three kingdoms period in chinese history starting in 169 ad and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 the novel features many outstanding characters and draws from the history of china to tell a story about the unification of china and the grand people behind it all  all this combines to give us a historical title with aspects of myth and fantasy woven into it

total war three kingdoms combines all the lessons learned from previous total war games and combines them into one its best historical titles in a long time offering two distinct ways to play the game

 romance mode a focus on the larger than life characters big heroes that can change the tides of battle engage in duels and are an army of one battles are usually faster with a bigger focus on using your characters abilities

 records mode a focus on tactics and the traditional total war experience characters are accompanied by a unit of bodyguards and dont wield the strength as they do in romance mode battles are typically slower where positioning and pacing is more important

each play mode has its own distinct feel but given this games importance in characters i have opted to play the game initially in romance mode 

as for the game itself it is laser focused on depicting its source material and setting with lavish colours sweeping landscapes and a suitable soundtrack and audio the added touch of chinese language is nice as well and probably appreciated by anyone playing in china as well 

each faction has a host of characters and rulers that all have different goals and ambitions in unifying china from scholars and healers to veterans and warlords keeping all these archetypes happy within your kingdom is of grater importance in this title than many previous titles as well all your characters have likes and dislikes and personality traits that will effect their standing with your leader as well as the other characters of your court if relationships sour too faryou may be looking at a potential new enemy on the battlefield not only will the character leave your service he may take his armies with him 

additionally all your characters have a skill tree and inventory to invest in as well as you fight and administer your regions they will gain experience and items that further increase their strengths as well as their dedication to you and your cause the emphasis on characters relations and diplomacy actually feel like a fundamental part of the game now as opposed to it feeling optional or a nonimportant in previous titles

new features aside game has had one of the smoothest launches of any total war title and appears to be better optimized than the warhammer titles the campaign is sprawling but the game will keep doling out quests and missions for you to keep you focused on smaller goals while trying to paint the map with the colour of your faction out of all the total war games released over the years three kingdoms is a landmark title that will probably appease older fans and appeal to newer fans as well 

tldr

total war three kingdoms is a fantastic game that takes the best parts of total war games over the last decade and creates something truly entertaining

#####

despite my hours within the game being lower than some of the other total war titles this is my favorite tw game to date diplomacy being by far and away the best in the series makes this an easy recommend to any tw fans but it also has a fairly low barrier to entry so id recommend it to players new to the franchise as well 
cas terrible handling of this game in particular is a bummer but theyve announced a second game for this series so hopefully theyll catch lightning in a bottle with that one obviously not very consumer friendly doing that instead of just updating this one but it is what it is

#####

sells blood as dlc
sells chinese players out to  netease
sanitizing mods and banning mods that dont fit their family friendly vision

#####

game is very focused around diplomacy definetly more of a learning curve then any other total war you will have to watch closely how to build your towns its not the same copy and past building that were in other total wars

#####

maybe not the most innovative game in the history of total war but at least you will find rock solid mechanics and a content supply that keeps you playing the game for hundreds of hours oh btw  no racist shit but i had a hard time figuring out who actually declared war on me because they all basically look and sound the same and there is no bring me to that dude button showing me who wants to be impaled next that aside you may find your new game here for certain hours

 m

#####

there are many good features to tw3k the graphics are nice the concept is interesting though the three kingdoms period is overrepresented in western game media and i would have liked to see the warring states period of the east zhou dynasty represented instead the factions their techs and their units are meaningfully varied and present different strategies for different playthroughs  the general game play mechanics all work well

unfortunately i wouldnt recommend that anyone buy this game  the reason is that the developers have abandoned it and have announced that there will be no updates even though several annoying bugs still exist  im only on my second playthrough and already i have found two major bugs specifically yellow turban characters dont spawn in the late game and one of the nanman tech trees is impossible to research to completion the presence of these bugs makes the game unintentionally challenging in the sense that you must fight against the games mechanics in addition to the other factions that isnt fun  after searching online for solutions to these problems i found that these were bugs that were reported to the devs long ago acknowledged by the devs but never corrected so the game is functionally unfinished and never will be

selling and abandoning an unfinished game like this is irresponsible and shouldnt be rewarded by the general public throwing their money into this

#####

long story short i enjoy this game maybe not as much as other past total war games but i can not in good faith recommend this game the game does not feel complete and is basically only supported through the workshop by the community

#####

傻逼ca

#####

best total war ever

#####

love it i just bought total war warhammer 3 and i cant believe how cheap it feels compared to three kingdoms

#####

great game i dont know if any total war can ever compare to my love of shogun 2 but this comes close ive always been a fan of games portraying these powerful ancient cultures and this doesnt disappoint great campaign play good unit control on the battlefield very few bugs cant think of any at the moment

#####

being a long time total war fan and as chinese i was suspicious that this game would be a disaster at first but it turned out i was totally wrong i loved the aesthetics very very much the much more realistic graphics and cosmetics are definitely a hundred miles better than the koeis japanese cartoonish crap hope ca can make the second game of this series

#####

total war three kingdoms is one of my top 5 total war games of all time i love the period of ancient china and the three kingdoms

total war three kingdoms probably has the best diplomacy system of all total war games

its a shame creative assembly abandoned three kingdoms its such a great game

higly recommended

#####

this game is a ton of fun for anyone who has a little bit of megalomaniac inside himself or herself you can take control of one of the famous regions of the novel the romance of the three kingdoms every game is so different different objectives different game play lots of fun

#####

very disappointed with this game 

ive been buying and playing tw games since i was 11 and ordered shogun tw from the back of a magazine back in 2000 and i feel this game is nothing but slap in the face to us loyal customers the ridiculous amounts of expensive dlc missing features and changes in the gameplay were too much before even reaching the main menu you get several ads for dlc trying to choose a faction and leader becomes difficult with all 70 if the choices being dlc and sudden browser changes attempting to lure you to even more dlc you then start playing and its like a vanilla hero based 18 unit max with 3 generals required hero battles with issues reinforcing and no ambushes fourfive buildings per providence storylines and guided quests have become more a priority than the grand scale strategy and battles one purchases tw games for

i dont have the time or energy to list all the same cons you will see on the other reviews here but i cannot recommend anyone that enjoys classic tw to waste their time or money on this i hope enough people out there will take and stand and stop purchasing rushed halfbrained pretty little dlc farms from ca or sega or whoever makes the decisions now

maybe after they make tw warhammer 10 they will go back and give rome or empire another go so i can die a happy man

#####

immediately fell in love even though i have never played a single total war game before
clever ai loads of options and styles to choose from and i actually enjoyed the combat
i was just blown away by yellow turban dlc gong du campaign where the start is as bad as it gets because no one likes you or cares to do any business literally couldnt stop playing until i had the whole east 

liu shen offered me a treaty cao cao were mad it doesnt get more accurate then that and best of all it wasnt scripted to be like that

1110  would profit from yellow turban rebellion again

really really immersive

#####

first time playing a total war game this game is perfect for newcomers to this genre great mechanics you could spend endless hours building your empire and dealing with diplomacy hire nobles to work in the court all with their own benefits and when you die of old age or in a battle make sure you have a trustful heir that wont butcher your faction

then there are the battle simulators you could spend endless hours fighting one battle with numerous strategic view points outnumbered use the forests to conceal your archers use flanking elements spear head formations and several defensive tactics 

there isnt one way to do things in this game its quite incredible the relationship system is amazing to build strong bonds with another captain or general of a retinue of the same unit or become enemies all goes the same for all other factions to just love this game so far

edit

there currently is an annoying crash during late game in campaign to fix this i turned off ai turn movements and it seemed to have worked and the yellow turban rebellion is no longer crashing my game im sure there will be a fix but this worked for me

#####

和网易合作是这款优秀游戏的灾难也是我们中国玩家的灾难

cooperation with netease is a disaster for this excellent game and our chinese players

netease社との業務提携はこの素晴らしいゲームをゴミにする事と同然中国のプレーヤーにとっての大惨事である


#####

seems to be slightly enhanced version of britannia to me ive played through the whole series since day one and id still say medieval 2 is the pinnacle of the series the current game engine is stretched with its 32bit limitations and aged rather badly despite this there are cosmetic improvements but still feels a bit samey to the last few games the political side seems better and a i like enough to not feel angry as some of the lazyness by the devs reusing the same tired engine for a decade but feel moving to a new 64bit engine would unlock so much more potential to expand the gameplay i picked it up for 1699 261219 and seems about right for the game i got i think id feel a bit cheated had i paid 30

#####

i waited to write this review as i was a tad unimpressed with 3 kingdoms when it was released but they kept promising updates now that updates dlcs and other features are fleshed outthis is a fantastic total war game the options in this game shows how hilariously bad total war warhammer 12 are in their current forms 

 want to hire pirates to invade your neighbors go for it
 want to hire mercs or play as the mercs to fight for you i had someone pay me 10k to go fight someone then that someone offered me 15k not to fight them suddenly i am rich and laughing
 want to build buildings that will annoy your neighbors with negative perks i will steal all your people via migration 
 political intrigue ranges from telling the emperor to get stuffed target someone you dont like or make the world mad 
 you can have governors people on assignment and other things to buff your armies cities or factions or do negatives to enemies 
 can send spies to rival factions now this is a minigame in itself you can get your spy hired as a general a governor or even in the faction council then you can cause all sorts of havoc from within i opened the gates poisoned a well or leaked marching orders i also gave myself an entire city becausewelli was the governor but this can also happen to you think your general is loyal whoops

ai has improved and can challenge you in some fights dont have archers wellyou might want to charge immediately or they will sit at a safe distance till they run out of ammo think your archers are safe they will try to find a way to ride around your lines and slaughter them 

warhammer had 0 unit options other than heroes so you just have a scrum and wait to see who wins now you can spear wall shield wall advanced formations or do a mix just depending on the terrain and opponent  my archers can swap between regular arrows poison or firedepending on the army in warhammer you had to specifically make those units 

optionsoptions to play different with different factions is fantastic 

cons
oh it isnt perfect shogun 2 fall of the samurai is likely still the high watermark 
 keeping generals happy early on is a frustrating minigame 
 gatehouses or passes are generally pointless you cant close the door to deny access and the ai never attacks them i had one fully upgraded and an army inside as 3 enemies came at me i was prepared to lose that army in a tough siege battle defense to give me time nopethey just rode past 
 some factions are awesome and others are very mehcao cao is sometimes too op id like to see lu bu at least once be a major force 
 naval fights we havent had boats since shogun 2 can we have boats back please i miss ramming shooting or starting a boat on fire did sega fire all their naval people i also miss naval invasionslanding with boats inside the walls was great 
 some of the buttons arent well advertised assignments or titles are buried somewhereand real small this could be explained or shown better 

but if you want a true total war experience get a friend and play as the yellow turbans buckle upas that is a brutal one to survive as everyone hates you and doesnt stop coming 

cheers

#####

the game itself is pretty decent though it has several major flaws

 when reinforcing my armies are directly next to each other and yet on the battle map my reinforcements will often come from behind the enemies back line

 the battle map often does not reflect where i am positioned my army is on an open field or bridge and yet i will get forest maps in fact it seems nearly every other map is a light forest so forget bringing any anti infantry artillery

 skirmish mode is broken if you dont pay attention for a brief moment your skirmishers will occasionally run into or not run away from combat even with skirmish enabled

archers will occasionally run straight into the enemy and ignore commands to run the other direction 


though there are other bugs those are major ones making it feel like any tactical movement on the world map is essentially pointless
the game is fun sometimes but not worth the cost buy it on sale if you really want it

very good i have played all total war games and this one is done right

i had stopped playing video games often for a while before this game came out but that all changed once it did it has probably the best diplomacy in total war history as well as fantastic rpglike elements where you level up your characters and grow attached to them

that being said since ca pulled support from this game i cannot with a clear conscience recommend anyone buy this game if they dont already have it pulling the plug on a relatively new game for no reason is an extremely shitty thing to do especially with the amount of hype this game had

#####

i wouldnt have purchased this game if i wasnt going to play it with friends
here are my issues with the game

1 bday 1 dlcb
the act of implementing day 1 dlcs have already been heavily criticized making it available for free during the first week doesnt make it any less slimy as a business practice theyre taking content that has already been made and separating it to sell for more cash they can also take their blood dlc and shove it up where the sun dont shine this should already be a feature in the friggin buwar gameub next thing you know theyll be selling you a window with no pane and telling you that the pane is dlc

2 bthe ai is brokenb
i mean this as in sometimes it wipes the floor with you and sometimes it simply rolls over and dies
this is okay if youre looking for something to laugh at but then again its only funny for the first 5 hours tops
take that how you may

3 bthe ai cheats and it showsb
ai cheating is acceptable up to a point when youre looking for a challenge that said the way it is done in 3k can really limit your options on harder difficulties as the ai can simply cheat in resources during prolonged military campaigns designed to target those exact resources making certain maneuvers and strategies impossible at harder difficulties

4 bthe generals look mostly the sameb
would it kill them to commission more portraits for different generals the only unique portraits are for famous generals and thats only a handful of generals the rest of the game is basically face swaps and bad face swaps at that
i understand using those in the event that you run out of characters and have to procedurally generate fake ones but even gold name generals have standard face swap portraits knowing the devs they were most likely going to sell us portraits as dlc

bthe greatest sinb
i cannot believe that they managed to make the romance of the three kingdoms boring
there is so little story going on behind this you cant even run it according to events in the real story so many good characters good storylines rivalries all flushed down the toilet

#####

lets see whats wrong here

mod censorship
toxic community managers
no agents
dumbed down simplified ai
lack of faction diversity
thrones army recruiting nonsense
you will only ever need to invest in commerce peasantry never works
can only choose buildings in commanderies not smaller provinces
commanders are mostly copypaste of each other in abilities with a few exceptions
wahmen strange obsession with making virtually all the female leaders look butch
needs more flag bois

#####

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2022 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

great ideas but not expanded upon them and very unpolished
worst offenders being the vassalizing system yuan shao very little unit diversity for all han faction the bandits and yellow turbans feel like they were implemented without testing theyre fun but very limiting and very bad enemy ai for all the factions queue the benny hill music compensated by some ridiculous ai cheats so it feels like a challenge
also every faction has the same victory condition which after playing 45 campaigns it gets really annoying
better with mods but the same ai problems plague the mods also
other than that its a beautiful game which feels fresh for 45 campaigns then youre just going through the same motion with different faction
some faction mechanics are not in line with the victory conditions of the factions making it a chore to get there
nanman as ai and looters are just there for the sake of being annoying and bring nothing new to the campaign same for yellow turbans and bandits as ai they will not influence in any way what is happening on the map either dead first 10 turns or down the vassal line so that yuan shao can get his quota going
mandate of heaven feels really rushed and not tested i would stood clear of it after the first playthrough
eight princes dlc bought it but didnt even bother
overall for around 100 hours its ok after the cracks start showing and they become more and more obvious
in the end i would recommend only on sale you get some hours for the money spent full price i wouldnt touch it for the state it was left in after it was abandoned
ps blood dlc for any game is very scummy surprised they didnt make the game black and white and charge for the colours

#####

literally the game ive been wanting since i was 11 i played dynasty warriors 2 demo at a game store way back in 2000 then when i got home i played total war shogun and the thought was instant total war dynasty warriors would be awesome 20 yrs later they actually make the game then abandon it before its completed still fun highly moddedthis is still top 3 total war game and its actually my #1 pic but its not finished

#####

okay lets relax for 30 mins 5 hours later 

#####

i am really really bad at this game

and im still having a ton of fun

#####

this game stole my sleeping times

#####

absolutely solid and great game all of the campaign mechanics are truly inspired and smooth an excellent game for both beginners and veterans to the total war franchise

#####

ugh i really want to like this game but after six attempts at the campaign i have to say that i dont recommend it  im a long time tw veteran going back to the original shogun  ive long since resigned myself to the usual ai cheating shennanigans  the ai makes tons more money than you can field far more armies than you can and every enemy general can move just slightly farther than you  all of these issues seem to be amplified in 3 kingdoms as it becomes painfully obvious that the computer is playing against you and only you  every campaign seems to end with an avalanche of ai war declarations  even previously friendly factions with nonagression pacts will randomly declare war on you if the computer thinks youre getting too far ahead

somehow the major enemy factions can easily vassalize multiple smaller kingdoms while even friendly factions refuse offers  even when you do get vassals they prove to be a gigantic pain the a  someone at ca needs to look up the term vassal because clearly they dont know what it means  vassals constantly drag you into unwanted wars or randomly renege on their obligation and declare war on you  usually after having moved multiple armies into your territoryconvenient

on the upside the map is beautiful but confusing the game runs flawlessly and the battles are predictably gorgeous and exciting  just be prepared to deal with a ton of frustration as the computer is clearly playing by a completely different set of rules

#####

its my favourite game of all time ive done it to death but there is just nothing else like it
use the quick deals in diplomacy and just check what is available each turn and china will be yours

#####

this is a good game but could be better if the dev didnt abandon the game

#####

it is a beautiful game and i cannot stress that enough but it is also severely lacking the ai is absolutely braindead and is only a challenge because it cheats a lot and has an incredible player bias the game is primarily character driven but apart from the main characters the average player will not care about them at all which is to the severe detriment of the game they are not generated and therefore every playthrough is with the same characters sadly to end it all the campaign plays like realtime while it is turnbased and the battle play like an mmorpg with a lot of button smashing instead of an rtt because battlefield tactics hardly amount to anything

#####

it took me 102 hours to complete the first campaigngranted i think i left the game open while afk a few times so the number might be skewed sadly i just cant be arsed to play another campaign because it feels like such a chore

bprosb
 the diplomacy is really good you can trade territories you can trade items you can arrange marriages  really for me the trade territory feature is something i wish was in previous tw titles
 you can also click on quick deals and get a list of nations that will accept diplomatic options  so rather than going to talk to one at a time to see if they are interested in trade or peace or vassalization or confederation etc you can just get a list this is an amazing feature that i hope continues in the tw series
 the graphics and sound are very good  the level of graphical and sound polish is extremely high
 early game first 50 turns is by far the most interesting part of the game

bconsb
 mid to late game is where things become boring  having to take at least 95 commanderies and the three seats is just not much fun  the ai starts sending really weak armies all over to try to slow down the progression so whackamole starts to become a thing  

 the generals upgrades and items are just not that interesting  after mid game i just didnt want to bother with having tons of characters that have leveled up and now i need to add a skill that wont really matter  im more or less just dominating the enemy turn by turn having to manage the generals and court each turn is fun when you have a handful and you are in early game but midlate game its just boring 

 the buildings also really dont matter just get enough food so you can afford to upgrade the city maybe add garrison or something  public order really isnt an issue at all unless you have food or money shortages  i really didnt even bother carefully picking buildings or anything just spammed upgrades when needed  

 early game units are just as powerful as late game units  making late game unit costs just not even worth it

 i cant sit down and play another campaign because i know that it will be the same me having fun early game and then the midlate game turning into a complete boring chore  i dont want to sit here clicking upgrade buttons every fucking turn and playing whackamole  the ai was not threatening at all midgame either

#####

abandoned too soon great game

#####

my oh my that diplomacy system is epic ca really listened to the fans this is one of the best total war games to date

cant wait for warhammer 3 and to see what theyd do with it

#####

the only total war where the story goes like a movie

#####

we three though of separate ancestry join in brotherhood here combining strength and purpose to relieve the present crisis we will perform our duty to the emperor and protect the common folk of the land we dare not hope to be together always but hereby vow to die the selfsame day let shining heaven above and the fruitful land below bear witness to our resolve may heaven and man scourge whosoever fails this vow

#####

i sure hope this wont be the last good total war game

#####

well its basically two thirds of a total war game without the community love to fix it with mod support like with what happened with rome 2 or warhammer 2 also ca hates its customer base  calls them dick heads

#####

bought it for the dynasty warriors nostalgia stayed cause its actually fly as all hell

#####

id say this is the best total war game to date yet for a more historical title im not into the fantasy option they give you but records mode handles that

important positive changes
diplomacy system is amazing ca outdid themselves this time for once the ai diplomacy algorithm is fined tuned instead of just rejecting my trade agreement just cause

 battle ai is semicompetent knows to hold a battle line and flank properly understands how to use unit abilities properly 

choice between romance version and records with romance being a more warhammer experience but records being a tradition tw experience

reform tech tree system a refreshing change you get a new tech reform every 5 turns  

general units have 5 different types meant for different roles commander vanguard strategist champion and sentinel each role is specific some more combat oriented than others each role has a main stat the five stats are expertise resolve cunning instinct and authority every general has all 5 stats but usually specializing in two stats each stat gives bonuses to your generals combat abilities as well as army buffs

every unit has a role some units are anti armor some cavalry are specifically anti cav units thus dont place a importance on unit tier so much as utility

important negative changes

battle ais siege attacking is horrible besides rudimentary flanking maneuvers ai throws its units into the meat grinder other than loose formation and wedge formation the ai doesnt use infantry formations

army formations and flaming arrows shouldve been a techreform not something based off a generals cunning stat 

playing romance version slightly more difficult and confusing as i cannot judge how handily i will beat someone in a duel even though it says their strength compared to mine is negligible seriously how did they beat me if their strength is negligible to mine

score 810
great game my favorite so far  beside some weird design decisions and slight ai incompentencies this is must have in the tw series



#####

this is peak historical total war even better with mods and here are some reasons why

politics
expanded relationship system between individual generals across all factions
your treatment towards them determines whether himhertheir friendsrivalsfamilies join your faction
unique character portraits and models even more with mods instead of generic names and faces
undeployed generals can be sent on various assignments to different regions which buff your economy
complex loyalty system for generals with personalities and ambitions
diplomacy is no longer guess work like prior titles everything is displayed with numbers

espionage
a spy is shogun 2s metsuke ninja and geisha combined
included all familiar abilities like sabotage assassinate divert improve relations etc
can infiltrate rival factions and work their way up to be an administrator general and even leader
turn a disgruntled rival faction general or family member into spying for you

gameplay
alot of factions to choose from each with different starting area and time periods
multiple notable historical characters to role play as such as lu bu dong zhuo and cao cao
bandits xiongnu southern jungle tribes units add alot more replayability to monotonous han period units
1v1 duels between generals in the midst of battle is epic
the ability to gear and prep generals towards fightingduels or civic duties
ability to win the campaign mostly just by hard focusing on economy and buying lands
unique troop types for each of generals strategist champion sentinel classes 
bigger vanilla unit size than other total war games 240 men per cohort

graphics and performance 
7800x3d7900xt system
actually uses more than 2 cores and threads
rarely dips to sub 60fps when zoomed in large campaign battles 
runs very well on even with 125x unit size mod 300 men per cohort
fast end turn time
colorful vibrant painting aesthetics art direction
game runs stable but pay attention to mod load orders if youre modding

#####

fuck you mean we left the percs at changsha

#####

ive played hundreds of hours of all total war games and i can honestly say this is the best of them all

#####

the recent updates havent been all that great theyve completely missed over the important parts people were complaining about ie overpowered cavalry brokenbugged alliances and the stupid loading screen voice that you cant turn off to name a few which is such a waste for a beautiful game with massive potential to be the best total war title 

pros
 huge map
 lots of three kingdoms lore unique playstyles some and lots of new additions
 heroes like cmon
 fresh beautiful graphics 

cons
 annoying loading screen voice that gets incredibly old after the first 2 playthroughs that you dont have any option to mute
 lots of units are sharedmonotonous as well as nonhistoric generals
 recent updates have made battles in legendary difficulty too easy i was defending a siege in which i was outnumbered 1500 to 300 and yet all the enemy ai did was dick around until time ran out
 some other concepts in the game such as spies family naval combat just dont seem fleshed out whatsoever and dont actually live up to their useful potential as the game would suggest

i would easily switch this from a negative to a positive review if they just fixed the very core aspects of the game and added an option to disable the loading screen voice please

#####

my first total war game and i really enjoy it the system is complex but reasonable making it fun to play looking forward to more dlcs more historical unique characters and more campaign scenarios

#####

nice game for ones who love three kingdom history but the city name especially those spots around each city with varied features lack a specific history background causing a loss of immersive gaming experiences for me and other history lovers which is a shame

other than that the heir system is even a greater manifestation of the messed up understanding of chinese ancient history of the developers for example it is extremely significant for a ruler to make sure his sons are going to safely take over the power after his death which is why there had been so many domestic infighting throughout lots of regimes

overall i love this game and i enjoyed it more than civilization because of the three kingdom background all i have stated above just means that i strongly believe this could have been a much more exquisite piece of work with a bit more attention to the chinese history timeline

also im looking forward to seeing the new update coming in a few days

it is worth a fullprice purchase

after the recent free patch update the game gets better with much more details to be discovered and more strategies to be deployed this patch has made the lategame much more fun to play with comparing to the earlier version

#####

this is probably the best tw game ive played since medieval 2
for a single reason optimization

this runs so unbelievably good that it is an absolute pain to go back to rome 2 or warhammer 2 with its 20fps midcombat and this has actual proper antialiasing taa that solves the horrid pixely foliage and sprites of the past games
the grass in this game looks on par with bannerlord or witcher 3

im running this on an intel i7 6600 yes that awful one 32gb ram and an outdated 1070
im getting 40ish frames maxed out shadows on ultra not extreme
this includes ss reflections ssao and ss shadows
unit size on ultra i can go extreme without any framerate impact but the animations and simulation starts to stutter due to my slow cpu

this was always the problem with the tw games in the past
on paper they were amazing games and yes you could have hundreds of hours of fun i did with rome 2 warhammer even empire medieval 2 rome 1 etc
but they were always hindered by their awful preformance and jaggy messy lack of antialiasing even msaa 4x looked jaggy in tw games and sucked half your framerate

but this game somehow managed to completely and i mean utterly resolve the preformance issues and improve the graphics at the same time i frankly have no clue how they did it

ill tell you this if warhammer 3 uses this engine and runs this good
then ill be a sucker and buy all the future dlc for it because they deserve it at that point
didnt buy much dlc for the previous 3824 games because they didnt deserve it why buy dlc for a game that runs at 15fps in large battles

protip though
use reshade with some lumasharpen to resolve taa blurriness still nowhere near as bad as fxaa and you get flawless aa as a bonus

anyway if youre on the fence because you had preformance issues in previous games get this
who knew being able to actually play a total war game in playable framerates would improve the game who knew

#####

the enemy run craven

#####

total war for ever

#####

i have tried to like this game but modern day total war games are complete feces compared to the old ones 

i have never once felt like ive ever been outsmarted or outmaneuvered by the cpu they are just allowed to do things you arent 

my army will move 1 inch across the map per turn but the enemy army can move an entire commandery worth of distance and block any move im trying to make they will always win if you delegate the battle even if you have superior forces you will just play musical chairs with unguarded cities 

you are limited by how many armies you can have doesnt matter if you can afford them or not you have to be a certain rank to be able to field more 

lazy programming again the computers soldiers have more hit points and armor than yours to simulate increased difficulty my troops will break and run if their shoes become untied but the enemy unit will have 6 guys left and still fighting dont buy games from this company they are the same ca from 20 years ago graphics are the only effort put into modern games


#####

so i am part of the  i am not buying this side of the community

im very glad i did first things first day one dlc  not cool ca please stop

now thats out of the way this is a great game that feels one of the strongest on launch i have seen i love the leaders system i wish marriage was a bigger deal and more fleshed out but overall an amazing step  rome 3 cough

the combat to me feels great i feel the leader to troop ratio of kills is good and being able to equip them with weapons is mint i adore the rpg additions with this title the leaders are unique and have hard starts i start on vh h most total was not today jimmy 

not today 

the yellow turban are fun i like the oldstyle tec map but i do find with have 6 unique lords of the top of my head they do start to feel a little limited towards owning half the map on the other hand they offer something of a this is total war legend style campaign from my understanding though ca said they would leader packs in earlier or later time frames didnt 6 years before a cloaked badass mf with his brothers walk around

as an englishman i hope we can find understanding that i like islands i cant build an empire with those three tiny little islands ca i would love to see future korea dlcs im not 100 sure of their history at this time but map wise it would be a game changer 

i think the banners in particular make the game look so much better than other titles in fairness the game looks great i find it hard to escape the dynasty warriors look but ca did a amazing job i think the artwork deserves a round of applause

however if you have not taken a word in please read this bit twice we need avatar mode 

and custom generals

          and no more day one dlc 

im a guy thats been playing this series most of my life so a lot of my points will not affect new players and im sure older ones will have more than likely have heard them mentioned before i think this title has the potential to be one of the best we have seen in a long time i hope ca may bring things like avatar mode and naval battles and id be more than ready to pay for them but if you are sitting on the edge id give it a chance

#####

i mostly want to compare this to other total war games

i was worried this would be the same kind of crap as rome 2 or something uninteresting like warhammer im not a fan of table tops so it makes sense i wouldnt like the warhammer games as much as the historical games still recommended 

in short the first impression i was able to get out of this game so far are this

1 it runs well

2 it feels like a new experience

3 it doesnt feel out of place like warhammer did

so i have a pc that was built in 2015 sort of on the cheaper end of the spectrum it was able to run witcher rome 2 and skyrim all on high at least with some bumps this is still the same experience the good news is it is that way at launch rome 2 was not which honestly was my greatest fear for this game i can play it

the general feeling i have for series like total war is if they can keep the same basic elements but add something new i started to fall out of love with the genre as it did start to feel stale  i can only look at a map of europe for so long  this game fixed that i can now play a total war game and not feel like ive played it a thousand different times before its great total war for me has been a history of europe kind of series i start playing rome 2 go to atilla medival 2 then empire and finally napeolon this is fine for the most part but after 1000 hours of looking at italy i sort of want to stab my eyes out 

warhammer was a good mix up in this area the issue is that it felt like another series in the genre and not something created under a total war title i would compare it to the difference between assassins creed and the arkham series  two very similar games but they feel totally different three kingdoms feels like an actual total war game to me not some fantasy table top game 

those are my thoughts as objectively as i can put them i should note that i do love chinese history and i am not a big fan of table top games so this has influenced my review  i am much more likely to want to like a game based on chinese history than a game based on warhammer or fantasy if that sounds like you i think youll love this game

#####

better than living your real life

#####

friend of mine gifted me this game and i am very glad he did so had tons of fun and more will come despite three kingdoms in the title campaign is still only for 2 players 

pros
 audio
 graphics
 three kingdoms era
 in multiplayer second player can lead enemy forces each time when theres a battle making it even more fun
 skirmish can have more than 2 players
 musou mode next to normal mode generals are powerful or not
 events not always play the same way and player actions can impact those as well
 seems balanced better than previous total wars
 lu bu even at age 70 still can take on hundreds of enemies himself i mean run run
 dlcs with scenarios and warlords are coming out giving more content  settings to start with
 workshop community

cons
 during 30 hours campaign there were 2 battles that i had to delegate because the game was crashing
 small font atleast for me
 no wu vs wei vs shu map despite three kingdoms in name albeit you can easly lead to that
 it begs for 3 players multiplayer and maybe tutorial on how to effectively make your turns as provided guide is inefficient imho
 as with every total war multiplayer campaign  can be painfully slow 
 might be hard to find a good partner to play without friends
 few minor things that might or might not impact your experience the wrong way
 not so cheap


all for all i think the game is worth its price but waiting for a deal to buy with dlc might be a good idea however the base  is all you need to experience it as a whole you need to try it

#####

even the international version contains censorship meant to appease the chinese government xi hong kong tibet and taiwan at least are not allowed to be used when renaming things even in singleplayer xi is the most egregious of these as any words containing the letters are also outlawed when several regions and characters bear those names by default xiliang cavlary for instance can not have their name changed back if you set it to something else

gameplaywise diplomacy is a major step forward while battle ai seems to be the worst yet frequently attacked by ai only to have it run down the timer without doing anything ai generals commiting suicide one after another against my much more powerful duelists ai holding nothing in reserve to defend archersartillery from player cavalry

if you have an interest in the time period and like fantastical battles more than historical ones consider it on sale


#####

three kingdoms could be one of the best total war games yet except for its bugs

ca has left three kingdoms in a horrible state where core mechanics of the game  like alliances and empire  are utterly broken years after release

the issues are widely known and reported everywhere including on the official forums but ca has just chosen to ignore them and end support to the game no further bug fixes are coming

as such it would be criminal to recommend giving any money to ca for this game or any other

#####

although warhammer ii total war has held my interest like no other title since medieval ii and i have neglected this title a little since it came out i do think its one of the better titles in a strong series

#####

dynasty warriors 9 total definitive edition

#####

so first the good 

i really enjoyed playing the game ive played lots of other total war games and this one brings some really interesting things to the table namely more indepth character interaction more complicated region management a really cool tech tree and more that got me more invested with my play through 

now the bad in short  bugs

i first installed on linux i prefer setting games up on there if i can its my main os and im keen to show theres a market for linux games

problem is that i get about 1020 hours into a campaign on ubuntu and the game just crashes admittedly i only tried it once because id rather not get burned investing another 2030 hours in a campaign i can never finish but as far as i can tell this is a common problem 

so i setup a new ssd with windows 10 especially so i can play this game

about 2030 hours into that campaign the same thing happens  when i end my turn the games crashes

i can excuse a few bugs shortly after release but were more than a year out from release stuff like this shouldnt happen

i paid full price for the game around 4050 knowing that ive enjoyed other total war games in the past and the reviews sounded great but theres really no point in me investing in this game if the campaign is unplayable

its so so frustrating to get really invested in a campaign twice only for it to bug out on me and become unplayable

i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone especially on linux for the above reasons which is really sad and unfortunate because the gameplay in itself is really topnotch

ca  please dont market a game on linux if youve only bothered implementing a halfarsed port and please dont charge 40 for a game if long standing bugs make the campaign unplayable

dont think ill ever pay full price for a ca game again seems obvious to me that they have some serious quality control issues

#####

i wish there was a meh option rather than thumbs updown

i think three kingdoms is way overrated

there are serious improvements to the campaign map and ai over previous games however the tactical combat is just plain boring  there is simply too little variation between different units a spearmen is a spearmen and an archer is an archer and they are pretty much uniform across all factions to make matters worse there is little variation between factions even at the strategic level

to me the unique races and mechanics of the total war warhammer series make it far superior with far more replay value

#####

this is without a doubt the best total war system since shogun 2 sadly ca has stopped supporting it

#####

going on 4 years out and so many updates and whatnot but still getting bugs i like the game but s like the faction council ancillary option taking my money and not working is the reason i dont have more game time on this and why i cant recommend it

#####

ive wanted this game since the first rome from bouncing between extreme legends 3 i was 10 years  old i am 29 now enough said

im learning a lot about chinese culture and history through this game i started watching the 1994 made 3k series too

i dont notice how time flies while i play this masterpiece

we find ourselves in china during the three empires and whoever thinks it was a time of peace happiness and prosperity should recall the name of this series the han dynasty collapses and armed feudal vultures  generals governors rogue bandits  fly over its carcass and each of them wants to be the next emperor
the three kingdoms however is largely not based on real history but on the novel  that is the cultural impact of such a chinese lord of the rings where powerful heroes each stronger than a hundred ordinary men fight against each other you can also turn on historical mode where ordinary generals and their armored escorts run around the battlefield instead of bloated chinese but you would be deprived of a large part of the local magic this total war is based on strong personalities

although for asian pop culture these bloodsoaked hundreds of years is a gold mine from which it has mined countless books movies and games we westerners may be groping a bit at first when my neighbor yuan shu suddenly declared war on me i was very confused because i thought yuan shu was my most loyal ally i mumbled for the vile betrayal for a moment before realizing that my ally was actually named yuan shao

year after year the developers of creative assembly prepared the ground for real change game by game they tested new mechanics tested whether their strategictactical turnrealtime structure would work in a fantastic environment as well as in a historic one and the culmination of their work is total war three kingdoms a confident game full of great ideas that work most of the time and never fall apart completely this is total war 20
the creators did not lie when they promised an emphasis on individuality the three kingdoms are surprisingly good at building a sense of personal drama as well as a great war flooding chinese fields with blood b 60 b

if you are a fan of total war or a fan of the three kingdoms era than this is a must buy 

however if you are new to the series then i still recommend this game as a great place to jump into the series 

the only issue with starting the series with this game is how difficult it will be to go back and enjoy previous games in the series because of all the updates and change 

this game easily has the best diplomacy system we have ever seen in a total war game complete with the ai constantly and consistently seeking different diplomatic options and allowing the player to approach the ai with many different options to bolster their income gain trade agreements gain territory and supporting vassals to overthrow their masters 

the 1v1 duels that you can chose to have with your generals are outstanding and have some amazing animations now obviously there is not fully matched combat which does make some animations looks worse however i will happily take this over units trying to find opponents and the strange unit formation issues that are caused by this 

each faction feels unique and has its strong points and weak points which does make each campaign feel very different and unique faction specific units add another layer to this that adds more decision making for army and general composition i was very worried coming into this game that i would be using the same 23 general combos in all of my armies however i am very happy to say that is not the case each general type has their own benefits and draw backs and depending on your tech tree focus you may unlock units that make you want to recruit certain generals less or more often and add these higher tier units into different general retinues 

the retinues and the different skills your generals take will greatly influence what kind of units you will want to recruit or maintain inside of different armies and even though all of the generic generals have the same skillbuff trees their is frequently reasons to go down different paths in different orders depending on what you need from a general at any given time 

there are a few bugs present currently such as city towers doing much more damage than intended as well as there being a certain faction who seems to collect vassals like pokemon but these will most likely be fixed shortly as ca as acknowledged that these issues exist and will be rolling out patches soon 

this game has everything that makes me love the total war series and adds enough new dimensions and options that i know i will be playing this game for years to come much like shogun 2

#####

as a total war game  the title is more akin to warhammer in terms of combat as its more gamey and the generals play an extreme role here having a commander or strategist basically allow you to use formations once they level up enough
as a 3 kingdoms title  itssomewhat lacking i guess some events wont proc at times and you can only go so far with story instances but the generals as mentioned take a center role some can really make or break a battle  zhang fei in vanilla is beyond nasty

campaigns available as of right now are
1 aftermath of the coalition against dong zhuo the default campaign
2 mandate of heaven  basically the prologue  leading up to the yellow turban rebellion
3 a world betrayed  where the big dong and sun jian is dead
4 eight princes  another civil war  but with less characters overall  post three kingdoms

major dlcs to note are  the yellow turban rebellion and the furious wild adding nanman tribes  meng huos people as playable

congripes  theres not much mentions of updates and theres still some major story campaigns lacking like the battle of chibi liu be getting shu han  or even a three kingdoms campaign yet 

 a custom campaign mode would be nice  like dynasty warriors i guess  that can enhance the longevity maybe


#####

ive been recently immersing myself on the three kingdoms chinese history wow i am immersed and this game only makes me more invested on old chinese history

#####

despite all its flaws its the best total war game so far

#####

as a chinese person myself i love the accuracy of how they portray the scenarios especially in the campaign this is honestly one of my favorite games and everyone should try it it gives accurate portraits of what chinese culture and ancient chinese warfare was like this is such a great game that i just cant stop playing for anyone new to the game try starting as cao caolui bei or sun jian  they are great starting characters so you can get used to the campaign or if you want to just make custom battles let your imagination take over this is one of the best games that you could play for fun relaxing or if you feel like making strategy and conquering your enemies

#####

 romantic historical drama  strategy done right

three kingdoms along with shogun 2 are the best games  from the total war series in my book 
the music the artwork and how the games indirectly teaches you geographic and culture knowledge but at its core is  that they are so full of atmosphere

when a game is this great that it made me pick up  and read the actual romance of the three kingdoms the least i can do is give credit to the game that introduced to me to genera


#####

recently the game keeps crashing thanks to denuvo for make it more laggy

#####

any tomato sauce else 

#####

the diplomacy is epic in this aspect this game is basically crusader kings lite the charactercentric system is a breath of fresh air in the tw series and in hindsight an excellent design decision its hilarious to recruit former enemies and force them to fight side by side with people who killed their friends

this scale of three kingdoms is absolutely intimidating in land area and gameplay mechanics i was not expecting this learning curve from a aaa title since the trend these days is for video games to hold my hands and avoid hurting my feelings if you want to figure out how a mechanic works exactly be prepared to search online as for map size i thought five provinces ten hours in was decent progress until i zoomed out no sht chinas huge its awesome

if youre into tw games must buy at any price

if youre on the fence must try because the game is worth your money maybe wait a while for a discount if you feel 70 bucks is too steep 

great job creative assembly

#####

keep in mind im mainly a paradox playerhoi4 eu4 ck23 vic 2 and got introduced to total war via warhammer 2 essentially i know long time fans love medieval 2 rome and napoleon and i havent spend much time in those titles at all so this is coming from a newer player of the series if you will in short my enjoyment from this game is only compared to warhammer 2 since its the one ive played the most and three kingdoms in my humble opinion is a way better game and a great entry title for anyone looking to play total war


i got this around two weeks ago for around 40ish in a sale and it has become my favorite total war the battles are great with soldiers carrying bannerswhich adds to the immersion and the engagement itself being extremely cinematic whether you have a volley of arrows taking down charging infantry cavalry clashing against enemy lines and the map itself is just gorgeous to look at it also gets rid of the annoying agents and replaces them with spies which are characters from your court that can essential sabotage another warlords effort but the mechanic and court itself does leave something to be desired but ill take this any day over having to control a swarm of agents around the map overall this entry is enjoyable with the different playable factions having just enough flair and gameplay mechanics that makes the game feel fresh after hours of playing a specific faction if like many people online say you didnt give this game a chance for a lack of knowledgeinterest in chinese history do yourself a favor and give three kingdoms a chance show ca how wrong they were in cutting support for this game


additional comments

i played a campaign in vanilla another with radious mod and a third with trom out of the three i would highly suggest using radious with 80 more upkeep to have a more polish experience that is basically bug free adds new units to the roster and with the latter prevents the ai and player from spamming massive doom stacks

to avoid having a ten page essay here i would like to quickly add that the unit management here is done masterfully instead of having a generalhero and 19 units spread out in a tab that makes everything look meh imo having different general classesvanguard for shock cavalry champion for spear infantry and strategist for projectiles and artillery manage six units each is a much better way of handling army composition as each class shares and has unique units to recruit

the soundtrack ambient and presentation are a 1010

got me thru 2020

#####

a surprisingly good update to the triedandtrue total war formula that makes it feel fresh adding an emphasis on characters and relationships adds on a nice metalayer on top of the usual strategy of a total war campaign

#####

i literally have dreams with this game amazing

#####

easily the most enjoyable rewarding and if you set your difficulty settings a bit higher than standard challenging games in the total war saga

its been years since a total war game had me this engrossed the romance of the three kingdoms time period is one ive always been interested in and between its gorgeous art direction engaging and interesting character in depth diplomacy options the best in the series by far this game has me completely obsessed

#####

i love taxing people till they break and make a rebellion only for me to anticipate it and put it down immediately then begin the cycle again

#####

i didnt consider myself that interested in the setting however the strong diplomacy and relationship system between factions has me hooked

#####

after

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game
creative assembly

i cannot in good conscience keep my reviews for this company positive with the way theyve been treating me as a customer
dont give them your money its the only language they speak now

#####

creative assembly the absolute geniuses behind this game love to update the game and absolute break your saves both mutliplayer and singleplayer so dont get invested in any longrunning campaigns because they might just roll out an update on a supposedly unsupported game unannounced this definitely didnt right before i wrote this review

#####

keeps crashing at unpredictable timings during map phase in battle or transiting to a battle with no clear fix which makes me frustrated and try to quick save at every occasion

#####


i was hoping for another shogun 2 and fall of the samurai sadly this isnt it it seems like ca can only do warhammer stuff these days the old devs that made the historical series so great probably left the company

despite basing it off the highly exaggerated records of the three kingdoms book the warhammer type of super human still feels out of place in a historical total war series it is somewhat fun but feels gimmicky and why even bother building your army based on strategy when lu bu can single handedly destroy all of course you can always choose historical mode but then that one has problems too

the good thing about shoguns rockpaperscissor units was that elite units had an actual impact and visually you could tell them apart everything in this game feels so bland and an army of crossbows will pretty much shred anything the ai can ever offer even with elite units units rout too easily elite units are made of paper battles turn into blobs and nothing is ever cohesive enough for a welltimed or maneuvered flank or rear attack 

the game at least has one good option and thats the espionage or intrigue system you can send spies to rival courts and eventually get them to a position of power this even allows for the taking of enemy territory without the need to declare war or just plain scoutingsabotaging the enemy positions

i love the character the setting but the gameplay is just so boring and typical since rome 2 everything looks the same and most units play the same even the soundtrack sounds the same aside from the trailer theme geez ca at least pony up the cash and let jeff van dyck compose the soundtrack that man made all the total war games sound and feel memorable 

stop focusing so much on censoring community crap when all you produce are bland games


#####

ah three kingdoms i figured nearly 300 hours in was a good time to write a review well the tw fanbase has been a bit split in recent years over the warhammer games some older fans have enjoyed them as much as historical titles while others have been waiting for a return to the true historical games personally i think three kingdoms does a fantastic job of bridging that gap with the romance and records modes one of which has much more powerful individuals a la warhammer the other being much more akin to the older historical tws
so should you buy this game probably in my opinion if youre devoted to a single past tw title or disliked the warhammer games for their new mechanics not setting it may disappoint you because the franchise has continued to evolve but if youre just a fan of the formula creative assembly have been using for a while or got into tw through the warhammer games just get it

skip the eight princes dlc though mandate of heaven and world betrayed bracket the base experience really nicely princes is set two generations later and just feels disjointed and weird

#####

just finished my first playthrough using huang shao with legendary difficulty and i just want to say that the game runs smooth  and the rework of diplomacy system runs very great game is very enjoyable and is one of the best total war campaign that i played 


#####

ive played this franchise all the way back to the original shogun and i have to say im very pleased with this particular game its so well balanced good battles good diplomacy good economics and a great deal of role playing with leaders make this a very enjoyable experience it took me many hours to grasp the fundamentals and learn to use the 3 leader army model but once i got it everything else sort of fell into place my new favorite and definitely recommended fantastic game

#####

got tired of warhammer two decided to give this game a shot

absolutely loved it and its so nice to actually worry about diplomacy

#####

ca didnt listened community and when dissatisfied players stopped to buy undesirable dlc which werent even close to what peoples wanted ca decided to pull the plug

i cant recommand this game but in few years some modders will likely remove most of important bugs and game will be playable untill then dont buy it unless its on some sort of sale for 1015

#####

best tw release since shogun 2 imo overall this is a great addition into the total war series i enjoy the historical games a little more so this was a welcome change of pace for me the additions to the campaign map such as better politics and scheming finally has happened ive been hoping for something like this since playing mods for original rome tw still i think they can even go more crazy on familiespoliticsdiplomacy as a whole but all in all very very well done whenever the workshop opens i cant wait to see what kind of mods people can create with the base that creative assembly has given us  the battles are basically more of the same some things seemed to be polished out well battles last a good amount of time once your units are higher tier which is great even though this is a historical tw i still prefer to play the romance mode which at first i thought id hate it but its the only mode i will play now im playing as cao cao and my advisers in the game keep telling me to reduce campaign difficulty from hard to normal but i havent got steamrolled yet so i dont know why they are suggesting thatmaybe in 20 turns i get wiped off the face of the map who knows lol anyway if your into strategy games or you just like the tw series you cant go wrong and possibly like me u might think this is the best release since shogun 2 i actually prefer three kingdoms over shogun 2 by a country mile

#####

bought it was looking forward for updates and improvements ca dropped the ball and abandoned it

the game is far from complete it is unique compared to other total war games but the way ca handled the development and expansions is laughable 

tldr buy it if you want to get ripped off bless

#####

playing hours speaks for it

#####

ive been playing total war from the very beginning  i dont like the current direction of the franchise  ive deleted the game and reinstalled it for another try twice now and i give up  three kingdoms is so much less absorbing and realistic than earlier offerings  the ui is way too cluttered and gaudy the battlefields are tiny with very little opportunity for manuevering and the silly feature of having one superhero person fight a whole unit is idiotic  the intent seems to be that the player gets to watch an unrealistic movie battle unfold rather than command a historical force  this used to be my favorite franchise but between giving up on realism dumbing down the game and going overboard with the dlc moneygrabs creative assembly seems to have lost their way

#####

they axed it before it even reaches the three kingdoms setting what a bummer

#####

personally the best total war ever done truly top draw

#####

first thing you will notice is ive only played this game for nearly 10 hours 
the fact i feel i am able to write a review with that many hours is really all you need to know as to why ive given this game a negative review but i will explain myself anyway

as a veteran of total war ive watched a once great strategy game turn into what we have in front of us now 
sega clearly believe there is only money to be made in mobarpg type games as slowly they are all devolving into this helloooooo dawn of war iii

but alas to three kingdoms specifically

ill start with the good

i opened the game and was instantly stunned my pc is now 7 years old and despite epic hardware back then its now feeling its age big time 
but this game looks incredible the attention to detail in the artwork is beyond compare and it ran really well considering my older hardware i was able to get almost ultra quality at 2k despite only having a 980ti and a i5 4670k and still get a respectable fps granted im late to the party so most of the flaws have probably been fixed by now but it runs well in my opinion
the setting is a fantastic choice while im new to the three kingdoms genre its perfect for this type of game and ive thoroughly enjoyed this setting ive even done some reading to further my knowledge 
romance and normal mode is a clever twist which allows the game to appeal to a wider market one which could encompass older total war fans and newer warhammer fans a very clever ploy and actually works well to change up the feel of the game despite it obvious being designed with romance mode in mind

the bad

so where do i start
its boring as 

here ill mostly talk about the campaigns the battles will come later

this campaign is a prime example of how to take a diverse and interesting game and devolve it into a diplomacy simulator
a huge effort has been placed into diplomatic relations which is all well and good it sounds fancy and you now have a million and one different ways of negotiating with other factions but it still boils down to clicking the various different options until you get a little  appear meaning they are more than likely going to accept your deal

buildings provide no variation other than campaign effects this means you have no desire to progress with buildings to provide you new troops or a better standing in the campaign the only thing it does provide is a bigger garrison to stop it being taken from you that and you may fleetingly need a building to increase some public order 
generally you only build farms to ensure both the city and the armies have food and you make the most money possible

all cities now have a heavy garrison provided you update buildings you will because you have to spend your money on something as you generally only have one or two armies this eliminates all threat of losing any cities once they are claimed

all this leads to you just trundling along taking the next city turtling until it can defend itself and your army has recouped then moving to the next

it portrays the ideas of strategy while simultaneously swiping the entire strategy elements completely from under your feet
you end up with one or two armies with epic characters and a force unstoppable which just hop from one city to the next

factions are again boring giving only small variations in very specific troops and some added campaign map features which change very little in the real terms of how the game plays out and considering there feels like literally hundreds of different choices it all boils down to the exact same formula for each faction leader with varying levels of initial difficulty same unit types and a heavy focus on leaders means you have nothing to strive for mid or late campaign at all

all in all leading to a game of grand promises which boils down to something incredibly shallow



the ugly

the campaigns maybe shallow but at least shows elements of enjoyment the battles on the other hand are just out right terrible

there is literally no strategy what so ever just crash the units together and hope they come out the other side the victor 
as an avid fan of shogun 2 which had almost perfected total war battles with its rock paper scissors out look i doubt i will ever come across such an engaging and genuinely interesting battle map again
units still block together and dont attack each other properly cavalry still have no sense of impact 
in romance mode generals challenge each other to a duel before the troops have even got close to each other one will be the victor of said duel having a severe affect on the rest of the armies morale meaning everyone just loses morale and runs away
battles last under 5 minutes 99 of the time including pauses allowing zero time for thought planning or strategy 
units still run away far too easily having lost 10 men and then regain morale when they have run away 200 metres this causes total chaos and absolutely no way to enforce any kind of battle line or tactics

these are issues which were present back in rome 2 how can they still be pushing along with this flawed system glossing over the issues with a new brush of paint every installment


i could forgive warhammer total war 1 and 2 for these issues as they had very grand depth and variation

three kingdoms is shallow unengaging and shows no steps forward for the brand or the game as a whole it ropes you in with promises and complexity which once figured out lead to a game which can be mastered in minutes

i will need serious convincing to buy any further titles

#####

pan feng wisely said my battleaxe has long been horny for battle 

perfection

#####

 very balanced in records mode not really a fan of romance since i think it becomes one sided sometimes
 very good game events that is connected to the story
 love how complex the diplomacy is its not just all about war peace pay this pay that i personally think this is the best  feature of the game
 dlcs are good if youre really not into the story wouldnt recommend getting dlcs since not much changes anyway besides added factions and a few features but would strongly recommend them otherwise

ps
fk lu bu kill him the moment you see him

#####

i wish this had a neutral instead of just thumbs up and down

pro 

the campaign map is good the diplomacy additions are amazing far far better than in any other total war to date cavalry is just better in this game charges to a flank from shock cavalryand melee to an extent are devastating so a big improvement from warhammer 2

cons

every faction feels like theyre the same to play expand expand expand just the same ive played through gong du campaign till the mid game then switched to ma teng same campaign gameplay just expand theres just little variation outside of the starting position politics are just uninteresting and the same with every faction no different roster of troops every type of character also has the same role as another with differing amounts of effectiveness vanguards are good troop killers with no variation apart from some being better at it than others etc

the only difference is yellow turban troops are different than normal troops thats it

every faction having almost the same roster of troops adds to the above theres little to no variation ji militiaspearguard as far as the eyes can see

factions that declare war on you once will continue to do so so peacing out with them with some extended deal means nothing they will just continue to mindlessly declare war on you even if they lose every single time had this happen in my gong du campaign sun jian kept declaring war on me losing land peacing out on repeat until he was destroyed

characters keep magically returning to full strength after uve killed them like attila from attila total war just with not as many lives at attila so killing them in battle is pointless unless you have the campaign movement range available to hunt them down again if you killed them but dont have the movement range to hunt down the army they will appear at full hp the next turn

the new recruitment system is also bad ohh you just defeated a big army and inflicted lots of casualties but just didnt have enough movement range to finish them off next turn they will have a full stack of troops at half strength ready to defend whatever it is they retreated to absolute nonsense

battles are just outright worse very arcadey troops rout very fast on both sides archers have 200 rangewtf every battle is just over in 510 minutes

id rate this game a 610  its just not worth a buy at the 60 mark if you can get it for 4040euro off of some keystore then its worth the price or on a discount

#####

a beautiful game set in a time period and a part of the world that doesnt get a lot of love from western civilization i love the story that is here as well as the ability to kind of role play your generals the dynasty aspect of children and them able to marry of your game goes that long is awesome too

#####

i love it

frankly i think it is the best of the series to dateby far   at least in hindsight after having played all the other tws and it just all turns into the same ole same old

this is the first one that really got me role playing in my ahead ala crusader kings and i think the balance of importance of characters vs importance of armies is spot on  granted i havent made it to the end game yetbut playing  my very first game as kong rong on legendary and diplomacy is a must  

me and liu bei have a bff thing going on that actually sorta developed naturally  the sob took the northern trading port i had my eye on and swallowed up  all the safe territory to the east while i was barley able to push back the guy to my west forget his name and i kept thinking man as soon as i get this guy taking east im kicking liu beis butt

then after finally winning that warwhich took way longer than it would have in any other tw to just grab 2 fracking cities i start realizing just what a small fish in a big sea i am  and liu bei is well not going to be anybody im going to be winning against

about that time he sent me a nonaggression pacti read his bio he seem like a nice guysnow 63 turns later we are making cao cao rue the day he ever demanded i become his vassal

1st time i think ive ever actually remembered this cats namesand that includes tw warhammer   good stuff

highly recommend
