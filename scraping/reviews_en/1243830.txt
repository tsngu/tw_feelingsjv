take note this is not an overcooked 3 this is basically overcooked 1  overcooked 2 along with its dlcs with 7 new kitchens and upcoming content in the future

would recommend if you have not played oc 1  2 
if you have oc 1  2 this is not worth the pricetag for the extra couple of levels perhaps until more content is added

overall overcooked is a great game however this may be misleading to many that think this is perhaps overcooked 3 when its basically an oc1  oc2 bundle

#####

its a bit questionable to have a remake of the first two games for a high price at expense of original fans but for those of us who lack one or the other game its great

except the game has a lot of time limited content thats now permanently unavailable content that was only available when basic fundamentals of the game werent even working theyve since been fixed but that content is now permanently lost and thats a malicious practice time limited fearofmissingout content is rampant in todays industry among larger titles and something i really loathe seeing in indie titles

until something is done to allow this content to be unlockable or available through other means i cant help but leave a negative review 
i appreciated the first overcooked game but the way the franchise has been handled monetized and rushed since has me scared for the future of overcooked

#####

started playing this game with my girlfriend 6month passed im playing with my wife now

#####

if youve played overcooked 1 or 2 this is simply a collection of both with some new levels which is not worth a full price if youve never played overcooked series this is the perfect one for you have fun

#####

this game

ive played overcooked 1 and overcooked 2

i can say with certainty that this game is one step forward and two steps back 

the remastered graphics and audio are well done lighting really makes the cartoony detail of the game world stand out as it should the audio is much crisper and cleaner than the originals making for a good experience for sight and sound the ui has been reworked to be much cleaner and easier to use you no longer have to scroll through a list of all the chefs to pick the one you want theres a lot of chefs out there  not to mention the number of colour variants for each

however that is where the positives end

the ui was remastered yet for some reason one of the most annoying things about overcookeds chef selection still remains it does not save your lastused chef on quitting sound is always on full blast rip earphone users on startup i use the exact same chef every time and deliberately have audio lowered so that voice chat is more audible why the player profile is not loaded on startup is beyond me these little qol adjustments would add that final bit of polish to a ui that is already well done

multiplayer performs reasonably well at lower pings at higher pings the rubberbanding is insane in this day and age state rewind is not an impossibility it does not matter if you are host apparently the antilag method seems to try to get an average of all the players game states resulting in a sharp jerk followed by a slow pull to your final position if you dash and then stop my latency to my usual friends group is approximately 120ms  not exactly ideal but also not totally awful  yet i was rubberbanding to the point where it was frustrating even no antilag clientauthoritative state would be preferable ala overcooked 2 than this where you cant even tell where your character is supposed to be

the controls are awful im not sure what theyve done with object interaction range but ive noticed significantly more incidents of dropping a plate on a burner instead of scooping up the contents of a pot or pan at best the plate can just be picked up off the ground again at worst your character cant decide whether to interact with the potpan or the plate combine this with tight kitchens and no dedicated button to drop an object and your chef can be left holding something useless while being unable to switch to the intended object when you can easily 4 every level in overcooked 2 without any issues and have severe problems with scooping up items like you used to you know something has gone horribly wrong

i cannot justify the steep cost of this game a 5695 if you like me already have overcooked 1 and overcooked 2 the remastered graphics and audio are nice but hardly compensates for the significantly degraded online multiplayer performance and atrocious controls if you havent got overcooked 1 and 2 and you intend to play multiplayer on a couch go for it by all means if your multiplayer tends to be over internet stay well away from this and get only overcooked 2 instead

#####

good but they should let you get it for free if you have one and two already

#####

buy this instead of overcooked 2 its oc1  oc2 and all dlc

#####

i love the game but im very disappointed in how people who has supported since day one buying all the dlc and stuff when i got out now have to buy more or less the same game again losing all progress and stars etc to get the birthday special or any other cool update for free 
you say youre inclusive since this can be used by and olater between all different types of plattforms as well as this is the most evolved version of the game yet but you forget that you exclude all the big fans and supporters who has been there since day one buying each and every pack as soon as it got out we dont want to pay one more time for the same game but we sure do deserve all the updates and privileges

#####

this game ended my relationship

#####

3999 eur for two games i already own just to get future bonus content that used to be free not worth it

i used to hold team 17 and ghost town in high regard but after this greedy cashgrab their names are forever tarnished shady business practices that i would expect from the likes of ea do not recommend

#####

tldr good if you dont own overcooked 1  2  otherwise not worth the big price tag

good
 updated graphics
 online multiplayer for overcooked 1
 one new content update 
 cross plattform multiplayer

bad
 loyality discount of 15 for owners of the old versions
 no new ideas  game mechanics
 not many new levels
 some of the older game music was replaced and takes away the flair 

a word to the makers
we bought overcooked 1  2 with all available dlcs  oc 2 even twice and you think a loyality discount price tag of eur 33 is fair i dont think so 
we are big fans of oc but this release is an uninspired reskin with nothing new  

since the announcement we anticipated the game but this is a very sad end to the franchise rest in peace

#####

it helped me get with my girl

#####

i was excited to play this game with my online friends because i heard the games were really fun to play with unfortunately the negative reviews about online sessions do not lie i keep getting disconnected consistently every match resulting in me abandoning my workstation every time i am supposed to be angry at my friends not the game and since these network connection issues will never resolve as it has been 2 years im refunding this game before i cant anymore i may rebuy it if the connection issues resolve but that seems heavily unlikely if you have a group of friends that can play locally be my guest but do not play this game if you want to play online with other friends

#####

absolutely wonderful  i was one millisecond late on putting the patty on the burger and my wife is now filing for divorce shes taken the kids it was her last straw we couldnt get 3 stars on the level after about 10 hours of attempts my kids and twitch chat were watching and they all booed me my kids asked w or l in the chat it was just ls  ive lost all followers now all subscribers my kids absolutely despise me my extended family was watching the stream and are now disowning me the clip was shared around my office and ive been fired effective immediately i only have enough money for 3 months rent ive lost my job my house my family my love and my life i have nothing left nothing except one thing overcooked all i have left is this fantastic game that ruined me

#####

ultimately as someone who has played every bit of overcooked content available i would recommend buying overcooked 2 on discount and waiting for dlc to do the same over buying all you can eat ayce adds only a few dlc campaigns while eliminating local remote play it is unavailable on this title and being much harder to run on weaker pcs because of its improved but barely customizable graphics options only vsync and very low to very high quality setting available 

only recommend this purchase if you love these games and you own a high powered pc that is the only thing youll ever want to play this on otherwise save cash and just buy the original overcooked 2 for cheap you arent missing a thing

#####

played with friends a few times we are not friends anymore

#####

game company makes beloved series of games and you buy them and associated dlc 
game company then bundles content that you already bought with a little bit of polish and sells it back to you as a full price game 
plot twist  new game has trash multiplayer code

#####

lol not paying double to buy 1 and 2 twice  something needs to be in place for those who already bought both 1  2 and the dlcs

#####

b very recommended for b
 you who dont own oc1 or oc2 and have been wanting to play it since
 you who have been wanting to play oc1 online coop with longdistanced or overseas friends
 you who cant play with friends all this time because you bought the game on different platforms
 you who have played any of the series but never bought the dlcs oc1oc2

b recommended for b 
 you who have played oc2 but never played oc1 because theres no option for online coop
 you who are a hardcore fans of the title and need a reason to replay the game all over again ime raises handi
 you who with any of the two reasons stated above want to invest on possible future dlcs released in ayce version at least the dev promised for a free update later this year

b probably not recommended for b
 you who have bought oc1 andor oc2 with all their dlcs ibut hey surprise this is actually me yet i have no regrets buying aycei
 you who think ayce is a third installment of the series and is looking forward for many new levels no its a remastered and bundle version of oc1 and oc2 plus all their dlcs so far ive only seen 1 new dlc exclusive for ayce the rest are totally a rerealese

those who fall under the third not recommended category would think the game is overpriced and the loyalty discount is not enough to make up for it i do agree to a certain degree but at the same time i understand that the highlight of playing ayce is mostly its ability to support crossplatform and to make oc1 available in online coop mode im not sure if ayce is marketed with the intention of encouraging old players to rebuy the whole game so if we see from a bnewcomers point of view ayce will definitely worth itb other than that im betting that future dlcs would probably be released more on this ayce version

we cant deny overcooked is super fun and has great gameplay so at the very least i wouldnt not recommend it just because the price fails some people

the bgm and visual are really improving though i love how catchy oc1 and the main menu music is

im playing with keyboard so i have yet to experience controller issues edit heard they fix it with the patch by now but as far as ive experienced ayce tends to have server issue when playing with friends we need to close and relaunch the game so were able to join a new session theres also this problem when we connect while enabling the crossplatform function it tends to fail to connect when hosting if youre playing online with others uon the same platformu its a better bet to turn off crossplatform option for more successful connection

#####

was concerned given the reviews about not being able to play splitscreen with 2 controllers and 1 copy of the game i was able to get it to work properly very easily once you click some buttons on the second connected controller it autoassigns the second player to that controller no splitting required just wanted to clarify this as it is a feature the game claims to support and does while from looking at reviews a misconception is stopping people from buying

#####

do not buy if you want to play online with friends because it does not work and they still have not fixed it the game came out in march 2021 and the netcode is still awful

#####

do not buy this at least until they fix all their issues with controllers and if you dont already own any of the first 2 games

this should have been a great game they just ruined it by over valuing it price is waaay too high
and also theres nothing new its just a re release because they couldnt be bothered to fix crossplay between overcooked 2 on xbox  pc which the game promised but didnt deliver 
so im forced to buy this and then they break the controllers on the first patch

this game is basically a patch for the second game to fix it without adding anything new or innovative that would warrant a 30 price tag

edit
somehow they broke it even further now my nintendo switch controller doesnt work as well was working on the build with broken xbox controllers

also the pc version for some reason cant properly select a different variant of a character

#####

so much fun
but it can be stressful especially if you have a girlfriend which is obsessed with this game and wants to do endless survival runs we got the 100 though d

hoping for more levels and updates


#####

my girlfriend who hates video games loves this we started with overcooked 2 worked our way back to 1 and now were starting plateup thank you overcooked  1010

#####

i was excited to have everything rolled into one with new chefs levels and nicer graphics

but then you guys ruined it by having to be online regardless of single or multiplayer and that it was all server side which meant unstable connection extreme lag and disconnects thanks for ruining one of my favorite coop games at least overcooked 1  2 will still work and be playable in 10 years unlike this game which will inevitably be shut down

#####

bought this for the sole purpose of playing multiplayer with friends 4 player multiplayer does not work on campaign mode avoid this game until they come out with a solid fix we have tried every few months to play this and the devs still have not fixed the issue

#####

dont buy if you already own the other overcooked games or youll just be wasting your money if you dont already own the games though this is a great way to get them all in one

unfortunately i already owned overcooked and overcooked 2 so i found this to be a waste of money the overcooked series is great though it will ruin the relationship of whomever you decide to play with as you argue over strategy or a failure to follow the agreed upon strategy its great fun

#####

major difficulties with creating session and on the extremely rare occasion that i can create a session my friend cant even join my session the whole point of this game is coop play so why is the connectivity so half baked

#####

more than 2 years since launch all you can eat is still littered with critical bugs whether it be connection errors or gameplay bugs all you can eat is an inconsistent experience you would expect a well polished game it being a repackaging and remaster of previously released content but this isnt the case 

apparently team17 and ghost town missed the memo that their product is a coop game where most players will be playing with others over the internet yet the games online infrastructure has zero stability and missing critical features you cant mix players from public matchmaking with invitees so enjoy manually hunting for partners all over the internet if youre looking for players to fill empty slots the major campaigns are mostly bug free but all the side content suffers from match ruining bugs and constant disconnections 4 player games are as stable as a critical nuclear reactor and in every session is an inevitability that your game will shit itself at some point my absolute favorite part is being unable to connect to team17s servers for multiple days straight ruining an entire weekend that was meant for playing with friends what i find most insulting is that these problems are as old as the game itself and the developers have not made any effort in squashing these critical bugs

all you can eats technical failures are saddening because there is a genuinely great game beneath the bugs

#####

only recognizes one controller on one device makes local coop a little hard to do properly since both games already supported up to 4 controllers this limitation seems very intentional so that every player has to buy the whole thing themselves
and yes because they operate by emulating local controllers this does apply to parsec steam remote play together  steam link and so on

#####

i love the game but myself and a bunch of friends bought the game only to find that multiplayer for 3  4 players doesnt work 

we spent an hour trying different ways we all have internet speeds from 150900mb up and down but failed every time in the end for my stream it was always me and one other and each hour i swapped out who i was playing with 

it was utterly ridiculous many people in my community including myself have wasted much money on this game 

fix multiplayer

#####

i own overcooked 1 with all dlcs and overcooked 2 with all dlcs love both of them played 100s of hours
bought this for the updated graphics and additional bonus levels during a sale

the main part of the game seems to work for me but the game has bugs which get never addressed for example some levels are made in a way that the timer only starts rolling once you deliver the first meal so you can prep all the ingredients and then deliver super quickly later in this version the timer just runs always when you try to get 4 stars that way you can never reach the 4 star score

i see in the forum that this has been reported several times and the feedback from the moderator was it was handed it to the development team but its not fixed for months or years what else can you do than give this game a negative review they had no issue taking my money this stuff worked correctly in overcooked 2 but not in this version so thumbs down

#####

i love this game even tho none of my friends will play with me because they hate me

#####

finished overcooked 2 with all the available dlcspurchased all you can eat with an additional copy for my bf so we could play more contentcoop is unplayable disconnected us from the game every few minutes for 20ish mins straight even upon trying different modes we will be refunding it asapsave yourselves trouble and get overcooked 2 with season pass instead this game shouldnt be even available for purchase on steam in this state of play

#####

cant play multiplayer in a multiplayer game devs have been silent about the problem

#####

update its gotten worse this game has corrupted bluetooth and controller drivers leading to a reinstall of windows to clear the issue setup and tried again same thing and another windows reinstall no other steam game including overcooked 2 has cause or had this issue stay away unless they fix this you may get lucky and not have any issues but its a headaches if you do

owned all the overcooked games and dlc on switch and here on steam 

i cannot recommend the pc version the controller support is terrible eventually had to use ds4windows to emulate 360 controllers to get it to work there was never an issue with 1 or 2 with any of our controllers 8bitdo dualshock switch pro

cross platform coop worked fine and was a good amount of fun the headache of the controller setup isnt worth it if they fix it then i would recommend it

the other item of note is the price theres not much content to justify pricing if you own overcooked 12 with all dlc i wouldnt bother unless someone in your family has to have it or for reasons of cross platform play

#####

unfortunately the game is currently not playable with a steam link and a controller from the start screen its over you get no further with the a key i started overcooked 2 for the test it went without any problems
gave the game back

#####

it kept disconnecting checked the forums and its been an ongoing issue for 3 years and they still havent fixed it if youre planning to play with a full team do not buy

#####

tldr good game if you never bought the previous two games multiplayer issues galore even for 2 devices using the same gigabit internet feels like an intentional monetary roadblock on those who cant afford to buy the game a third time and could easily be solved by allowing crossplay with the previous versions

overall it is a good game but it has its issues multiplayer can be a bit laggyeven when both of the players have gig internet a good example of this is when my wife and i play on our separate pcs using the same connection we should not have any latency issues specially on google fiber but we do second issue with this is the lack of crossplay support when it comes to those who own previous copies of the overcook 12 it isnt fair to have had to purchase the games separately only to have to rebuy an hd update with a dozen or so new levels at full price i am aware that there was a discounted price when the game released for those who had the previous versions but it still isnt fair for those folks who are on a budget and cant afford to rebuy the same game let alone be roadblocked by the developer not affording a bit more time to enable crossplay with the other versions of the game with other players this huge issue basically blocked a good chunk of friends who had the other two games to not being able to play with us we enjoy the game it just sucks that our many other friends who cant financially afford to buy the game a third time are roadblocked from playing with us



#####

there needs to be a disclaimer that online matchmaking does not work you cannot matchmake with party members and even if you couldthe game refuses to match you with anyone i cant believe this game has been out for over a year and yet there has been no word or attempt of a fix by the devs really unfortunate because i really couldve seen myself playing this alot with matchmaking

#####

online multiplayer does not work and is not playable at all i have seen reports of these issues since the game launched and they still arent fixed dont get scammed

#####

im a major overcooked fan i have every level in 1 2 and all dlcs 3starred and i enjoy them immensely ive been looking forward to this game for months and the day it came out i paid 40 for a game that includes 7 actual new levels and the chance to play the original overcooked without having to rely on how horrible steam remote play is i was immediately disappointed with the lack of consistency of development as they neglected their keyboard and mouse users by making it impossible to bind mouse buttons to any of the controls theyve since fixed this but because i have 200 hours using either a switch controller which i still think doesnt work and keyboard and mouse i didnt want to relearn the controls to complete the same exact levels i reinstalled after the original hotfix and to my delight not a single online function works on my computer ill give their support team props for trying to help me but their public discord shows dozens of other people struggling with the same issues ive had since the games release overall it feels extremely buggy unfinished and overpriced for something with major online functionality problems less control support than its predecessors and very little actual new content im likely refunding again if i cant play a couch coop online

#####

can only play with one controller locally very disingenuous to label this as local coop

#####

you cant play with your friends if they have the vanilla overcooked 12

#####

you absolute donut

real talk the game is overcooked 1 and 2 with all the dlc repackaged some visual optimizations have been done but its not all that different of an experience from the other games if you already own the other two its likely not worth the purchase the only reason im purchasing this game is because of the inclusion of crossplatform multiplayer i have a niche case where netplay options like steam remote play together and parsec arent viable in my view there isnt anything else here at launch that would convince me to buy

dont get me wrong its a good game it doesnt give much value beyond the original games but if you havent played overcooked before this is a fantastic bundle and who knows maybe the free content promised later this year might make up for the lack of new content im not crossing my fingers for that but we shall see

#####

this game is fun when your friend is channeling their inner gordon ramsey and telling you that youre garbage and that you guys need to work together d

#####

this game causes domestic violence

#####

i love it its one of my favourite games i love playing it with friends for the developers please allow us to change positions it would add variety and flexibility to the gameplay its not intuitive that we have to create a new session to change the order of our positions

#####

cant get local coop to work with steam deck since it requires a player profile for each controller

#####

its simply a compilation of overcooked 1 and 2 with nothing new added for instance while you could throw ingredients in overcooked 2 you still cant do that in the maps from overcooked 1 within this compilation this compilation pack might be more suitable for those who havent played the previous overcooked games but since multiplayer is serverbased rather than hostbased there are quite a few issues with bugs and lag making it challenging to recommend


단순히 12입니다 하지만 3은 아니네요

#####

game is fun but until they fix the problems with controllers i cannot recommend the game

also even if you change the sound settings the game will always start off with blasted sound settings to make sure you go deaf before chaos ensues

#####

all you can disconnect 
just dont buy this
go to overcook 2 with season pass

#####

may ruin ur relationships but worth it

#####

if you already own both oc1 and 2 and the dlcs and you are a hardcore fan feeling tempted to buy this please dont i voted oc every year for awards because of how much i love this game however this remastered version of the game has really disappointed me and many other fans of oc there are many bugs and online coop connection is glitchy the game seems to be created to earn more money from diehard fans of the game because it looks like no thought and attention to details were even put into it unlike in oc1 and 2 i have to say i am extremely disappointed at the way this game turned out and also with team17 for also updating us on the wrong platforms the free updates given to all you can eat should not be announced on other versions of oc i hope that there will be more content added to this game in the future but till then this is not even worth buying on a discount

#####

refunded   such a waste 

 controller issues when my controller is perfectly working in overcooked 2 

expensive for people who already owns overcooked 1  2 full dlcs   15 loyalty discount only when we already own almost 90 of the game content   

i dont mind paying twice just to get better graphics  etc  ill buy it again after you fix the controller bug
ps5 dual sense controller



#####

this is hands down one of the most disappointing games ive ever purchased it has now been refunded me and my friends all got it excited to finally play overcooked 1 online without steam share the servers for this game are basically non functional we constantly got errored out and all got the same error code when looking it up we found threads over a year old with the same issue unfixed under no circumstance should you purchase the game in its current state hopefully one day they fix this game

#####

multiplayer is broken appears to have been for about two years and the devs havent fixed it you cant launch a campaign with other players in the lobby

#####

i have both overcooked with all dlcs and its great that they remastered the first game but they havent done any fixes that really make an impact on gameplay  black bars still present on ultrawide screen and i dont see a reason why theres no fix for that just put something on the background or extend existing background ie like water in levels with water hell you could even do the same way yakuzas game have done it  put instead of black bars  monochromatic styled bars no one asks for making all the maps twice or thrice bigger therere a lot of bugs in ui like backdrop of a modal not even 100 of width more like 80 looping bug when something overgrow the width of display and itd create trailing below modals on animations spacing between lines and text are off in settings

for a couch play game works perfectly well as the second game but online coop sometimes unplayable just see other reviews to know why

i hope they will fix this and i would gladly buy this game and replay it again

#####

multiplayer worked for like 3 hours following that we were not able to connect devs have not fixed it after like 2 years

#####

i wanted to enjoy this game  but i cant

i was already upset that despite owning overcooked overcooked 2 and all the dlc the newest edition simply bundled all that and charged full price  45 cad for a game i already played before  i purchased it for myself and 2 friends  we spent the better part of 50 hours trying to 100 the game  we love it  i swallowed the steep price as i value the quality time with my friends

unfortunately the game is unplayable  we constantly get an e0157 error which kicks us out of the online session  this never happened in overcooked 2  or any other steam game we play together

this game isnt really meant to be played solo  it is a multiplayer experience

because of the greedy tactics of team 17 and the unplayable state of the game i would not recoomend this title to anyone

#####

i thought it was a bundle with all the content but its a game by it self which means that if a friend has the 1 or 2 you still cant play with them because the dont have all you can eat it was really disappointing  founding out about it once i got it you cant even use remote play together

#####

i bought this well aware that there are online connectivity issues but usually play either locally or through steam remote play together as i have done with overcooked 1 and 2 so i thought i would be unaffected by the aforementioned issues however i got disconnected from the network error screen which ended the level prematurely while playing a level solo a few seconds from the end what a pain even solo play is affected due to this i solemnly cannot recommend this title

edit after 15 hours
i really wanted to change this review to positive since there are additional chefs levels and a graphical overhaul of overcooked 1 but having single player require online connectivity really killed the buzz for me especially since the disconnection issue ruined another level i finished achievement hunting in overcooked 1 and 2 and still feel overcooked 2 holds its own
as others have mentioned  this title may be worth it if someone does not already own the previous titles and does not mind potential disconnects even on solo play

#####

the main draw of this game is to play overcooked 1  2 plus all dlc content crossplatform and for that this works well  ive played online without issue with friends on steam and switch if you already have oc 1 andor 2 and arent interested in crossplatform play this might not be the purchase for you

#####

kept crashing for our party of 4 could not get all players to connect at once without an error didnt get to play even one single game all of us requested a refund

#####

e0157 error every game the multiplayer doesnt work at all sometimes you can play one game before disconnect sometimes none seems nearly fraudulent to offer an coop game without coop

edit there are claims the multiplayer is fixed now but i cannot confirm this

#####

game is a banger and you should absolutely get it on consoles
avoid on pc
do not buy on steam it is only 1 person online at a time

on consoles you can have 2 players local and join 2 players online
on pc you can 2 players local offline
if you join an online game even with 2 local players and multiple controllers it will bump you and make it so you can only play 1 person per pc online 

game is fun af and would absolutely recommend on consoles not on pc

#####

multiplayer doesnt work which kills the experience and the game for me the only way to play with friends is through remote play

#####

this game made my friends and i scream at each other i absolutely love it

#####

great game but no here is why

online multiplayer is still buggy kicks me  my friends out for no reason and sometimes we just cant use it without knowing why and everyone must own the game
then what bout local multiplayer it supports up to 2 person both keyboard   both controller no mixture even for remote play and you cant be like 2 person on switch  2 on pc 

while i do enjoy this game i think this is a serious issue that they have to fix it for pc port

#####

the online component  crossplay for this game doesnt work despite the game being out since march huge bummer and wasnt able to play with a friend on console im not sure if the game will be fixed

#####

one day my children will come to me
dad there is this girl im dating but i dont like her and want to break up with her how do i do that
son there is this so called coop game by the time you two reach level 10 your girlfriend has already broken up with you

overcooked is where friendships and romantic relationship come to die

#####

best game to either get the perfect marriage or divorce nothing in between

#####

the ultimate test of ones marriagerelationshipfriendship you will sink or swim highly addictive and who doesnt love petting kevin

#####

they dropped a 4gb update and the only chance i notice is that my xbox controller no longer works im big mad

#####

i bought this game alongside my friend so we could play it coop every time we start a session we get the connection error code e0157 we have tried disabling firewalls cleared dnsdownload cache made sure nat was open we tried playing through the tutorial solo and rejoin together on the next missions weve tried everything other people have posted about with similar issues this game is not very fun solo and i am disappointed this game was offered as playable when it is not if you want to play online with friends do not buy this

any help to resolve this issue would be helpful as id like to play it with my friend if there are no fixes id like my money back bc this game is unplayable

#####

i play this game online with friends in the same city and the lag is absolutely ridiculous placing and picking up items takes a full second to register and when map mechanics happen you have no idea if youre shoved off the map or not i dont understand how oc2 had such a good online play mode but this completely butchers lol the experience 
oc2 is my favourite game to play with friends and i was super excited to play ayce before release but its been a full month and a half since release and over a month since the last patch im massively disappointed in this game and really expected a lot better

the new rats mechanic that steals your food is a terrible design choice and you need to dedicate a player solely to stomp them instead of contributing to the team i also tried to link my twitch account several times to no change in the game which was a frustrating experience 

i enjoyed the new chef choice screen and the new end game screens i wish the original game assets from oc1 and 2 were upscaled nicer than they are because they would look much nicer and be worth the price tag of this game 



#####

do not get this game if you want to play multiplayer

me and my friends got this game to play together with the idea that it would be a great time the game had bugs and it disconnected us a lot  this was a few months back the developers seemed aware of this problem we are far from the only people to experience them and figured theyd fix it they have not fixed the issue

so not only can we not play the game together  we also waited too long out of blind faith and cant even get a refund

so lessons learned
1 dont wait to get a refund 
2 dont trust this developer to make a playable online multiplayer mode

#####

love the game and the overcooked series but until this games multiplayer servers are fixed there is no reason to own it you literally play one game and get disconnected every single time if it even loads in the first place it is the remastered with all the dlc so if you never played oc1 or oc2 or dont have the dlc it is very worthwhile

#####

the online is messed up right now  its hard to get a game in arcade or versus  the discord is really cool though  the community is adding eachother and playing online private to get really heated matches  come join the discord and get in on some of this cross play action

#####

great for the crossplay overcooked 1 online remastered graphics and all the dlc all rolled up into one package

if youve played everything then this isnt really that great of a value i like the series a lot so i went ahead and bought it but veterans wont find much to do here except maybe a good excuse to replay the games overcooked 1 online was pretty worth it for me personally though

#####

do not buy this game if you intend to play it online its big regression compared to oc2 rubberbanding teleporting high latency not able to pick items etc not fun hope t17 will address this soon give us p2p option or good oc2 networking so we can bypass your ass servers

couch coop doesnt work on steamdeck with two controllers no fix for waayyy too long oc1  2 work fine without issue disappointed in whatever change they made to controller inputs

#####

this is not a sequel this is a remaster collection if you are expecting anything else dont

pros
overcooked is a great series if you dont already own 1 andor 2 then buy this and have fun local or online i own both on consoles so this was a great way to get it for pc
you can play all all the levels from oc 1 online
some bonus levels all the chefs in a handy menu
go read the reviews for the separate games because people are bombing this edition
controller support some reviews say otherwise but i have ps4 controller and works fine

cons
if you own 1 and 2 youre not getting anything new
maybe some connection issues but my internet is also not great
people complaining about paying more

#####

love the game what i dont love is team17 not proactively trying to fix their servers i have had multiple friends deal with disconnects one that cant even play the game and the only info you can find for fixes is from 2 plus years ago which tells me they havent tried fixing any of it at all

#####

my girlfriend and i love playing overcooked together it is a really fun concept of a game unfortunately the multiplayer for this game is god awful the servers are so laggy it gets to the point where its unplayable you will be trying to move fast and your character will just teleport to the left or right often times flying you off the edge of the map you can be standing still and this will still happen to you it is very disappointing considering how much we love the game please just fix your servers and this game would be amazing

#####

even that the game has some bugs that team17 doesnt fix and the game doesnt have much new levels 

pros
be able to play oc 1 oc 2  dlcs 7 new levels in one game
crossplay works better than oc2
really fun to play with your friends

cons
too expensive 
some bugs example some stuff get stuck outside the level or above the wallsoven plates pizza
response is a bit laggy comparing with oc2

#####

do not get the game if you plan on playing online multiplayer it does not work and will only disconnect you if you try the game has been out for 3 years and they still havent fixed it

#####

i have reported the problem regarding default key setting left ctrl key not responding to team 17 couple months ago and guess what they have no plan to fix it
i mean theres still tons of issue going on with overcooked all you can eat even til now and yet team 17 have not release any new updates attempt to fix the issues since march 
team 17 can be negative or perfunctory about anything because all you can eat is a onetimepurchase product for now you will get all the dlcs with the price of the game so whoever is planning to purchase the game should bear in mind that the game developer is not going to help if you have encountered any issue with the game

#####

need more new levels

#####

bought this to play with friends game disconnects over and over and over we cant do the campaign at all actual garbage

#####

i hate having to write this it breaks my heart i read the reviews and thought it cant be that bad right 

overcooked all you can eat is literally unplayable online error after error we flushed our dns validated files ran as admin checked forums etc any support was pure deflection  check your connection it must be an issue on your side
if we got into a game and that is a big if we would disconnect after each level forcing us to regroup and roll the dice again only to disconnect and repeat the process get overcooked 2 instead which had no issues connecting with others all

#####

this game is nothing but fun  but if you play with a loved one it will test the strength of your relationship lol

#####

when the game works its fun but multiplayer refuses to work for more than 2 levels really sad that this has been an issue for months and the devs havent said or done anything to remedy it heres to hoping they fix the game since im past the refund window
edit its now november and still having multiplayer connectivity issues  cannot go past level 44 as the save files always get corrupted and the game constantly errors out after getting there also dlcs error out what a waste of money holy smokes
edit 2 march of 2022 still no fixes for the game even though updates have stated the multiplayer problems have been fixed its all lies still cant play for more than 2 levels with my friends online 40 bucks still wasted

#####

my only huge complaint is yeah the loyalty discount shouldve been more especially since people bought overcooked 2 at full recently other than that i personally have not experienced any controller or internet issue switch xbox even a ps4 controller all work and ive not had any issues connecting to online or with any of my friends but the release of all you can eat i feel like was review bombed unfairly since people were already gearing up to do so before the release in general

edit will not deny that others are having these issues just saying for me its been a great experience so far

#####

i dont wanna give this game a thumbs down because it is a good game i can see the appeal but i genuinely cant handle it dark souls is a more relaxed game than this if you are easily overwhelmed do not play this game lmao

#####

very annoying to rate fairly and on its own merits because at its core its just overcooked 1 and 2 combined and splashed with a new coat of paint and one or two dlcs worth of new levels
some visuals were reworked a handfull of new levels added and overall this frankenstein monster is unironically the definitive and best version of overcooked

but if you played the first two games to death and completed them both theres barely anything new here for you
and the problem is compounded by the fact it cannot be played in crossplay with overcooked 2
so for online multiplayer sessions all players need to have either overcooked 2 or all you can eat

if you plan to buy all you can eat to play locally with family and friends or your online friend circle already mostly adopted it over overcooked 2 i feel all you can eat is a good pick

but if you plan on playing online and your friends either have overcooked 2 or dont own any game in the series at all its much cheaper to just grab overcooked 2s base game on sale play through it together and if you still crave more cooking action you can go straight to all you can eat

im going to give this a thumbs up but count it as a thumbs down thumbs down if the following applies
 you completed both overcooked 1 and 2 and own all the dlc theres just 12 new levels if you think 2040 eur is worth 12 new levels then go ahead
 all the friends you want to play with already own overcooked 2 over ayce

#####

ghost artifacts of ui at top when playing on steam deck developers know the issue but wont fix it

#####

very fun wanted to cry on some levels but so fun however do not buy all you can eat if trying to play with owners of the base game it is not compatible

#####

as longterm fans of overcooked i have already purchased overcooked and overcooked 2 as well as all of the dlc i was under the impression that the new game would have more new content i was underwhelmed and disappointed when the majority of the content was content i have already played in addition to this i was never able to find people in the online public matches if it was cheaper than 45 it may have been worth it for the improved graphics and the few new maps this seems more targeted for new players and i wish that was more clear this is one of my favourite game series and i hope to have the opportunity to play more content in the future

 overcooked og player

#####

what a mess took me over 30 minutes till i was able to play with two different controllers ps4 and xbox360

a game like this in the year 2021 it really shouldnt have these problems connecting a controller and then an additional different one holy cow what a struggle game wont tell you what you did wrong game wont tell you how you should be doing it and there is no tutorial a tutorial for playing with an already connected controller like come on

here is how it works for me in case anyone struggles as well

i use an old xbox360 controller from like 10 years ago with one of those adapters and one of those later versions of the ps4 controller both controllers connected correctly with steam i know because i could navigate steam big picture with either of them i was able to start the game but only the xbox controller was able to get past the start press aspacear screen ps4 just would not work and google search gave me the answer eventually after way to much time spent on this which should not be a problem in the first place 
solution plug it in via usb who would have thought that this might be a problem in the year 2021 

would have refunded the moment i relized that but since my gf loves the game ill keep it and play it with her 

shame on every developer that is unable to include a proper controller on pc feature 

oh an also no playstation controller symbols i know both is used how about include them both like ax or bo since you know  are a thing and people can distinguish whats used for what and no it is not about just memorize cant be that hard it is about accessibility and people who barely ever have a controller in their hands

what a mess

#####

this is just a mashup of oc1 and oc2 with their dlcs and no bugs fixed at all
they only added crossplay

#####

this is just a mashup of oc1 and oc2 with their dlcs it could be made worthwhile by adding a level editor and communitymade modifications with new game mechanics

a successor of a game should always be better than its predecessor mashing the two together simply dont cut it you need to add new content for a new game to make it worth its cost and money

#####

i love overcooked and its legacy but

please stop milking this poor engine it has no milk left to give make overcooked 3 or retire

#####

completely unplayable with friends such an awesome game however we were getting constant disconnects really upset was looking forward to co  op oc 1 as this function was unavailable before devs please sort asap 

sadly had to refund for now  

can someone let me know when this is fixed 3

#####

do not get this game if you want to play online with friends the game constantly disconnects and is virtually unplayable online you are better off getting overcooked 2 as it seems to be a lot more stable with no issues online

#####

i love this game i owned the original overcooked 1 and 2 plus most dlcs but ended up buying this to get access to all of the dlcs plus bonus content they keep adding extra free content too it has so much more than just overcooked 1 and 2 in it at this point it looks great and feels great strongly recommend especially if youre looking to try overcooked for the first time

btw there are reviews saying that you cant use multiple local controllers but i play this with friends using parsec and have never had a problem with it

#####

all gewd now 

#####

really tough to recommend right now there are so many crashes to work around with playing online coop a bit disappointing  when its a pretty steep price to pay for what is essentially a repackaged version of content ive paid for in the previous two titles

very fun however there is a network error which causes the game to crash to lobby after one level story mode consistently in 80 minutes of playing my friends and i all steam all same server set crashed to the main menu after every single level two if we were lucky fun in couch dont rely on online play 

#####

multiplayer doesnt work

#####

fantastic partyfamily game more stressful than soulsbourne games

#####

i bought the game so that i could play online coop and online multiplayer like how i would on playstation however these online features doesnt work on pc i got a refund immediately after realizing this

#####

overcooked is the first game that comes to mind when i think of the quintessential coop experience ive played overcooked with my friends and girlfriend going for highscores to playing with my parents and trying to scrape through each level teaching them the game while laughing as the kitchen burns down amongst the chaos 

i think the trailer does a good job of showcasing what the game is about so i wont go in depth here the basics are working together with your group to cook and deliver various meals to customers this starts out simple but toward the end will really test your coordination and teamwork skills if youre looking to get the maximum star rank on each level the game offers a gigantic variety of recipes and stages to play on with new mechanics or hazards to consider if you like the gameplayloop you wont be disappointed with the huge amount of content on offer here i really could sit there all day making ramen in the giant woks

while the game certainly wont click for everyone i feel overcooked appeals to a wide range of ages and skill levels ive played the series with different people trying to achieve very different goals but the common factor is that it has always been a fun time 

a must buy for any coop fans library

#####

bought this on a gamble given the reviews about the online crossplatform game worked great with me and two friends on xbox and one friend on switch the four of us beat the entirety of overcooked 1 with only disconnecting once in a single 4hr playthrough game seems to work pretty well for online love the new graphics and having selection of all the chefs on a grid menu is really nice didnt mind paying full price to have another game to cross play with my xbox and switch friends

#####

fun game but online is broken and disconnects frequently

#####

if you already played the original ones i would not recommend buying the game at full price wait till its on sale
its way too expensive considering the lack of improvement on the graphics and the lag in online coop which i did not have while playing the original series
nevertheless i still like the game since i was a fan of the originals and its still very entertaining if you play with friends
 its just the netcode thats not accurately working



#####

my score 810 due to some issues in general that can be hopefully fixed

fyi a friend and i found that to help with the controller issue at least with using xbox plug it in before you start the game and when it prompts to either press a or spacebar press a on the controller to ensure you are playing with a controller

as someone who has played both the first and second games i still ended up getting this because of crossplatform multiplayer access to all the content from both games in one package and online multiplayer for the first game sure it still has bugs and some other weird issues but besides that this is a good value if you have never played either any of the overcooked games never played any of the dlcs or for any other reasons

edit now that the game has been out for a while i feel that there are still some issues with performance i usually run the game on lower graphics quality however it uses a lot of graphical power where most of my gpu usage always with this game will be almost 100 maybe its just me i feel like this game isnt even that demanding specswise but it really takes a lot out of my 1060

#####

after the controller remote play and mouse keybind fix i can say its a good game

take in mind its not really a game for owners of 1 2 and dlc its more a welcoming for new people to the series
the price is decently cheap if you consider that youre getting overcooked 1  2 by 5 less without including oc2 dlc and oc1 looks gorgeous however it still brings nearly nothing new for previous owners

ocayce is made for newcomers to the franchise and people who want to revisit the game in 1 package with many qol changes through visual upgrades you dont need to buy this is you dont want to but the game is still a fun revisit of the overcooked magic

#####

i bought the all you can eat version on the expectation it would work with all four controllers but it does not work with more than one controller 

there is a reported bug from at least august but it seams team17 havent been able to fix it for 5 months now i view it quite a serious bug a 4 player  controller game working only on 1 controller this is a bug in the game itself my 4 controllers work fine in other steam games

#####

the definitive version of the series  better visuals and the combined games in one spot and crossplay which is really nice the biggest downsides are they didnt add the ability to throw food to the first game a major missed opportunity imo and that you cannot play with people who do not have this version of the game all you can eat but do have overcooked 1 or 2 i have not had any of the other issues that people have mentioned

#####

the netcode for this game is just plain bad
rubberbanding experience on 4 player online and constant disconnections occurring here and there

even though the visual is greatly improved for the two previous game stages i would have to call a pass to anyone who wants to give this a try and get overcooked 2 at a discounted price instead which somehow have better netcode than this version

#####

great game for couch coop they definitely improved graphics in this remaster if you are looking for a couch coop game or game you want to play using remote play together then i absolutely recommend it i did encounter issues with sound it cuts abruptly on some levels
 
910

#####

love this game but its so buggy

#####

controllers dont work unplayable stick with the original i actually understand all the negative reviews actually playing with family or friends in person is not an option everyone needs to pay 40 to enjoy this game ill go back to oc12 no thanks take your disfunctional game back

#####

game is too buggy to play constant disconnects and a good chance of the game not starting

#####

im waiting for osha to shut this game down with how terrible some of the workplace violations are  kitchens on an iceburg kitchens between traffic and lets not forget the kitchen in which you have to jump between 3 moving trucks on an expressway just to make some fish chips and soup  the only way my wife and i made it through this game was by communicating with each other but not at each other  

in all seriousness this game is an absolute blast and suggest it strongly  if you want to succeed teamwork and communication is key  without that your kitchen will go up in flames

#####

all the dlc included whaat

#####

could be a fun game if there wasnt constant disconnections and network errors googling the error shows devs just repeating we know about this error sorry for the inconvenience

#####

my group has been trying to play this  we love overcooked but the crossplay is unplayable  weve tried two sessions  long loading times and constant drops and you cant even try to reconnect  so incredibly dissapointed

#####

good only if you dont already own overcooked 1  2

#####

as many other players have said the multiplayer doesnt work at all  i bought this game to play with friends but when we try to start a game it just displays the e0055 error code and refuses to connect  reported this issue to the game support and after none of their suggestions clearing the dns cache etc solved the problem was told the report had been passed to the developers 
u four months lateru the devs are still silent on this issue and nothing has been fixed despite reports from many others with the same problem

if its fixed ill change my review but until then i would say only buy this if youre a solo gamer whos happy paying for a bunch of features which dont work

#####

this great is really fun and i enjoy playing it especially with friends but unfortunately it suffers with a lot of connection issues that basically makes it unplayable in multiplayer online with friends which is a shame

#####

tldr definitely get this game if you want to play overcooked online even if you own the previous games controller issues have been resolved

this is the best online overcooked experience what it feels like is they switched to using a dedicated server instead of having one host in overcooked 2 which was a nightmare of latency for anyone who wasnt hosting while the new setup does introduce some weirdness from time to time overall its a far better experience than overcooked 2 whats more crossplay works flawlessly ive been playing with friends who have the switch version 

while there were some issues initially upon launch unable to crossplay broken controller support both have since been resolved and its been a great experience so far its a shame that some of the old music was replaced but the gameplay has definitely been refined overcooked 2 engine which means you can pick up cooked hamburger patties with just a bun instead of needing a plate for example this was impossible in overcooked 1

#####

do not ignore the comments about how bad the lag is this game fucking sucks now

#####

i dont know how team17 messed up this bad with the netcode my friend and i live far away from each other therefore we constantly have high ping between each other overcooked 1 was playable and our actions were slightly delayed in game but in overcooked 2 we rubberband all over the place and its unplayable

also the dlc content doesnt even launch with all you can eat its id literally give it 0 stars out of 10

#####

its cool that they use a random number generator to determine if the match youre trying to play with your friends will disconnect or not

#####

me gusta cocinar con mi wife d

#####

overcooked 1 the kitchen is two buses driving through a minefield in nothern somalia and the customer will execute you gangland style for putting lettuce on his burger

overcooked 2 the customer wants raw unseasoned diced fish that you threw on the floor

havent played extra trimmings or online im not good at cooking

oct 12 dlc is buggy as all get out  yes its free  yes this game is old  yes i wish theyd either put out some quality dlc that takes longer than an hour andor overcooked 3

seriously its been years cmon

#####

youll scream at your friends 1010

#####

overcooked all you can eat is an absolute riot this game is hands down one of the most entertaining experiences ive had sure you might run into the occasional bug but theyre minor blips in an otherwise fantastic game what truly sets it apart is the sheer amount of content it packs in combining all the levels and kitchens from both overcooked games this means youre in for a ton of gameplay and thats always a good thing

however what makes this game truly shine is the chaotic fun it delivers when you play with friends its not just about cooking its about laughter frustration and the challenge of working together seamlessly your friendships will be put to the test and its a brilliant way to see just how well you and your buddies can coordinate under the pressure of a busy kitchen overcooked all you can eat is not just a game its a friendship forge i cant recommend it enough for anyone looking for an unforgettable time with friends

#####

for online coop

i do not recommend constant connection issues at the time of review

#####

its absolutely insane they expect people who own one or two of the previous games plus dlc to buy this just for a couple of extra levels the upgrade in graphics is minimal to the experience though i guess it was nice to have online multiplayer in overcooked 1 we had this for free for like a day and we played all the new levels  at least once as well as finishing overcooked 1 and mining some achievements the fact its not even back compatible with the other games because its a different game wow save your money for something more worthwhile

#####

the game is a lot of fun especially when playing with friends however the online coop is a joke and the game is constantly having network latency issues and people disconnecting midgame its impossible to play without running into these issues at least once every session its a great game if they manage to fix it but otherwise its only worth getting if you are going to play coop locally

#####

e0054 the game couldnt be joined
the best game ive ever played i cant even play this game with my friends
why this shitty bug till now still havent get fixed _

#####

bought at 50 off 28aud
oc 2 on epic games  terrible online connection experience for australia painful rubberbanding 80 of games

ayce 
online experience
 connection is much better possibly steam  epic servers and dedicated australia server 
 light rubberbanding is rare however powerpoint presentation visuals sometimes when due to someone else is hosting 
 easier to find skilled not new player teammates as dedicated players buy ayce and people on epic likely picked up oc2 for free me

pros
 oc1 levels online multiplayer and all existent dlc 
 being the latest installment will get more developer attention than oc2
 remote play any level with nonowners 

cons 
 scarcer people in online public
maybe dont bother if you have oc2 as more people have that deffo only buy when discount
 common powerpoint presentation visuals when not hosting sometimes light rubberbanding but never as bad as oc2 was
 strange 3d interaction collision when dashing up stairs items getting placed on ledges out of reach deffo not perfect may or may not be due to combined lag

a little disappointed that 99 chefs are available immediately and dont have to unlock

#####

it kills me to write this because i love overcooked very dearly ive bought it both versions and all the dlc both on console and pc because i love it just that much i bought this game too even knowing that it didnt have much new content because i wanted to show my support and get some new friends to play it

but thats exactly the problem online multiplayer is barely functional creating a session takes forever and you disconnect either immediately or after every game it is the ultimate buzzkill to the ultimate party game as it is despite knowing that this is a great game i cannot recommend it to anyone in its current condition unplayable ill update if that changes

ps  fwiw i actually didnt have any controller trouble just connection issues

#####

super fun but dont let the kidfriendly look deceive you this game can get hard  love it and my 5 year old sister loves to play we can play for hours

#####

hey guys so this game is great but it has 2 glaring issues that it seems  team 17 has failed to address in the years since this  has been out and searching online has yielded zero solutions first being if you and your buddys have not completed the tutorial mission when completed  in a group session it disconnects you and your friends until you have all completed it solo secondly that previous issue is the only one so far if you only play with 2 people if you try to play with more than 2 online basically isnt even in the question it saddens me greatly because the game is great both games standalone are great but the lack of care for the community really shines through with this title alone even their team 17 support page shows evidence that they are dodging the issue so until they actually fix this issue i cant recommend it if you want to play with more than one other friend

#####

played with a friend for 40 minutes  attempted 5 different games varying arcade overcooked and overcooked 2  all 5 had disconnects as varying points  dont buy if you plan to play with a friend  networking issues that are still unsolved after 2 years

#####

the campaign multiplayer does not work playing 4 player online coop the common reviews and forum posts point to this being a common issue for the last 3 years and never were addressed

#####

scarier than outlast

#####

i love the games and the idea of a remake because the first game didnt support online multiplayer
but the remake is just so buggy

i need to quit the game when i want to change from controller to keyboard
its laggy to the point where you cant play online because the levels are literally impossible to beat in that state
right now it tried for 10 minutes to connect me to twitch for some reason so i couldnt enter the game and i had to altf4 and restart since i couldnt cancel its attempt  and its still not working
ive played for 35 hours in total and feel like i spent half of the time trying to fix the game

its one of the worst portsremakes ive seen these days

#####

been a fan of this game since overcooked 1 bought all the dlcs and preordered overcooked 2

i got a taste of this game during the playforfree event aside of technical issues holy gourmet it does crash often the game itself is fine basically a single place to combine all overcooked experience if you never bought any overcooked games this is the one you should grab the biggest middle finger is i have to buy it again for quite a hefty price considering i own most of previous games even after 40 discount the price is still higher than the preorder price of overcooked 2

i expect this game to be a free upgrade to the owner of previous overcooked games just lock the content which i dont already have in previous games and give the option to rebuy the missing contents the devs really need to look at metro exodus enhanced edition thats how you treat long time fans

#####

i had an issue with the controllers but it has been patched since

overall i really enjoy the game gives me an excuse to play overcooked 1 levels i havent played online yet but the couch coop is a blast i already own overcooked 1 and 2 and i still very enjoy the ayce version

#####

i am with 3 friends online and the game forces crossplay enabled on us despite the fact that we are all on steam
the connection crashes at random intervals
unplayable

#####

40 for porting old content with a 4k overhaul that you dont need controller improvements not ported to first games content and old dlc is presented in a way that suggests it is new content with no easy way to discern what is new and what is old

#####

still seems riddled with gameplay bugs and the online play modes still suffer from network latency issues t17 has lost the plot  who cares about fancy 4k graphics when you cant be bothered to fix major gameplay issues such as intermittently being unable to pick up plates or combine food

#####

i love overcooked but this is a buggy laggy mess that just aint it not sure if theres any plans to change it but im really glad i grabbed it on sale and didnt pay full price

#####

i really enjoy the game itself but i bought this to play with my friends and it constantly is disconnecting us after every match we all get disconnected and then have to hope that it will let me create a new session but that also tends to crash not sure how a game thats been out this long is having this bad of an issue its basically unplayable i unfortunately spent my 2 hours playing and cannot refund

#####

literally my favorite game ever its chaotic and hilarious and there is so much to do to keep you entertained

#####

the game feels very buggy compared to the previous version of overcooked 2 with the movement feeling awkward and delayed

#####

a delightful couch coop game equally balances fun difficulty and optimization i especially recommend for partners

#####

pain

#####

me and my girlfriend really enjoy this game my first review in steam that is how we like it

#####

i cant remember a lot of times i laughed so hard and raged so bad this game got me so addicted i play it alone when non of my friends are available or even get to the point to gift it to people so they play with me

#####

we tried to play coop with 4 people and constantly got network errors
dont buy if you want to play online

#####

my wife likes playing

#####

the best overcooked experience if you dont own 1 and 2 buy this one if you do own them like me im not sure it is worth it all you can eat edition brings only 7 new levels on the other hand developers promised free content update later this year

#####

reaalllyyyy laggy when it comes to playing on pc online multiplayer with my friend  didnt have the same issues with overcooked 2 so its kind of disappointing  ridiculous doesnt seem worth the purchase

#####

content could be included in the season pass what about people that already owned both games and all the dlcs

#####

 must play with a friend
 you need a strong friend relationship

#####

this game has an uncapped framerate and for me it was the reason why my game was crashing frequently i had to go into my graphics cards control panel to manually lower the max framerate every time i wanted to play this game lol
also trying to lower the display resolution or graphics quality via the ingame settings was pointless as that would just let it pump out hundreds or thousands of more useless frames


also when i first started playing this game i had some issues with crossplay with three other friends that were on the ps5 version that lasted a few days but it seems like it isnt an issue anymore

scores for completed levels are still weird sometimes and say   for some friends even though they do actually have credit on their end another friend lost all of their for completing 5 of the levels in the dlc after our session

all in all games good 40 good eh maybe but you and your friends will probably get tired of the game before you even go through all of the dlc

it looks kinda greedy to ask players who already bought overcooked 1 and 2 to buy this updated version for almost 40 bucks
why is there no cheaper upgrade option available
so many other games let you simply upgrade your standart version of a game to the newerbundle version
some even give the new version out for free to players who own the base game
so wth is this
doesnt make any sense to previous players

#####

unfortunately as a big fan of team17 and most of their games including owning both overcooked 1  2 this game is too glitchy to play with friends



#####

absolutely love the game ive been playing largely using the assist mode this allows you to control 2 cooks which can help alot when one of you needs chopping done whilst something is cooking and you dont have anyone to play with its fun as single player but where it really opens up is with the multi player where everything just descends into chaos 
i would recommend using a controller i use a switch pro which makes it feel alot easier

#####

这个游戏的初衷就是为了联机和好有享受友尽或者合作的好游戏 但是我与我好友联机时甚至没有跨平台都无法连上 十分可惜现在只能把它放文件夹里吃灰了 希望游戏制作组能尽快解决这个问题 因为不只有我一个人在等带着个问题的修复 毕竟这个游戏现在只出来不到两个月
i buy this game during the time that is on sale and recommended by my friend after the series of wasting time for trying to connect with my friend the basic problem is online connection is terrible that even dont allow same platform contact i hope the company could fix this problem immediately not only me and my friends expectations most of customers have this sort of problem accordingly i choose to send the negative comment to let the team made this game to see this comment because the negative comment is more obvious and valuable to espy and peruse that is so pity which it only can sediment inside the storage right now

#####

love it clearly having played daily since 2020

#####

i would totally recommend this game to other players i didnt play it in solo mode yetbut together with my boyfriend and it was so much fun we laughed alot during this game and even tho sometimes it was quite frustrating to not get the 3 stars at first with some practice it was totally makeablebut on the other hand it wasnt boring at all to play the levels over and over again till we made it its a game where you can have fun together and in which you really rely on each other plus we arent even finished yet tbh because you can actually try getting 4 stars after the story so it wont be easy for us anyway i hope ya all can give this game a shot and have also a lot of funny moments within this game

#####

yes i recommend this game but there are issues  best to wait for a sale or for the bugs to be fixed  they seem to be having issues getting controllers working right  mine was fine at first then broken with patch 1 but could be refixed by enabling xbox controller in big picture mode  seems like they put their b team on porting ayce to steam



super fun time management game  i 3starred overcooked 1 and 2 on the switch but never went back and completed 4stars once that was released  im super excited to play this again with 60 fps since the switch tended to dip below 30 fps  when playing solo its a very stressful game  some of those time limits are incredibly challenging and one wrong move can ruin an entire level

#####

i recently completed all levels on this game with 3 start with a friend and we then proceeded to get all the achievements i really love overcooked and this was a blast to play through but one this i feel i need to mention is that in my opinion the quality of the dlcside campaigns fluctuates a lot some are really good and some id rather not have played
all in all 45 good minor issues keep it back from being a 55 but i love it all the same

#####

overcooked ayce is a shameless cashgrab 

this game has very little justification for its price tag overcookedayce is a combination of the previous two overcooked games with one dlc added into the mix they couldnt even be bothered to add the throwing mechanic into overcooked 1 

team17 is quickly turning a once promising franchise into a piggy bank to make up for their lack of creativity in the past years do not buy this game

#####

overcooked all you can eat packaged overcooked 1 overcooked 2 together and some dlcs from both previous games however this game all you can eat does not have a new story campaign for its own definitely this game is a waste of money and it does no justice for the fans that owned the previous overcooked 1 and 2 sure if you have not owned any overcooked games before then this is a good deal for you but this is a cash grab and a let down to their fans

#####

aaaaaaa

#####

i played both overcooked games previously with friends so please ignore the low playtime this game is a true test of friendship grit stress tolerance the ability to improvise multitasking and frontal lobe development i dont work in human resources but this looks way better than any teamwork exercise the soundtrack is charming and you have lots of characters to choose from try to get your friends to play it with you though ideally the ones without anger managent issues or the ones more prone to giving up easily and it will be worth it

#####

cant play with friends wtf

#####

its very funn because the dlcs all there no need to buy it again but maybe its to fix the online coop bcs often cannot joining other session

#####

fun game but absolutely trash connection  when i try crossplay with friends the game says connection failed and we all get kicked no matter who hosts honestly love the game otherwise just practically cant play it with friends

#####

the game keeps crashing over and over again i cant play with my friends i have an rtx 3060 and ryzen 5 2600 32gb of ram i tried updating the drivers but still nothing not even the steam tool to check the integrity could do anything

#####

i have been holding off on this because of the disconnects and unable to play with friends reviews

well it was half off on xbox and a friend grabbed it there so i bought it here on steam and we played together no problems at all even crossplay 

as someone who has couch cooped the first 2 all the way through in the past i am very excited to play through again and see the extra levels

#####

if you own 1 and 2 already you shouldnt have to pay 40 for what is basically a few quality of life updates should have absolutely gotten this for free

#####

firstly this is a bundle of both overcooked 1 and 2 along with their dlcs and a few extra maps

after having just finished the overcooked 1 portion i gotta say not worth it   it was nice to play overcooked 1 online  until the online didnt work   whatever they did with the connectivity is a hot mess and the lag as well as the several times we got disconnected from each other was less than appealing

if youre playing this alone or locally maybe its worth the money to you but if youre playing online stick to overcooked 2 and its dlcs   

hopefully they fix the connectivity on this game but until they do i cant consider this as much more than a cash grab

#####

lots of fun  especially with coop play

#####

claims to be the ultimate overcooked experience and more or less delivers on that for me so far it has everything the first two games contained plus a smattering of new levels and for the first time in the series offers crossplay between consoles and pc

the remastering of the levels from overcooked 1 to bring them visually inline with 2 is pretty much perfect they look great and the new graphical flourishes do nothing to interfere with the gameplay couldnt really ask for it to be done any better ive seen some complaints they dont go a step further and add in gameplay changes from the sequel namely throwing items around but playing it for a half hour will pretty quickly make it apparent that doing so would break the balance as a lot of the levels are built entirely around the players not having a simple way to pass ingredients or objects to eachother across any sort of obstaclesdistance 

have yet to dig into 2s levels beyond a quick glance to see how it looked versus the first games ones and havent gotten to the new ones yet either  but looking forward to tackling both after im done 3starring everything in 1 with my friends 

the crossplay is the one point of contention ive had so far with this remaster collection while it isnt anywhere near broken for me as others have reported it to be for them i and my friends are playing with a mixture of switch and pc players and have had one or two odd issues so far where a loading screen before returning to the main menu will seemingly get stuck and require a restart im not sure if this is an issue with the multiplayer specifically or some other issue with one of our connections that catches everyone else in the party when it happens but i didnt see it while i was tooling around with the game solo overall though its been reasonably stable and smooth once were all in a game together  so i can deal with the odd hiccup that might not even be down to the game specifically 

strongly recommend this for anyone who wants a prettier version of overcooked 1 a compilation of 2 with all the dlc and a way to play overcooked with their friends on consoles

#####

not having the previous games i have no complaints that others who bought the previous games might have  i do however have the problem of having turned into my mother when playing computer games  how is it my teenage daughter who doesnt play computer games much can be a master at this in such a short time while i spend half of the time of each level just trying to work out what on earth is going on i hate getting old

#####

im really sad to leave a poor review on this because i love the overcooked series but steam multiplayer does not work on this game campaign mode cannot be played with multiplayer at all it crashes as soon as the first level begins we tried this multiple times with different players hosting  it lets you join the session plays the intro cutscene and crashes as soon as the countdown finishes every time 

multiplayer does work on arcade mode but it crashes every time a nonhost player dies in a level specifically when they respawn the host can die and respawn with no issue but other players cant i do not recommend getting this game if you plan to play with online multiplayer at least until they implement a patch

edit  on 47 i received a developer response saying these issues had been fixed however as of today 520 i am still experiencing the exact same issues outlined above

#####

one of the best coop games its very fun and unique

#####

very fun game when you have your friends or family down to play worth it

#####

we can toss food at each other

#####

server very poor

#####

really nice game fun and hard enough to keep you playing for hours
i recommend binding the actions chop  throw  pick  dash in some other keys im using left up and right arrows respectively so its easier to play its in the same order as it would be on a playstation controller  square x circle
also kids love this game so its a good option to choose for a family game night
or to play along with friends over discord its really funny
communication is a must its like youre really working in a restaurant kitchen
im just finding the online play a bit buggy when my chef is next to another one it kinda teleports to a square around the other person
still overall really great game ive been waiting for this version with crossplatform feature to be launched for several months now and im not disappointed even with this bit of a pricey tag
super worth it

#####

excellent game ever had

#####

online multiplayer does not work

#####

even after seeing all the bad reviews the game has i went up and bought it anyway because ive had such a good experience with the first and second games unfortunately the bad reviews are well founded the online modes are bugged and ive had to discover a quirk that allowed me to play with another person if i invited or were invited to play the message never arrived so you have to agree on a time so when the host sends the invitation and the game is being created the other person join through steam and only then the message that you were invited show up and the problem doesnt end there the connection is not good everyone plays with some kind of delay that makes the experience of missions on ice for example pretty subpar when compared to the second game multiplayer i didnt try remote play but i dont suppose that even if it works well the other problems should be excused because of it

overcooked is what made couch coop games big again overcooked all you can eat brings you the first the second and all its dlcs in one game

everyone reading this probably knows what overcooked is about but if not you and up to three friends need to work together to cook as fast as possible there are dozens of different receipts and several machines to use you need to take care of cutting vegetables cooking deep fry baking dish out the food wash the dishes and a lot more at the same time or shortly one after another

h1time h1
is everything since you wont have a lot of it costumers will get angry quickly which means if you need too much time you will lose points to advance in the story and unlock new levels you need a certain amount of stars similar to games like crash bandicoot

h1communicationh1
well i said time is everything but in fact communication is everything if you cant communicate well enough you wont be successful as a team overcooked is what games like uno and monopoly were before you will scream at each other and get angry but the main difference is if you are successful in the end all of this will be forgotten if you arent successful this could be the last time you saw your friend 

h1contenth1
there are over 200 levels and over 80 different cooks they just differ in looks with a playtime of around 20 hours more if you want four stars in every level or play against each other there is enough to do 
they are also adding more free content such as cooks and levels the next update will be in august 

h1different ways to playh1
you can play online with friends or strangers on different consoles together on your couch invite friends through remote play they dont need to own the game and use keyboards all kinds of controllers or the steam remote app you can even decide to share one controller with a friend this way everything gets even more confusing 

h1online multiplayerh1
i did try to play online but found no other players i also read several times now that there is a bug and you cant even play online i cant say for sure but you should know before buying it especially if you intend to play online 

h1difference compared to the base gamesh1
a higher resolution more fps the graphics got updates especially the first game new cooks and a few new levels thats about it 

h1conclusionh1
overcooked all you can eat is everything youre looking for if you want a couch coop game it has a lot of content still gets free updates is playable in different ways and is just fun overall its the best of its genre a masterpiece 
but be careful if you want to play online with a friend on a different console wait for more updates as it seems that this is bugged right now if you want to play online via steam you can use the remote play feature instead of the online lobby 
also if you already own the base games there is really no need to buy this one

otherwise i definitely recommend getting this if youre looking for a couch coop game it regularly gets on sale

with my gf we love this franchise it helped us to survive the quarantine and to strengthen our relationship  so we got excited when we knew that this version would be on steam we planed yesterday as overcooked day and prepared snacks for the ocasion 

and so far we are enjoying the game a lot

the critics about the content and the price are true but as someone said before it is a great excuse to replay overcoocked 1 we were expecting a newer version of the  final battle against the meatball and we got it so we are playing to get there 

one of the problems are the transitions the ones in the original games are pleasing and caracteristic by their absence this ones feels rough

if you have a partner to play buy it better with controllers





#####

if you want to play single player it is a fine game but literally every game i tried to play with friends one of us wouldnt be able to play a few times we managed to all get into a lobby but be kicked once again once we finished a mission overall extremely frustrating and would not recommend you bother with it until they fix their servers

#####

i need more levels and if i could choose more thinking and less running around like an idiot

#####

overcooked all you can eat blends adorable graphics with frantic gameplay in a cooperative culinary experience the 4k upgrade and inclusion of all levels from overcooked and overcooked 2 provide a visual feast and endless challenges the multiplayer mode shines demanding coordination and communication to conquer deliciously chaotic levels with an impressive array of kitchens and chefs this package is perfect for those seeking fun chaos and teamwork on a single plate get ready for an addictive culinary madness

#####

i have to revoke my previous review i was clearly seeing this game and the company responsible for it through rosetinted glasses and after the way the staff members on the official discord server have conducted themselves i cannot in good conscience recommend that anyone purchase this game

it pains me to write this review i have been very passionate about this franchise for multiple years now and i would think that my hours logged in the second game would serve as testament to that i dont think i can give these people the benefit of the doubt anymore though theyve been making anticonsumer decisions ever since this packaged bundle was announced for nextgen consoles last year and theres a good chance that most of the more egregious negative reviews arent too far of a stretch from the truth

if i had to give an unbiased opinion its worth buying on sale its worth it if you just want some casual mindless fun with your friends for a little while although youd be better off buying the original games instead of hoping that this package deal will work since even a year after its release people are still struggling to connect to their friends its not worth it if you are passionate about the games you play and there are countless better options on the market if you want to get true mileage out of your games

#####

the perfect local coop

#####

the game is unplayable if you want to play with friends online constant disconnects

#####

so contentwise i love overcooked 12 i have played both games with friends and am always looking forward to content updates this game unfortunately is not optimized for pc controller play i have never had this issue with overcooked 2 so when it felt like my character was moving through sand on screen i was really disappointed my character will slide without me moving it glitches all over the screen and just in general has zero accuracy when trying to placechopthrow anything i am so confused as to how this came after overcooked 2 which has just been a fantastic experience i understand it is basically a combination of the two games but clearly something was done right with oc2 that was just not implemented in all you can eat it needs to be fixed because this is an absolute chore to play with friends

edit 10152022
so this game has gotten better since its first launch although it has never played as smoothly as oc2 did which still baffles me this recent update world food festival really feels like it was not properly played through before release i dont play solo so all my experiences come from both hosting as well as joining my friends game we tested both to see if the issues were lagrelated or game related we played through all levels once to 3 star and then again to 4 star and the issues were consistent through each playthrough this update has ridiculous bugs that i have never experiences on any other level
1 our characters frequently dropping or throwing food without prompt and i mean frequently
2 in 12 specifically the amount of times items were dropped or thrown was ridiculous thought it might have something to do with the stairs
3 collision with other characters as well as fire was ridiculously exaggerated simply bumping into a player would throw them off the map and cause a respawn even if we were nowhere near an area on the map we could fall 12 get kicked from the sink area to the water 13 from multiple areas
4 on 31  32 the score system and stars are screwed show 0 and what you score doesnt matter you get 3 or 4 stars without actually getting a high score tested does not show you what score you have to get to reach each star at the start of the level either
5 on 34 specifically the delivery guy is just stuck doesnt move and his box is not reachable we tried throwing the items into the box to get something to happen but the box looked bugged too so we gave up and played around the delivery guy
6 this is minor compared to everything else but emoting was bugged and players couldnt hear their own character emote 12 the time

i look forward to every update because i genuinely enjoy this game and the games that have come before it these kinds of bugs make playing very hard to enjoy though and i honestly expect oc2 level gameplay given it clearly worked well

#####

i cant even connect with my friends and play together i own all you can eat and they have overcooked 2 but even if i chose overcooked 2 we cant play its why i bought this game 

#####

i had such high hopes for this game i love the overcooked series and i played both original games to completion they were so much fun that when i saw this game on the store page i bought it immediately 

unfortunately while the game itself keeps the magic of the originals and even adds some really fun new worlds and content the connectivity issues make this game absolutely unplayable my friends and i were disconnecting constantly and one of the worlds just straight up would not work after experiencing these issues i browsed the reviews and forums and this is a very common issue and has been a problem since release it certainly seems like team17 has no plans to fix this game and its server issues

while there is lots of fun to be had i would recommend just buying the two original games and skipping this one its more trouble than its worth

#####

guess you could play it solo but its fun with friends 

#####

stay away if you plan to play with a friend online waste of money team17 could not fix the problem

#####

for all of those scared about internet connections ive been playing story mode with my friend from canada and weve had zero connection issues and they havent complained about any issues regarding lag or latency weve gone through all of overcooked 1 and are now about a quarter of the way through the second one without issues 

the game also runs beautifully and looks great great bundle with all the goodies for those who dont own the first two games separately

#####

it has no widescreen support even know feature has constantly been asked since 2015
because of that steam link new big picture on tv can display only in micro screen14 of your tv actual screen maybe smaller
also multiplayer still dont work

#####

quite pricey if you own the originals but ive had no trouble with controller support and the matchmaking and net code works a treat  if youve not played these games before or just want a hasslefree way to play overcooked over the internet its a pretty fun romp  pretty basic gameplay loop so i would recommend a friend so you can laugh at each other fumbling around

#####

the online game is so laggy

#####

great game to play with friends and family this game includes the previous parts overcooked 1 and 2 along with additional new maps as well

#####

if youre going to play with friends make sure its not sofadasafa

#####

the perfect 4person couch coop game for the family besides moving out there really arent many games out there that offer a comparable coop experience fun frantic and colourful whats not to like

the steep price point for starters this might come off as salt in the wound for longtime overcooked franchise players who have invested substantially into purchasing all of the dlc which is included in this edition the devspublisher should really consider providing a discount for such fans edit they just announced an upgrade scheme for overcooked 2 owners

for everyone else though i think this is the definitive overcooked experience and is a worthwhile purchase although i own the two previous titles as i didnt purchase the dlcs i still found overcooked all you can eat to be a great value

#####

will preface by saying i love this franchise and have bought each game and dlc prior on both ps4 and steam so bias laid bare to the review

if youve never played overcooked before this is an incredible deal at 40 for all the content over 200 levels with couch or online coop for up to 4 players as well as crossplay with other platforms its quite fun for both casual party play and the more hardcore competitive end has a scene as well overcookedgreenydev tracks high scores and the overcooked league discord hosts nostakes tournaments to test your skill against other teams in a somewhat live sense

if you have played every overcooked game and dlc prior to this it may be hard to justify the price tag what you add is online play for oc1 levels more chefs to play as 7 brand new levels somewhat better load times and having everything in one package i got a 15 dicount for owning all prior content while not much with how much play time ive gotten out of the series thus far i was happy to support the dev more so use your best judgement if the moderate convenience improvement is worth it to you

there are currently some bugs that need working out with connectivity though my personal experience hasnt been a dealbreaker hopefully these will be fixed in the future

another issue i hear of is bad controller support i personally run 8bitdo with my ps4 controller emulated as a 360 controller and have no issues with that id do some research on it depending on your setup

overall while theres some launch issues i still highly recommend this game

#####

if you like party games this game is for you this new game of overcooked allow to play in local multiplayer or online with people around the globe you can play overcooked 1 and 2 with this game the graphics improvements are really nice the new feature of crossplay allow you to play with other players in other console which is really nice feature to have more fun playing online

#####

after the update i cant even play online anymore waste of money

#####

phenomenal coop game that is a possible friendshiprelationship killer and i enjoy every second of it

its crazy fast paced frustrating exhilarating super fun hectic and just what i needed in my life

communication is your best friend and can help make sure everyone is on the same page and so everything can run smoothly

the controls for pc are a must tweak because it was pretty hard with default controls my fiancee and i use left mouse for pickupdrop and right mouse clicking for doing tasks

aside from that its super fun its chaotic in a good way and once you learn the mechanics it can be a huge blast

id give it a 910


#####

so youll see some review that dont recommend this game due to bugs or whatever i have been playing this great
game for a few hours now and i havent experienced any issues well besides my own skill issues i will note this
game is way better multiplayer so make sure you have someone that will play this with you so if you dont have anyone to play this with it might not be as fun for you but its still a amazing game

#####

so much chaotic fun great test of coordination challenging but not overly frustrating

#####

loved the game

#####

yumma 

1010

#####

i need plates

#####

devs abandoned this version due to low sales due to scamming 40 out of customers who owned every single previous level

editing my review to let everyone know  there has been zero content added since the dev replied to this review this has to be a scam right theres no way they are working on the game still with zero actual updates to the game in 6 months since they last replied to me insanity

#####

so much swearing and chaos but what do you expect even gordon ramsay cant do shit if he does cooking in overcookeds stages 

true hells kitchen

#####

it is a challenge especially when you add more people

#####

as someone who only owned the first game i find this remakererelease to be an awesome little collection you get the first and second game plus all of the dlc for both for a lower price than overcooked 2 plus all of its dlc on steam right now i always enjoyed the first game so its nice to be able to play through it again with friends online this time around this game can definitely be stressful but you know what they say about kitchens and heat would recommend for fans of couch coop

#####

love all these freaking games

#####

i have overcooked 1 and 2 on three different platforms while this game doesnt add much if you have already beaten those first two there are a few new levels and updates i recommend this for die hard overcooked fans or people who do not already own 1 and 2 however i cannot get enough overcooked so i will take any updates i can get

#####

super fun to play with my partners and friends definitely creates the fun kind of chaos

#####

very good very much worth it if you dont own overcooked 1  2

#####



#####

aaaaaaaa esse jogo é maravilhoso divertido com os amigos super coop podendo jogar online ou mesmo dividindo a tela sendo possível até 4 pessoas jogando ao mesmo tempo o jogo é uma loucura dividindo entre momentos de gritaria e desespero cadê não tem prato alguém lava o pratoooo haiodsfhos e momentos engraçados é preciso criar estratégias e organização entre as pessoas para que cada um faça um papel específico para não perder os pedidos super divertido nessa edição contém os overcooked 1 o 2 e as dlcs recomendo

#####

i am a one star chef

#####

i bought the game with the loyalty discount it works just fine i use an xbox 360 controller connected wirelessly to a usb receiver with no problems whatsoever i see a bunch of bad reviews because people cant figure out how to use controllers the game looks beautiful theyve updated all the graphics and even some levels have added new surprise effects that i wont spoil there are a ton of chefs to pick from all in one easy to pick from menu the ability to find people online is amazing but maybe a bit slow the voice chat feature looks great but i havent talked to anyone yet ill have to test that out further the ability to find players online for overcooked original is fantastic i play the game on pc and i played with my friends that have it on the nintendo switch and there were no issues other than some moments of server lag im hoping and thinking they will get that tidied up overall i see no reason to bomb negative reviews just because controllers wont connect the game just released and every game has issues on release give the devs time and this game will become amazing i can tell that its off to a pretty good start already so thank you team 17 keep up the good work

#####

this is a great and funny game but unfortunately requires a lot of improvement in becoming a more stable experience specially in regards to network i noticed in the discussions from users also having issues but unfortunately i just noticed that after purchasing i tried it in different computers different isp and routers same thing
i hope the steam team can help us out by providing decent support or refund otherwise please remove from steam store until team17 fixes all gamers complaints reported in the discussions


#####

the other reviews basically summed up what i wanted to say this is nothing new other than putting 2 games and past extra freebies into 1 game and reselling it not worth buying if you own the other 2 versions already and really shouldnt be buying this at all because we dont want them to think oh people are stupid enough to buy this again lets do more of these remaster it encourage shady business practice

#####

nice to have a game that you can play with anybody no matter their taste or preference

#####

its the best overcook can offer just make sure you have a good pc as its way more demanding than the two previous games

#####

the game is so unresponsive that its pretty much unplayable online i am constantly missing plates and ingredients like i never have before in the previous games some levels are better with how they run and some i am just glitching across the screen completely unable to complete the round

i go this on sale for 60 off and i would still say that it is not worth the money

#####

glitchy and laggy i dont know what they messed up in this version but it feels really bad to play

#####

free for a day so i gave it a try one of the buttons on my controller did not work despite it working perfectly fine the picking up of food using my controller was buggy somehow worked sometimes only

 my friend using a keyboard was not able to chop either with the ctrl button very buggy and unstable

#####

first off this game is really only for people who dont have the majority of overcooked content as well for people who really dont care about the price though i do recommend getting the game on sale 

overcooked is an amazing game it forces you to cooperate with your friends through 200 transforming and challenging kitchens the game tries not to become overly repetitive by constantly offering new and unique mechanics like new recipes and environmental switches though the game can get a little repetitive at times
though if you do plan on doing multiplayer be a little cautious as while it hasnt screwed up yet for me it has for many other people
in all unless you already have most of the overcooked content out there the game is definitely worth it to me its a solid 9510

#####

fun with friends contains both the first and the second game as well as added extras

#####

the game continually disconnects when playing with 3 players in campaign mode there are so many reviews forums and posts stating that many people have this same issue for years now just crazy that a 20 game bugs out and no fixes have been implemented would be a great game if it were reliable clearing caches verifying integrity of files etc does not work so lame

#####

multiplayer buggy as a mf major money grab for making the price 40 and having terrible servers

#####

if you search for an ideal game to play with your friends at a game night
overcooked never disappoints from chill gameplays to intense moments
i am sure everyone will love it i was playing overcooked in the friends house
for a long time and i decided to buy it myself

looking forward for upcoming updates

#####

improved version of both overcooked 1 and 2 better graphics and more content to play  
however this game is not keyboard friendly and favors controller 

#####

非常好的做饭游戏使我的血压升高爱来自刘海飞天吗喽

#####

made me lovehate my friends and fiance

#####

love the cross play this game is a staple for my friend group now

#####

i have already 4starred all these levels but now its allyoucaneat so i have to do it again no ragrets

#####

its pretty good

#####

been a fan not anymore will not pay again for the same content since ive already own the other two previous version

#####

weve already blown through all the levels  addicted  make another one and do desserts

#####

an awesome game to play with friends

#####

local coop doesnt work there are bugs in the dlc that werent there originally on overcooked 2 gonna stick to predecessor until the eventual overcooked 3 is out

#####

this game is broken i bought this game to try and play with my friend in the us im in australia and we had trouble friending each other im on a laptop and hes on an xbox we couldnt invite each other at all and it kept saying that he was offline and i wasnt in his friends list even though we sent friend requests about 10 times please fix this overcooked i now regret buying this game 

#####

great for partners

#####

i was about to thumb up this game but i just realised that they changed the sale discount they used to offer 20 plus 40 off which worked out to 90 off if you owned overcooked 1 or 2 now the offer doesnt stack with the discount what a terrible developer if you make a mistake own up to it dont be a cuck about it

#####

i have both games and all dlc now what   i was looking forward to more content but really only have a few options better graphics but not worth buying and having two games of both and you cant play with people who only have overcooked 1 or overcooked 2 you can only play with people who have this game

#####

made my wife burst out laughing when orders failed 
overall a fun game

#####

great game very awesome to play with friends i love when we all yell at each other d

#####

this game is a blast i have restaurant experience irl and my siblings do not we are cackling the whole time im pretty sure one of them watched one episode of the bear so they know all the lingo we have learned how to cry in the walk in together and it has been an absolute ball i love this game so much because not only is it a fun little game that is really well put together but it is a way that as adults we can play video games together like we are 12 again 3

#####

i cant use my controller please fix this issue asap

#####

fast paced team work game challenge your friends and work together to complete orders

#####

definitely worth a buy if youve not played overcooked 1 and 2 but maybe give it a miss if you have includes few extra levels which really should have been released as dlc for overcooked 2 but definitely not worth the price if youre just buying to play these 

still its a solid game so i will recommend but please use some discretion when buying

#####

my friends and i love playing overcooked 2 together its chaos in the kitchen as i call it having both games and all the dlc together in one place is amazing also due to overcooked 1 being a local multiplayer only we can now go back and see what it was like

#####

hardly any new content not recommended for people who have played 1  2 however if you havent then this version is for you looking forward to updates for new dlc took less than 2 hours of gameplay to complete 12 new levels and birthday free update

#####

i have played both oc overcooked and oc2 and i have just tried this game up until oc level 41 will be playing again later call me lonely but i have been playing solo since oc and up until now i dont really mind about crossmultiplayer and online matchmaking for now probably gonna change my mind once the devs improve this system

if you really love and support oc as well as enjoy solo play like me then this is the game to go people say its expensive but im pretty sure the devs will work hard on the updates and patches plus i remember that there will be 5 free updates this year i really hope thats the case though lol the game may not worth it for now but if the devs kept their promise and work hard for the players this game will worth the expensive price in the future given that the price is kept fixed if the devs raised the price though after free updates thats messed up lol but at least you dont have to bear higher price if you buy this game now

one thing though i noticed that this game causes my laptop to overheat easily the first time i played this game 2 months ago my laptop overheated like crazy it went shut down by itself with a weird sound of charge i couldnt turn on my laptop so i had to let it cool down before charging the battery which gives the same weird sound and finally be able to turn on my laptop i have never met with this issue whenever i play another 3d game a game between 4060 players which i currently and actively play

i have to ask my friends help to optimize the performance so that i can play this game nicely as for now i have not met with such problem ever since the performance is optimized but the overheating issue from this game is still my concern i wonder how my laptop will be able to withstand the heat once i reach the final level pro tip turn on the vsync so that the fps stays fixed i reckon that variable fps during gameplay is one of the factors of this issue

i really hope that the devs do something about this overheating issue to the devs make sure that this game really worth the high price 

pros
better graphics and ui
you dont have to buy dlcs from oc and oc2 to play them
the camera doesnt zoom in even if you play solo a huge problem in original oc

cons
crossplay and matchmaking doesnt work not that youll mind if you play solo lol
you wont get certain achievements if you play solo 
overheating issue

tldr if you support overcooked usually plays solo and have decent gaming computer go for it may not worth it for now but it will in the future

update i have just bought myself a gaming pc and i have enjoyed this game a lot of course i play other games as well but i really enjoyed the latest birthday update sure the last level is quite frustrating to get 4 stars but it is supposed to be challenging

tbh i feel sorry for overcooked team because of the recent backlash especially from twitter its kinda sad that i saw the banner changed because of that sure someone has screwed up in the making of this game or even this update sure the damage has been done but i still have faith in this game i really hope that the dev team will make things right and bring this game back to its glory days just like how my other favourite game spoilerfall guys ultimate knockoutspoiler were used to fall in popularity last year before giving great comeback with great updates this year

who runs a fucking restaurant this way fucking hell piece of shit pumpkin

#####

its such a cute game but its definitely a coop game you have to be a prodigy to be able to pass the levels on your own if you guys also dont have friends like me  you can join the overcooked discord where you can always find people to play with

#####

not even an hour in and my girlfriend gave me a migraine

#####

just great fun

#####

i bought this game because i loved overcooked 2 but couldnt play it because of the connection issues it sucks to know this game is unplayable too and all reused content save your money if you wanna use the online multiplayer feature so disappointing

#####

overcooked more like overpriced  the connection issues are super frustrating with random disconnects or the game trying to connect to twitch or go offline i loved overcooked 1 and overcooked 2 but all you can eat is disappointing the actual game was fun but the connection issues make  it unbearable to try and play

if you want to play this game with other players not stay together and use the same computeryou must defray extra cash for acceleratorit is necessarya software to make sure you and others can keep contact instead of loss the contactthe pay expenses is persistent if you want this serviceyou should pay for italthough we already had all the content about the gamebut if you want enjoy the functionstill need to do somethingthen i think it is fantastic as a cook gamethe general appearance of a picture is cuteplaying method is also interestingbut it is just my thinkingso if you do not like this gamethat is all righti have to say it is horrible we need to solve the problem about the game by ourselvesbefore the problem be seeni know nothing about it and think i can use all of the part and enjoy my time after downloadi was flurriedso somebody  said the matching mechanism is rubbishi think soit is not itself provide it for youthe truth maybe absurdno kidding
if you want to see other players personal informationyou need the software called steammaybe the requirement can be changed if you are live in different placeif you cant get into steam communityyou can have a tryeven if you used the acceleratoryou still have the chance loss the contact with othersit seem not have method to solve the problemas iif other people and you used different acceleratoryour feeling may become bad because at this time control yourself in the game will be more difficult than usual  howeveras long as the game can be playedit is enough for methe game is wicked
by the waywhen you play with others onlineat the very start somebody stay together with youmaybe onetwoor threeas long as they dont secedeyou can play with them for long time without somebody midway addyou and others can keep contact and nobody disturb yourselvesuntil somebody quiti like this truthand thats why i stay herei only like play with one person at the same timeonly with the person i like and wish become togetherjust stay along with meat this timei always be happywe can enjoy the time belong to ourselves and nobody elsethats really so warmjoyful timetook me so many sweet memories and pleasurethe game took me some funi really really like this game
actuallymaybe the longer time you stay herethe more alone you feeli just feel tired for wait and play with more than one personi knowsomething i cant acceptso i seceded ceaselessas long as its not just me and one personmany timesi doubt myselfi wasted so much time on itmaybe im wrongmaybe because of my attitudei lost so many chances to play with my friendsi dont want my friend feel awkward when other friend invite hermaybe play together is a good methodi dont want to force her to choose someoneme or anotherthats too sadi just want my friend feel happy with meno sadnessi love my friend and only expect her happybut we have to do the choiceto save myself from the bad emotioni made the choice that tell my thinking to herthats my answer for myself
im so lonelytell the truthexcept the time my friend wish me to play togetheri even dont want to open the game anymorewhen the passion disappearedthe time you play the game is too long to feel curious about its contactbecause already too familiarno more new thingsno more new feelingsthe technology is also hard to increase even i want to be stronger all the timeat this timehow to find the reason to stay hereif just for waste the timethats too sorrowful
i think the mechanism of overcooked2 is too dysmorphiait just my thinkingi just feel felicitate about this way be changed in all you can eati just think player should have chance to choose they want to play with how many person at the same timebut in overcooked2you have no choicesystem can add others to your room as long as counting downso the game is useless for me because i cant play with others with a healthy attitudei always feel sadsome people become very pleasingly affectionate about this mechanismi feel admit about thisbut i cant do thati have to refuse something instead of suffer from the paini have to do itfor protect myselfits necessary
its less happiness i acquire than i  began the gameits inevitablei knowi can accept it just like i accept the good feelings from this gamei enjoyed itso i accept it leave me tooi already played more than 1000 hoursmaybe become much more in the futuremaybe notanywayi will do something to make sure i can enjoy the gamejust like the past
i will remember these sweet memoriesthats my dreamlandi dont know my future about the gamebut i love my friend

a little midget keeps yelling at me and my friends

#####

never actually owned an overcooked game myself so i wanted to spring for this one with all the content i saw all the reviews about the servers being bad for online matches but ill give my personal experience and say ive been playing online just fine at least with one other person i havent had a single disconnection or lag spike at all matches have gone very smoothly on our ends of course this isnt the case for everyone but i recommend trying it out first

as for the game its overcooked its just as fun and chaotic as all the others ill say the movement feels slightly glitchy sometimes and my character may teleport weirdly around obstaclesother people but not bad enough to ruin the gameplay ive had lots of fun so far especially if you dont own one of the previous games give this a try

#####

hectic fun with friends play this if you want to shout at each other while you mess up all your orders and then want to try again anyway

#####

cant plate on multiple levels due to glitching and there are levels where the character or food will glitch and get stuck on the counter wouldnt recommend the all you can eat purchase

#####

this game is challenging easily played with the controller most of all fun

#####

the kitchen is actively burning and my friend is holding the fire extinguisher hostage help

#####

do you want to test your friendships and figure out which ones hate you the most
want to learn how bad at team communication you are
want to laugh as your team mate throws a dish away that you painstakingly created

this is the game for you

i personally only play this with close friends couch coop feels better than online but its still a ton of fun 

if you dont have patienceand you dont like loosing and you hate taking orders from your friends dont play this game

#####

its a really fun game to play with another depends a lot on your coordination and communication with the other person

#####

the good finallly you can play oc1 online everything looks a little more polished though for the most part oc is not a game where you have time to stare at background scenery

the bad netcode is still extremely sensitive to connection issues lasting even for even a few seconds and there is still no mechanism for a disconnected player to rejoin midgame a friend i was playing with had to get an ethernet cable just for this game because we couldnt complete the longer final level without connection dropping

if youve only played through one of oc games this is a good way to play through the other one

if youve already played through both oc games and want something new this doesnt add that much  id recommend playing some of the other games in subgenre like keywe or plateup first

#####

this game is so fun i love the style and how goofy it just is its a lot of fun to play with friends and does present a fairly difficult challenge considering everybody has to work together i love this game
