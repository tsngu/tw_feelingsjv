takedown red sabre was supposed to revive the tactical shooter genre but it failed miserably after the publisher forced the developers to release the game before it was anywhere near finished the game had initially gotten over 221000 from kickstarter supporters but the final product wasnt anything like the developers had envisioned this game was launched before it was anywhere near completed by the companys own admission in a cash grab by the publisher do not buy it the company has moved on to new projects like epsilon and this game is no longer supported meaning that the developers do not intend to release further patches or content for it

a summary of the situation is below

do you like ultra hardcore realistic tactical shooters that border on masochistic giving you the ability to pretend youre a military genius capable of clearing an entire room of enemies with a single bullet ricocheting off walls

dont get this game buggy unresponsive and downright crap the ai is barely functional and has the incredible ability to spot and kill you through walls constantly moving a single step even crouched can alert an entire map to your position endlessly trawling through dull drab environments looking for the solitary last enemy alive only to be sniped with a pistol through several brick walls across the map is not fun dropping an action man in to a blender and recording it in slowmotion is definitely more fun than this save your 399 for anything else

not literally anything

so i got this game as a gift recently  even as a free gift from a friend this game is not worth playing
giving your friend a gift of this game is akin to giving him a boxed present that is filled to the brim with droppings from a variety of different animals combined
where can one begin on a game of so many failed things
the controls are stiff and uncomfortable to start off  think rainbow six except not good  movement is a chore and no matter how slow you move the ai seems to detect you through eight layers of concrete and steel without problem even though you are making no noise on your end  the disconnect between what you hear and what the enemies can hear is severely disruptive  you can move faster but it does not help nor is it advised  you will always run straight into one of the ai juggernauts i will cover shortly  the gunplay is abhorrent barely tolerable every weapon feels handles and operates the same way no differentiation between firearms and are thoroughly  unenjoyable to use or fire  the sounds are bland stock generic   etc  any word you can imagine to describe forgettable sounds applies here  i cant think of a single sound that made me feel immersed excited thrilled or anything you would want to feel about sound  the sound design in this game is on par with rainbow six  that game came out in 1998  
and so we get to the most offensive part of this game the ai  the enemy ai if you would even stoop so low to call it that is beyond unbelievable  not in the positive way either  its so bad it needs its own paragraph to discuss it  my average experience in this game upon loading a match up is seeing the first enemy in the level maybe 15 seconds in go from looking away from me to instantly rotating 90 degrees towards me in a single frame and then proceeding to headshot me from 50 feet away ending my game instantly  they will either stand still and eat bullets for you or annihilate you mercilessly and without a single modicum of realism in their actions  there is no middle ground  these are hellish terminators bent on the destruction of humankind loaded up with aimbot and wallhack software yet with nearly absent pathfinding and tactical skills  they are idiot savants who are expert marksmen yet walk into walls and freeze up upon trying to navigate the infinitely difficult obstacles of a simple wooden doorway

this is not a fun game  this is barely even a game  i have difficulty in believing that people intentionally made something this horrid  i went into this wanting to like it i truly did  it had the heritage of rainbow six and tactical squad gameplay behind it devs who wanted to do the old series justice and the potential that new technology and a fresh perspective could have brought to the genre  instead i was assaulted by an unplayable monstrosity that should have been put down by the evil scientists who created it before it broke loose from their lab
after playing a while with my friend who gifted me the game the only redeeming values i found about the entire game were these
well the models look pretty good
aw dude i can see your flashlight when you shine it  thats awesome

when the only things i can commend about your work are the above you know you have problems
i do not recommend purchasing this game  indeed if youre reading this go somewhere else for your tactical action needs  they will not be satisfied here

takedownredsabre

this game promised to bring back tactical shooters and reinvent a now dead genre needless to say that this is not the case lets break down why the game is so bad

gameplay
terrible squad and enemy artificial intelligence they spend more time shooting at walls than each other
meaningless customization three different armor types and multiple weapons that behaive exactly the same
the enemies can one shot kill you no matter where they hit you regardless of armor

interface
very difficult to traverse menus
lack of visual settings

misc
good luck setting up multiplayer for friends


now lets look at some other points 

the price is currently set at 549 cdn this is still way to much to buy this game for in fact this is a game that you should not even accept as a gift i bought 4 copies of this game for 549 total so that my friends could suffer along with me

and finally let me remind you of the awards section of the store page with my own commentary in brackets
awards

fps guru  pax prime13 most innovative
the most innovative award is yet another indie title step your game up pax one of the great things about indie games is they always manage to be unique and bring something new to the table not always good theyre able to take the risks that triple a companies arent this is a company that has made the decision to skip following the generic shooter genre lets get rid of levelsmaybe this is why there are only four maps  noob tubing and throw in tactics if by tactics they mean boredom and strategy and by strategy they mean endless buyers remorse instead serellan llc certainly deserves this award for ruining their tactical shooter takedown red sabre the name of the game also doubles as a request to valve

takedown red sabre encourages the player to communicate with their team mates by yelling at the npcs for walking into walls  and take on each mission differently in exactly the same fashion  in their hope to survive dont expect to be running and gunning down the hallways because good luck finding anyone to shoot theres no respawningapart from the fact that you turn into team mates after death its a displeasure to see a return to the tactical shooter and what appears to be an unsuccessful return once i got my hands on takedown red sabre it was difficult to stop because the menus wouldent let you

#####

this game should not be classified as a game as it is an unfinished product a later alpha at best if you have the misfortune of owning it look in the games main folder it says early access that should tell you the amount of effort alone 

the ai can range from completely stupid to unrealistically accurate the game is riddled with various menu bugs such as when you choose a level you dont always get the level you choose and in addtion the inventory system rarely saves i could never recomend this game to anyone espically when the games it clams to be based off are vastly superior even now swat 4 is a better game a 2004 game is better then this even swat 3 is better because its ai was at least competent as far as team ai goes ie checking corners by leaning

and the biggest culprit of all to this bad game is the devlopers who blame their community for not being hardcore enough they dont even have the gumption to admit their game is severely underdevloped compaired to the games they based their game off of if your thinking of buying this just dont there are at most 3 servers if you are lucky mostly none though

#####

do not buy buy insurgency instead

#####

they sold an unfinished game but advertised it as finished its really bad and it also damages similar games reputations when they are much better they did make small fixes after about a week of it being out so we could actually use the server browser but by the time it was done no one played and for good reason

do not buy
i prepurchased this pile of poo never again

#####

takedown red sabre is largely unfinished but may have potential if it was finished

as a fan of tactical fps games such as rainbow six ghost recon and arma i was excited to hear about takedown red sabre unfortunately the game failed to live upto the hype which was promised by the developers as being a realistic tactical fps in almost every area of the game its clear to see that the game was rushed with apparently no time spent whatsoever for polishing or improving the game before its release

in terms of gameplay majority of the game is actually there but its poorly implemented enemies range from being completely unaware of you to being deadly accurate the friendly ai is almost completely lacking which makes singleplayer completely unenjoyable however the games core mechanics are in fact there which means that there is a small amount of fun to be had if you choose to play the game with friends but be aware there is no way to create private matches and there are no online games available at all at the time of writing this review if you can live with some small niggles such as the unbelievably slow walking speed the fact that any height can kill you and the ai the game is playable but it just doesnt live up to what the developers promised

the level design is one of the few aspects of the game that appears to have been properly thought out with levels that feature tight hallways and open spaces which might create a tactical fps if the games mechanics were equally polished the graphics arent terrible on low settings and even lower end machines should be able to handle the game pretty easily

overall takedown red sabre is largely unfinished but might have some potential to live up to its promises if someone took the time to finish it and give it the polish it desperately needs

#####

the best thing about this game is the uninstaller works great

#####

this game had a lot of promise the concept was solid a tactical thinkingmans shooter the dream come reality in 2014 fell short compared to a game made in 2005 swat 4

my biggest complaint is the ai is embarrassing the enemy ai is oblivious it never seems to respond to sound or much of the happenings in the environment only event that causes them to spring into action is if they catch the player visually in their lineofsight additionally the animations of enemies are robotic

as for the friendly ai they are completely braindead there are no real commands you can tell them to stay and follow not look over there not stack up on this doorway not toss a flashbang in and clear nothing

i really wish this game lived up to my expectations but it didnt i cannot recommend it your time and money would be better spent on its inspirations swat 4 and rainbow six

#####

warning   do not buy 

while this game is relatively inexpensive it is priced far too high for its level of quality and should be avoided  the game was not finished prior to launch and it remains laden with bugs and missingbroken features  serellan the developer was never able to get dynamic shadows to function properly even with the help of the game engines developer so the games lighting is a bit off  physics are a joke characters do some strange things when theyre killed and ragdoll physics take over and the resulting odd behavioir is probably the only positive thing about the game because it might give you a laugh  artificial intelligence of the enemy was better than chuck norris ridiculous when the game launched and friendly ai is borked in the opposite direction effectively eliminating any sort of tactical feel to the game  it plays like a really bad knockoff of a really bad game  spend your money on something developed by someone that is capable and willing to produce a quality indie title  setting 15 on fire and watching it burn would be more entertaining and worthwhile

 note it appears the new steam tagging system is subject to heavy censorshipmoderation  every negative popular tag seems to have been scrubbed  do publishers  game developers have a say as to what tags are ok and what must be removed  i sure hope not

#####

alright okay 

hear me out 

this games got some flaws the movement is kinda clunky and the hit detection is a bit off 
but
what im trying to say here is that theres been a little bit of unfair criticism goin on here the brunt of it has been on this games ai people say its bad but ask yourself this before you count yourself among them what if this game just features the most advanced enemy morality system ever devised in a video game 
     what if that time an enemy shot your teammate then stared at you doing nothing what if he was simply at that moment being overwhelmed with the crushing reality of the fact that hed just killed a human being and you shot him in the face didnt you you didnt even think about it you chalked it up to bad ai 

     that terrorist had a name it was tom tom got up this morning just like you did put on his beret kissed his wife and kids and left for work his oldest daughter had just gotten into college it hadnt been the school shed wanted but it was closer to home and that made her father happy toms son had showandtell that day he was bringing his dads fatigues in to show off to his friends he was 8 years old 
     the terrorist drove to work just like he had every other day he said his good mornings to his colleagues clapping jim on the back he knew the man had just become a father jims wife had asked him to come home a little early to take care of their baby girl that day his mind kept wandering to his two favorite ladies back at home waiting for him 
     the sun was already bright outside not a cloud in the sky tom was the one who always took care of the plants around the office he didnt mind it brought a smile to his face just a normal thursday 
     they grabbed their bombs and headed out to their routine day of terrorism jim and tom sat around playing cards tom couldnt ever seem to win but he liked the companionable silence 

     he couldnt know what horror would soon break that silence forever

     a green eggshaped object landed on jims lap 

     jim what 

     a flash of light and a deafening boom jims arms flung apart the playing cards flying from his splayed fingers tom felt a spray of something warm spatter across his face he stared into the space where jims torso had been now a mass of ground meat as he turned mouth agape the swat team was already entering the room jims other colleagues crumpled at their feet by the door there had been no screams no chance to cry out a gunshot erupted from somewhere startling tom the sudden impact of the recoil from the gun in his hands surprised him he hadnt even remembered picking the thing up one of the swat officers jerked and toppled to the floor in a heap one last monosyllable escaping his lips tom stood there over the man mouth slightly open hed done this hed killed this person just moments earlier he had been playing cards he hadnt meant to shoot the man he looked down at the rifle in his hands so heavy so ugly tom dropped the weapon to the floor with a metallic clatter he turned toward the other officers raising his hands no i didnt mean to im sorry i didnt mean to it just 
     he would have said these things he would have been pushed to the floor and been handcuffed and gone quietly he would have sat in his prison cell thinking about his familys smiling faces haunted by the memories of his friends gone in the blink of an eye one thursday he would have done a great many things but the chance never came 

     tom never heard the shots that killed him he felt the first few rounds but not the ones after everything that hed ever known slowly drained out of the holes in the back of his head and onto the floor the scent of his mothers perfume his baptism the feeling of his wifes hair against his face tom lay half headless on the floor on that sunny thursday afternoon surrounded by the twisted figures of his friends the faint smell of smoke gradually fading from his failing brain

overall 910 game odd that theres no prone mechanic

#####

take this game down from steam second game they abandon after a few little updates serellan llc i gave you a second chance after the first screw up but it was also the last one

thank you for reading hope it was helpful

i got this game as a gift and have since stopped speaking to the person who sent it to me

the fact that they put more effort into the trailers above than they did the actual game you can see how much of a shallow money grab this really is

i got this game for free and i still feel like i deserve a refund

the reviews are more fun and interesting than the game

please takedown this game

does man deserve perfection

     such a question has been passed for centuries reaching the farthest inquiries and the sharpest of minds if man does not have perfection it will strive to one day create it such is the pursuit of happiness when pleasure takes presidence in the human mind and perfection has been sought for a millenia what beautiful creation may be spawned

 man made a gem 
     a ruby 
     a radiant pearl in the depths of sorrow and distraught
     a gleaming beacon of hope in a dark sea of dissatisfaction
     a flawless painting that picques the picassos

 man made takedown red sabre


     an enigma wrapped in golden silk takedown draws you in with its deep character customization and limitless combinations of weapons and attachments at the main menu alone i was at first overwhelmed with the flood of paths i could begin on luckily for us all the godcrafted tutorial helps to soften the blow of the numerous gamemodes and maps with a simple and stylish interface takedown takes you for a ride yet holds your hand and still kisses you during it whispering words of encouragement as it occassionally nibbles at your ear
    
     once ingame youll find the stunning realism to it all after my first kill i balled up my fist and held it over my mouth turning from the screen moisture tickled the corners of my eyes and i found myself shaking without end the sound of the bullet the scream of pain and the thud of a lifeless being left me sighing in distress for a moment i truly believed that i had taken the life of another human being 
    
     as you slowly make your way from corridor to corridor you can almost feel the weight of your armor bearing down on you your comrades are with you though and the bonds you form with one another will follow you until you exhale your last breath as time progresses you feel much like a spider spinning beautiful gossamer to create an ohso fragile web of emotions with your squadmates

     rick the stick flick is a wild card but has a soft spot when it comes to those he cares about with a family photo in his locker and his locket hes commited to those he brought into the world and gentle with the woman he loves more than himself

     feanus is emotional quick to anger but a loyal man regardless his friends come first and thats the bottom line bullets or bickering nothing will ever tear apart a bond that feanus has built up known to be a bit fiesty he keeps his pipop up on the front lines and never lets his anger interfere with whatever mission is at hand

     laffy taffy is a quiet man tired of the war hes endlessly fought both in himself and on the battlefield an honest soldier trying to get by he always seems to have a mission to be done and a task for his gun although he seems little more than a melancholy soldier laffy taffy has an easily brought out smile and a grin that can turn the world jovial again

     and then theres you will you make a name for yourself will you put your life on the line over and over again and see to it that your loved ones see tomorrow will you take arms and fight for your brothers your family and your home will you gun your way through countless murderers terrorists and thieves to rid the world of filth


to be honest you probably shouldnt

about as tactical as a brick and just as smooth

#####

honestly i hate it and i love it but that is subjective this game has too many obvious cons to let my bias tell you its good 

pros
runs fine
is fun if you like sweep and clear style gameplay something i love 
somewhat good selection of maps and objectives and modes varied
good operatorclass customisation
fun and good gunplay
good working coop
movement is ok and provides walk quick walk and run options varies in speed and avaliability with the type of armour you wear

cons
ai teammates open every door in 5 feet of them for no reason which results in an enemy on the other side turning around and gunning down the whole ai sqaud and 9910 you as well and 1010 making you so low on health you may as well restart
stealth is impossible i have walked up a staitcase crouched in silence and have enemies come running out of their rooms and shoot me while being completely behind door frames
ai enemies have aimbot and wallhacks literally they can see you even without looking at you and they can do 180 spins in one frame and lock onto you with their first shot being deadly the second one round is let off every enemy knows exactly where you are at all times even if no one has seen you for well over 10 minutes i have cleared a building and then walked into the next one 50 feet away and have an enemy waiting me me on the other side of the door pointing directly at me and shooting me before i can do anything
friendly ai is useless as anything but extra lives and will more than likely cause over half of your deaths they cant aim at all and just decide to shoot whatever whenever
your character cannot aim i have aimed directly as people and fired off 1012 shots all fully stable crouched and aimed down and have let the recoil subside after each bullet and nothing happens the only way to get a kill from further than 5 feet away is spray the ever loving crap out of them
the ridiculously skilled ai makes it so the only way to play properly is to run and gun hoping to get lucky shots in before the ai catches up 0001 seconds later
all scopes have pretty much the same zoom the sniper scopes are useful and holographic sights are good but the acog like scopes on smgs and ars are zoomed so much that one shot leaves you looking at the sky for 3 seconds and you die this paired with the awful inaccuracy of the shots that are dead on target means its impossible to use them
game has 0 online multiplayer with randoms no servers left no people online nothing
menu controls are slightly annoying and buttons sometimes dont respond or input too much
in ability to customise the whole squad for one op once your initial charcters dies you are stuck with the default rather then the loadout you have made for that class meaning undesirable weapons and an overall unpleasant experience
the leaning cancels when moving which makes it very hard to use properly
the enemies will often one shot you even when you wear heavy armour which makes the sacrifice of movement speed worthless as you die instantly anyway and encourages the run and gun playstyle the game already promotes despite its intentions being the opposite

in summary the whole game is fun but the enemies are op and the friendlies and useless and the mechanics are overall unpolished and unbalanced

#####

a friend gave me this as a joke we are not friends anymore

#####

i purchased takedown red sabre back when it was around a dollar guessing it be a capable perhaps minimalistic firstperson tactical shooter qualities i tend to occasionally enjoy and recommend but in place of an entertaining romp through room clearing and cqc i instead received an underwelming mixmatch of unfinished ideas and interesting concepts


	using takedowns spiritual predecessors the rainbow six series and swat 4 whose demos are still available online as the standards for tactical shooters red sabre falls a little short

	starting with the mission select screen the lack of a planning stage means the player is left to begin the mission blind as to the mission objective general routes and overall level design yes several vague objectives are posted in the form of a styleoversubstance video overlay but their possible locations numbers and significance are all still left unknown or murky a realistic estimation of the cloud of combat and the limitations of simple surveillance not really seeing as all three of these aspects are sensible targets of approximation during the inevitable observations that occur prior to sending in tactical teamsright a simple premission map with rough outlines and selectable routes would be wonderful as would some form of dialogue between squad and commander to answer any lingering mission details

	on the topic of missions the actual mission objectives considering red sabres apparent tactical roots are surprizingly bland and simplistic in nature echoing the desires of a standardized checklist rather than the actual swat operations they wish to emulate missing are the dynamic hostage rescues with captivecaptor dialogue and potential loss of life due to the explosive nature of such echanges even compared to the earlier swat series takedowns missions are devoid of the atmospheric tension maintained through periodic use of covnversation and ambient comments

	    then when actually playing a mission several basic capabilities are absent namely squad manipulation and regular status updates in place of a context menu or other useful method of commanding your team a simple hold toggle and roe wheel are offered both of which obfuscate the allessential room clearing as your team is always behind you in turn rendering useless the more elaborate levels with their multitude of cover and choke points as your teammates will never actually take strategic positions or utilize flanks and complicating simple matters of spacial awareness as our mates tend to vanish when not verbally announcing enemies their virtual minds dead set on maintaining unnecessary radio silence the ability to investigate both physically and visually through your squadmates rooms towers corners windows doors would be a monumental improvement as would simple formation and movement commands

	this brings into light your squads strange lack of communication yes the ai announces spotted enemies but thats seemingly the extent of their communicative ability positions actions general sidechatter are all absent replaced instead with a wall of silence and death while the latter is more a subset of mood setting and tone the former two topics of conveyance are important aspects of movement and firing maneuvers as proper placement of suppression and flanking teams must be confirmed before performance that and the awkwardness of having to spin your character around to check their periodic status when enemies are everpresent is painful the movie way of the gun provides a fun example of firefight communication as do several article by dslyecxi a founding member of armas shactac

	    lastly is a breakdown of the players ironically standard moveset given the advances in recent game design and takedowns desire to be both modern and tactical the player is limited to a digital lean without a stepout or means of truly examining corners and bends two digital stances without any real cover system nonexistent damage modeling foot shots are instakills and strangely simplified gun mechanics as stated by its own developer red sabres crippled lean was intentional but as demonstrated in ravenshield fully analog leaning and stance change are possible and with a reticule present reticules being a sensible representation of the mental focal point one references when looking around and not the fabricated gameworld only gimmick some make it out to be btw returning fire is possible so long as the weapon is locked to the view an equally sensible representation given swat behavior the application of such a system would allow for full realization of the environment window avoidance and improved surveillance aspects only improved upon by a fluid cover system one that allows at least in its most basic form temporarily full coverage from fire as shown in red orchestra and even killzone or perfect dark but in a more advanced form with some manner of controlled cover migration exemplified in games like receiver and the aforementioned orchestra gun mechanics can be rather complex without seeming overwhelming so long as theyre presented intuitively ammo checking magazine management individual component manipulation bracing have therefore all been implemented in the past and have helped in pulling player skill and concentration away from reflexes and placing them on planning and execution

	    along with several prevalent submitted glitches involving firing aiming and stance freezes i hope the above mentioned points help illuminate the fact that while not the horrid abomination some have made it out to be takedown red sabre is at its best underdeveloped and at its worst unfinished statuses that could effectively be remedied via patches andor modding

	
	looking into the history of red sabre it would seem takedowns developer serellan started a kickstarter to create a certain type of product of a certain calibre and after raising a fair amount of money over 220000 released a product of subpar qualities even after praising their own past experience and ability thats just frustrating and unprofessional

people say that this game is buggy but the unistall button works just fine

fakedown red gaybre is a game where
you fall half a metre and die of ebola and coronary heart disease
the ai brings a sniper with a scope to a cqb scenario
the terrorists are actually super mutants with super hearing who are angry at their creators cause they can sure as hell hear you creeping 3 rooms away
you have 3 speeds of travelwalkingbriskwalkingwtf and sprinting
they give you a buttload of smgs and ars but only one sniper and shotgun but who cares cause we cant tell the difference
enemy bullets are like antigoodguy bullets which will disintegrate your heavy armor and straight out kill you
you have to use task manager to quit the game
you regret buying the game eventhough you got it for free
the pistols look like they have dwarfism
you get trading cards dats cool i guess
you have a great time laughing with friends in the training missions but lose them once you start playing the actual missions
you can put flags on your armor dats cool 2 i guess
you find the motivation to be successful in life just because you dont want to end up like this game

overall buy this game as a gift for your mortal enemy and pray they dont do the same to you

#####

of my over 1000 games owned on steam library this is the only game ive ever deleted permanently from my library
as prepurchaser i even got extra copies for free to give away but i never disliked anyone enough to want to give them this atrocity

h1btakedown red sabre		 510bh1

essentially a very high potential tactical fps which unfortunately is abandoned in an alpha stage at best buy and play at your own risk

h1iintro what is takedown red sabre aboutih1
takedown red sabre is an abandoned attempt to revive the tactical fps genre that is best represented by games like swat 4 or rainbow six no not siege rainbow six 3 raven shield i say its an abandoned attempt and not a failed attempt because thats what happened and thats what it is serellan llc was a one man driven company with different collaborators that abandoned the project along the way this dude abandoned development for tdrs and started developing epsilon another abandoned attempt of the same genre

h1igraphic engine and artistic aspectsih1
tdrs runs on unreal engine 3 you definitely cant screm miracle but it doesnt look like a rushed indie essentially all levels are limited areas ranging from less a inspired subterranean base to curated and credible offices and a ship as well all in all levels are built with good attention dont mind too much that enemies are all the same identical model in all missions

h1isoundtrack themes and accompanimentsih1
besides the epic menu theme theres no music at all and thats right considering youre supposed to move cautiosly from corner to corner listening for eneimes random nonsense chat and footsteps

h1igameplay how does it workih1
as a tactical fps you can and should prepare your loadout before any mission considering a stealthier approach with a silenced gun and assault rifle or a more subtle and distant approach in open areas with a sniper rifle there are multiple combination considering assault rifles bullet proof vests and so on
main game modes are tango hunt kill every terrorist and mission which usually consists in one or multiple task such as defuse bomb or take data from servers and so on
theres no way to run and jump this is not an action maybe theres no way to jump as well im not sure this is a tactical fps so no regeneration health you cant take an entire clip of bullets before you die and enemies hear your steps an moves so be quiet and move cautiosly
of course the game can be played with a big team of players in cooperative mode a strongly recommended way to play the game to compensate games flaws with a higher number of players

h1ilast notes what doesnt workih1
a lot of things
loadout doesnt seem to always work menu is kind of messy as it doesnt seem to keep your choices if you pick them from the lobby while it keeps them if you work on them from the main menu some elements dont load at all as if they were slots of unexistent equipment
ai thats the weakest point of the game its cheap dumb and supersmart at the same time and its not because they can oneshotkill you as long as they hit you in your face thats fine a tactical shooter works that way and tdrs works like this as well in fact your bulletproof vest works in this regard kind of the problem is that they oneshotkill you from miles away nonsense and you might think theyre excessively smart and youre right and wrong at the same time because usually after this burst of intelligence they immediately get dumb as a stone to the point you can run on their face around them and they just dont know what to do sometimes they run on your face and dont know what to do they have no idea what a cover is okay the last one was too much i was expecting too much but the rest are solid points in my opinion it can be frustrating or it can be fun at the very beginning but gets frustrating in the long time

this game is terrible mechanics are shit visuals are shit ai is shit and nobody even plays at all ever so good luck trying to even find a game online save your money at 15 this is highway robbery at 150 this is a waste of 150 if this was free to play it would be a waste of your time to bother with it

110  would not ever recommend unless you paid me in which case for a few hundred dollars i might give it a 3

ps if you are wondering about my play time yes i played it for 15 minutes on this account  that was enought itme for me to get through the tutorial and play two rounds on an official server  it really doesnt take long to see how terrible it is and im sure you can tell by my review it really wasnt worth any more time

it should tell you something that the videos for this in the store page show mediocre review snippets and doctored images that arent from the game itself

#####

take down the take down

#####

well no servers no players no updates this game is dead boring and bad

#####

a buddy of mine gifted this to me

to quote ed sheeran

the worst things in life come free to us

#####

if you know a person and you hate him give him this game

#####

i got this for free almost ten years ago and i still feel like i got ripped off

#####

somehow i have over 190 hours of this game played  dont get it confused this is the worst game ever made

#####

imagine a tactical shooter that requires lots of skill and planning  one where you turn every corner slowly in fear that an enemy might be there to gun you down  imagine grouping together with friends to take over a building and complete an objective


now get off this store page and buy rainbow six siege instead

#####

i bought it because it was 099 and it seemed terrible

i was not disappointed the awfulness is great if you want a poorly made game to have a few laughs at and have fun with try this one out

1010

#####

please dont buy this game i was a kickstarter backer and feel like my money was wasted this is abandoned now and i promise you will ask for a refund i know this feels like a normal extreme hate review for a game but seriously save your money

#####

i gave this game the im not cryingtheres somthing in my eye award because it nearly brought me to tears through sheer disappointment

#####

note to see  this review in its true form go to httpwildwoodgeek2blogspotcom201403gametakedownredsabrehtml

i hate to have to give this game a bad review because a friend gave me this game for free but the game is just not good where to start first single player is a nogo because your team ai is 100 retarded they react in slowmo and always end up dead in seconds to make matters worse the enemy ai all have aimbot as soon as they see you they hit you and mainly in the head or other critical areas


this alone makes single player impossible and boring as heck the next thing you will notice is the sub par visuals and animations you walk as slow as a turtle and even when sprinting you dont go that fast once while leaning out of cover the game starting autoleaning my player left and right left and right i had to shut it down and restart for it to stop other times my screen would go red and blurry for no reason at all once again only going away when i shut the game down the weapons sound like crap and even the animation for the guns is horrible youll feel like you are shooting a paintball gun not a colt m4 carbine that the us marines use

to make matters worse the game seems to have been set up to be released in early access version but then later for some reason the devs decided to call it a day what prove do i have of this well other than the obviously unfinished gameplay there is a folder in your steamapps called takedown red sabre early access  what more prove that the devs are desperate to sell this game well with each purchase you get two copies of the game thats right two for one except the game still sucks the only way i could see this ever being a reasonable purchase is if you get it for a dollar or lowerdo yourself a favor and dont waste 1599 if you need even more prove of how bad the game is just check out the reviews on steam they aint prettyred sabre was the single biggest disappointment of the past 2 years for me  they sold an unfinished game but advertised it as finished and most of them start along the lines of stop do not buy this game  and it has a 26 metascore based on 126 reviews  seriously spare yourself the horrors of this game

#####

i am a extremely big fan of the older tactical games especially rainbow six 3 raven shield i loved that game and still do so when i found out that one of the creators was working on a new game i went nuts i told all my friends to buy it and most actually did because we had such fond memories of the older tactical shooter games that arent really being made anymore 

needless to say my friends now hate me this game lacks in every front graphically mapwise everything is very empty the gameplay itself isnt good at all technically its a mess the ai is atrocious 

please do not purchase this game

#####

playing the likes of ghost recon before it became a third person shooter rainbow six and brothers in arms i have always enjoyed a good tactical shooter this game is trash movement is way too slow grapics options are nonexistent enemy ai has near perfect aim but are infact very stupid and the game is made extremely difficult with you dying in a single hit but even then i have had enemies walk near me but i had no idea so the sound design in this game is nonexistant or broken overall this game is boring go pick up r6

#####

takedown red sabre is a swat esque first person shooter where you go through multiple levels with your team

story

takedown red sabre doesnt really have a story theres multiple levels that have no connections whatsoever levels range from clearing a radio station in the mountains or saving hostages in an overtaken container ship they give you a debrief of what needs to be done and then you are thrown in the mission thats about it honestly so if you want a story to go along with your swat escapades youre gonna have to keep looking somewhere else

graphics

takedown at moments is a horrendous looking game its honestly one of the worst looking games ive seen it at best looks like a ps2 game at times it also makes the game difficult to play in the final mission in the power plant the enemies actually blend in with the environment so what is already an insanely brutal game this issue makes it even harder

sound

the sound design is even worse sound is one of the most important aspects in a tactical shooter so when its broken beyond belief and you cant understand where the enemies are so good luck assessing the threat when you cant pinpoint enemy locations 

the gun sounds are also pathetic you use some truly powerful weaponry but in the game they sound like toy guns and theres no impact

gameplay

okay this is where we get into the nitty gritty stuff of the game as a big fan of swat 4 i was looking forward to trying out something similar considering swat 5 will never happen but sadly this game is worse than i could have ever imagined so lets go bit by bit first of all the mission structure is horrible each map is pretty big and theres a bunch of enemies around so you have to be incredibly tactical to get past these missions but the thing is no matter how tactical you are you will die in the cheapest way possible  

once the mission begins its a possibility that a single footstep will alert everybody on the map and i do mean everybody every enemy on the map knows your position and once you get close to a door get ready to get shot by hundreds of enemies that already know you are behind the door 

another thing is the health system in swat 4 your health  didnt recharge and a few well placed shots quickly took you out so you had to be smart and not rush into rooms in takedown the system is pretty much the same but it doesnt really work the health system is absolutely random and i have no idea how it works even to this day its random one time a single shot might put you down to the lowest health point possible or at times a single shot will take you out so basically you had to take out hundreds of enemies that could easily kill you in a single shot 

if youre playing solo you can also jump into your ai teammates taking control of them but sadly other than using them as your vessels they are completely worthless on the field and sometimes they make the game completely unplayable in the ship level of the game there are hostages you have to save but the thing is the ai are programmed to take out any ai thats not the swat officers so if you still have teammates and they end up in the room with the hostage they will shoot them on sight making you fail the mission so the only way to finish the mission is to go in solo and the game is literally impossible playing solo

also the enemy ai are incredibly hard to deal with they have the hearing of a hawk and once you spawn on the map they already know where you are at all times also their aim is literally point perfect so if they spot you before you do consider it a game over

verdict

takedown red sabre is a horrible game in every way shape and form the difficulty is insane and at points incredibly sadistic making it one of the hardest games ever made even though the levels are insanely short you will spend hours to figure out best ways to complete them but once you do the satisfaction never comes skip this game and dont even bother 

final rating

110 

pros
na

cons
 enemy ai is incredibly unfair
 difficulty is insanely sadistic 
 teammate ai will kill friendlies making you fail missions
 sound design is terrible

ive gotten this game for about 150 and to me its still not worth it  i see some people defending this game and it always confuses me  im all up for reviving the slow pace tactical game play but this game doesnt really offer anything good at all  the squad function is minimal only having two options for your squad  theres squad movement and squad rule of engagement with only two options for each  theres hold and follow then aggressive and defensive  just the barebones for controlling your squad  you cant tell them to throw any grenades clear rooms breach doors just barebones  also only 6 maps  it isnt much at all but at least the maps look somewhat nice  lets talk about the ai  i know that this game is suppose to be played with 3 other people but this game is absolutely dead and no one wants to play it  your teammates just stand there and get shot at  theyre absolutely useless when it counts  also all i can say about the graphics is that theyre horrible and they look like theyre from the ps2 era

from what i can say do yourself a favor and buy rainbow six 3 and you know whats sad  a game from 2003 still surpasses a game from 2013 and thats completely unacceptable

#####

whatever you do do not buy this game get a tom clancy game or arma 3 instead

#####

do you like fps tactical games are you looking for a game that

 has good grapics
 wide range of weapons grenades  more
 tactical shooter not a run  gun
 gives proper experience being part of a swat team
 has singleplayer coop and multiplayer
 great maps and a wide variety

well there is a perfect game waiting to be played by you its called counter stike global offensive and you can find that game in the link here

httpstoresteampoweredcomapp730

i hope i helped

#####

its still better than cod

#####

justjust dont

#####

its either the bots can 360 no scope you form across the map behind a wall or theyll aimlessly stare at you waiting for you to pull the trigger and end their suffering theres no inbetween

#####

to keep this review simple i will sum it up thusly
takedown red sabre was released in 2014 to revive the tactical shooter genere and yet it plays like the alpha version of rainbow 6 raven shield which was released in 2003
what r6rs did for tactical shooters setting the bar for mission planning and execution takedown fails miserably at there is no mission map no planning method no meaningful squad control only to shoot or not or hold posistion the enemy ai always sees you while your squad may see them all glass from my experience seems to be bullet proof and suppressed weapons will still draw a lot of attention i could go on but this game is pretty awful and there seems no inclination to fix it
imitation is the most sincere form of flattery but i am pretty sure that ubisoft and red storm would have rather not had this title try to emulate their well crafted game

#####

this game is an absolute masterpiece no matter what people say

it does not state it openly but this is one of the best horror games ever made bullets make almost no noise but the reloads can be heard from mars some say the reload are loud enough to communicate with aliens since the decibels are almost 1025x louder than the krakatoa volcanic eruption of 1883 

just like real life the bullets of any gun do not only the same damage but kill on a single shot no matter where they hit the hitbox of all models become a single head hitbox even if the bullet hits a toe

not only that but the walking and running sounds dont exist and are replaced with what i can only imagine the sound of a cat walking on top of a pillow 

the ai are super soldiers with late stage autism they wont be able to see you even if you stand within arms length but can snipe you with an ak from half a kilometer away

once again similar to real life skill is not a factor in this game with pure luck your jelly like atrophied arms will carry the recoil of your pistol to a loose thread hanging off of the enemies bullet proof vest and kill them instantly

the game developers understood that if they added ragdoll physics to the game it would carry this game from a 9910 to a number incomprehensible to the human brain10 

i would go as far as to say that this game created the original big bang jump starting the universe transcending space and time itself

infinity  10

#####

i was really looking forward to this title personally rainbow six rogue spear was among the first games i ever played

the game was funded on kickstarter with a goal of 200000 alas it didnt live up to its expectations

h1 takedown red sabre vs rainbow six and swat h1

first of all its not really that tactical in rainbow six and swat you could review the layout of the level before starting listen to the briefing take advice from specialists etc you would get a roaster of units to choose from  all having their portraits and biographies not only were those games tactical they were very atmospheric

in this game you are just walking around as a nameless 3d model you cannot command your teammates other than basic follow or stop you cannot switch to them you cannot even choose their loadout

honestly the only bond between these games is the fact that everybody dies easily

h1 content h1

it only offers 6 levels one of which is a tutorial level

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid192977040

as for weapons  7 primary weapons and 3 pistols

httpwwwimfdborgwikitakedown_red_sabre 

i simplified to account for all the clones

h1 issues h1

loadout customization is kind of bugged as well 

also they have this thing  every scope except for holographic has a disturbing zoom in effect whatever effect they wanted to mimic they shouldnt have its completely unnecessary and frustrating

the ai isnt that great either  neither your teammates or enemies in fact making allies follow you is not advisable you are much better using them as extra lives as for the enemy these guys while deadly can still miss at point black range

multiplayer and coop werent working for some time and when they did they game died out

h1 conclusion h1

i really think that 200000 is just not enough to fund something worthy of being called a spiritual successor to rainbow six and swat the game was made on unreal engine which requires quite a lot to license additionally they probably spent quite a lot of their budget on weapon licensing

on top of that the pricing of the game was only 15 in the end the game has too many problems that need to be fixed its not really superior to the rainbow six or swat in any way even graphical so you are better off playing the old games they really nailed that everybody dies easily part but the rest  enemy ai games depth content some game design choices not so much its very shallow and just not worth the time

#####

takedown red sabre tried to bring back the legacy of games like rainbow six 3 or swat 4 but the sad truth is that both of said games still remain much better than takedown in basically every aspect be it the controls ai maps etc
doesnt help the game is poorly optimalised despite the graphics not being especially great which is just one more reason to play rainbow six 3 instead as i believe even despite its age rs3 has aged very gracefully

#####

this is not even really a game  it just is  it exists 

it costs only a few bucks but instead of wasting it on this game go buy yourself a bag of candy or chips and youll get 10 times the fun from that instead

#####

rainbow six siege but instead of actual special warfare operators you are special education operators who cant lean and walk at the same time 1010 best vbss simulator

#####

go buy some csgo skins instead

edit why did 110 people find this funny i was being serious this game is horrible

#####

only thing working in this game is uninstaller  this game is joke pure horribleness simulator

#####

heres a quick tip if you are thinking about buying this dont

#####

me mom can we have rainbow six

mom we already have rainbow six at home

the rainbow six at home

#####

in the end takedown is simply unfinished it plays and feels like a beta and in its current state its a game that appeals to neither twitch nor tactical shooter fan perhaps when or if the bouquet of issues is patched it may indeed become the spiritual successor to rainbow six but until then this one is best if avoided

the proper way to purchase this game
you dont

#####

utter piece of buggy garbage

# movement is painfully slow
# aiming is terrible and inaccurate due to in game mouse software
# team ai is useless
# enemy ai always knows where you are and shoots you in the back out of nowhere killing you instantly
# no in game menu
# terrible options menu

#####

i remember booting this up for the first time and praying for a  mobodestroying power surge by the first 10 minutes of gameplay broken and at times outright unfair ai coupled with boring gameplay stiff controls and underwhelming graphics even by 2014s standards rainbow six siege offers a much more fullyfleshed cooperative shooter and for those wanting a singleplayer experience stick to swat 4 avoid this one like the plague

#####

i was so hyped for the game thinking it would be just like the orignal tom clancy rainbow six but it failed in many ways
game is not worth the price and it is always on sale for 1
pros
its all about being tactical
once you die you take over one of your teammates
customize your guns and equipment
small missions
can peak around corners

cons
ai literally have 100 accuracy
ai always know where you will be at once you have shot
developers have abadoned trying to fix the game
multiplayer servers do not work


#####

id rather masturbate with sandpaper 210 ign

#####

but shit it was 99cents

#####

you see this game you see this god damn game its a motherfucking masterpiece this shit is what would happen if phil fish made fez 2 instead of running off with the funds like a neckbeard fuckface he is but holy shit takedown red sabre is one of the best games ive ever played its a hardcore realistic strategy moba 3rd person hellshooter it has a lot of great features like a fantastic loadout selection of like4 motherfucking guns 4 guns for your bitch ass ever wanted to get shot by your teammate and then have him suicide in a bathroom by a grenade  no well fuck you asshole thats all you get this game may or may not be the best 350 i have ever spent

#####

this shit looks like its from 1999 i could buy 5 pieces of gum and have more fun chewing them than playing this game

#####

guys dont buy this gamenightmare

#####

dont buy it

#####

i do like this game it does have a long list of problems like surprisingly bad for a game based on unreal 3 engine the controls are clunky the ai is clumsy on pathing but very good on reacting to your sound light armor and light gun make all the difference in cqb maps because of noise more than mobilitymuzzle length the ai of your teammates is almost nonexistent and incredibly disappointing considering christian allens pedigree

the interface is godawful and forgets maps your selections every time you finish a round it appears to forget your loadout selections too but it doesnt though sometimes i select a loadout and it doesnt work

and multiplayer well no one plays this game and if you try to make coop multiplayer work youll find it wont connect without a whole lot of troubleshooting use tunngle

all that being said it is challenging the bots dont mess around with their aim and react very well to any noise you make if they dont fail at pathing when i first started playing i felt proud if i could kill 20 people before i died and without unlocks in the game it lends itself well to having this kind of challenge and not being frustrating ive had some really classic moments playing this game and it can get really intense at times

i have logged 29 hours in this game and i still havent beaten cargo ship or facility i still really like playing it

but its currently at a low price and its a great deal if you want a challenging tactical fps the bugs dont break the experience but it helps to go into the purchase expecting to get a game that feels like its still in beta

#####

remember that game you bought for a couple of bucks on sale about four years ago yeah it still sucks ass

#####

you like the swat games well imagine you are playing swat 4 with no idea how to give orders a dumb ia and zero tacticals stuff to progress

i bought it for 099 so not even worth that

#####

honestly cancer

#####

this is literally the best game i have ever played 1110 if i had to choose betwenn half life 3 and this it would be this i died once and an actual swat team came to kill me but my tactics i learned from playing the game defended me you can lean left and right enough said

#####

probably the worst game ive ever played i am embarrassed and ashamed to have this in my steam library

#####

travel around the world to exotic locales with team red sabre a team of operatives from various nations who seem to walk around at a pace no greater than your average garden variety snail as you fight terrorists with some of the smallest handguns to have ever seen production and employ real world tactics used by sof units such as hacking servers with your mind and running in blind due to lack of any premission planning

nonexistant squad ai which will call out targets and not engage despite have a clear shot from a good firing position despite having loosened the roe as well as blocking doorways and narrow corridors they cant be issued any orders either

terribad enemy ai which will pick off your ai squad members rather methodically from awkward positions as your squad never returns fire they are also know to aimbot the crap out of anyone anywhere anytime

this game is wasted potential and could have been so much better terrible singleplayer but a decent coop experience if you can get passed all the shortcomings

#####

this couldve been a good rainbow six alternative if it wasnt abandonded within 6 months after the early access release

#####

sometimes i just sit down from a long day of work and all these competitive games just seem like too much of a hassle so then i hop on here and play some tango hunt for hours and hours i still cant win the game but then i tell myself ill try again tomorrow after work

#####

this has got to be the worst fps i have ever played made by one of the most childish developers imaginable they froze threads on thier forums containing any opinions differing from their own and on the steam forums they did much of the same thing the game was released as an unplayable mess and to this day continues to be a nail in the realisticfps genres coffin i grew up loving rainbow six and swat and prefer realistic shooters to generic fps games however i cannot reccommend this to anyone it handles like a broken tricycle and has the most rediculous ai i have ever seen some moments they cannot hear your bullets whiz by them point blank and others they can pick you off with 360 no scopes stay away from this garbage the rating is there for a reason

#####

1010 goty

features

visceral accurate movement perfect quadrupleamputee speeds of up to 1 centimeter an hour
gritty bloodpumping shootouts probably i could never get to them because i was busy dying of one bullet
thousands of enemies with ai so amazing that it cannot be outhought because they see you everywere and anywhere through walls across maps through keyholes anywhere
best game ever buy now

#####

all the fun of rainbow six but without the fun
