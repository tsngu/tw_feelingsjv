as an 82 year old player i appreciate the sharp images in acc and the excellent feel of the controls after down loading the update package with the mount panarama circuit i loaded the new bmw m4 gt3 and what a hoot that combination is to me some long straights to rest an old mind for 3 secs but then some critical shut off points and those sweeping bends up and down the hill that are impossible to get right well i may never get to the rest of the stuff in this package
thanks for some great fun software folks

how it started
 you mastered arcade racers like forza horizon and dirt
 you mastered simcades like f1 and forza motorsport
 you saw some streamers playing acc and it looked pretty cool

how its going
 you try playing acc with a controller only to spin at every turn on your first lap
 you get good enough with a controller to know that you need a wheel to do a proper lap
 you get good enough with an entry level wheel to know that you need a sim rig load cell pedals a direct drive wheelbase an authentic formula wheel butt kickers and a vr headset to truly feel immersed and squeeze every tenth out of each lap
 you spend all of your free time and most of your time in the office on sim racing forums and browsing gear sites
 your wife and kids become strangers but you dont mind because you just set a pr at spa

dont fight it

im a pretty casual racing game player i dont own a wheel but i do enjoy playing all kinds of racing games with my controller ranging from arcade titles like nfs to more serious titles like forza motorsport having that said ive never seriously dabbled into a real sim like acc mostly because i dont own a wheel but since its on sale today i figured why not im happy to report that its very much playable with controller if youre just a casual driver you might not be as fast as the fastest wheel drivers out there especially if you use steer assist but if youre just looking to have a good time this game can be a lot of fun i recommend getting the gt4 dlc if youre new to sim racing gt4 cars are slower than their gt3 counterparts so youll have an easier time learning the ropes with them but theyre also super fun to race with keep in mind that most people only race gt3 cars online so youll probably only get to use your gt4 cars in singleplayer

these are my controller settings found these somewhere on reddit ive found these to be really smooth i play with stability assist off and tc and abs on increase your tcabs levels if you keep spinning out do a few test laps on your favorite track to get a feel for the cars and be gentle on the steering if youre on controller

realistic but makes me feel like im ass at driving and shouldnt step in a car

#####

this has ruined every other simulator for me and made me spend 3200 on a full sim rig worth it

#####

when i first started playing i thought great ive got the coordination of a drunk giraffe and now i have to learn how to control a car in a game thats more realistic than my actual driving skills i mean seriously it was like trying to tame a wild beast but hey who doesnt love a challenge right after countless hours of spinning out crashing into barriers and probably causing more virtual damage than a demolition derby i finally started to get the hang of it and let me tell you it was like discovering fire for the first time suddenly i was in control and it was amazing

im still not winning any races but who needs to win when you can have the time of your life just trying to keep your car on the track its like being a contestant on a game show where the prize is not dying in a fiery crash and honestly thats good enough for me so if youre looking for a racing game thatll make you feel like youre actually behind the wheel of a highperformance race car assetto corsa competizione is the one for you

#####

i come from iracing now i have the same fun but i have more money

#####

dude where are the mods the sim racing community didnt take it very well when assetto corsa competizione came out in early access back in 2018 unlike the spiritual predecessor assetto corsa there was no mod support and the game would rock the unreal engine instead of kunos simulazionis proprietary engine that used to power assetto corsa and netkar pro and it wouldnt be a jack of all trades either blancpain gt3 content only which meant that the car and track list would be limited to the ones that are used in real life from a brand that consolidated itself thanks to being the peoples favorite moddable platform one could say it was a bold move would it still be able to stay relevant and stand out from the competitors that also offered gt3 content 

one of the advantages of narrowing down the content variety is that it allows for extra care and attention to detail which kunos took full advantage of every one of the 32  gt3 cars handle differently with realistic performance figures taken directly from the manufacturers along with unique engine sounds that make reallife sound dull in comparison by far the best sound effects out there making the competition sound like bumper cars the modeling is also impeccable both internally and externally with fantastic texturing that looks just like the real thing when they meant an authentic gt3 simulation they werent kidding

but we all know that a racing simulator isnt just made of cars tracks are important too kunos knows that very well and doesnt disappoint each one of the 11 base game tracks is masterfully replicated through laserscanning which means they are just like the real thing in every sense of the word every bump crack elevation change weathering and so on is carried over to the simulator so that both cars and surfaces can offer unparalleled accuracy the other 8 dlc tracks are equally as good 

as far as game modes are concerned acc delivers the usual stuff career mode multiplayer hot lap practice and free race unfortunately it doesnt sport a fullfledged career mode like the f1 franchise for example but its good enough from humble beginnings to the top of the category with an excruciatingly slow introduction in monza which takes away from the experience a little bit but doesnt fully compromise it if you want to buy it just for the career mode dont with that being said the singleplayer races within and outside the career mode are very engaging thanks to a very good ai that can either be very fast or very forgiving depending on difficulty you can customize the length 10 20 30 minutes and so on weather time of day grid size mandatory or optional pit stops qualifying length or just disable it altogether just like most modern sims would races are very engaging and the rating system is a stimulus to keep you going oh yes the rating system it goes up if you race cleanly goes down if you crash into other drivers it might be strange at first but it certainly helps to transform you into a clean racer making you drive like the gentleman driver the sport expects you to

the multiplayer mode is decent thanks to the rating system there are official races where you get competition points for winning that improve your driver rating and nonofficial where only the safety rating gets deducted or increased and the track and car control related ratings server owners can set a minimum amount of safety rating points so that people with low sa cant join and ruin the race by crashing into everyone making it so most races are troublefree this doesnt mean that incidents dont happen they are just less encouraged because the perpetrators get punished

as far as additional content goes theres a dlc that brings the international gt series and 4 new tracks another one with gt4 cars 11 of them and a british gt dlc that replicates the 2019 bgt season as accurately as it can be along with three new tracks for their respective price tags one could say its a whole lotta bang for the buck transforming a very complete gt experience into an even more refined product

assetto corsa competizione like fine wine got better over time from a troubled early access start with people questioning its physics and lack of content to hands down one of the most complete and authentic simulators on the market

#####

short version if you like gt racing  you should be playing acc this is the spiritual successor to the gtr games that you have been waiting for and as of this review october 2020 the developers are still planning to push out more tracks and cars to make it even better

yes the launch was bad you know it i know it  but this game has come a long way since launch ive been playing racing games for quite a while  i was a day one buy for the first gran turismo competizione is one of the best the game is a treat to look at  not just in fidelity but also in physics the cars look like they have the weight and momentum of the real thing and thats not always executed well in other games many have cars that look too floaty and it can hurt immersion racing at night is especially rewarding with the colorful leds on the cars and the headlights casting shadows across the track i wish we had more control over the cameras in positions filters etc replays so we could make some flashy videos but giving players that sort of tool is understandably not high on the devs priority list

sound is another high point for acc the word that i keep revisiting is raw the cars are loud the breaks scream the transmission is constantly whirring inside the car if you take a lot of curbing it makes a huge racket  not just the tires but you can hear it shaking the entire car the only complaint i have hear is that exhaust notes are strangely quiet when you go to a 3rd person view but anyone playing acc is probably stuck in a seatdashhood view all the time with good speakers the raucous symphony of a gt race will hit you right in the ribcage

multiplayer is still not where it should be as is the trend with sims  you have a rating system that tracks your performance and that is used to group drivers of certain calibers together this works pretty well but depending on what time you play you may still hit some lobbies where the racers are a little too spread out this means the netcode will probably have a few hiccups and if it has one when youre trying to get a good draft off a car right in front of you it can cause a collision is it way better than launch absolutely during primetime hours its never been an issue i just have to be careful if im playing early in the day and getting matched with a lot of european drivers

but the biggest question is how it handles acc shines there and it does so for a specific reason competizione is a dedicated gt racing game the physics are designed around gt cars many racing games have such a wide variety of cars that inevitably theres types that just dont feel right in the games engine or become to samey with other handling models competizione is going with the depth over breadth approach everything feels like it belongs and it allows you to notice the differences between the cars the porsche feels drastically different from the amg the amg feels drastically different from the m6 you will find a car that you like and youll main it almost like a fighting game character

competizione is doing exactly what it needs to do and the future for this game is pretty bright if they stay on this track oh and dont hesitate to jump in if you only have a controller  you can still put down some pretty competitive lap times without a wheel and pedal setup but i think that youll want to get one after you play this game

#####

do you think you can drive you cant

#####

pros
game is good

cons
i am bad

#####

im freaking addicted

#####

im very bad at this and i love it

#####

if you no longer go for a gap that exists you are no longer a racing driver the rando that just ended the race for the entire lobby

#####

have you ever wanted to drink and race at nurburgring well nows your chance pull out your life savings buy a logitech g29 with a hshifter and bring it home wait you didnt think about the fact that you have a rolly chair and everytime you need to brake you yank the wheel off the table ruining your perfect lap time does this sound enjoyable sure fucken does buy the game

#####

first of all satisfying graphics great physics and of course epic eargasm

oh also i have a little tips for you

ive seen some drivers doing a 02second gap between a car in front of them down a straight and think that it is perfectly fine to continue to stop at their normal braking point they used the lap before  


in short its not  


why  


because doing a 02second gap from the car in front down a straight lets say blanchimont spa at 255kmh both cars are travelling around 70 meters per second  


that 02s gap at 70 meters per second is a 14meter gap nose to nose from the cars  


14meter  3 car lengths average car length ingame is about 47meter  


kmh x 5  18  speed in meters per second  
255 x 5  18  708 ms  


ms x gap in seconds  gap in meter  
708 x 02  1416 meters  


so if you were to brake at 02second gap on your normal braking point into a tight corner such as a bus stop chicken chicane or a hairpin down to 80 kmh  


at that 80kmh both cars will slow to 222 ms your distance from nose to nose will now be about 444 meters a number less than that average car length mentioned earlier  


if you were driving behind a guy in a bentley with his 5meter car length your nose will now be 22 inches deep in mr bentleys backside thats 56cm  


mr bentley surely will not appreciate you penetrating him like that and taking a sniff as both of yous will now spill your sa everywhere due to those 22 inches of action  


this wouldnt happen if you backed off just before braking to a much safer 03s gap 66m nose to nose with 16m social distancing between the cars at braking  
or even better is to brake earlier and then modulate the brakes to keep close to him after the braking zone and into the turn in  


brake modulation  brake early then let off very slightly to come closer to the car in front again and brake again to slow the car down to appropriate speed for the corner  


remember  


  dont penetrate tap or grind people unless they consent to it  

  if youre unsure about the gap andor car distances at certain speeds back off  

  if you do know the gap always brake earlier in situations when youre close to the car ahead

its much better to focus on the corner exit and get alongside your competitor before the next corner  
only ever brake normally in this case later if you are side by side and your car has an overlap and you are on the correct side of the track  


do not listen to people who say braking late is the way to overtake there is no such thing as braking late its ether braking on your optimal braking point or braking earlier  


because braking late  you doing an extremeultrasuperlatebraking and going off into a ditch in front of some old grandmas house or the lord of no consent return of the penetration  


conclusion brake early coast turn in accelerate

pros

skill issue

extra cons
my grandma drove better than me

#####

i didnt want to get competizione because i was a devoted assetto corsa player and i thought why get that when ac has all that and more

it doesnt

acc may only do blancpain and world gt endurace racing but it far outweighs what ac can do the visuals are stunning right out of the box the gameplay is through the roof the feeling of the cars even the best of assetto corsa doesnt get close to the fidelity of acc if you want to race seriously  hotlapping against ai or in multiplayer  this is the sim to go for

#####

my wife left me

#####

ok so ill say right off of the bat that im a big fan of rfactor 2 their tyre model tech physics real road system second to none its pretty but not too pretty in some places not pretty enough but its technically very sounds and is only missing a really good system simulation for the likes of gearboxes for example and there is still a couple of things missing from the tyre model when it comes to how the tyre interacts with ambient air but as far as a racing simulation is concerned its the best their is 

that said

what an absolute experience acc is the visuals the sound the feel the physics its come a long way 

where rfactor 2 may give me the best simulation it feel incomplete due to it lacking good ui and tools multiplayer for example is not as simple as it should be to setup and even dealing with setups or tailoring a single player session isnt exactly a breeze to do properly most of the time

acc feels more complete its ui is on par with the likes project car visuals too the sound experience in this sim is definitely a high point the cockpit feels alive the sound sim for outside of the car really give you the information you need to provide position information to work out direction and distance very well and very consistently which is an absolute life saver when going 3 wide turn 1 at monza or perhaps when you run just that little bit wide towards the end of turn 17 at sebring as you decided not to listen to the well above par force feedback going through your hands you are in the car

add to that a single player system that while a little lacking on the career side give the racers among us a good number of options for our play time ranging from practice sessions and race weekends all the way up to running your own offline championship theres definitely enough to keep you busy

pair that with a mp player system that can run any race on any track in the game for as long as you like supported by day night cycle and pretty epic weather model this pairing does one thing in common though

it encourages your to be a better driver whether online or offline whenever you take part in competition session your driving experience and skill is assessed and as you get better and better you unlock certain ratings that become very important to keep in check anyone who has ever had any experience in iracing will know safety rating and irating but in acc there are additional attributes that are scored to give you your friends or anyone on the platform an idea of the skill level of a driver these additional scores include the likes of trust earned by racing close with another racer including ai without making contact and keeping the exchange clean another is car control which is effected by how well you can remain in the control of the car you are driving this is effected also by how hard you are driving as well so being slow and careful not to spin out isnt necessarily encouraged here either 

there are others but these scores are used to ensure the right racers are getting in to the right competition essentially earning their right of passage to everything acc mp has to offer for those who want to compete it keeps people of similar mind sets and skill levels together pushing each other to race harder and be better something which occasionally and subtly pop up throughout the game while these ratings on the driver profile could easily be gamified it wasnt you have to earn the rating you need to get in to whatever competition you are aiming for but you also have to maintain that standard theres no end game here 

the feel of the game is very good too i would definitely put it up with the like of rfactor when it comes to the comprehensive force feedback information on hand the upgraded 5 point tyre model has also helped there but its still not quite as good as rfactor 2 if i were to express this concisely i would say the following 

rfactor 2s force feedback gives me everything i need to know from the suspension and the tyres contact patch and the sheer amount of information coming from the tyre itself makes up the feeling of the tyre and is what makes up any blanks you get from just the road feeling you can really feel the tyre flex in rfactor 2

accs force feedback does all of that except the feeling of the tyre but its still sooooo gooood

this is just another shining example alongside the likes of iracing rfactor 2 and automobilista of a racing simulator made by people who know racing know simulation and know us there arent many of them on the market anymore despite how big the simulation market has become 

but its almost always the ones that dont have simulator in their name that know how to do it better than the ones that use the word as a marketing tool dont you think this is the officially licenced gt blancpain game too so the latest tyre model information will regularly be added to the game with the annual car the next of which is happening quite soon actually

to finish ill say this 

this sim made me sweat in every single online race the sound and overall presentation of this sim while your racing hard and balancing on the edge of order and chaos really gets the blood pumping

edit  writing this for the steam mini game thing p

purchased assetto corsa competizione a week ago and have already put 38 hours into it im playing on a 27 1440p monitor with a thrustmaster t300 gt and included pedals mounted to my desk having so much fun that i nag my friends about coming over to play it has got my daydreaming about buying new gear and a proper rig even though i certainly dont have neither the cash or space for it

i dont have that much experience with other sim racing titles so i cant really comment on how authentic it feels but its a huge difference between this and arcade racers such as forza horizon and need for speed what i can say however is that even on my little setup it is very immersive sound and graphics are very nice and the cars behave on track as i would expect them to compared to the racinglinehugging rubberbanding ai from titles like forza horizon the ai is much better cant comment on multiplayer though because im still learning how to not be a wrecking ball near other cars

would i recommend this game yes absolutely even just practicing doing hotlaps and racing against the ai is incredibly fun

#####

monza t1 where boys became men

#####

oh dear under appreciated gem even by me for a long time

it can have a terrible first impression but it really grows

certainly a brute when it comes to software polishing this is a game that ive hustled the most to get it going nicely in performance

butdamn the physics are spot on for what you can feel on real life gt3 races onboard broadcast and the sounds are magnificent in comparison to the digital overload of assetto corsa people say it is the best gt3 sim on the market you can see that brilliance in the game here and there

all tracks seems to be laser scanned which is glorious maybe even the cars are laser scanned the level of detail is in line with assetto corsa

the ue4 engine is where the weaknesses starts to appear in this make sure you have some graphics not on the lowest or the game will look really bad but in other hand this is the most graphically advanced racing sim out there what has marketed project cars games acc does better but no photomode afaik c f7 key does wonders though use middle mouse to show camera controls 

this is not for the impatient and if you plan to play with a pad you need to have a long sit through and tweak it out the different steering values if youre going with a wheel you will find an ocean of wheel support and pedals and configurations as the sim was made for

this is not for the impatient again because you need to learn if you havent already with ac to drive safely and respecting your competitors

it is an endurance focused simulation and not a 3 lap stint blazing all four wheels and drifting every corner learn to drive smooth it out your aggression have a wonderful race with other people who also loves motorsports


a better gt3 racer than assetto corsa would ever be i miss all those contents though

edit now with the latest dlc featuring bathurst kyalami suzuka and laguna seca it is glorious

#####

one of the best racing simulations out there right now laser scanned tracks fun to race against the ai very good forcefeedback lots of different cars and the dlcs are worth the money

assetto corsa competizione is the definition of racing simulation the only racing simulation that innovated and pioneered the 5point tyre model when all previous sims used a singlepoint tyre model it simulates heat transfer from brake discs to tyre core temperature it also features an advanced realistic weather system with simulation of dry lines slippery racing lines when rain falls on a rubbered track as well as daynight transitioning i have been driving acc since it was first in early access in 2018 and 3 years later there are things im still learning about it today 

kunos simulazioni may be a small team perhaps a tenth of the size of other companies but their work far outrivals many of them simply theyre a bunch of motorsport and car guys highly skilled intelligent that love what they do as sim racers we strive ever further to improve our laptimes by that tenth of second or even hundredths of a second focusing on the little details similarly kunos focus on the fine details of simulation and it all comes together to create a truly incredible simulation

#####

this is for v1310

overall this is the simulator ive spent the most time with and still going back to it and ive been on all major titles except ams so far i should probably also mention ive always preferred openwheelers so factor that in too ie their lack of within acc physics and feedback are great imho the best and the rating system makes for a very welcome online experience  it pushes you to improve even when offline i actually didnt expect the ratings to apply offline welcome feat i personally enjoy oneclick blind matchmaking which as you would expect gives better and better racing as i improve my ratings i also enjoy special events were you can set your times in the online leaderboard while taking your time practising and setting up your car

if any of the following is your top priority though youll be disappointed
 offline career mode individual offline races with ai are still fun
 smooth and high frame rates on low to mid end systems
 any other discipline except gt3 drifting or modding

even though im a bit disappointed myself on the first 2 points above its still worth every penny 

other than that cant think of anything negative to say a few glitches here and there dont bother me too much every title has them devs are quite active and ambitious and there is a good community around it pretty educative stuff with arisdrives or nils naujoks not just for this game alone 

oh and i almost forgot dynamic weather conditions and night are awesome

actually came here to check intercontinental pack and thought why not leave a review never do but i remembered wondering should i buy it myself so hope this helps

#####

dont play the free weekend test 
its a trap to force you buy it

omg this last update

it has everything we asked for

scheduled cp servers you got it now is truly competizione
improved sa of course now if you finish a race you receive a sa boost
better ai aggressive setting now works properly and they have improved
fucking brake wear its here now we have 4 types of brake pads for diferent race lenghts is possible a more inmersive game

try it and tell me theres a better gt3 game i double dare you

#####

i drive more carefully in this game than the real life

and trying to be the best racist 

love this game so far so good 1110

#####

only two types of sim racers those who love acc and those who dont play acc

#####

i really like this game its got basically everything youd want from a gt simulator with the sole exception of that big long road circuit in the woods and around the hills of germany but hey maybe someday an sro event will go there right now though everything thats here is great there are plenty of things to learn and plenty of cars and tracks to race in and on respectively its got a pretty deep system for tracking your statistics in various ways most importantly for online racing your safety it also has a pretty great weather and time of day system with plenty of options

however id like to highlight a couple of things i think would really help the game first is the lack of information you are given about the cars in game it didnt occur to me at first because prior to purchasing acc id watched videos and read up on things myself as well as spending many weekends this year enjoying real world gt racing however i dont know the bhp of any of these cars or if they are naturally aspirated or have a turbo or even the engine placement likewise the gearing the top speed and what the engine maps do are all mysteries until you find an outside source via a video guide or a forum post even then you cant find all of the technical aspects this is somewhat baffling for a racing game maybe manufacturers dont like to spill the beans when it comes to their cars capabilities thats one thing but this knowledge is already in the game its just not told to you i only found out the audi r8 gt4 had seven gears by mistake and that its ginetta counterpart topped out at 149 mph after i took it around mount panorama which has very long straights compared to some circuits what makes the porsche 911 cup car different from a 991 gt3 car hows the 2018 991 gt3 different from the 2019 one they all look basically the same its entirely reasonable for someone not to know how they differ but completely unreasonable for the game to give you no way of finding out before driving them the tracks have short blurbs on their history a corner count a total lap length and a map showing the path they follow along the ground if this basic stuff is there for circuits it should be there for cars as well

secondly and less importantly is how locked down everything is perhaps its a licencing issue but not being allowed to use custom liveries in official races is silly i would say its akin to not being able to make transfers in a football manager title this is my game so what if i want to race a porsche with a haribo livery at a circuit where that never happened and with teammates called gleep and glorp even the newest f1 title lets you put a whole new team on the grid and in acc being able to set how many cars are on track means you can already change the official car line up of a race anyway its just a strange little hangup the game seems to have that would be nice to get rid of or around

thirdly i would say the game needs a free mode where no stats are tracked not lap times or driver ratings being able to increase safety rating and what have you offline is great you wont be sabotaged by a dive bombing maniac unless youre the maniac doing the diving but for a new player having a way of driving without needing to worry about invalid laps or totalling the cars would be great ive got a lot of invalid laps around tracks id never driven before and i was still trying to work out which view i was going to drive in which dont exactly seem fair to have on my personal record from now until forever trying to drive in the rain is another instance where id appreciate a free swing lots of sims dont have rain so even experienced sim racers might never have had to worry about a flooded track and torrential rain but once again thats a big fat failure if you aquaplane into a barrier during practice that ill never undo

this has gone on for too long and i doubt anyone with any ability to effect any of these changes will ever read it if anyone at all does hopefully though some of these ideas might spread around the community and gain some traction so to speak

coming from iracing  assetto corsa  r3e and having some reallife race car  track experience i am very impressed
of course limited functionality so far but that was clearly communicated by kunos people who complain about this should better start to learn reading

regarding this first prerelease what stands out
 incredibly good  believable physics
 tyre modeling by far the best of every sim i played so far
 no need for finetuning ffb settings it works out of the box had only to limit the gain to around 95 with the csw 25 to avoid some minor clipping
 very very demanding complex yet believable driving behaviour to keep the car on the track and doing fast laps
 sound is the best out of every sim so far fast down shifts in the lambo put a grin on your face every time
 much more styled ui especially compared to ac
 usability of ui could be better
 control configuration is not very usable eg if i klick on some buttons i want to see that on the ui to check if it is already allocated
 fov settings limited should be able to be done on the fly like in pcars2 including viewing angle btw it is important more than in any other sims to set the fov right here otherwise you have a hard time to handle the car and getting faster laps
 needs very strong system to run high fps with 8700k  2x1080sli sytem it runs around 5060 fps i need 120 for my monitor
 i expected a bit more graphicswise it is on par with pcars2 but not significantly better could not use the raytracing feature obviously

i guess most of these points probably will be adressed and are still in development until the official release for simracers this is the musthave title without any doubts too bad it only has gt3 class cars i crave for a title that uses this kind of physics with an title offering different car classes

#####

love being killed in the first turn of monza

hey new sim racers please read before playing on multiplayer

ive seen some drivers doing a 02second gap between a car in front of them down a straight and think that it is perfectly fine to continue to stop at their normal braking point they used the lap before 

conclusion its not

why

because doing a 02second gap from the car in front down a straight lets say blanchimont spa at 255kmh both cars are travelling around 70 meters per second 

that 02s gap at 70 meters per second is a 14meter gap nose to nose from the cars

14meter  3 car lengths average car length ingame is about b47meterb


ikmh x 5  18  speed in meters per second
255 x 5  18  708 ms

ms x gap in seconds  gap in meter
708 x 02  1416 metersi


so if you were to brake at 02second gap on your normal braking point into a tight corner such as a bus stop chicken chicane or a hairpin down to 80 kmh

at that 80kmh both cars will slow to 222 ms your distance from nose to nose will now be about b444 metersb a number less than that average car length mentioned earlier


if you were driving behind a guy in a bentley with his b5meterb car length your nose will now be b22 inches deepb in mr bentleys backside ithats 56cmi


mr bentley surely will not appreciate you penetrating him like that and taking a sniff as both of yous will now spill your sa everywhere due to those b22b inches of action


this wouldnt happen if you backed off just before braking to a much safer 03s gap i66m nose to nose with 16m social distancing between the cars at brakingi
or even better is to brake earlier and then modulate the brakes to keep close to him after the braking zone and into the turn in

bbrake modulationb  brake early then let off very slightly to come closer to the car in front again and brake again to slow the car down to appropriate speed for the corner


remember
list
  dont penetrate tap or grind people unless they consent to it
  if youre unsure about the gap andor car distances at certain speeds back off
  if you do know the gap always brake earlier in situations when youre close to the car ahead
list

its much better to focus on the corner exit and get alongside your competitor before the next corner
only ever brake normally in this case later if you are side by side and your car has an overlap and you are on the correct side of the track

do not listen to people who say braking late is the way to overtake there is no such thing as ibraking latei its ether bbraking on your optimal braking pointb or bbraking earlierb

because ibraking latei  you doing an urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzl3mtmlmw8gextremeultrasuperlatebrakingurl and going off urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwycf3sbxpnkinto a ditch in front of some old grandmas houseurl or urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvd8vrtpr4cwithe lord of no consent return of the penetrationurl

brake early turn in accelerate

#####

whew lad you are not made out for racing and this game will make sure you know that 

nothing but great things to say about the game the only thing the developer really needs to put work into is the online play this game would be absolutely amazing if it had some sort of matchmaking system as is you have to really preplan your races which makes the game more of a time commitment that i dont always want to get into there is also a safety rating which is meant to keep the opponents more friendly in races but the system doesnt work and toxic players will crash into you if they have a sufficiently high safety rating to get you out of the race since their punishment wont be drastic

i recommend playing it with a wheel 

#####

cars feel real nice i go fast and cant hear my girlfriend complaining over the roar of the engines

#####

when i think i am getting fast then someone does a lap time 23 secs faster

that is acc

amazing game

#####

a sports game that doesnt make a new game every year updates the rosters of teams and tracks for free and dlcs that sell a heap of content and not piece by piece official used by the sro group as their official game and you dont need a shifter just a wheel this game is not only a good buy with futureproofing its a great place to start sim racing especially if you like gt3 cars you just need a beef pc

#####

lap invalidated

#####

edit the review below was based on version 18 since update 19 i would no longer recommend this title

acc is not a game as such its much more of a sim than a game the career mode is just racing against bots no story animations or cut scenes etc
if you want an idea of how hard this game is go to any driving game you own and turn off all assists although there is traction control and abs in acc its still not easy and turn up the difficulty to max you need to practice and practice and practice and probably need learn some advanced driving techniques just to get up to race speed


acc is the official gt3 game and as such it is restricted to just the cars and tracks from the gt3 series there are also gt4s essentially slower gt3s available as an add on but no one really races them
some may see this as a bad thing but this does mean that they only have to concentrate on 1 style of physics and they have done the gt3 cars justice

then theres the setup of the cars you have a choice you can buy them from a 3rd party or learn the art yourself i warn you its not that easy
the tyres are the easiest part of the setup and the one part you will have to use all of the time

the tyres are everything in this game get the pressurestemps wrong and you will not be able to drive fast and will probably spend all your time sliding and spinning out you need the correct temps to have decent grip
you will need to drive multiple laps return to the garage adjust your tyre setup then go back and drive a few more laps and rinse and repeat until you have the desired tempspsi this may need 68 laps to achieve the desired tempsand that is just for the track temperature that you happen to be on at the time change lobby or track temp and you will have to do all  this over again it does get easier to do over time as you get the hang of it

i wouldnt really recommend you play on a joypad it is doable but not ideal id think you would struggle to be competitive but if you must id suggest to find a good guide on how to adjust your pad there is a great one on here

for those that do like the format and physics of this game it can get expensive and i am not talking add ons etc i am 800 in so far on a wheelbase load cell pedals stand for the wheel and pedals and a gt style wheel just becauseand this is the cheap gear thrustmasteryou can easily spend 3000 to 5000 on a nice setup

i just realised i havent even mentioned the rating system within acc some think its really bad and others think its ok
i wont go into details on it but i will say if you want to race online then you must pay attention to itand you can only have one user within the game and there is no resetting your user to reset your stats

acc is not am arcade type of game sliding and drifting is bad crazy fast changes of direction are bad and crashing into other cars is a big no no it will lose both yourself and the car you hit some of your safety ratings which is the most important stat in the game so dont expect the person you crash into to be happy with you

so if all the above sounds good to you go for it you will love it

if you do buy acc then please do everyone a favour and dont just jump into an online race straight away it will end badly for allplease go and practice practice and practice before joining any public lobbies

#####

this game makes project cars 2 feel like an arcade racer i honestly am so annoyed at myself for waiting so long to get this game the physics feel so much more realistic i can actually brake correctly turn corners and run over curbs without spinning off which i hated about pc2 

out of the box competizione just plays so well i dont need to fiddle with setups and all of that i can just jump into the car and race and think about learning to set the cars up later

#####

update
this sim is primarily responsible for my upgrading my gearbought when using my trusty g252k later and the performance and immersion increase is chalk and cheeseand yet i need more stuffa 3dof motion platform is now a serious considerationso be warned
i read the analogy someplace in the reviews section about crack for sim racerswelllooks like im expletive 
good as a sim gets at this point in space and timeif you want a true racing experience
help me 


very impressive gt3 sim
finally a good tyre model that is realistic to usegone are the shonky use of tyre pressures to gain unrealistic performancethese tyres have specific windows for premium performancego outside the windows and you will suffer
the approach taken on the setups and telemetry is quite new and will take vet sim drivers awhile to understandif you use the same method approach used in other simsyou will wonder what the hell is happeningagainthe cars have operational windowsstep outside those windows in set upsyou will go backward
there is far to much to list herebest spend some time on youtube to get up to speed

the tracks are the best ive seen so far in any simthe new standard is laser scanned tracksthe bathurst track is incredible to behold
i praised racerooms version of mt panoramaand this is even betterthe sensation of the altitude dropclimb is superbthe transitional weather and lighting effects are too good
a decent pc is requiredmostly when there are other cars on the trackcompromises will have to be made in a field of 70 carsonline or single player

the gt3 sounds are perfectly suited to surround sound and offer so much depth to the driver
the driving is outstanding and is more important to be consistant over a blistering one lapguys go to fast to0 early end up binning it or burning out the tyres destroying brakes etc

this is elbow to elbow racingthe cars are extremely close in performance and all have their little pros and conssome suit a specific track and some dont
some carslike the 991 are very tricky to set up and requires a new approach on different tracks

motec is supported and if you are a half decent driverengineeryou will need itas it will help you understand what the hell is happening in your set up

ive tried and competed in many sims over the years and this one is clearly a superior producteven if its limited to gt34

i cant think why you wouldnt want to give it a shotjust leave your old helmet at home and bring anew oneas the learning curve will take awhile to sink in

online driver swaps and 12 hour races are impressive and well implementedif you want the real thing

no complaints with this onelads

h1i do not reccomend assetto corsa competizioneh1

h2if you are a racerh2

blobbiesb
there is very little track variety and the skill difference between players is appalling if you are looking to race on different tracks and have fun with other racers while learning this is not the place to go usually the full lobbies consist of only monza spa and nürburgring and thats basically it regarding the players expect 60 to be completely reckless drivers who ram into others from the first turn until they leave while the remaining 40 consists of either alien drivers who lap you almost every race or wannabes who crash because they lack car control and then leave player base acc 4000 vs iracing 100000 per month

baib
if you decide to avoid all this terrible multiplayer experience which i promise to you you will never get out of even by driving off track because the fs will ram you even there and decide to grind your sa up by singleplayer so you can go to the competetive server or join an online league then you will have to face one of the most terrible driving ai ive seen in a racing simulator
there is just no brain behind the wheels and it shows especially on bathurst where you have to be mindful of taking chances the worst thing is that even if you move the aggressivity slider even to 0 the behavior is the same basically but the drivers will just not follow through when driving out as in for overtake and this causes incredibly stupid moments where someone has a blue flag and you have like 6 cars behind him scared to take him over at 60kmph on a straight you are very able to compete with the ai even with 100 aggressivity but only on some tracks and even if you manage to go through with the madness another issue arises and it is that the cars just simply break rules and because they really have no fg brain even crash into you and continue to throttle up even if they are in contact with you and spinning you out and they dont care if the crash goes on for 10 seconds or more no they just keep going full throttle

brating systemb
the rating system is a really nice idea and i would say that has a great way of managing all the aspects to be a pretty good sign of a drivers skill yet they havent for some reason finished it its just like there but has no real effect and for some reason uses only few past races to give your rating and not a wider range

blifestealb
if you really enjoy racing and want to be good its gonna steal your life because you see how amazinglyperfect the simulation physics setups and tracks are and it just calls you and you will tell yourself that if you grind and be safe that you can get out of it but then you make two races where everyone crashes and doesnt even learn the basics of overtaking and rules of blancpain for which this game shows no info nor does enforce the rules and you get mad so you go to free practice where you calm down and tell yourself that you can grind it up and then join a race even a league one and experience the same unjoyful clck of raming and gigantic skill gaps again without end 


h2if you are a gamerh2

bskill demandb
if you are looking to grab the game and just have fun on some races like in forza or need for speed i must disappoint you this is not a game anymore but a fullon pledged simulation of a real motorsport with no help thus if you do not know anything about tyre temperatures brake temperatures racing lines oversteerundersteer and racing rules then you will have a terrible experience until you learn all this for which youd have to commit yourself which is not an easy task if you are just looking to race because this can be considered rather a hobby than a game

blobbiesb
same way if you expect to just race on some tracks while having fun and not looking to lose all your life learning how to race just to keep up with the aliens then you wont find a single server you are expected to be a fully pledged driver who knows how to set up his car and the track so you will just be somewhere back thus crashing almost every lap until the rammers leave

bno walkthrough or tipsb
there is just very limited info about the setups and no real info on how to safely pass or what are the rules of overtaking in order to lower the ridiculous amount of disgusting crashes so you will have to go and learn all about the cars the rules of the race and behavior all by yourself not that it is a bad thing but many people wont do it or can find false info



h1i do reccomend assetto corsa competizione h1

h2if you are a racerh2

brealismb
oh my god the fg realism is so freaking damn good man its almost unreal how real they made the cars tracks feedback weather graphics simulation and everything you just can imagine realistic i just am so much in love and cannot comprehend how its possible to have it this realistic even the sound that you get is just incredible you hear how your chase and suspension work you hear every bump on the curb and know exactly when your tires have cleaned themselves off of the last sand bits

bsimulationb
the simulation is just superb in all the aspects it offers be it tire temps or grip you just cannot stop appreciating all the aspects that affect each other so perfectly to create this unique experience you really are driving a car that reacts to even a degree change of air temperature and behaves differently on a track that has been driven on for a few laps or 50 laps if you consider that all tracks are laser scanned and the official cars have been used for the engine and have all the values affecting a race car its just a steal to have a fully pledged gt car garage at home for this very little price

bdrivingb
you will just feel every bump nook water puddle or rubber patch the mindblowingly good tracks with these incredibly enjoyable cars will keep you wanting more even after being completely destroyed by not sleeping for three days wishing you wouldnt have to sleep so you can get more laps in


h2if you are a gamerh2

bdrivingb
if you are just looking for a real experience of a racing car and dont care about multiplayer then you will be in awe like in dcs regarding planes

bhobbyb
similarly if you want a new hobby or skill to learn then this is the perfect thing for you since you can really indulge your full life into it and even then wont know everything about it

this is the best game ever made concerning simulation of real racing and the physics and simulation are just from another dimension but the complete lack of care for the sportsmanship and rules of this prestigious sport makes it an unbearable singleplayer game at best its sad considering you could have this the next esport but its used only like a simulator of driving around an empty track where multiplayer is an option but its not

#####

#####

pros 
if you are looking for an great single player gt3 experience the this sim is great  

the ai feels alive each driver has a different pace that varies throughout the race making each race different 
the sound and the graphics are great 
etc etc 

cons
if one of the main reasons you are buying this game is for its matchmaking system then you might want to reconsider because it seems it was just a pitch borderline false advertising

 overall thoughts 
overall one of the best sim racers if you want realism my favourite sim on the market

#####

i have so much fun playing acc and i finally managed to get my friend to play it

im kinda starting to regret that though because he ran over several orphans while we drove around spa

#####

ok so truth be told im totally new to sim racing my experience of racers pretty much is forza motorsport on xbox and we know thats more arcade than sim but i love the blancpain series and endurance racing in general so i figured what the heck the price is reasonable and well im locked down so need to find another hobby to compliment masturbating

well on first glance didnt have a clue what i was doing so i set everything to beginner automatic gears racing line ai driver etc and have to say it was much more forgiving than i thought you definitely have to handle the cars differently depending which model you drive ive settled for the mclaren or honda as they seem to be the more newbie friendly but that could just be down to driving style the career mode which feels a little stunted does a decent job of representing the series multi qualifying and races etc but it does feel somewhat barebone but honestly thats totally fine ive not ventured into the championship mode yet but i have gone online and generally speaking the lobbies are very pleasant dont get me wrong ive finished more than 30 seconds behind the leader numerous times but for the most part its fun clean and if you ask a question youll more than likely get a good answer you do get the occasional moron that decides to ram everyone monza is horrific for this or an idiot that decides to park in the middle of a chicane but id say 810 times you get good quality racing

so in summary if youre looking to venture into sim racing and want to go multiplayer this game is a fantastic starting point i genuinely am surprised how much i adore this game from the good close races to just sitting in pit lane and hearing the growl of the cars zip by its well worth the price and im not getting paid to say that

现在我妈不敢坐我开的车

i bought this game on the steam summer sale 2020 at 50 off at that time i was a pad user and straight away i understood this is not at all for pad users with less than 2 hrs of playtime i requested a refund and bought pc 2 with that money after a week my wheel arrived and i started spending many hours on f1 2020 and pc 2 pc 2 is more like jack of all trades master of none at this point the summer sale has ended
now i started to regret my decision
i decided to buy acc again but this time at full price to my pleasant surprise there was huge improvement in physics and the difference was night and day as of now i have spent only 3 hrs of time in acc and i can already tell i will not regret purchasing this again

#####

only sim racer that you can play competitively without being a millionaire

#####

just trying to be the best raciest i can be

#####

first a bit about mei use a g29 wheelpedals i play offline with ai in races and without any competitors with practice and hot lap modes  i am a newbie when it comes to circuit racingi dont know all the courses by heart i dont know all the intricacies regarding the rules for the race series and i dont know the insouts of each car

i initially was on the fence about getting this game due to the limited class of cars also while i really wanted to like the original assetto corsa i was turned off by the unpolished ui and it needed a lot of tweaking to get my wheel running properly what can i say im a casual i guess  i bought acc on a whim and went into it without much expectation and have to say ive been really impressed  overall while your car choices are more limited than other racing games it does what it does really well

the menus and ux are much improved over the original assetto corsa and my wheelpedals felt good to me right out of the box  regarding the cars  ive found i really dont mind just having the gt3 class gt4 is now available through dlc too  i usually enjoy driving historic cars due to the nostalgia factor but i have other options for those in other games and honestly i find i usually dont use half the available cars in other games any ways

the game is getting regular updates and there is additional dlc planned british gt

#####

good game but no fortnite battle pass

#####

racism at its finest good physics easy to get into hard to master 910 would like more server customization or ui adjustment

#####

best gt racing sim out there excellent aiphysicstire sim if youre a fan of the series in rl and have a decent steering wheel get it note no nordschleife only tracks that are officially part of the blancpain series 
edit april 1 2024 nordschleiffenurburgring endurance is now available as dlc so my only gripe i had about it is now gone

#####

step 1 launch acc
step 2 put on your vr headset
step 3 blink for a sec
step 4 start your engine
step 5 congratulations you are now a full time gt3 driver


#####

to put it short this game is fantastic for gt3 racing first off this game has been compared very frequently to iracing but i believe that its not a fair comparison as its more so comparing apples to oranges acc is currently purely focused on gt3 racing and emulating that while iracing is suited for many different kinds of championships the multiplayer is great in this game the races themselves are fun and there are a lot of open lobbys to join during the day and night what i would like to see in terms of multiplayer being added is a sort of amateurproampro competition type servers this would mean that the amateur competition servers do still have a standard of required driver rating to join but would be a step to getting your feet wet into the competitive races another hiccup that i find with this game is that the frequency of these competitive server races is that these are not frequent enough moving on from the multiplayer aspect the physics and tire models are very ironed out and feel extremely realistic in particular when the brakes are cold or the tires you can feel yourself getting more grip over the course of the lap intertwined with this is also the track evolution where you will find yourself being able to take different lines over the course of a race as the track gets more rubbered in the detail in the tracks being laser scanned and the scenery in combination with the graphics makes this game a truly immersive experience and makes you yearn for cutting those tenths off your laptime and improving the career mode itself feels a bit lacklustered not having much depth except for the typical championship race weekend style gameplay but i can not think of how this could be changed seeing as in the essence of it it is a racing game after all good selection of cars and the sound is probably the closest you will come to the sound of a real gt3 car if you dont believe me compare the sounds of a car in game versus the in real life counterpart 
i would 100 recommend this game to anyone who has a racing rig and enjoys driving gt3 cars the forcefeedback feels complete and i can feel when i am overdriving the car or am about to understeeroversteer if you are using a thrustmaster wheel the ffb settings on default were at 333hz which felt a bit lacking depth and moreso being too rough to get out the fine details after setting it to 111hz it felt like i was able to really feel every bump and surface of the road individually

#####

like this review worth it

#####

this games gt racing puts iracing to shame especially for the price difference best gt sim on the market

#####

once you play acc you cant simply go back to f1 gts or forza horizon

#####

i stepped away from simracing for a year and kept my g920 in its box  id had the urge to get back a few times but this past week i finally decided to dip back in and i chose acc as the sim to do it with  unlike other sims acc had a g920 profile prebaked so setup was entirely painless for my wheel

as soon as i exited pitlane in my first practice session i instantly felt at home  like an old glove or a bike or whatever fun metaphor  i cant believe how natural competizione feels  the helmet camera is especially nice and extremely easy to race with it puts the camera inside the drivers helmet and the helmet rotates and tilts moves around to reflect the gforces exerted onto the driver  every sim has a cockpit camera and a few have helmet cameras  but what sets acc apart is the helmet camera tilt is not preprogrammed to automatically look at the apex of a corner  accs helmet camera is entirely based on gforces

the tracks though limited in breadth are satisfyingly well detailed  i wont speak to how accurate the laserscans are because i frankly dont know  but the trackside branding is great especially at bathurst in the dlc  theres also ambient audio that plays at tracks that is reflective of the tv and radio broadcast of each local region  i was enjoyed sitting on pitlane in australia and hearing the radio lemans guy talk about the australian race

liveries are also incredible here  i dont follow blancpain so i dont know if any teams or drivers are missing  but goddamn did kunos really pack the hell out of this game with liveries and teams  sometimes i end up spending ten minutes just browsing through the pretty paint schemes looking at all of the foreign sponsors that ive never heard of

i have no problems recommending this to simracers with a wheel unless you hate road racing and gt3 cars

#####

defenitely the best blancpain series game there is graphics are amazing really challenging online is not as toxic as other games so def worth it

#####

i played so far only 5 hours but guys finally a sim playable with a controller i know that is not the same experience that could offer with a fanatec or whichever racing wheel but still it is a really fun game

#####

makes f1 2020 seem like an arcade game from the 90s

#####

this is by far the best looking feeling and performing sim ive ever played i just wish i was faster

#####

dont play during the free weekend its a trap to force you buy it

#####

great driving sim but has some problems for newcomers

tldr youre forgiving the game more often than the game is forgiving you feel like this game would be more popular than gtr if it were more welcoming to new players

i picked up sim racing about a month ago with gran turismo sport after a couple of days playing i was pretty much hooked its been a lot of fun learning about the racing world driving techniques and trying to improve myself i started racing online and while im definitely still a noob i was enjoying it immensely after the latest update to gts though the online penalty system broke and has become a total wreckfest in my driver ranking group so i figured id pick up something for the pc and after doing some research i ended up with ac  acc

first off the driving simulation itself is great and i highly recommend it im liking the realism and i can clearly see why ac is the cremedelacreme of racing sims my problems with the game really start to stem out of how the game itself is set up and the problems its giving me before i can even start racing

1 every time i boot up the game my driving wheel is off the game seems to have a bad habit of throwing off my wheels calibration i open up the game go to race only to find my wheels off center i have to back out of the game spend 20 minutes calibrating the wheel before i can even get going its immensely frustrating 

2 you have to know to set your wheel up properly if your wheelpedals arent set up appropriately youre going to have a bad time when i first booted up the game and started career mode i was clocking about 206 in the monza tests compared to the ais 156 at first i contributed to the fact that i must have really just sucked at the game but come to find out that the wheelpedals just werent set properly after doing some research i finally got it set up and almost instantly shaved 6 seconds off that time the problem here is that i had to spend time outside of the game to even come to that realization 

3 career mode just seems awful im not expecting some grand and immersive career mode but there just doesnt seem to be any progress after you finish the first tests that set the ai level etc you get to select a car to use during the course of your career but you cant seem to change it after youve selected it if youre like me and totally new to this you need to be able to experiment go back and try things differently but that option just doesnt seem to be available if you select the wrong car and want to change it you have to start career mode all over

4 sometimes it seems too realistic maybe its just me but sometimes it just sounds like the engines in these cars are about to fall out of the underside or like theres just gravel all up in the engine its incredibly distracting when you feel like the engine is about to break out of every turn you come out of

5 the track competency system doesnt seem to make a whole lot of sense and my laps seems to get invalidated for the tiniest mistakes in the early career mode tests at monza my laps kept being invalidated coming out of turn one and i just could not figure out why even if i felt like i took the turns perfectly

6 the game doesnt seem to be too keen on explaining the basics to you during the first race at zurburing after spending a number of hours even getting through free practice and qualifying i was doing pretty well but i almost missed my pit window i had 0 idea that i needed to pit pittings fine i just wasnt aware and it cost me my position in the race and i finished in last at that point i was at least happy i had actually finished a race but now its like ok id like maybe a course on pitting or something i dont want to have to get out of the game and search youtube videos or something to learn how to do this stuff

overall i really want to like the game it just feels like theres a mountain to climb to even get there i guess they expect you to have a basic working knowledge of racing sims before you even get the game i think it would really benefit from a plugnplay style like gran turismo while also having the capability of being a full blown sim racer

#####

awesome game

ive just done an hour long race in an m6 in one of mrgits lobbies with a full grid  the race started on a rainy afternoon and with accelerated time finished in the evening no longer raining but a wet track except a dry racingline  ive got a decent enough pc to run in vr and i can honestly say towards the end id forgotten i was playing a game  the sunset and light reflecting of the track was stunning  physics utterly convincing  well done kunos  the games a work of art thank you

#####

if you like gt3gt4gte its great with cheap logitech gear and its even greater with quality sim racing gear just buy the game already even if you dont want to race online the ai can challenge you if your not an alien

#####

brilliant game iv tried iracing raceroom and rf2 but i just keep come back to acc the ffb and the immersion of racing is excellent would defiantly recommend ppurchasing the game and dlc when on sale also 1 key thing to remember is to stick to 1 car and learn it rather than keep jumping to different manufactures

#####

such an amazing sim level of immersion is actually insane every car is different yet same speed pick one then master it
you can also drive bmw m6
yes i main m6
yes no one else mains m6
yes 1010

#####

bought this by mistake thinking it was the other one

#####

car

#####

purchase if and only if you want drive gt car around spa in the rain at night and poop pants again friend not me


#####

they should add f1 so we can have a proper f1 game again

#####

as good as it gets  acc ruined iracing for me now i just cant go back

edit except kunos refuse to implement proper multiplayer system it is stupid

edit2 after a year still the best lfm low fuel motorsport solved the proper multiplayer 
          system and it is free no irenting bull

edit3 just go csl dd with basic csl pedals oh my goodnes its so fucking good help

ps i hate driving gt3 cars but this is so good it does not matter d

#####

my tires decided they didnt want to be tires midway through an 8 hour endurance race 1010 would spin again

#####

kunos im actually incredibly proud of you and your team you took this game from an early access hodgepodge of bugs and turned it into a future classic gt3 racing title i recently got back on this game after all sorts of major patches and changes were made and i must say i am incredibly impressed with how far youve taken this game

when i first got the ea of the game i was honestly starting to get a little skeptical if this title would ever live up to the ambitions set fourth for its roadmapffb early on was a disaster optimization was dog doodoo and there were tons of other issues here and there but having a fresh look on this game its as if i playing a completely different game from how much its been improved

very good job i would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a true gt3 experience this is the best gt3 sim racing package you can get and you can put your faith in kunos to keep delivering you better and better updates to this already stunningly impressive game

#####

make sure your computer can handle it

#####

awesome game runs great on linux with no issues through proton still cant corner for hell though but thats cause i run outta talent mid corner

#####

use the wall to stop

#####

this game is sucking me into the never ending void of misery that simracing is the pain and suffering of losing milliseconds off your laptime
the feeling of dread coming from knowing that one day your family will despise you for never spending time with them only to learn you had traded it off with just one more lap
1010 bought all dlcs

h1𝗛𝗢𝗪 𝗧𝗢 𝗜𝗠𝗣𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗦 𝗙𝗢𝗥𝗭𝗔 𝗠𝗢𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗦𝗣𝗢𝗥𝗧 𝗗𝗥𝗜𝗩𝗘𝗥𝗦h1

im not saying it is the best i just see forza as some sophisticated simulation working for too many years and some people believe thats an unfair or unbeatable advantage i dont think that given the proper work to convince me

𝙒𝙃𝘼𝙏 𝙏𝙊 𝙀𝙓𝙋𝙀𝘾𝙏

heres inside the british and both gt3 and gt4 cars including the tracks of its respective events and of course its drivers more about that down the review because of the dlcs this isnt exactly a slideshow of civilian cars i love them but the thing here is about the corpo cars filled with corpo decals rather than fantasy racing running all naked given that naturally the game abides to blanpainc rules and regulations you can race casually but this isnt one of those games

steering and artificial intelligence is slowly nearing there even if with unstable curving trying to maintain it still i have never experienced this before and you can impress other games drivers everytime i run assetto corsa competizione i can almost smell the gas if it wasnt for a few things that still arent quite there but hopefully will one day if youre interested in this only for screenshots or to admire the scenery random npcs or how good the grass looks you got another thing coming the graphics didnt impress me and screen shot cinema hud options are weird to work with

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2513870458

those are tertiary elements in the scale of importance what the driver is really interested in after buying emulation simulation steering  i emphasize that part and competition with all that in motion but if they want us to truly smell the carbon dioxide they gotta work more on the outtern details too more immersive particle effects that screenshot has filters and reshade mods that the game should have in first place that impacted my final scoring in this review

h1𝗦𝗧𝗘𝗘𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗜𝗦 𝗦𝗨𝗣𝗘𝗥𝗕 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗗𝗘𝗧𝗔𝗜𝗟𝗦 𝗧𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗖𝗢𝗠𝗘𝗦 𝗪𝗜𝗧𝗛 𝗜𝗧h1

my first phase testing with the lamborghini youngster programme was humiliating as if i have never been behind any steering wheels yes i had to borrow from a nearby friend just to feel like a pro but once i returned it i had to readapt myself with a xbone joystick  but dont think this limited me i managed to program it for the level of realism i like even with a joystick

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2513903037

after taking care of my control situation i decided to tweak my black demon they give you a huracàn super trofeo that growls like a devil hissing for meat demanding sacrifices in the temple of speed the devs decision to start the career at monza was just too right

so instead of 60 liters  the default fuel quantity they give you i deducted only the enough amount for 5 laps instead around 21 liters super basic but we tend to forget about these  because the game isnt interested in doing everything for me which is great easing pressure caring about the brakes and other dynamics and vóila i could finally reach third to last position better than last position and with better knowledge i started climbing the ladder im more interested in learning through experience and readings but you can always look for setups around the the internet and then place it on your files and load it up

code 𝗔𝗦 𝗜𝗙 𝗜𝗧 𝗪𝗘𝗥𝗘𝗡𝗧 𝗣𝗟𝗘𝗔𝗦𝗔𝗡𝗧 𝗘𝗡𝗢𝗨𝗚𝗛 𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗥𝗘𝗦 𝗦𝗧𝗜𝗟𝗟 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗥𝗔𝗜𝗡 code

the dynamics are so beautiful and harmonical so realistic i could finally see why some pilots in history performed better during rainy weather to experience that for the first time in my gaming life  ever guys like ayrton senna in the f1 category for example and so many others

the fight is different during the rain in the real world your worries are condensed and the car and the tires are sliced little to none beneficial things like cooler brakes and bad omens like thin layers of water under the tires a driver in the rainy weather would prefer to use the best line to avoid that part of the track that still is wet not just water puddles because it is more complex than that  the fight during rainy weather is different and this is simulated on where it should acc proved me im a rainy racer having greater time results whenever jupiter is angry

𝙍𝙀𝘼𝙇𝙄𝙎𝙏𝙄𝘾 𝙍𝘼𝘾𝙄𝙉𝙂 𝙏𝙀𝙉𝘿𝙎 𝙏𝙊 𝙎𝘾𝘼𝙍𝙀 𝘾𝘼𝙎𝙐𝘼𝙇 𝙁𝙐𝙉

that doesnt mean the casual should avoid it but im afraid they would rather play something else competizione still can be tough even on easier modes the setup isnt like dirt rally 20 for example with bars to slide around even on advanced setups youd see bars but its different you either know what youre doing or you do not it is intuitive enough to keep you interested in it experimenting but you will need to know it anyway because there are not enough hints if youre out of place there are only a couple of basic presettings but very often theyre not enough just a rough bet for the things youre going to face

the hud seems overwhelming at first but you can remove things i dont recommend that because the devs thought about everything even swapping colors in the speed meter when you need to shift but got no time to look at it meant to alert your peripheral vision

𝘼𝘽𝙊𝙐𝙏 𝙏𝙃𝙀 𝙑𝙍 𝙏𝙃𝙄𝙉𝙂

i dont own any vr and no hero in my vicinity does cant rent around here either so you wont have my views on that as ironic as it sounds there is a camera angle you can choose like a first person view from inside the helmet but i dont see much bobblehead physics maybe it wouldnt work there is no gravity simulation shaking that camera angle nor when i brake too hard and i think simulation should start thinking about that

h1𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗬 𝗦𝗛𝗢𝗨𝗟𝗗 𝗙𝗜𝗫  𝗣𝗥𝗢𝗡𝗧𝗢h1

olistthe crowd people are what we call cardboard audience here where i live very outdated when the crowd is 3d npcs from the pitstops for example theyre badly animated were not in 2006 anymore so please

rain sprites droplets are nasty like most frames based graphics in this game are and it needs updating it isnt better not even in epic settings more particles are needed too

not so rarely impact sound effects are just repetitive even when youre performing something else not related to that youd hear some clanks and bumps when not clanking nor bumping although minimal it is undermining the attention to details it already has

artificial intelligence does suffer from the conditions of the track but it could be better most super simulated games only think about you and your sweaty fights ai needs to be prone to mistakes more often maybe some sort of fearfactor and stress like humans do i dont know how the hell they would do it but it is awful to see that they dont do much

the game demands more identity and the career mode is the way to do that youre welcomed by pilot mirko bortolotti himself trying to warnprepare you for what is about to come then not much is shown game needs more style not just cosmetics but further expansion of career mode i just think details arent enough to rival other games right nowolist

i have played project cars 2 and raceroom before
this is the best gt3 simulator out there 
assetto corsa competizione  life like crisp graphics of project cars 2  seriousness of a sim like raceroom

note for beginners 
set brake gamma to 100 the preset for logitech g29 is set wayyy higher making you spin and crash everywhere took 1 hour to figure that out

note for developers
i know this is based on the official blancpain gt series and all cars  have already been added in the base game only liveries and tracks will be added i guess but i have a few suggestions

1 add a retro dlc pack set in the time when things were a mess and when gt1 and gt3 coexisted i would love to see the following cars in the dlc 
     i aston martin dbr9 gt 1
    ii lamborghini murciélago rsv blancpain gt 1
   iii vodafone maserati mc12 gt1

#####

this is the most realistic and sophisticated gt3 gt4 and soon gt2 racing simulation commercially available 
the game gets continuously free updates to the physics engine tire model and adjustments to the bop to better reflect the real car performance the last mayor update was version 18 which included an overhaul of the tire model was released at the end of 2021  since then the game got 20 more updates the last one on 20january 2023
i bought all dlc packages and will happily buy future dlcs to support the forward paying developers

with the free to join external community low fuel motorsport lfm with currently over 76k registered users it rivals iracing and beats it in regards of gt3 racing beside weekly 36h endurance and 6090min races they also offer hourly 30min gt4 25 min bmw cup 25 minute gt3 and 45 minute gt3 races with sometimes over ten splits over 300 users 

vr support could be better since i bought triple screens i rarely use vr because of the limited frames rate that i get with vr 
for some reason triple screens with 2560 x 1440 each has a much better game performance 80 fps than vr with either quest2 or valve index using ryzen 5600 and nvidia 3070 you probably need at least a 4080 to get vr working with decent graphics settings

#####

the future of gt simulations  massive thumbs up

#####

good sim do not expect to be lewis hamilton right from the start the game has a big learning curve

#####

after 9 hours in this ea sim already i feel like i can make an assessment of this title

as someone who bought ac in ea buying this was no problem for me
kunos delivered with ac so i have complete faith and trust in them to do it again

the first ea release contains just one car lambo hurracan gt3 and one track the wonderful
nurburgring gp gt circuit
it looks wonderful and sounds amazing

i have a fairly beefy system and it runs well in daylight dropping to between 40 and 60fps at
night in the rain at 1080p
replays also drop down to this lower frame rate
this is with all the graphics on epic with the exception of mirrors high and motion blur off

the car drives wonderfully well and the force feedback on my thrustmaster t300rs seems to be very good other players are having some problems dialling it in but it seems fine to me

there are only a few limited things to do in the release which is to be expected
a road map was clearly laid out for anyone taking time to look so people moaning about a lack of content only have themselves to blame

back to the content
you can practice hotlap hotstint and race against ai
you can set the time which you can speed up and the weather
the weather can not be set to dynamic yet thats coming in a future update
all these modes are fun and are surprisingly addictive

theres a box up in the right corner of the screen that gives feedback on your driving 
performance and helps you to improve

all in all im blown away by how good this first ea is albeit with limited content
the content is top quality though and this sim is just so addictive

roll on next month when we get misano and the bentley continental

8510

update 25th july 2020

kunos have recently released the gt4 pack for this game and its simply awesome

the game is getting updates and bug fixes and is being shown a lot of love by the devs

it just keeps going from strength to strength

#####

my friend said that if i get 20 likes and 5 awards he will buy me jagermeister and absolut so i will leave this here

#####

after nearly 1k hours played i finally start getting fast hardwork10 would suffer again d

#####

the best simulator currently available for gt3gt4 racing and it keeps getting better with every update

#####

acc is a must have if you have the slightest inkling for sim racing what originally started with a lamborghini and one track has greatly evolved into one of the best racing experiences you can have the sound and feel of the cars the close duels with other drivers the sensation of speed yeah theyre not i the i fastest cars but acc captures the sense of speed very well loud engines creaking and crackling frames that sound like theyre about to break and the feeling of accomplishment when shifting perfectly into the next gear btw immediately set gearing to manual the automatic sucks imo a very strong recommendation from me

#####

one of the better sims out there and still constantly getting updates and new dlcs 

although it is limited to gt cars of which you will most likely only be racing the gt3 ones since theyre faster and who doesnt like faster there is a bit of a meta just like in real life car a will be best at track a and car b will be best at track b because thats how the cars are but ultimately if youre just racing solo or regular multiplayer it shouldnt really matter which car youre driving everyone will mostly be at the same level besides the occasional really bad player which is usually just a new player and the really good player which will just be someone with hundreds of hours theres really nothing to be ashamed of if youre a bit off pace as long as youre having fun 

just try not to have fun at other peoples expense and remember if someone does crash into you its most like by mistake 
trying to explain to someone why a certain move they pulled was just dumbrude and what they should do instead is better than calling them stupid and not telling them why because next race theyll do the exact same thing and it wont improve the races for anyone

#####

not a hardcore player here but i like a good simulator
this is something special played ac forza7 pc1pc2  but this is different comes really close to how real race looks like on live tv just done few laps and played replay and is simply stunning light shadows attention to details sound are fantastic no need to worry about how driving is going to feel controlsfeedback etc anyone who played ac will know why and it is a beta version so its just going to get better and better
played full hd on gtx980ti i7 45 8g ram ssd smooth no issues
100 recommend

#####

assetto corsa competizione is the best sim racing title out there the sim has the perfect combination of physics and graphics unlike many sim racing titles acc has great weather dynamics all the dlcs so far have been high quality and ai behavior is mostly on point the only downside i could really point out is the vr integration since it is quite taxing but still playable for the midrange gpus for the controller racers it is extremely challenging to race with a controller so even though you maybe can pull it off i would still suggest playing only on a steering wheel overall if you are into gt racing or want to get into gt racing acc is a must have


#####

a racing game that blends a narrow singleseries focus with excellent visuals surprisingly good sound and solid racing in a dynamic environment with daynight cycle and changing weather   

for offline racers midevent saving works quickly and well allowing full endurance events to be run over several realtime days and doubling up as a poor mans flashback tool if you need that and the ai provides a solid challenge with the nature of endurance racing  less immediate need for passing and cars frequently being in different parts of their tyrefuel life  covering somewhat for all racing ais difficulty with overtaking

the ui isnt perfect partly because the complicated nature of engine maps brake balance traction control abs et al requires _a lot_ of buttons but also because things like pit stop settings are not intuitively placed theyre in the car setup menu and then once you get into the race the later pit stop presets may forget the tyre and fuel settings you chose

the focus on just one racing series is either a weakness or a strength depending on your tolerance for gt3 cars but overall acc is a game much improved by its 11 patch offering customisable challenge in classic locations made to look beautiful by excellent graphics and dynamic environments



#####

the best racing game i have played until today but i will tell you my history of racing games

i started back in 1992 with microprose f1 gp and papyrus racing nascar and indycar racing followed by indycar racing 2 and nascar 2 in svga wow you could see the cars much earlier but we had so much fantasy back then do you remember token ring networking me and my best friend drove 500 laps of the same circuit at home and compared our total times and fastest laps back in school then

later i spend a big junk of my childhood to become better in f1 gp2 and bought with all my money a thrustmaster t2 no ff back then finally i was able to disable all assists in gp2 until then i had to use tc as we only played on keyboard i own an original game of f1 gp2 still in 2021 this was a milestone in racing simulations when i look back nowadays

when online gaming finally was available i switched to fps games like ut 99 wolfenstein or tactical ops 2 usually my ping was  250  so i had to aim way before the head as the opponent was moving but it worked and i enjoyed it maybe therefore my favourite weapon was the rocket launcher

back in 2002 i bought my first ff wheel saitek r4 and enjoyed racing games again for a short time like many other products ff was not the way it was meant to be it made you slower instead of faster 

after microsoft cart toca 2 and gp legends i stopped racing games for a longer time mmorpgs were more interesting the 4th comingi spend about 5000 hours in this game

after this i had to sort my life and began to learn and work

finally i began playing racing games again dirt 3 f1 2017 and i was impressed about the graphics and especially the much better ff

the first years i only played in single player mode but finally moved to online i remembered how much i liked competition in f1 gp2 hotlap competitions i joined two f1 leagues in f1 2019 and f1 2020 but never was happy with the aggressive style of the opponents maybe the players are too young nowadays for me maybe i hated the racing line too much

and then i found acc i started to learn the different cars and mostly learned the important link between temperature psi and tire temperature and after some practice i started to play online and was impressed by the sportsmanship in this game if someone hits me by accident he slowed down and waited for me instead of securing the better racing position

sometimes i see dirty drivers when i join a public race but most of the time the players are very fair i think i found my new favourite racing game after f1 gp2 finally

when i compare the tracks laguna seca to indycar racing 2 and donington park to toca 2 or moto gp i am impressed by the quality of acc

thanks i can only recommend this game to anyone who remembers the good old times 

#####

excellent
works well with evga 3080 ti video card or amd 5700 xt video card
works well in vr with hp reverb g2
works well with simhub bass shakers
works well with thrustmaster t300 rs force feedback steering wheel
works well with voiceattack for voice commands


#####

fell for the free weekend trap and ended up buying the game and the five dlcs 
i do not regret it works well with my g923 if you on the fence on buying acc just buy it 


#####

came back to this game after two months without playing it and i am amazed just how much this game has improved wasnt interested when it first came out but now i would rather this over iracing

#####

not for keyboard players 

#####

best gt3 sim racing experience out there

#####

had this sim for 6 month dabbled occassionally but just couldnt get on with it while everyone else raved about it covid came along and i dedicated 2 days of furlough to get to grips with this game best advice for anyone new is do not overdrive it start slow get used to the changes in the ffb and build up your speed its an astounding game in soo many ways graphics sound ffb the lot great sim great content well worth the money

#####

my previous version of this review was for all the reasons you shouldnt buy the game  now at version 14 the 2019 content and the 4 track expansion being released i must say if you like gt3 racing this game is great  its beautiful to look at and incredibly rewarding to drive  in the same vain as ac1 you do kind of half to make your own fun if single player is your thing  there is a minimalistic career mode a championship mode and free play  the racing in these modes against the ai is very fun with most kinks being worked out of the ai by now they can be set to be aggressive but always seem fair  multiplayer is a bit lacking with just a server list to pick from  there is an official competition server race most nights unless you live outside the eu or us

the bottom line is its a fantastic gt3 simulator and a descent game  if youre into gt3 get it

#####

could be a great game  excellent ui great graphics engrossing gameplay a proper sim but for an online sim racer to have no report function or ability to votekick or ban has unfortunately ruined this game

most online friendly races are 20 min so not exactly your 3 lap sprints however there has been a recent surge of trolling these include
 parking on the racing line behind blind corners and waiting for the lead pack
 parking off the track to wait for cars to tbone
 blatantly deliberate t1 crashing
 deliberately ignoring blue flags to hold upcrash into lead lap cars

obviously some people find it fun to ruin other peoples but when a game is doing seemingly nothing to prevent this its inevitable that people are going to wreck it

will update if online issues are addressed

#####

500 hrs later still going so much content you would not believe the detail in this game  so much fun
imola  2020 gt3 cars and skins about to drop and british gt3 just after new years

hands down the best racing sim available get it

#####

h145 demoh1

tldr
these developers need to get down to the ground for once and understand that good driving experience is not enough

assetto corsa is a good game at its core it lacked a lot features like career mode single player content beatable challenges for normal human beings proper multiplayer everything was done poorly and left half finished but it shined at its core which is car physics force feedback great amount of cars and accurate tracks driving felt amazing and of course mod support
so i expected competizione to be an improvement but all ive got was a huge downgrade absolutely no single player content no career mode no progression just like the first game you get in the car and drive countless laps trying to beat yourself you can drive with ai but whats the point if theres no progression you complete the race it ends and thats it you can start another one this feels like a demo not a full game

there are handful of challenges but again it feels boring doing same challenge hundred times
difficulty is again messed up no way for normal people to beat all the challenges and career its a joke its just some practice sessions and races you could simply just start a quick race and have the same experience instead of having a driving school like in gran turismo or a proper career mode they did nothing why a career mode cant be like a tutorial an introduction to the game where you learn how to race hire mechanics who explain how setups works you could add so much

ok competizione means competition right so maybe multiplayer is good well its average you get into a multiplayer race you drive finish the race and thats it you dont get to see the standings your progress isnt tracked you dont get to see the summary of your rating lap times are messed up right after you finish another race starts just like that often you dont even know in what place youre at and what place youve finished and how many opponents you were racing you dont even know how many laps are left because on some servers theres no hud 

theres a rating system which is quite interesting and is a step up in the right direction you need to drive consistently and carefully to build up your rating but overall multiplayer is half done and its there just for the sake of multiplayer and with 500 people playing at the same time there obviously wont be a good matchmaking i mean the ranked races are for aliens and theres no point competing with them im not gonna spend all my time on one game then there are averagecasual players and they can have pretty wide skill gap this may sound nice but when there are people with different skills accidents happen more often and then there are trolls as usual how to solve this maybe lower the price of the game to bring more players and improve the rating system now youre being punished and your rating goes down if someones drives into you to race with nice people you need to race with trolls first to increase your rating what kind system is that

what i would add to the rating system is penalty for leaving a race like severe rating penalty in all areas because now its pointless to race online everyone starts fine there are 10 players and after each lap the last one quits so if you were in a third place out of 10 in the end youll be last because there will be only 3 players left
and of course theres that first corner as always so if you start in 48 place youll be pushed out of track or into other drivers and your rating will take a huge hit

here are some other things kunos did badly i dont own a vr headset but this game was advertised as a vr title and i hear many people complain about poor vr implementation kunos even released an official statement saying that vr is a novelty no one uses so it isnt worth working on really a novelty
and yet another thing i dont care about but false advertising is not nice this game was advertised as rtx title i think it even was at nvidias rtx presentation and now bam they decided it doesnt need rtx i mean its fine if it doesnt have it but stop advertising things youre not gonna do

so what do you really get with this game few tracks and few gt3 cars i mean pretty much any racing sim has gt3 cars already and same tracks actually gt3 were the most popular cars in assetto corsa multiplayer mode so if you release a game which focuses only on gt3 cars you should do it flawlessly it should be something you cant find in other games and that was exactly what i was expecting when buying this game the game should be innovative offer something new and unique but this is a downgrade from assetto corsa theyve got rid of those cool on screen apps that was such an amazing invention game also doesnt support modding anymore and modding is what kept assetto corsa alive through all these years honestly this shouldve been a dlc for original game

when it comes to physics and the overall feel of the cars its great its a joy to drive cars feel different and they feel different at the beginning middle and end the end of the race force feedback is pretty nice and all but thats all there is good driving experience alone doesnt make a racing game good just play the first game raceroom iracing rfactor 2 project cars 2 or whatever and youll get more enjoyment

graphically the game looks pretty nice it depends on weather conditions but i cant say anything too bad about the graphics its good but nothing special looks like a regular game although car models are exceptional but you see them only in replays anyway
performance is decent it could be better its a racing game so it definitely could run better i believe people with high refresh monitors could be little disappointed

sound is awesome the engine sounds amazing but i guess its not that hard to nail the sounds when you do only few cars of the same class

this game could pass as a decent racing simulator if it would be the first game developers have worked on and the price wouldve stayed at 20 like it was in early access rating system is half working racing online can be fun sometimes but after a year of early access the game hasnt improved much ive played for around 13 hours now and i dont really know what else to do it feels like ive seen everything i mean driving is fun but its pointless because theres no goal no progression of any kind its a hotlap simulator mainly its a pretty game but at the same time its pretty shallow and doesnt offer anything new if you want a single player experience just buy another game theres plenty to choose from and theyre better than competizione multiplayer is a bit more fun but its shallow for now its just a 45 demo and nothing more

iracing and rfactor2 snob here
i was very skeptical about the acc experience even though i had driven kunoss stuff from way back and know how good it can be
a buddy of mine was driving acc and saying positive stuff and seemed to be somewhat addicted to itso i thought id have a peek
  i bought it and starting driving  first i thought the cars felt stiff compared to the previously mentioned titles but the more i pushed the more i thought this feels really good  i can get a great sense of what the tires are up to and push accordingly  the more i pushed the better it felt
i went back to my favs and drove them and decided after all the acc actual physical driving experience is at least as good if not better  plus the sound and graphics add up to a very strongly immersive experience
yes its limited in scope but the subject it covers is not small and has a great capacity for variety within the somewhat confined limits  there are several cars that i havent even heard the engines for much less drivenpotential fun
the single player workup is really good  a full campaign to be mr awesome driver and really good practice oriented stuff to play with
also there is a deep ratings system that requires the driver to prove heshe is serious about actually racing and is just a lot of fun to learn and develope your own personal ratings
i really cant think of anything bad to say about the sim  it drives great sounds amazing and is thoroughly fun
hats off to kunos thanks buddy great stuff i love it

#####

folks get this game  i have played iracing pcars 1 and 2 gtr2 assetto corsa plus all the arcade racing games out there   i can say honestly that no other driving experience has come close to competizione  there was actual magic feeding back through my wheel and pedals  i cant recall ever feeling so connected to the road as speeding around spa francorchamps in a porsche 911 gt3 car feeling the ragged edge of the limits of grip  the moment when my jaw dropped to the floor was when i overcooked a corner and i could actually feel the weight of the rear mounted engine through the wheel  kunos and 505 made a masterpiece

#####

havent played a lot but so far so good

braked too early for monza t1 but thats on me

assetto corsa competizione stands out as a shining example in the world of racing simulators the game is a dedicated endeavor to recreate the blancpain gt series now known as the gt world challenge europe with an impressive degree of accuracy and attention to detail

one of the most laudable aspects of acc is its handling model it strikes a delicate balance between realism and playability catering to both hardcore sim racers and those new to the genre the games physics engine delivers an incredibly authentic driving experience every nuance of the cars behavior from tire grip to weight transfer is perceptibly influenced by various factors like weather conditions and track temperature making every race a unique challenge

graphically acc is a marvel the meticulous representation of renowned circuits and a diverse range of gt cars are visually stunning complemented by dynamic weather and lighting systems that not only enhance the visual appeal but also affect race strategy and vehicle handling

the games sound design deserves special mention the roar of engines the screech of tires and the ambient sounds of the track come together to create an immersive audio experience that puts you right in the drivers seat

multiplayer in acc is robust with a ranking system that ensures youre matched with players of similar skill levels the game also features a singleplayer career mode that while not as deep as some might hope offers a satisfying journey through the gt series

there are over 20 tracks and dozens of cars in each category gt3 gt4 etc  depending on which dlcs you get

however the game is not without its shortcomings the ai can sometimes be unpredictable and there are occasional technical glitches moreover the steep learning curve might be offputting for casual players

in conclusion assetto corsa competizione is a mustplay for fans of racing simulations its exceptional attention to detail combined with a sophisticated physics engine and stunning graphics offers an incredibly realistic and engaging racing experience while it may have a few minor flaws and a challenging learning curve these are small tradeoffs for what is otherwise a brilliantly executed racing simulator

#####

this is my honest and open review so please look at other reviews and watch youtube reviewsgameplay to come to your own decision about this game

after entering into the world of simracing during the lockdown and purchasing a logitech g29 i dabbled with a few other games of varying disciplines from dirt 20 to project cars and i personally found that assetto corsa competizione is by far the best sim on the market for the price heres a brief list as to why

pros
 high graphical quality on each car and circuit
 unique handling for each car and the clear physical distinction between gt3 and gt4 cars
 total immersion and fidelity when racing wheel to wheel
 attention to detail such as tyre degradation to standing water across the track
 player ranking system which allows private servers to cap inexperienced players from ruining others races accidentally
 ability to use external vehicle skins although only visible to client and not server hosted
 real time weather and time of day effects


cons
 lack of public server filters
 lack of interest for the gt4 cars
 lack of explanation within car setups eg brake pad numbers
 lack of server tool support eg unable to change circuit without changing server config and restarting server
 basic ai which will collide with player if youre in anyway slower or in front of them

there is also so much more that i havent included in this review which youll find in game yourself and be utterly blown away by the shear attention to detail within the game or from other reviews i urge anyone to not enjoy a great battle for position with equally skilled opponents on iconic circuits like spa or mount panorama

i would strongly advise racing in a league or organised events as this is the absolute best way to get the most out of this game just search online for racing events and leagues in your timezone and get stuck in

for me the game isnt perfect and it has improved with patches and the inclusion of intercontinental circuits and gt4 class has increased its replayability the pros far outweigh the cons when compared to other sims like iracing and its hefty price tag

#####

ac competizione is a true simulation that goes far and beyond of what i experienced when it comes to track focused racing games
the cars are tough to control so not only you have to worry about other drivers a battle with the track you have a battle with the 4 wheeler you chose 
if you are just a causal racing game fan that plays titles like project cars gran turismo shift and even the og assetto corsa competizione will kick your butt 
i started the career mode on the lambo youngster tests and i cannot even finish the first event i had better luck with dirt rally and that game is not easy
if you do get the game start with practicing with the huracan on monza 
if you just want to race and enjoy casual play be ready for disappointment the game then is not for you
i decided not to refund it for the 16 euros i got since it is was on sale because i want to improve my racing game experience and toughen things up

#####

assetto corsa competizione what can i say that hasnt already been said

been in since day one of ea there were some rocky moments at the beginning but the guys at kunos worked their behinds off and especially since the 11 and 12 updates and now todays 13 update the sim is really been brought to the fore as the gt3 racing simulator

the sound has massively been improved since the original assetto corsa and is a treat to the ears the physics and fbb make each car a delight to drive and how the cars feel when the dynamic weather decides to fill the track with rain will put a smile on your face for sure

as someone who pretty much races exclusively in multiplayer theres not much id change the only thing id love is to have more hours in the day to spend more time driving in acc d

100 recommended for any simracing enthusiast

#####

overall a fantastic sim racing experience that just needs a little more integration into the blancpain gt series

pros
ffb 
tire physics
track characteristics
car physics
sound the sound 
vivid graphics
car models and liveries
trackir integration
driver rating system that encourages clean and mature racing 

cons
woefully inadequate explanation of car setup aspects prepare to do a lot of homework  trial and error testing 
cannot completely navigate car setup menus with logitech g27 directional pad have to supplement with keyboard 
performance problems during day  night transitions and im running in 1080p with a gtx 1070  
limited track selection but will improve over time 
small online community this is the wild card with this game the community could grow but that depends on how dedicated kunos is in the long run based on kunos support for the previous assetto corsa im not too worried 
needs honest integration into the blancpain gt series there should be race alerts highlights links to content and rules etc this is a huge missed opportunity for the game i purchased acc because i was already familiar with the blancpain gt series but theres no reason why it cant work the other way around the game should be heavily promoting blancpain its a worldwide series after all

acc is thrilling to play in vr with a valve index and with a small amount of tweaking it runs beautifully i am by no means hardcore into racing simsi am a complete noob to gt racing but have been having so much fun racing trying not to place dead last in career mode the ai is very challenging and aggressive and you have to watch out not to get too close to them luckily you have a team mate in your ear telling you when they are coming up behind you and on what side of the car theyre on its up to you whether you want to listen to him or not 

i recommend using the openfsr mod to increase performance in vr i will include a link to my quick guide below i was getting a lot of reprojection glitches at first but this eliminated that issue completely for me

the gt cars are amazing ive been racing with a mclaren the graphics and sound quality are a step up from assetto corsa so thats a plus besides openfsr the sim doesnt need any freeware or paywalled mods unlike its predecessor which is nice theres a multiplayer option as well as a championship mode career mode and custom single player races

i play with a xbox controller and with some adjustments to the settings it makes it a lot more fun and easy to control below youll find the settings ive found to work best with my controller

overall i recommend acc despite it not being as popular as the og assetto corsa and it can be more challenging whether youre a total noob like me who just wants to have fun racing in vr or on a flatscreen or if youre a hardcare racing sim enthusiast acc will not disappoint

as a relative newcomer to sim racing i played about 110 hrs of f1 2020 and got a g29 wheel about halfway through that which was a game changer i had acc in my library for a while and finally tried it out it isnt nearly as beginner friendly as f1 but once you get in to it it is head and shoulders better even on the g29 the ffb is on another level

i think a few big tips with this game are pick a car you like and a track you like and start slow the game will punish you for overcooking and once you start getting a feel for it know that tyre pressure is soooo important maintain it between 27528 for gt3 and it will transform your car you dont need to fiddle with setups too much just use safe to start then aggressive once comfortable then build up to playing with it using youtube for racing line learning to trail brake and to feather the brake to shift the weight forward for tighter turn sheds seconds off your lap times 

i have recently started playing online and i am hooked consistency is everything online especially when you are new just make sure you build that safety rating up as much as possible before you begin

this game is incredible immersive and with amazing sound and visuals of the driving games i have played it is by far the most realistic and satisfying when you piece together an awesome lap  i would safely give it a 1010

#####

bought it didnt play it for 5 years played it got punted by my mates and got banned from my own server for safety rating 1010

#####

its fantastic steep learning curve with an emphasis on clean safe racing it is challenging in single player and when you have a good multiplayer server it can be downright magical the sound design is top notch and the graphics are excellent ill be putting many more hours into this one

#####

i am trying to learn how to be a certified racist in this game and so far i am happy about it

#####

i have reviewed the game trough the whole roadmap since the release 1 to the release 7
httpsiimgurcomcczfjcapng

i have deleted that review since this game deserves the 10 review so this is my review of the release version of the game

h1first offh1
do as you wish but would you rather listen to somebody who has less then 2hrs in game or somebody who can tell you by their game time and their experience how the game is 

h1this 10 release is deffinetly not the final build of the game developers have said they do plan to develop the game further and they have plans to expand on content will touch on that laterh1

i have been following the game since the day they showed us the trailer and till this day i have been reading forums and every single post litterally d i know no life bla bla

i am big fan of the game for couple of reasons i love gt3 cars  this game introduced me to blancpain gt series witch i have been following last 4 years and its a great journey amazing races crown jewel of them is spa 24h  my dream now is to attend one of those   

back on to the game review

h1contenth1
10 version of the game brings bofficial 2018 seasonb content witch means b10 tracks and 18 carsb13 manufacturers 
and already confirmed  bfree updateb later this year of 2019 season witch will bring 1 new track  and 67 new cars confirmed by far

h1tracksh1 laserscaned so you can feel every bump while driving 
h1carsh1 each car has its own personality whole different driving adjustment when you switch from lambo to bentley lets say crazy how all cars act so different along with amazing details on them interactive interior where you can see buttons move and animation of driver doing itrubber dirtspot on details on liveries from real cars even led strips for endurance racing on cars were reproduced spot on  as close to real life counterpart as possible

h1 campaignh1 witch has real life driver coaching you trough the youngster program until you get approved to do full season racing 

and next to all that bunch of small options to fiddle around and create your own fun  do as you wish no unlocking of content etc

h1soundsh1
sounds in the game are amazing no comment ear bleeding from how loud some cars aredrooling how good some cars soundand if you compare them to the real life footage they are spot on 

h1multiplayerh1
multiplayer is a whole new level of the game your driving is scored on  advanced rating witch is ruining on servers and by your skills you will be matched with people same skill for better racing experience

penalty system witch will not let cheaters go around that easy good luck serving drive trough on spa d 

online quick join button yes now there is quick join button where game will automatically find the best fitting serveer for you or if you already have your ratings worked out you can enter cpcompetitive servers where situation is more competitive etc

or use good old server browser and find what you like and want 


from my personal expirience  multiplayer has been so  much fundoing public races doing closed in sessions racesits just hours and hours of fun for me 

feeling of adrenaline rush when you are doing qualis and you end up on top places with just 013xx in between top 10
when you start doing formation lapand hit green lights and you floor it when you do longer races and fight for survival fight against the all odds if you like that this game is definitely for you excitement when you have 23 corners of side by side driving hoohh


now if you want to listen what some people expectations were and their wishes did not get granted that the reason for so many negative reviews people expected iracing type of multiplayer for 25 game  and developers said they will not have that and people gone mad merge that with some youtubers covering that shitstorm and bam people that barely touched the game leaving reviews how game is bad

h1physics and ffbh1
now this is touchy topic but its must i own a g27 yes yes i know entry wheel not dd etc
i have it set so game feels so good on the wheel so i can feel all the car movement on the wheel little slip of the car i am on it and correcting it when i spin i can feel the rubber scraping the tarmac until car comes to a stop bumps curbsyou can feel it everything ffb on g27 for me its perfect different wheels may differ but putting some time and setting up wheel is worth it

h1graphicsweather24h day and night cycleh1

graphics is top notchgame looks amazing no doubt about it no racing game looks like this and delivers amount of detail acc does 
weather most wanted feature from ac came to acc and its rain developers really nailed it with this one rain and driving on rain is scary af and i mean itfighting a car trough the track even on wet tireson stronger rain its crazy and surreal feeling you can feel the puddles on the ffb you can feel how your wheel is dancing on the track that does not have grip you can feel  when your tire overheats and does not have grip and you go off the racing line on wet part of the track to cool the tires down

and i dont think i have to say anything about 24h cycle except that night racing is amazing night racing is my favourite 

  if you are racing fanif you like gt3 cars yes gt3 cars only  this game will give you the best experience for your 

h1give it a shoth1 try the game but give it proper try it takes time to learn the gamecarstracks and to be good at it
i am almost 600hrs in the gameabout to go over the time i spent on ac  in 2 years d
thats how much i like this game

#####
















#####

w game  remember kids braking is the key

#####

if gt3s are your thing this is the sim for you

#####

great game absolutey brutal though  takes real dedication to learn the game and become proficient at it not even good just good enough to complete races and not launch yourself off track at random points every other race  if you have a wheel it is a must buy will get you up to speed on cicuit racing while not having to do any modding  i do suggest getting your wheel set up well briankoponen website has really good guides for pretty much all sim games for wheelforce feedback settings  it takes time but the effort is rewarding because the skills learned transfer and it gives you a nice progression path as well as a solid single player for you to run as many laps and test as much as you want with ease

#####

this game is very fun it differs from assetto corsa as there is a more serious and technical side with setups so if you are not a giga nerd it is not going to make sense setups do play a big role in lap time and therefore people try monetize this aspect of acc which means you will have to spend more money on top of the 40 price tag  dlc to have a competitive setup to properly race this leads to another side which is that acc uses info from the gt championships so if 1 car becomes bad and you have just spent 40 for the base price and say 1 dlc for the car so like 15 and then a 20 setup you are now down 35 for the car and the setup for an noncompetitive car you can find free setups or make your own but they are rarely better than pro setups and way more time consuming a negative is also that you do need to own all dlc to participate in ranked races but just sign up for lfm which is way better or do casual races despite listing some negatives this game is incredibly fun weather and graphics are amazing the cars feel very responsive and drive differently based on tc and abs settings better multiplayer than assetto corsa as in ac the server list is clunky and often empty in acc you can get your favorite car and join multiplayer races braking system is also significantly more accurate for gt3s than iracing or assetto corsa cars are also incredibly detailed with many nooks and crannies as well as accurate weight distribution for stuff like engine placement and fuel car collisions are significantly betterdetection wise than say iracing on the other hand the mechanical damage is not as detailed as iracing and can sometimes feel negligible in an aerodynamic sense cars can be very hard to drive but incredibly rewarding once mastered i drive the mclaren 720s gt3 evo and it is very hard to sustain grip through lower speed corners and sometimes even the off tic can make the car loose grip or lock the steering but once you have mastered all the brake markers and the intricacies it is incredibly rewarding take for example i was learning the mclaren on monza and when i finally got a 154072 i was extremely happy but i have been driving now on spa and feel like on eau rouge my car looses grip and the steering locks which is very frustrating either way if you are a pleb or a professional racer sliding into a gtr user get ready to be called a slur ps braking is better in acc than iracing

#####

car

#####

tried project cars 2 rfactor 2 automobilista 2 original acand this is what i like the most

#####

the best competitive scene in multiplayer sim racing outside of iracing if youve bought a wheel and youre tired of the multiplayer chaos in forza or the f1 games this is your next step

#####

game is great physics and graphics are amazing big lobbies too have had races with up to 70 other cars in multiplayer on one track however the ui needs some work especially with explanations and other aspects such as the ecu mapping you have to look on forums though game is great but not friendly towards new players at all regarding explaining how things work

#####

kerbs go brrr

#####

new to sim racing still learning and i really like this game

#####

awesome physics sounds and gameplay
join a league for the best experience

#####

coming from years of forza and gt this game is a huge step away from arcade to sim world the sounds and visuals alone just pull you in gameplay and driving will show you quickly that you arent hot sht like you were in the other games i play for fun and knowing i have so much more to improve on makes driving fun again getting the game and all dlc on sale is amazing beats having to spend well over 250 like in iracing for the same content

#####

cant fault the physics engine in this game fantastically rewarding and addictive the gt experience is captured authentically if thats what youre after then its a great game and encourage you to buy it for me though its let down by lack of features that would bring the game together into something more cohesive 

for example want to jump on a track with a friend and have a blast one on one to do this youll end up running game servers yourself running your own chat app and trying to bring it all together its a lot of faff and you end up spending more time in setup than you do enjoying its fruits 

other major callout would be the lack of ghost support its very rewarding to drill a track in time practice mode but youre left with little clue of how you might compare to others or how you might compare to prior laps also means you end up on youtube to discover new lines etc

im being critical here though the core of the game is fantastic and ive not hit a single bug

#####

it took me seven yes 7 hours to do my first race i get it now buy this then forget everyone you know

#####

the best bono my tires are gone simulator

still the best xd

#####

bought acc upon release but never really got in to it my main race sim currently being iracing  however with update 18 and the improved force feedback and tyre model i am beginning to love it  still not the best experience in vr but if you have acc in your locker now would be a good time to revisit it  put in the effort to get a decent safety rating and you will have some good clean online racing

#####

it has the 720s

#####

tyres burn quicker than fuel

#####

the best gt3 in the market the feel of the car is just unrivaled and the full sro license offers for a great selection of tracks and cars also the porsche cup cars are very well made

if gt3 or cup cars are not your cup of tea there are probably better alternatives iracing specifically

#####

i grew up on gran turismo on ps1 all the way through to ps2 so this game feels like its the most closely related game to that series it has the same type of feel with the courses and atmosphere but it has a lot more to it with tuning and controls there is a lot i could say about this game but i can definitely see me playing this more so i recommend it

#####

based on version 104
can not recommend at this stage this is a broken and unfinished game very obviously

update on the 23rd of august 2019
assetto corsa competitizione is no longer commited to fullfil the promise of rtx  430 youtubehvswp3j2ijyt276  that makes them liars

broken things i noticed within 2 h of gameplay
 buggy control mapping ie mapped    to ignition it unmaps itself all the time ie same for starter  leads to broken pitstops
 pit limiter is not working most of the time seems like it is only working when off throttle
 hud can not be moved around at all
 certain elements can not be turned off ie track performance or whatever in top right
 certain elements are obviously unfinished ie relative standings are cut off badly
 inconsistent ai spa i could easily keep up nürburgring they were 3 sec faster per lap at 90 difficulty
 incompetent ai monza regulary spin during formation lap in storm conditions  sometimes they are so bad at recovering that they miss the start or even never get back to driving
 ai is op in rain like massively it is like the puddles dont affect them
 rain is absolute bullshit despite high tc it is basically undrivable storm  but ai has no problems
 tc way too strong especially above 01 settings
 too much damage for slight car contact but at the same time you cant really see it
 several missing descriptions ie it would be important to know what 1 means at ecu is lowest fastest or highest fastest
 cut track penalties  warnings are super inconsistent and absolutely not clear when you will obtain and when not
 ai can be held up on track by simply going very slowly or even stopping on track observed on nürburgring  typical assetto corsa problem
 why the fuck cant i go in the menu bottom left to the previous page the menu where you can change your pitstop etc who the fuck made up this design but incar dash of cockpit menu has that functionality where most of them have anyways only 2 pages  
 terrible hud design in some places from a functionality point of view
 i find the tire model and physics not as good as assetto corsa and far from the top sims but i think you can get there  though in the end only a real unbiased driver can tell
 ffb is bad compared to other sims subjective g29 was used especially compared to rfactor 2
 bad fps despite top specs

 and much much much more

100 rushed and incomplete waste of money do not buy and spread the word this is btw now the 2nd time kunos did publish a buggy and incomplete mess
something like this should not be tolerated by gamers this must stop half the games these days launch with major bugs

edit final words
as of the marketing lies used and really shitty state the game is still in couple of months after release i can not recommend any product from the developers  kunos as they are only greedy ssholes we shall not encourage such behaviors anywhere

#####

i am now a certified racist

#####

best gt3 racing simulator on the market best price wise and all dlc is really cheap 

no subscriptions like a certain other game and having to put a mortgage down to race consistently as well as download certain overlays

wouldnt bother if dont have wheel and pedals

experience enhanced massively by lowfuelmotorsport google it

#####

h1my first adventure with simracing and i love ith1

acc is detailed gt3  gt4 racing simulator built on unreal engine 4 while it doesnt have many cars or tracks the quality of content and polish is trully amazing from visuals audio to feel of the cars are superb its a game that offers a lot if you dont mind its all about gt3 and gt4 cars

single player is great for practice and learning experience  as i mentioned its my first real experience with simracing and acc is pretty good for beginners 
the main fun starts with multiplayer and leagueevent racing  you can find plenty of activities online while some simracing games are lacking here or require monthly subscription acc offers you everything out of the box with plenty of players to race with i personally recommend joining league  there are plenty and are so much fun to participate joining random servers can be hit or miss and building up own rating system takes a bit of time and practice

in the end what i like and what i dont about acc
 amazing visuals and audio
 runs really well on old pc
 high quality and detailed car models
 very satisfying driving and physics model
 plenty of activities online active community
 rating and reputation system that really works and motivates to improve your driving style
 somewhat good career bit basic
 racing and fighting with other players in multiplayer is what it makes the most fun and its very addicting

 only gt3 class gt4 and other cars are paid dlcs
 not too many tracks only gt licenced tracks some come as extra paid dlcs
 other games have better newbie friendly introduction system

would i recommend assetto corsa competizione absolutely yes as my first simracing experience its exactly what i was looking for

#####

still the best gt3 game there is nothing else to say

as of writing this review july 7 2019 i dont recommend buying this game this is a game that was in early access for a fair amount of time and has been released and deemed to be worthy of a 10 version number this is no longer an early access title but core features like your stats or your saves have been essentially stripped from the game 

the single player menu features a spot for your personal best lap time for the selected track this spot remains unpopulated and has since pretty early on in the ea phase at one point it did work it no longer does knowing your pbs seems like an extremely basic feature for a racing game simulator focus or not this is only the start of the lack of proper stats the stats have been gutted for stability because this early access title is still having major stability issues post10

the title also lacks proper vr support and triple screen support two very important features to a not insignificant amount of sim racers and gamers in general 

we can get onto the topic of the missing animated pit crew that was also a big point used the advertising for the game or the missing or less functional matchmaking support they went with but its been beat to death on reddit and their forums

this game is in a poor state and is most definitely still in early access regardless of what the steam store says core features are missing there are stability issues that this game experiences that has caused the removal of core features like stats saves and the pitcrew this is from the words of lord kunos himself on the ac forums

#####

really good even on controller

#####

after 2 hours of playing this is what i think about this game

graphics awesome looking really realistic nighttime is great as well
driving feels very realistic aqua planing is well simulated as well
multiplayer most players are very competitive but drive responsible in this game

overall a great game

меняю отзыв обратно на положительный 

читеров давно не видно
разработка игры потихоньку продолжается 
баланс очень радует 
в остальном эта игра для тех кто готов тратить время на саморазвитие готов искать мероприятия и чемпионаты от комьюнити а просто покататься ну это не про acc здесь чтобы получать удовольствие нужно постоянно самосовершенствоваться

#####

i started with f1 games a few years ago and thought this type of racing would be slow and boring i couldnt have been more wrong this game is an absolute delight and there is so much you can do with these cars 

the online community is huge and it is quickly becoming my favorite way to spend my time

#####

the physics and visuals in the game are great the easy servers make casual racing a huge plus in this game

however the competitive servers are absolutely garbage first of all theres only 3 races a day the schedule changes daily and every other day is a random track if you want to even attempt the random track you have to already have every single track medal which is understandable however can be very annoying to do because there is no system telling you what you actually need

the servers had been down for an entire week when i was trying to race daily just launching the game seeing theyre down and closing then i finally get to do a random race theres only 11 other drivers in my lobby which is not skill balanced at all 2 leave because they dont like the track leaving 10 of us which are separated by a total of over 5 seconds in qualifying

i waited a week to have a race at a track nobody likes with 9 other drivers with nobody within half a second of anyone else on pace if thats what you call a competition server id rather go play project cars

#####

there is still a couple of bugs and vr is still quite demanding on your on your hardware that being said i love this game now its the only sim i can just jump into and have a good racing session without much overhead kunos is constantly updating the game with fixes and new features aswell 

ivr warning if you dont have a high end computer you will not be able to play this in vr that being said it performs ok on good hardware with oculus cv1 asw 45 locked i can run epic vr preset with 2080 super and i99900ki

#####

finally hardcore racing simulator devs took hint from console sims and made a decent steering assist
100 playable and enjoyable on a keyboard or a gamepad controlling slides and all without any stability control or similar cheats

#####

studies suggest that bmw and lamborghini drivers show the most psychopathic tendencies among gt3 drivers

#####

ive been racing cars for 18 years and playing racing sims since gp3 and acc is just one of many on a long list ive played on the pc theres a lot to like here but a few problems too  enough for me to struggle to recommend it over iracing rfactor 2 and ams 2 for context ive been playing on a fanatec clubsport v25 with loadcell pedals and previously have played the game on a logitech g920 on a relatively high end pc 9900k2080ti i keep coming back to acc in a desperate attempt to love the game as much as ac before it

bthe goodb

theres a lot to like about acc  its probably the most visually accomplished game sim on the market with a great attention to detail on its admittedly slim amount of content i love gt3 cars and european circuits so thats fine for me but that wont be for everyone still the level of precision thats gone into replicating these gt3 cars is unparalleled and the tracks are often indistinguishable from their real life counterparts certainly the ones ive driven spa and brands the setup modelling replication of all the adjustable features of the cars are authentic as they come 

the incar sounds  well at least the clatters and bangs are as close to real life as ive seen in the sim the engine notes are decent this is certainly the most realistic sounding sim from the replay screen but theres a slight weakness to the incar sounds compared to later entrants from ams2 and rfactor still the framework is there for this being the absolute best gt3 sim on the market

but it isnt

bthe badb

the game is unfortunately let down by the driving experience whilst its probably the most authentic gt3 sim in terms of physics where kunos really drops the ball is how it translates what the car is doing on the track to what you feel through the wheel this is largely down to the implementation of force feedback  kunos have opted to give realistic forces through the wheel rather than simulated forces see other games overcompensate with what you feel through the wheel because for 99 of sim racers who dont have a state of the art full motion rigs the only get feedback on car behaviour is through the wheel when i drive a real race car on the limit i can feel the traction through the rear forces from the abs and traction control through the pedals grip through lateral movement suspension movement and chassis flex through the gforces and vibrations coming through the car

acc simply doesnt give me the relevant information as to how the car is behaving giving a relatively muted sensation through the wheel that prevents me from interpreting loss of traction or feeling imbalances in the setup accurately going fast in this game is less about feeling how the car is behaving and reacting to it and more about endless repetition and learning how to most precisely drive round the circuit based on visual cues i never really know why im going fast or where the limit is intuitively this is exacerbated by the fact that even after the november 2020 tyre model upgrade tyre behaviour on the limit is still lacking  theres seldom any mini corrections when driving on the limit  lateral traction seems very onoff kerbs also remain thoroughly unforgiving way more so than in real life where theyre often part of the racing line

as a minor aside this game is an absolute system resource hog compared to other games  yes it can look better but its poorly optimised compared to other engines on the market and i suspect thats why the vr experience seems inferior 

sadly i struggle to recommend this game to anyone who doesnt have a fulltime vacuum in their life for learning a race sim

#####

all of the difficulty and frustration of elden ring but in a shiny car 1010

#####

fantastic graphics amazing sound stunning effects and atmosphere of gt cars every track is laser scanned and presented in full details best track models in all sim games ffb feels great just hope for more tracks in the future maybe new cars highly recommended to every sim racer worth every euro kudos to kunos

#####

very nice i drive they crash into me i lose sr i sad because they get fast lap i not but is fun

#####

only took me one race to see that this is a thousand times better than iracing infinitely cheaper and the gameplay is far more fair and balanced

#####

better than gt7

#####

one of the best competitive sim racing games driving system is great graphic is amazing engine sounds are raw very realistic and beautiful ai drives like it should be and the game is getting more and more content multiplayer has very good netcode the game has leagues and pretty big community apart from in game multiplayer every game has some problems but acc is definitely worth a try if you are a fan of gt3 series or even gt4 you cant miss this game its also casual friendly because there is a career mode singleplayer championship and events i recommend you to play it on the steering wheel for the best experience 

#####

solid racing game that offers stunning visuals combined with superb vehicle physics single player ai is easy to drive with but lacks skill in specific sections of each track if the difficulty is lowered from max schumacher s on nurburgring for example it seems they are programmed to lose all of their time in that specific section multiplayer can have some amazing races especially as you increase your saftey rating it does seem that no matter the skill level of the drivers around the first turn is always a mess use your mirror and you can usually avoid the carnage the dlcs are absolutely not required but there are a few amazing tracks in the first dlc controller is a viable way to play but a wheel will give you a significant control advantage all in all i would definitely add this game to your racing collection

#####

good sim racing game not for people who are looking for arcade like driving

#####

ive tried out quite a few racing games before i got to this one the biggest question was whether i buy assetto crosa ac or ac competizione acc and im sure you have this question as well the answer as it usually should be is it depends ac is good if you have an hshifter or want to try a wide variety of cars acc i feel is a lot more authentic in nature and refined than the original ac personally acc has quickly become one of my favorite racing games due to its realism if you own a wheel this is a must own

acc has rock solid bgameplayb everything from the car handling force feedback acceleration traction control and racing line are done right as someone whose put many hours on f1 and had a tough time playing anything else this game has fully shifted my focus it just feels right all around to jump in a game is very simple as there are servers constantly running practices or skipping them running qualifying or skipping them too and races there are a decent amount of cars to choose from and all feel very different especially if a wheel is being used if you played the original ac youll notice the racing line wasnt done right at all the racing line here is very accurate and true to the speed of the car the paddle shifting also feels authentic and there is no better feeling that downshifting at the right time 

career mode of course is available in the game the cutscenes in the game try to hype the player further about getting into the racing scene its actually pretty nice as the first race will evaluate what level youre at as a driver and try to set the difficulty according to your preliminary results this game is extremely picky on being a good driver any sort of collision is punished and ranked mode is not available until youve proven your a safe and reliable driver it will take quite a few races to build up your safety rating car control and trust rating the better the race the better the chances of increasing the rating lap to lap careful though any collision be it on purpose or not both drivers will be punished it is a little unfair when racing with new racers online but thats the nature of acc

the bvisuals and graphicsb are pretty good they arent top notch but more or less everything is quite defined the cars look pretty solid during cutscenes and on the menus the interiors of the cars seem very detailed down to the airvents why is that important no idea just what stuck out the damage to the cars are also quite realistic and will effect the abillity to drive them smack a wall too hard and not only will you see the damage but your steering wheel might be stuck at a 45 degree angle due to the collision the bsounds and musicb were pretty well done the sounds of the engines all sound different and very authentic there is nothing like making a sports car sound like a jet engine

overall i would highly recommend this game on sale or not this is one of those games in which you purchase a gaming wheel for competitive or not the game does find a happy balance where you can compete if youre looking for a serious racer where others respect your racing line this game should be on your list the more the merrier when friends race alongside you i would recommend to the devs to put a little bit of a reward system for the multiplayer in regards to points f1 will let you set up lobbies and accumulate points wouldnt be a bad idea here and please make the possibility of hosting a server a little easier

disclaimer this review is being made as a warning for anyone who is planning on playing this game in vr doubly so if you have an oculus quest 2 i fully intend on playing this game more in the future but based on my current experience with the game i would advise anyone playing on vr to steer clear of this game

to recap my time with the game so far
after 3 hours of tuning the games graphics settings watching multiple youtube tutorials tuning my graphics card settings tuning the oculus software settings tuning my fan profiles and overclocking my gpu the game is now just barely clear enough that i was able to complete the opening career assessment practice at monza of course the very next part of the career mode had rain making everything a blurry unplayable mess again guess its back to tuning the graphics for me

silver lining though the original assetto corsa project cars 2 and dirt rally 2 all of which had almost flawless performance right out the box btw now look unbelievably gorgeous and i have a new found appreciation for a developers ability to properly optimize their game to run in vr

#####

eat
sleep
acc
repeat

#####

enjoy the experience of tryharding a track for a week until being tenths off from the world record just to get disqualified in a 24 hours race for reversing too much in the pitlane because you couldnt find your slot

nah actually it is my favourite simulator it will make you suffer but just like any other

#####

simply the most immersive and most detailed gt3 racing simulation out there today the recently published update v11 brought all cars and tracks from the 2019 blancpain gt3 series as a free update so you have plenty to choose from and each car drives noticeably different they allegedly even had access to real gt3 teams setups how awesome is that the improvements since early access version 07 are really massive

uprosu
 great level of detail in simulation
 laser scanned tracks
 most detailed car interiors and exteriors you will find in a racing sim
 great ai that also does the random error or mistake
 lovely daynight cycle and rain simulation the spray in the night is worrying at least 
 great sound and acoustics in general
 extreme attention to detail in physics simulation
 plenty of setup changes can be made motec integration for the experts out there
 many active online racing communities who organize high quality leagues for acc

uconsu
 quite resourcehungy as its a next generation sim really
 servers currently still limited to 30 cars per track would love to do spa24h with more cars
 easy to overwrite setups saveload button not separated come on has been requested for ages now in the ui

i am simracing since more than 20 years and have not ever felt that attached to one of the simulations out there as i feel to acc this thing is just amazing

#####

this is by far the most realistic sim racer out there period
the little pings and cracks you can hear in the cockpit are insanely good and its one of the only sim games you feel like you can actually improve in 1010

#####

acc is the best racing sim that ive driven since the latest update i have been racing sims since f1 1998 and pretty much everything up till now rfactor 2 iracing and the first assetto corsa were at the top in the past decade in my humble opinion but i think acc takes it to the next level especially if you have a higher end sim rig with direct drive wheel base and a good set of pedals acc started off as a turd burger but rose from the ashes and now shines bright obviously this is subjective based on the type of racing vehicles and tracks you like one thing that i wish they can improve is the vehicle damage both visually and how it affects the cars while driving just a little thing but can always be made better with later updates i guess oh ya forgot to mention f1 2020 which i think is the best of the f1s all around kinda weird that you cant buy it any more since ea bought codemasters just saying this is the first time writing a review for anything on steam so take it for what its worth stay safe and see you on the track

#####

if you want to play ranked races you need to buy dlc this should be illegal

#####

best gt3  gt4 simulator out there i just wish it had nordschleife and lemans

#####

this review is based off the vr performance i am sure the base game is great however i only really run vr anymore with my rig

on a 1080ti with all settings to low shadows off aa off mirrors off and 100 resolution the game still fails to run at 80 fps on my index and failed to maintain 90 fps on my previous vive while looking muddy and pixelated i purchased this game based off the original  which runs fantastic in vr however over the last year i have spent all 6 hours of my game time messing with settings trying to get it to run

if you primarily play in vr avoid this game as it runs terribly compared to the other sim racers on the market

#####

hehe car go vroom hehe

#####

bro my nuts  be hard when i play this fr

#####

i would buy it i would recommend it and i wouldnt mind to not buy it on sale this sim is a gamechanger brings sim racing to the next level with advanced physics models graphics and the way gt cars handle the road really leaves you speechless  you wont want to race on any other sim and youll  forget about racing games and fall in love with racing sims

a huge negative our favorite track nurb nord is nowhere to be found and they can add it for practicehotlaps but have not as real sro teams use it for practicetraining as does the acc team so we should be allowed to have it for the same purpose

#####

night and rain was missing so bad to assetto corsa now thats fixed and the blancpain series is so awesome looks how great it is

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1510689810
the final release could be could be the race sim im looking for so many years there are so great sim around but all of them have pros and cons this one could be the almost perfect game im waiting tracks and cars number should be a little small because of the official licence but if mods are allowed and hopefully assetto corsa compatible the game will become the best

edit 

#####

versioin 100

quality of simulation
this acc simracing game is a joke even a gtr2  fia gt racing game 2006 doing better job then this because this have a blancpain gt tittle on it i want to know what is this all about but in the game not a single word talk about the race itself even the rules

quality its not about graphic or how good the game engine is
for sim racing grade game at least it have to education people about what blancpain gt is
in this acc i could not find any info about the cars glossary or theory about this race and most important thing the rules
even i have 800 hrs with projectcars 2 i still fail the first pitstop in acc because there no mention you must change tires

simulation ok that mean you need to setup your car right
when i look at the dampers in car setup page bump and rebound what is the numbers mean i know these number must be how stiff or soft fast or slow
but in acc its empty no kg no nm no cm no mm no force no meaning how do i simulation and setup the car by guess what im doing

in game ui control i just dont understand why we cant setup  bind pitstop menu buttons to keyboardit take 6 keys on the wheel

i cant recommend this game atm this still need lot of work to improve the game play experience

#####

i drive

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2428015995
assetto corsa competizione is first of all an excellent racingsim
the physics are really great the handling feels real and heavy
in my opinion not a sim for beginners
good atmosphere because of the graphics and in my opinion by far the best sound in simracing so far i usually play project cars 2 or gran turismo sport on ps4 both re great but assetto has some speacial features i really enjoy like all the new gt3 models really awesome graphics the graphics are amazing but require a serious overpowered pc to get epic spec graphics or even some lovley tracks
the career mode is very narrow compared to project cars 2 but functions fine in this category specific title car numbers should never be a factor since you know what you get in racing titles

my question to you is either 600 cars that all feel the same or 30 cars that are full of character 

this title is clearly the later and portrays them all very well great job kunos 
still you can find some heavy bugs but i really think that with time this will be an epic racingsim

if u have a steering wheel i have logitech g923 with trueforce technology this is a must have

its a hard game but every clean lap every win every overtake is satisfying and awarding the game is not moddable but there are a lot of awesome cars and awesome tracks dlcs are worth the money too for me 

#####

if you race in vr skip this game and play the old assetto corsa it is a good game to drive but in vr the graphics are blurry there is a fix but that reduces the frames to 40fps and introduces massive ghosting i have an oc 7700k 16gb ram and gtx1080ti and play on low settings but still

#####

i bought this game to support the devs after they delivered a great product of assetto corsa before through early access this game while having only 1 track and 1 car you can see that it is very well polished and visibly an improvement over the previous asseto corsa i had no issue with my g29 physix and realism continues from the last one which is considered one of the best in the sim racing genre but the textures for now seem a little bad they can be enhanced

#####

plz add sex

#####

ideal for beginners and veterans  very fair dlc pricing specialy compared to other sim racers the best graphics of all current sim racers on the market while maintaining good performance awesome sounds and every car is truely unique

but it also has some negative points i think are necessairy to point out
 driver rating system is flawed
 online servers are community driven  no free coop racing with friends against ai
 car and track selection is a bit small  specialy without dlcs
 occational small freezes during races which are very annoying
 searching for setups can lead you into paid subscriptions  look for free ones on youtube instead

recommended but dont pay full price for the base game

#####

a major tone shift compared to assetto corsa acc offers a far better racing experience out of the box at the expense of a specialized system im still disappointed that they eliminated modding and got rid of a lot of what made assetto corsa great but ultimately acc is a solid fleshed out title

if you are looking for decent organized races then there are plenty of communities that will allow you to race in leagues or organized events public lobbies can be very hit or miss but be careful for turn 1 at monza

#####

cars go vroom 1010

#####

trash for vr players
the menu apears behind you with a font size thats like an atom
braking is awkward it is set to max by default but i feel like im braking 50 and if i push my pedal harder i fear it might snap
weird problems which i tried to resolve and because that took 2 weeks i am now stuck with a useless title

edit
i contacted their support and their bot deemed my questionissue gameplay related and answered my email automatically by saying gameplay related quiestions will not be answered and they will not email me back about this issue
i will never buy or recomend a game that has to do with this publisher if this is the policy
unacceptable

#####

ive only played for so long and completely sold on this sim ive run project cars 1 2 iracing raceroom and a few others in the past and would always hit a wall be it compatibility ffb frame rate whatever they all get them and the only thing other reviews seem to get right is the optimization for vr i dont crash but i cant do it at 30fps so ill have to live with the standard

the controls are very well thought of similar to what rr has but a bit easier to setup the ffb is very simplified which reminds me of pc2 but it is dialed in to get you what you need for reading the car i can see that being a solid solution for the devs since they would have less to worry about when it comes to fans making ini tweaks controller i havent tested but i dont really think that makes sense to use since this was easily meant to be a sim and there are many other sources that will state that driving a sim with a controller has no meritor something

the visuals are a lot more than what i would have expected unfortunately it is a rather tall order on the hardwarei think currently my pc only utilizes 5 gpu peaks with a power draw of 60w and 6gb when it should be 220w i still hit 60fps without too much trouble and im pretty sure theres potential to be had its true that people have trouble sitting at the menu but i only recently turned of fullscreen optimization that windows loves to sneak in there easy to forget but very important

ai i havent gotten around to with much time but they seem very smooth theres no obvious point of deliberately running off course or smacking into each other as a catch up logic which most racing games seem to resort to these days it was very refreshing to compete with these guys and given the part where i have no time to look through forums for more dedicated servers this is very promising of all the games ive played these could well be the best when it comes to situational awareness and competence if there is a catchup i sure cant see it but somehow 505 seemed to crack the secret code on how to make that perfect pace with you its very niche

the physics themselves feel prettycomplete i only drove a couple cars for a few hrs but never picked up on anything that would just feeloff everything makes sense and feels logical along with the tunes the tips next to the parts you see dont go into detail which i also prefer too often you see a game where multiple people have built but all have their own understanding of what those tunes are supposed to do effectively deceiving you and proving that not the whole developer team was really working together

the sound i cant give a solid analogy since i havent been to a race track in forever i wouldnt know what sounds realistic any better than what you find on youtube but its definitely solid work i get a hint that it was designed to be accurate not just immersive although theres only one note to be made and thats the backfire from the exhaust i dont suppose it happens as often as this and not quite so loud but it doesnt take away from the rest of the experience so much thats its a distraction just a tad repetitive

almost forgot lmao idk why everyone keeps complaining about the driver animation ive only just bought this but read many reviews before hand there is nothing wrong with the wheel calibration secondly there is a calibration in the menu for steering range again nothing wrong with it detecting my fanatec neither so stop complaining and get a real rig before you # about a game thats meant for one

with that note id like thank you all for going through this ridiculous review hope it helped

#####

i personaly dont really like this game but i think it is really good if you want a competitive multiplayer gt3 racing game but i personaly prefer assetto corsa because of the variety of the cars maps and because of the mods as i dont really care about multiplayer on thise kind of games as i mostly want to have fun

#####

warning 
only get this game if you like gt3dtm class racing otherwise there is nothing in this for you
the cars and handling look sound and feel probably the best ive ever experienced in sim racing everything internally in and outside the cab shakes jangles and knocks unlike any other game ive experienced

no matter if you have hundreds of hours at sim racingthis game will make you feel like you suck ass

#####

after playing assetto corsa i decided i wanted a more hardcore sim game i bought acc and am amazed at how well this game plays

ill start with the pros

very easy to get the hang of but it will take time to master
the ai are pretty good in my time of playing definite upgrade from ac
the tracks are very enjoyable 
you dont need to pay more than the base game to enjoy it
 the ui is very easy to navigate

cons

lack of cars you can buy more in the dlcs they provide but for the base game you only get gt3 cars


#####

the best sim for gt3 racing

#####

someone rammed into my car like an idiot i thought my wheel was broken and the impact screwed the calibration and i was compensating for the wheel turns out the impact screwed up my alignment and then i realized why the wheel felt so familiar as it resembled so accurately how my benz felt after a fender bender one pit stop later and i was gucci 

simulation dos not stop here 

if you find yourself caught in the rain on slicks then you can pick up the marbles of rubber which have come off other cars at the corners and braking zones

the marbles help create channels for water to flow out from underneath the tire thus allowing for you to get more rubber in contact with the tarmac

now that is simulation 

#####

this game has come from far and now in 2020 this game is going to fly
one of the if not the best gt3 sims out there

#####

get steering wheel become slav driver
boris approved

#####

being able to race gt3 cars in a virtual blancpain series is a very clever idea from kunos its mirroring the actual series and it draws you in to their world the cars feel great and with wonderful tracks leading to some great racing 
racing with a properly setup wheel the ffb is very good giving you very good feedback on what is happening with the car i have put quite a lot of hours into this sim and the more it progresses the more i like it
i recommend this sim to anybody of a simracing nature and with the history kunos have with ac1 assetto corsa competizione is in very good hands

#####

the high watermark for serious sim racing with the exception of dedicated servers this game has all competitors beat hands down  and at a price point anyone can afford

#####

transitioning from f1 2020 this felt so good ffb wise and physics wise
just wish there is a better understanding or tutorial how game works


#####

now this is a game that is really difficult to review there are som gradings here that is going in opposite directions the driving simulator in itself is fantastic if you are into these types of racing simulators you will love this one it is really fun to drive and feels realistic cant ever be sure since im not a car owning millionaireone thing that sucks more than in any other game published the last 20 years is the multiplayer aspect

im not talking about the multiplayer experience that you get in iracing with races being automatically scheduled every 30 mins or so 

im talking about the more primitive multiplayer experience where you can login and perhaps see that your friend is also logged in and join that friends server

im talking about the multiplayer experience in where you could perhaps even offline compare your laptimes with your friends

im talking about the multiplayer experience where you could even see if a friend is playing at all

none of these things exist in acc no multiplayer features that promotes driving with friends
you can join servers but you will be playing with strangers


when it comes to servers there are no filtering options there exist some nonfunctioning weighting options that are quite uselessyou cant for instance filter out servers that you arent allowed to play on because you might lack some skill stat
insane

if you love racing simulators have no friends and dont mind jumping into servers without any control this is the game for you

#####

amazing game
good graphics nice gameplay nice online community really a nice game
i just wish they added more cars like lmpgte cars for more enduro races and tracks like lemans and nordschleife would make the game so much bigger and fun but im really excited what this game can bring us over the years

#####

bought acc in 2018 and with my dusty trusty g25 the game was brutal and a bit of fun never could get in the rhythm and put consistent laps together so i shelved the game 
now ive recently upgraded to a fanatec direct drive loadcell and little folding rig and wow incredible feeling in this game more than any other sim game ive played i can feel the limit save the car from a spin and actually put competitive times down and have great battles i am no longer sbinalla but now a smoooth operator
1010

#####

greate game is a little bit hard when you are new to racing games great graphics and amazing sound would recommend this game to others i started playing this game with a ps4 controller and moved to a logitech g923 steeringwheel  padels was really expensive but you will get a great experience from it

car goes wroom wroom and i like

#####

this review is based only on the vr port 
i played this game 8 hours if you call trying to fix vr settings playing only because i couldnt believe a nice game like this will have a so bad vr port its not only fps its the quality i tried everything preset settings low settings everything max and the quality was just bad i have rtx 3080 ti i played half life alyx hellblade and project cars 2 everything maxed at settings with average 100 fps and they looked like real life 

tldr  i wasted 8 hours of my life on this game that i cant even refund because i couldnt believe the vr port was that bad and i thought i was doing something wrong ask me anything

#####

learned more about true racing in 20 hours of playing competizione than in the previous 300 hours of riding assetto corsa

the swap to the unreal engine gives the track a greater depth and feel the weight of the cars physics and traction are represented in ways that just dont exist in the older engines used by sim racers perhaps maybe this can be part explained by the vr exploiting that depth of vision and the bucket seated sparco racing rig adding to the feeling its more than that though those things existed in the 300hrs of ac you now hear and feel the wheels spinning up if you over do the gas your grip wasting away on your tires making ever more demand to get your line and throttling right the physics engine exploits absolutely everything the wonderful engine notes demand your attention and speak to what your getting wrong or right

all of that has schooled me more in 20 hours in the last week over anything gone before i needed to see and feel those things i was getting wrong and in that competizione is an absolute triumph

this is a review i wasnt going to write until they did the full release but last night everything above finally clicked after racing 20 minutes of zolder in multiplayer only finished 9th but it was 20 minutes of everything i learned over the last week that put me in a group that finished within 2 seconds of each other

technically theres a ways to go to improve performance i run vr and it took a 2080ti steamvrs motion reduction and running steamvrs density scale at 20 to get it running smooth and looking to about 75 of what pcars 2 does without the 90fps because i dont have to induce motion smoothing for a default 45

i think thatll work itself out over time with improved technology rendering techniques and efforts from kunos to refine performance of everything theyve bolted together

competizione might be a crafted product that might not appeal to all the sim racing communities but in truth its as much a bridge to the future for kunos and a bloody good reference for all developers that need to look at what kunos are getting right

#####

the best car racing game its better then iracing because this is so much cheaper you could buy all the dlc and it will still be cheaper then iracing get it now

#####

as a beginner easy to get tired physically from all the concentration and mistakes you make that is why it is so addictive as soon as you learn to appreciate all those little 0035s from your personal best laps 

#####

i would like to preface this review with the fact that this game feels and drives excellent my couple of hours in it have contained some of the best ai racing ive ever personally experienced in any sim and the driving out of the box is on point

that said i cant recommend it as my main way of racing is in vr i should have realized just how bad vr is in this game but people online never made it sound that bad
its a blurry unstable mess

i am running on a 3080ti on a quest 2 headset at near max resolution and even with 100 resolution scaling in the game cars that are just slightly ahead of you become super blurry blobs of color in order to obtain an acceptable framerate the mirrors are low fps and super blurry rendering them just barely usable on top of that the lighting and colors are the most flat and boring thing ive seen in ages even assetto corsa without csp and with just a native postprocessing filter looks better than this

my understanding is that if you race on monitors you will have none of these problems sure the game takes a beefy pc to run but with its relatively new fsr and dlss support some of that can be negated that way so if you love gt3 racing and you do not use vr go ahead and get this game its awesome however if like me you mainly or exclusively race in vr youre better off skipping this one as of version 18 unfortunately

#####

yes

#####

if someone told me a year ago that 92018 im going to fire up ac2exe on my machine i would punch them in the face and call them a dirty filthy liar for getting my hopes up

the dark souls of racing what else can i say i kept punishing myself while driving during a storm it was unforgiving it was brutal i was simply loving it i definitely recommend this game especially when i consider that on my i7 6700  gtx1080 it runs performancewise like it was v10 already  smooth as butter  impressive work

#####

add fiat doblo dlc

#####

car

#####

having always considered myself a gamer and having enjoyed the early car sims like the original test drive i admit i am very late to the party with sim racing havent spent a day at silverstone circuit driving single seaters i took the plunge with this after having enjoyed assetto corsa all i can say is that the detail is incredible from the graphics to the physics to the incredible sound it is just sooooo addictive trying to learn and nail each circuit and then comes your first race exciting and intense i would say give it a go

#####

cars tracks physics are all top notch but typical kunos they cant design a intuitive ui for sht one of the main point of acc is authentic gt3 experience thats include properly perform pit stop do yourself a favour and search online of how to pit in acc and you can see a lot of confusing players notice that in blancpain gt there are straight regulations of when to pit and what needs to be done tyre change driver swap refuel depends on the length of the race and every time when i fail something in the pit i will face a dq after some research online i thought i start to understand it and tonight it was my third attempt trying to complete my first race in career mode it was a spring race the pit menu came up and indicate i need to perform one thing on the menu i choose tyre change and left all unchecked turn off the engine for my pit crew to start then another small menu pop up saying that my pit request was invalid and after playing with the menu again i realised that i was actually required to perform one task plus a driver change while all the ai cars was gone and i went to the last position another attempt wasted is it too difficult for kunos to include a briefing before the race something simple like a written text on the loading screen so players wont waste their time guessing what needs to be done if they want their game to be so authentic and behold with all the straight regulations not to mention their god awful pit menu which will only pop up only when entering the pit even the old simbin race07 did this better which you can bring up the pit menu anytime you want on the track and while in the pit others ai cars also stop in my box so i had no idea if those pit crew were working on my cars or not if you want it to be authentic kunos do it right what a frustrating experience it is we are gamers just trying to enjoy a good sim why do we have to spend hours searching online and reading all the regulations just to do something that you should include in some form of tutorial

#####

edit as of updated 18 vr in acc is a lot better than my original review stated below its not completely crystal clear but the depth of field is much better than it was before would recommend testing it out on a free weekend or pick the game up for 11 when it is on sale

original review
if you are a vr racer like myself i cannot recommend this the vr depth of field and graphics are up there with the worse i have seen in a racing game i could not judge any of the corners properly nor see two car lengths ahead the menus look great in vr but the graphics are all fuzzy im running a 2070 super 3700x and the valve index fps was stable

i was really looking forward to this game would have loved this game otherwise but vr racing is my only option with how my simrig is setuphopefully they fix the vr because id like to play this game

games that do vr racing correctly iracing rfactor2 and project cars 2

edit see the comments for making it slightly better but not up to par with the games listed above

#####

most realistic sim that exists for consumers

#####

strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoy gt3s incredible graphics and a nice friendly ui

all of the dlc is worth it and reasonably priced too



#####

i havent played a game in a long time that actually hooks me and makes me play it for hours everyday when i come back to it its casual and it can also be serious too with competition servers and leagues hosted

the good gives you a good selection of cars that you can choose from and they all feel different the learning curve is not too big or too small the sounds are amazing performance is also good as long as you have decent specs obviously i probably get like 4550 frames but i cant notice it because i am always so focused on driving even if the server is full i dont notice any stuttering only when people are connecting to the server thats basically it i probably wouldnt recommend this game if you had an i5 processor

i did use a controller for the game for 100 hours and its not bad at all once you adjust the settings for it still puts you at a disadvantage against others who have a wheel but i can still get top 10s and put together good races the only issue that ive found for using controllers is that you cant change the shift up button needs to be on default otherwise you will get a shifting bug this is for xbox one controllers

multiplayer is alright in most servers they have a required safety rating in order to join which basically filters out inexperienced drivers depending on how high its set which is nice so you can basically have beginner servers and intermediate servers anything can happen during online races people can accidentally hit you and your car will become damaged if not severely damaged to the point where you have to basically leave the race since its part of the rule book you have to pit in and they give you 3 laps to do so or you are disqualified you can be caught up in an intense battle with others i wish the servers would include a more variety of weather conditions instead of having a dry hot track all the time

this part was revised on 11142020
the bad career mode is boring even though you have longer races and different weather environments the ai dont make any mistakes the only three things singleplayer is good for is getting your safety rating up if needed warming up before online races and testingpracticing which is something i do quite often its not really worth playing career mode in my opinion do championship mode instead because you can make some adjustments

the ugly doesnt give out a guide related to the rule book and it doesnt really explain pit stop rules you have to figure out those things on your own like one time i forgot to add fuel in my car during an endurance race in singleplayer because fuel consumption doesnt work in singleplayer and it will give me a harsh penalty that would basically put me in last even though i was in 4th doesnt give you an are you sure you want to quit box when you hit quit i accidentally quited my endurance race in singleplayer because there wasnt such a thing

and finally i would like to play multiplayer whenever i want with people in the servers but since i live in america i cant play in the evenings because most of them would be asleep the majority of the players are european so if you are way outside of europe like me then there are only certain times you can play multiplayer with everyone in it not a problem for me but it is something that should be noted

put down constructive criticism in comments please so i can make this review better

#####

for someone who just got their first wheel this game provides a really steep learning curve and the all the setting around the wheel functions car setting and all can be pretty confusing but after collecting some experience in other games and watching some instructional videos i finally made some progress in my play style and ability to actually do some good and consistent laps but it can be really frustrating at the beginning id almost say rather try a different sim like raceroom which you can play for free and get some experience and to mess with your cat settings to get a feeling for it it certainly helped me on my way to be a little bit relevant in acc
that said however acc is certainly worth getting and trying out the cars are brilliantly made each one is different feels different handles different and more i went through the cars to find those that suit my and my driving style and there are quite a few cars to choose from it really takes a lot of trial and error but is very rewarding when you finally start to do well and understand your car its also a pleasure to listen to the cars soundtrack great tracks as well just a real pleasure
id only appreciate a little easier way to get my safety rating and be able to try my hand on ranked racing

#####

not as open as assetto corsa but definitely an upgrade in physics audio and video and the online racing ratings make racing on public servers a whole lot more fun than ac is realpenalty doesnt stop people from ramming you off track in ac but in acc the ratings do help tone that down a lot 

i really wish ac2 combines the good parts of acc with the moddability of ac because the community made tracks and cars still make that an amazing sim

#####

 very good ai
 very good multiplayer
 outstanding tire model
 a good selection of 10 soon 11 and later 15 tracks all laser scanned and very well polished
 excellent ffb
 excellent vr after some tweaking
 excellent graphics daynight cycles weather

 only gt3 cars on offer

in short if you like gt racing solo or against others this is the game to get its also kunos so itll age like a fine wine over the coming years


#####

great game great deal on cdkeys

#####

i dont write long reviews i seldom write them at all i am also a midlevel skill wise player on a good day plus i have less than 40 hours into this game so if you read on just take that in mind

i do not recommend this game to anyone who wants to jump into career mode and play until they win a championship in fact  it seems career mode is somewhat of an afterthought and most players i know not that many really ignore it entirely

the people who should buy this are ones who fancy themselves real race car drivers either to show that you really do have talent or very quickly prove otherwise the realism is pretty much off the chart which means aids that some titles have even when you turn aides off will show you that youve been using a crutch all along some of the realism might go too far like the argument that ffb does not indicate tire adhesion well duh in a real car the steering wheel doesnt vibrate but im sitting in an office chair on wheels anyway if you want more sim and arcade this game right here is probably for you 

tldr  theyve removed all the cade they could from this sim

#####

the ultimate gt simulator

#####

my last 20 hours of playtime 70h atm were very intense and i had a deep dive into the physics
i was playing around with car setups and had more and more great results in various cars
by now i think i can create good setups with motec tuned dampers and all that
i usually start all my setup work with the aggressive preset which is different for every track
first thing to do is to get the tyres on proper levels then its about the car to feel good
while the game is very profound in this regard my disappointment came with the porsche 911 ii gt3r
in the end the porsche was fast and stable but the more i got it right the more it feels like raceroom
on the one hand this is nice as it shows how good the sims actually are but that is also my point of criticism
without proper car setups the most cars are not competitive and getting the setups right is heavily time consuming and complicated
therefor acc is not driver friendly but forcing the racers to become a mechanic in order to get competitive
however get the game its fun and a bargain compared to irng

#####

update at release steam reviewers are the biggest bunch of whining babies  they love to tank a games reviews just because of one little insult they cant forgive  this time everybody is mad because they expected something which kunos bneverb claimed the sim would have  would scheduled races be nice  sure  is it worthless without them  nope  the rating and matchmaking systems will become more effective as people spend more time with the sim  your experience with early access multiplayer means very little  even if you think it should have had scheduled races the value thats included for the price of purchase is far beyond what any other sim offers update 

h1this purchase is a nobrainer for any sim racer  full stoph1  whether that applies to you depends on your definition of sim racer and whether you include yourself in that group  

i could go on and on about all of the reasons why i think acc is and will be the best racing sim ever  if you have specific questions i can answer in the comments  but mostly i want to recommend reading the blogs about the driver rating systems part 1 httpswwwassettocorsanetforumindexphpthreadstheaccratingsystempartiwewanttohelpyouimprove50766   part 2 httpswwwassettocorsanetforumindexphpthreadstheaccratingsystempartiilongversion51975 

basically those blogs offer brilliant solutions for every major complaint ive ever had or heard about iracing  

the tracks are laserscanned the cars and physics are on par with iracing if not better and the driver ratings are genius  

to make a brief comparison of the physics iracing makes the car feel very light and forgiving compared to acc  with acc you feel the weight of the car and the effect it has on your traction  the end result is that i have to be much more precise with my inputs and much more conscious of all the factors that influence traction  a few people complain that it doesnt feel realistic but theyre actually complaining that it isnt as easy as other sims theyve played  

with iracing i am able to get away with things that probably should have caused me to lose control  and overall its too easy to go fast especially in cold temps  its surprising for myself to say that because i thought iracing was brutal when i first started about 3 years ago  but ive learned many things since then and acc simply feels more true to life  comparing lap times at nurburgring gp  in iracing i can do 15051 pretty easily in a gt3 car maybe even 149 with quali fuel  in acc i think the best ive done is 155 maybe 154 in ideal conditions  i dont have the real life gt3 experience to compare with but that seems about right to me  i probably shouldnt be able to do lap times within 12 seconds of irl professionals though id love to believe im just that good   

so again for any sim racer this is a nobrainer  for gamers with gamepads im not sure i would recommend  and thats not meant to be an insult i just want to be clear that this is not at all like a forza or gran turismo  this one isnt made for gamers its made for sim racers

#####

best gt3 sim on the market blows iracing gt3s out of the water
join lowfuelmotorsportcom or similar for the iracing splits and safety rating type experience and youll be set

dlc are also reasonably priced 4 or 5 cars and tracks per dlc for the same price as 1 car or track in iracing

#####

update 24052022
boy oh boy after logging in 200 hours and started doing it competitively i have to say this is indeed the most realistic thing you can play yes i know the ffb is not the best out there but the simulation is insane the physics are also on the notsosane side

after patch 18 the game became even more realistic by the change of the tyre physics

1010 would still recommend if you want a sim experience like no other and if you are into gt3 and gt4 racing if you dont care for these disciplines then im afraid you have to avoid this title



it is one of if not the greatest sims of all time the handling model is really similar to the vanila assetto corsa but the physics the textures and the environment are tremendously improved

also nighttime and rain are here babes it is really scary driving with your lights off in a rainy night

#####

great fun sim is constantly improving and provides great value for money soundsgraphicsphysics are the strengths as well as a good dev team

#####

sensational

probably the most accurate sim released

#####

i did not do very good but i had a lot of fun

#####

blue flag blue flag faster car approaching

#####

best simulation for gt3 cars

#####

wow awesome sim  i highly recommend the ffb is really close if not identical to iracing im in love

#####

the good
 the immersion especially in vr is breathtaking
 weather physics are a blast i dont really like racing in the rain but hot lapping or just messing around is fun
 very easy to setup nice and clean ui very easy to control with the buttons on the steering i have a fanatec p1 wheel
 ffb is spot on for me with very little tweaking
 quality content excellent cars and tracks am i happy they went with less content but better quality than the other way around
 the ai is decent better than what i experienced so far with other simracing titles
 the price is really fair worth every cent
 looks amazing on 4k though i dont race with a monitor

wished would be done better
 i only use my rift s for simracing and i am not very happy about the visual quality even though i have a decent rtx2070 i need to set almost everything to low just to attempt 80fps and even if i sacrifice the fps using asw still the image is really blurry would really benefit from better antialiasing and optimisations for vr at this moment it looks like an subunit supersampled original assetto corsa running on something like a ps3 can live with this but i own other titles that look so much better

i really hope they address this better soon because it is the only bad thing i can say about it honestly i did notice some small improvements with recent updates so they do seem to care about this feedback but the visual optimisations of this game are not yet where i hope will be

#####

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

excellent in every respect but could be more user friendly to noobs and have rules and tips posted on the opening menu this way one must waste a lot of hours and energy and rely on others to share tips

#####

as far as sim feel goesit does what it sets out to do but is console at heart i feel

this industry is due for a huge bubble burst  is it too much to ask to have a game complete and working as advertised  my journey with this game

bought into ea early access day one gamble
vr and optimizationcontrols etc  all terrible
waited months for the 10 with maybe 20 hours play
10 releases and vr a major feature was removed on release from the store page  whats even better is that they still have vr included and it is god awful dont buy for vr right now
on top of that there are so many bugs  

what are we as consumers  what are you as developers  honestly what game are we playing  i buy  you failthen blame me for whining  the free market is saturated with incompetence and especially this industry  dont release the game if it aint ready what sort of competent company whoever made decisions releases a game like this after putting in through ea to ensure quality nonetheless  

wowwow

#####

unreal game especially with clean racers

#####

great game for beginners such as myself great visuals however can be a bit gpu intensive

#####

one of the best games i have driven in terms of ffb physics sound and graphics probably the best actually for sound the ui is a bit buggy still but will most likely be sorted with hotfixes currently my favourite sim racing game

#####

very good just changed some keybinds and the game felt perfect straight away the safety rating system is ok lfm provides most of the multiplayer experience for the game

#####

quite a deep game and quite addictive if you were to compare to project cars 2 its inferior in some ways for example livetrack in pcars2 and the night driving isnt as well lit in acc and the variety of cars is lacking as you would expect from a gt series racer however it does make up for it in some regards with the realistic feeling handling that to me does feel better than pcars2 but not by a long way its the steady but slow progression you make getting faster and faster that makes you come back for more personally i feel the ai is done slightly better in pcars as i was rammed quite a lot when first starting out in acc however as you get faster the ai ram less i have a feeling that its just low speeds where your car can accelerate or decelerate much faster that gives the ai less chance to react team customisation is a great feature and the types of hotlapping and racing variations is very good overall as a pcars 2 fan im suitably impressed with acc and it definately is a game i will play alongside if not more than pcars 2

#####

its an awesome game it feels very nice on the wheel and the graphics are nice

its only an early access game but the vr performance is pretty terrible and theres no custom settings available thats a big no go

but im sure they will addfix these problems soon

edit they fixed the vr things i mentioned above it runs very smooth
triple monitor setup works very good as well

edit 2 version 14 is out and i love this game more and more d 3

edit 3 gt4 pack released very pleased with it i am getting into alot of leagues etc having alot of fun d

edit 4 imola update just released new cars new track just more and more fun new tire model is really awesome and tricky to get right but lots of fun as always  

edit 5 british dlc released 3 new tracks and just getting better everytime

#####

this is not a racing gamethis is a gt3 racing simulator and it is a good one 

#####

if you want to take assetto corsa more seriously than this is the right game for you but beware this game is is functional on controller but its not as smooth to setup and not as easy to use compared to normal assetto corsa i would seriously recommend a wheel for this game if you plan to take assetto corsa more seriously

#####

immersion at the next level  so many things to keep in mind for every race

i never thought id play anything but open wheelers but acc changed it forever and gave me a real appreciation for gt3 cars

its far from flawless  but most of the time its just beautiful

#####

unfinished game

#####

just trying to stay on the road lol the game is definitely worth the money though thoroughly enjoying it

#####

nissan gtr go vrum

#####

good

car goes brum

sitting there in the quiet car race countdown coming to 10s ignition on starter the engine roars up formation starts rolling out of the last corner towards the line your crewchief on the radio tells you green flag go and from there on forget everything floor the pedal and fight for thousands of a second

this game is a serious simulation be sure of this when you think of getting into it when you enter a corner you need to think about what each of your wheels is doing how the loads are distributed what each square of rubber can give you but still the entry is quite easy in my opinion there are three setups for each track and car combination a safe setup which you can use to get aquainted with the car a wet setup for rainy days and an agressive setup the latter being the one for me to focus on its a good base which will work even if you might optimize some bits here and there after a few laps when i got there hunting the green spot of the delta timer in hotlaps qualification runs or races time just began to fly by

right now a week before scheduled 10 release i really enjoy it functions are still limited but the overall is impressive a short breakdown

graphics given the right hardware it can look really good taa shows some ghosting in replays but it looks like this is hard to avoid with the unreal engine hardware is quite important driving at 4k and 70 scale my 1060 6gb is at the limit it works fine for me but it wont put out a lot more than 60 fps on high settings

controls i have only tested it with my g25 and for a short run with a fanatec wheel during the spa event last year feedback is convincing for me and provides the information i need

ai it might be that you need to do a restart every now and than but close racing can feel really good its important to set the strength correct i set it so that i can qualify mid field and its possible for me to gain about 13 positions with hard racing and not overdo it on the aggressiveness

atmosphere game changer in my opinion the sounds are one of the games highlights every rattle shake pump curb marbles wheelslip etc comes to the ears naturally running down the straight at nürburgring where ive been myself quite a few times looks as close as ive never seen it in a game

mp its been a huge point of discussion over the last days but for me the current system with weights works quite well after a short period of getting used to it for me this is enough for server selection during a session my experience regarding ping has been quite ok even though once i had a collision which a buddy of mine whom i raced with didnt notice also i get a short hiccup every now and than i guess it occurs when a car model needs to be loaded for a car that wasnt used in the session before

to make it short if you are interested in a serious simulation of an interesting gt3 series i can only advise you to go for it

#####

full of punters  expect to have damage of some sorts from lap 1

the game itself is great there is just no immediate punishment for people who break the rules  in dire need of an introduction of some form of real penalties for these type of racers

#####

h1edit vr on v18 h1 unfortunately v18 has stuffed vr performance again  cant recommend for vr until this is sorted

h1vr review pre v18 h1   changed review after updating to 12700k and using 3080 and modified ini files

after upgrading my cpu to the new intel 12th gen i have managed to get acceptable results and as such have changed my review

from all accounts this runs fine on a monitor  physics and sound are bang on

can only recommend this game to vr users with at least my hardware

#####

after being a project cars 2 fanboy acc takes realism to a whole new level just wish they would make the multiplayer aspect of acc to the project cars 2 level private lobbys please kunos just want to race my friends

#####

this is the first sim racing game that i play with proper equipment logitech g29 and rudimental racing seat and i just cant stop playing

the level of realism is insane graphically is superb while the possible choice of circuits could have honestly been bigger i hope some other circuits will be added in the close future even if they will probably be a nonfree extension

i suggest this game to all of those players out there that dont like to start playing and immediately start winning easily this game requires practice dedication and focus and thats also why i love it

#####

while the game boasts impressive graphics accurate physics and an extensive range of cars and tracks the damage model is a significant flaw

in the game the damage model is not as realistic as it could be allowing toxic and idiotic racers to continue a race even after ruining everyone elses race this can lead to frustrating game play experiences especially in online races where reckless drivers can cause significant damage and ruin the fun for others

one of the major issues with the damage model is that it does not accurately reflect the impact of collisions collisions that would cause significant damage in real life often result in only minor damage in the game while minor collisions can cause substantial damage this discrepancy can lead to frustration for players who expect a more realistic damage model

another problem is that the game does not always penalise drivers for reckless driving while the game does have penalty systems in place they are not always effective at discouraging reckless driving as a result some players continue to drive recklessly causing damage to other players cars and ruining the race for everyone involved

overall assetto corsa competizione is an excellent racing simulation game but the damage model is a significant flaw the games developers should consider updating the damage model to make it more realistic and effective at discouraging reckless driving until then players should be aware of the potential for toxic and idiotic racers and approach online races with caution

#####

go fast kick ass dont cut the track

#####

nice penalty systemphysical mechanicsdrive feels and gamepad playability

#####

for 25 i almost feel guilty

edit  for 25 i feel ripped off  wait for many updates and a massive sale this is not worth full retail pricing

#####

i always wondered what the fuss was around this game i tried ac quite some time ago and wasnt impressed but was perhaps early access period  shouldve picked it up again  a friend said how much fun he was having with acc price was reasonable so i grabbed it  were still friends   

seems like it is possible to configure pretty much anything as needed controls visuals view realism etc  feel is fantastic i have tried some amount of single player career tried all the tracks and cars quickly and did a couple of online races too  yes a couple of guys that probably pushed clutch instead of brake at corners but also many people interested in racing properly  some great adrenalin rushes  

ive noticed that it has something which keeps me engaged the visuals the info the feel all make me want to squeeze a few 10ths off the lap time try different things at different corners where you can immediately get an idea from the feedback if it was good or not  then start to string them all together in one lap  is actually quite addictive  enjoyment level with this game is very high and i hope it continues as i plan to use this one to improve my race skills finally attempt to do own car setups and take part in some real racing d

summary wow

#####

even though i have almost 80 hours of this game on record i cant recommend this game especially at full prize

kunos imposed a launch date on itself so the final release feels rushed the single player experience is ridiculous the lack of features like the possibility to let the ai drive after a driver swap or even pitstop animations is a killer for me as the development took a lot longer than expected and the final product feels a lot rushed many players are leaving the game that means the multiplayer servers are getting less and less populated

in the end this game still feels like an early access it pains me not to recommend it but id say you will have better value for money by subscribing iracing for three months if asseto corsa competizione becomes more polished by then then you should buy it

this is different to the original assetto corsa while yes there is imuuuuchi more content that is completely dependent on how good a mod is and more importantly how much youre willing to pay this game on the other hand perfect content across the board the ai for it as well holy shit they dont feel like theyre too weak or too strong theyre still ai of course but compared to the divebombing tunnelvisioned speeddemon ai that you have to deal with if you dont wanna play with other people they are good enough one thing i really liked was how customisable the cars and your character is theres a lot of colours a fair amount of pattern options and most importantly you can have your own number on your car

tldr expensive including the dlcs but 100b0b worth it if you want a good experience for gt racing would absolutely recommend for a good simracing experience

# the best racing simulator out there

tldr  i 100 recommend acc for anyone who wishes to drive the most advanced gt3 and gt4 soon cars in the world as close to reality as possible 

## what i like  
the graphics are sublime
the weather effects especially in the wet it looks and feels so right
the physics and attention to detail in the simulation is quite astonishing  the suspension behaviour tyre model and the feel of the car when flexing and bouncing is just great overall this game has the best physics of any racing sim i have ever played 
the look of the cars the look of the circuits the scenery mount panorama looks amazing it all looks extremely good

## what i dont like 
honestly there isnt much i dont like about the game or at least that i dislike enough to make a big deal out of it of course the game can get several improvements especially in the ease of use and general quality of life improvements  
letting codrivers change the setup and pit stop strategy while the other codriver is in the car 
add vote to kick in mp i believe its coming soon
maybe have some more user friendly ui when selecting custom set ups and so sometimes i get confused as to which set up is loaded in the car but maybe its me 

## what i love  
the community the guys over at kunos are absolute legends they love racing more than anything and you can feel this in the game aristotelis and the entire kunos team make a superb job keeping the game up to date bringing new features we never knew we needed to the game and just being great with the community the update posts on the forum the videos the events etc it all makes you feel like youre part of a great community 

thank you kunos simulazioni

stopped playing this for a while since my pc was struggling with it in vr  with the price of components my upgrade hasnt happened yet but with time to kill i decided to load up acc  wow  it runs well on my now older gtx970  something changed since the last time i played it  this game truly deserves to be tried out by anyone who enjoys sim racing  the sounds are great little details like driving by armco barriers alters the sound in car  i can just imagine how nice this game would be with a better pc but until that day comes i can still enjoy this game on my old dog of a computer

#####

car go brrm brrm very fast much wow

jokes aside a very good yet content limited simulator licensing works best with wheel mostly for online races  in my opinion single play is just there to be there and to have people learn the game

#####

i play 100 in vr  with a hp reverb g2 on a 3080gpu 100 resolution in forced reprojection mode game renders 45fps then vr fills in the gaps to create 90fps

vr update  same rig but using the latest opencomposite openxr to remove the need for steamvr i can now get rock solid 90fps with a full grid  its worth the effort of setting it up and tweaking to get there

yes its really badly optimized for vr and the unreal engine probably will never address this no i wouldnt recommend it in vr for anyone with less than a 3070 gpu or equivalent yes the original assetto corsa running sol looks better in many ways and runs far smoother never missing a beat at 90fps and highvery high settings

but tweaking the settings down a little and reducing antialiasing gets me to a place where i get zero frame drops even on a 20 car grid start and reprojection mode looks better in acc than many other vr games i play

once you get to this reasonably happy place you can finally start having fun the driving model sound design and force feedback are amazingly immersive its the little things like the noise of the brakes as you leave it late into turn 1 at monza the sound of the chassis and car floor as you cut over a kerb that you really should have avoided and the feeling of the back end trying to get away from you on overcooked tyres

the longer you play the more you see the skill and effort thats gone into it im just glad i persisted to get to a graphics setting that worked so that i can now appreciate why acc gets the praise it does

in the next few days dlss gets added too  so those lucky enough to have an rtx card should find it even easier to get to graphics settings that do the game justice

#####

the siim is amazingly detailed and it runs very smooth on older gpus using the fsr option
my gtx980 can run constant 60 fps with mostly high settings and taa at 1440p even with 20 cars on the track
no bugs no crashes everything loads very fast and the ui is quite intuitive

the ffb and physics can make even solo laps addictive

hats off to kunos

picked up assetto corsa competizione after my friend recommended i try it out i was feeling like project cars 2 was starting to feel stale both in terms of physics and general car feel i always hated how easy it was to skid out in project cars 2

im 13 hours into assetto corsa competizione having played a few endurance races and a majority with the audi r8 lms evo on nurburgring and i enjoy this game much more
the physics feel so much nicer braking steering and even abs and tc feel much more authentic tire pressure and temperatures also feel vastly superior to project cars 2s model
i know in this game that if i happen to make a mistake its entirely my own fault that forced it

my only complaint and im not entirely sure if its my roughnessaggressiveness in racing sims or its an ai issue is that the ai tend to be overlyaggressive ignorant of where you are there are times i take an alternate racing line to accommodate the ais racing line and respect their space but they overstep their own line and either take me out or force me to emergency brake i feel like i know enough about racing lines and racing safety that this isnt entirely my fault when these incidents occur these ai are on 0 aggression setting

nonetheless i still enjoy the game for what it is and can forgive the setbacks for the amazing physics and gameplay that it offers over other racing sims

as a fan of gt world challenge series and gt3 cars in general this game is awesome and is my main racing game from now on its everything i want in a racing simulator especially used with my logitech g920 racing wheel

#####

vr sucks but the physics and force feedback is pretty incredible  the casual lobbies are kind of hit or miss depending on the time that you hop in but when they work out they are incredible  i would love to see more optimizations so i can run vr on my rtx 3080 intel 10700kf 32 gb of ddr4 and reverb g2 but with crew chief and the dynamic radar its my favorite way to race online
