i never meet such a terrible online game company who only think how to grab money from the players all dayrun away from it

to foreign friends

war of the three kingdoms is called 三国杀 in chinese actually it is a good game in some ways but the operation company of online game is a piece of sht frankly speaking if you want to gain some powerful characters you can only spend a lot of money in the game otherwise your characters will be easily defeated by other players who spend a lot of money although maybe your play very very well it still cant take effect on the terrible game process

at first i want to talk about my experience when i was in primary school i have touched and fallen in love with this game after that i play this game with different friends in middle school and university of course we mainly played offline games playing physical cards this game carries many good memories of me even the online game have brought me a good gaming experience in the beginning i believe that other players who give negative reviews have similar experience as me 

but this online game operation have made a lot of inappropriate behaviors and always wants to earn money wholeheartedly this company made three different online game in china which have highly similar game name and game contentalmost completely same games but the data for these games are not interchangeable it is impossible to play with you friends online if your play in different games because you need to spend a lot of money and energy in one account the game is always full of activities that tempt the player to pay a lot of money which are criticized by many players now this game appeared in steam i glance over the game in general and feel that it is very similar to these games have published in china i dont know whether the game published data is interchangeable at least not with my previous game account

on the other hand war of the three kingdoms is still a good card game although players feel very disappointed and angry to the online game the voice acting and lines of characters is very good which connect to real historical figures and events on the whole the design of many characters in game is full of talent the skills of the game character is also connect to real historical figures whats more many players often joke that game operators should kowtow to game painters because their excellent paintings in my opinion offline games with physical cards are perfect to play with friends in addition foreign friends also have the opportunity to play this excellent board game because physical cards are available in english and have a proper prizebut i think its hard to find a player community of war of three kingdoms in foreign countries

i rarely try to review in english please forgive me if i make mistakes in grammar and expression if you are interested in the three kingdoms you can also add me

after graduating from college life of my friends and me became busy it has been a long time since i have played war of the three kingdoms with my friends offline

title war of the three kingdoms a disastrous turmoil

rating 

the game war of the three kingdoms is an absolute catastrophe a colossal misfire that should serve as a cautionary tale for aspiring game developers everywhere from its clunky mechanics to its mindnumbingly dull gameplay this abomination of a game is an insult to the very concept of entertainment

lets start with the graphics or lack thereof its as if the developers found a dusty old atari buried in their basement and decided to recreate its visual prowess the pixelated mess that passes for graphics in this game would have been unacceptable even in the 1980s i halfexpected to see pong paddles instead of historically accurate characters

speaking of characters dont expect any depth or personality from them they are more lifeless than a disassembled lego set sure they might have historically famous names like cao cao liu bei or sun quan but dont be fooled these cardboard cutouts lack any semblance of humanity and interacting with them feels like talking to a brick wall

the gameplay itself is a mindnumbing ordeal prepare to sit through endless hours of mindless clicking as you engage in battles that lack any strategy or excitement in fact id argue that watching paint dry would be more thrilling than the tedious button mashing this game calls combat its like the developers asked a group of kindergartners to design the mechanics and called it a day

but wait it gets worse the ai in this game is so laughably incompetent that youll question if it even exists picture this youre leading an army against a formidable enemy and suddenly their troops start running headfirst into trees or swimming aimlessly in rivers its as if the ai is playing a separate game of how to embarrass itself 101 congratulations to the developers for achieving the impossible creating ai that would lose a game of tictactoe against a potato

and lets not forget the gamebreaking bugs its a sad testament to the state of this disaster when the bugs are the only consistent thing about the experience from characters floating in midair to the game crashing more frequently than a drunk driver war of the three kingdoms sets a new standard for glitchy messes perhaps the developers were trying to create a metacommentary on the chaos of war but thats giving them far too much credit

in conclusion war of the three kingdoms is a monumental failure in every aspect its shoddy graphics lifeless characters mindnumbing gameplay incompetent ai and gamebreaking bugs combine to form a perfect storm of disappointment i wouldnt recommend this game to my worst enemy and if you have any regard for your sanity youll steer clear of this catastrophe save your time your money and your mental wellbeing by finding any other game on the market youll thank me later

i finally found the exit game option

the game company is going bankrupt now its just to cheat money the server is dying foreign players should pay attention to all kinds of bugs

writing this game a positive review so overwatch 2 can take its place

#####

游戏本身还过得去但是由没良心公司运营即贪心又不老实才导致一个曾经受玩家好评又有潜能的游戏变成今天这个下场
因为贪心元素也导致游戏武将强度不平衡等等问题免费玩不消费玩家倒是可试试看

game has potential but was ruined by greed and dishonesty of the publisher this results in poor balancing and lots of ridiculous microtransactions week after week good game to consider for casual play and stick to f2p

#####

greedy company and garbage game in a nutshell

#####

best game to play if you pay
worst gaming experience and unbalanced gameplay if you play it for free

三国杀每次卸载后又重玩然后记起当初为什么卸载的游戏
为什么曾经大杀四方的我越玩越菜
为什么别人都有那么炫的技能
为什么敌方怎么样都死不了
为什么同一个人物可以有n种卡牌长得还比我的好看
而我的主公只能不停地给别人送牌保命换牌
为什么
原来是因为我穷啊

dont miss it when passing by hang it on your computer for a moment and help us click on a negative review together



this game has extremely poor balance as long as you recharge you will obtain powerful characters without brains but the probability of obtaining them is very low slightly higher than that of a pig flying in the sky with this money its better for everyone to buy some other steam games




#the above content comes from machine translation the reason why english is used is that english is an international language after all i hope it can help more foreignersb

helping overwatch 2 stay as the worst reviewed game on steam

there has never been so much malice towards a game the game is happy even for civilian players thank the three kingdoms killing for letting me see the difference of the world

#####

there are serious bug issues that affect the balance of the game and the developers level is limited and cannot be repaired it requires a lot of money to play the game it takes about 10000 us dollars to barely play the game it is recommended not to play this game directly

out of my own curiosity i subjected myself to the abysmal experience that is war of the three kingdoms and it was absolutely horrible to call this game a colossal disappointment would be a severe understatement i cant emphasize enough how utterly horrendous my brief 15minute stint with this travesty was

first and foremost lets address the language barrier the game is entirely in chinese with not a single word of english in sight now im all for embracing different cultures but when i cant understand a single thing happening in the game it becomes a frustrating exercise in futility i dont need a translation for every dialogue box but a basic english option for the menu and critical instructions would have been a godsend

as for the characters one would think a game based on the historical epic of the three kingdoms would offer rich multifaceted personalities well think again beyond the historical names and unique character outfits theres a void where depth and complexity should be its as if the developers tossed famous names into a blender and hoped for the best the female characters while visually cute are the epitome of onedimensional its disappointing to see such potential squandered for the sake of superficial aesthetics

now lets talk about the graphics frankly they are an eyesore the outdated visuals make it look like the game was plucked straight from the early 2000s character models lack detail environments are bland and uninspiring and animations are downright awkward its a visual assault that no amount of historical accuracy can justify

the ai in war of the three kingdoms is nothing short of laughable enemy troops stumble around like drunken soldiers completely oblivious to any semblance of strategic thinking its as if the artificial intelligence gave up trying to challenge the player and settled for mindless wandering the lack of a competent adversary makes the already tedious gameplay even more unbearable

speaking of gameplay its an exercise in frustration the controls are clunky and unresponsive making even the simplest tasks feel like a chore the combat system is a mindnumbing buttonmashing affair with no nuance or strategy required its a shame that a game based on such a rich historical setting fails to capture any of the complexity and intrigue that should accompany it

in conclusion war of the three kingdoms is a dumpster fire of a game that fails on nearly every conceivable level from the language barrier to the lackluster characters abysmal graphics braindead ai and infuriating gameplay theres not a single redeeming quality to be found save yourself the agony and steer clear of this digital catastrophe

dont watse your time downloading this piece of garbage i felt like crying after i played it



#####

i dont recommended anyone to playing this trash  its so much boring when opening tho you cant play without purchasing those op characters

#####

pay to win

#####

逼氪游戏毫无诚意

#####

you can play this game but never never never important things must repeat 3 times pay any money for it the companys credit score is dog shit they dont give a damn about players and they have even been doing dog shit pr for the past 13 years

you will be a bit slower to catch up to some of the stronger characters but as long as you continue to improve your game play you can still do just fine in all the game modes with some of the characters that are given for free and broken through for some of the single player modes there are constantly rich players who are offering to help so you will be fine also

你可以玩这个三国杀但是千万不要千万不要千万不要充钱重要的事说三遍具体来龙去脉为什么建议你不要给游卡钱请看此知乎回答 httpswwwzhihucomquestion506868542answer2280631451

这个版本标准包武将可以免费突破许多强度其实还不错提高自己的游戏水平可以和土豪打个平手我0氪至今能有60军八胜率和75欢乐胜率就是最好的证明军八里有些高强度武将直接禁掉就好单人玩法如武将列传有很多土豪提供免费帮助经常在频道里刷屏公告玩家之间的气氛还是很友好的

rubbish

today we talk about the three kingdoms to kill the ranking matching mechanism three kingdoms to kill the matching mechanism is simply outrageous there is no fairness in terms of charging more money the easier it is to win
the ranking of the three kingdoms can be single match and team match
allow me to introduce you to a little bit of knowledge of the three kingdoms the higher the game official rank the shorter the playing time indicating that the more the front of the punch three states kill generals are divided into three kinds treasure pearl will in other words you spend money to buy a lot of highintensity will highlevel will soul synthesis yuan treasure will generally speaking treasure beads will be the strongest highlevel will soul will soul is equivalent to a moba class hand game in the hero pieces will be the next treasure will and lowlevel will soul will be the lowest

firstly lets talk about the three stages of ranked nausea
the first stage after the start of the match can show each others rank and grade if the other side of the average rank is higher than your side congratulations you have a 90 probability of losing so a ranked can not win just start to know

the second stage the hero selection stage after matching successfully you have a random pool of 10 generals and then you can only choose the generals you have already obtained at this time you will find there are three situations the first situation the opposite side of the official rank is higher than you you will find that the strength of your pool of generals is very average at this time you can choose generals  everyone has them and the strength of a new number is about the same as you open a new number the second situation is your official rank is about the same as the opposite side of the two situations will occur one is your generals to restrain the opposite side one is the opposite side of the generals to restrain you the third situation is your rank is higher than the opposite side this time your teammates regardless of whether there is a treasure pearl general 100 you can win note that i said 100

the fourth stage into the game after the game if the first situation of the second stage the probability that you will not be able to play cards at the beginning or directly dead or unable to cause damage to the opposite side of the generals if the second situation of the second stage this time we have to look at if the two teams of generals have a restraining relationship the restraining party has a 70 chance of victory if the two teams of generals have no obvious system of relationship this time is generally the most fair time of the game this is the fairest time of the game this time the cards in the pile are random if the third situation in the second stage then congratulations your generals have a teammate buffs so you can get a steady stream of good cards even if you or your teammates died this game you can still win

now back to the door question of ingame card probability  
there are a total of 132 cards in a qualifying round including 85 basic cards 34 bag cards and 13 equipment cards
when you have a feeling that you are going to lose the following will happen
a very rare card in the beginning of the first turn in the opposite hand for example he appeared in a turn of 8 pouch cards of which only from nothing in the pile of 4 pouch cards in his hand and then the 4 pouch cards in the pile of 3 pouch cards only duel then the 4 pocket cards opened up 3 pocket cards that only had duel in the pile and one other pocket card that weakened the opponent note the probability of getting a pouch card is 0257 and then the same pouch card gets 4 cards so we simply calculate 02540436 and note that there are four more pouches so you can do the maths yourselves
the opposite side of the hand appeared in the very suitable for his generals cards and sometimes even in this round he was killed by the opposite side

do not play this game
this is a fantastic game from chinabut unfortunately its run by a terrible company 
the company that developed this game is only interested in moneywhich is spurned by chinese playersbecause they never consider the players feelings
there are even some game characters that cost 80000 rmb yuan per character in other servers
this garbage game should not be on steam
there arent any other languages for players from other countriesit comes only for the money in your pocket
do not play this game

this game is the biggest joke of all time in the very beginning it was pure plagiarism from trpg bang suddenly the game designers came to their right mind to create some original content  mostly paytowin characters coming directly from hell you hear me right when you dont have those characters you cant even stay alive until it comes to your turn theres no turning back after you start to pour money into this game every penny you invest in this game suddenly lose 45 of its value and the ingame econmechanism is still under skyrocketing inflation the game designers simply wont bother to modify any of the classic characters of this era simply because they are available for free while releasing disastrous paid characters every month i have to warn every single potential newcomer to stay away from this game and any game developed by goka games not sure if its the right spelling lol after all gksm if you know what i mean

#####

run by the worst company in the world all they do is scam their players and make threats towards their player base do not play this piece of shit

#####

trash game it forces you to get crap heroes i like to play 吕布  孙权 but after you lvl up the game forces you to get some uninteresting and unwinnable heroes like 曹操 夏侯惇 张角 etc after you get those heros you will never see heroes you like anymore you can only expand your hero options by paying like the hearthstone battleground i cant imagine how much money youd have to pay to expand how many options youd have to pick your hero you like
