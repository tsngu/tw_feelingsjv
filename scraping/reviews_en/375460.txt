if you think that 16bit trader will be some fun nostalgic retrostyle game that hearkens back to the early 90s in terms of graphics and music youd be wrong 16bit means gold bits because you are a medieval a trader in this game i would also like the point out someone forgot the hyphen when naming the game but they remembered for the artwork

if youre a math person the game might interest you as the bulk of it is buying from one town at a price traveling to another at a cost and then selling those goods to areas willing to pay more for it thats where the game starts to get fuzzy and falter the cost for everything makes it a challenge to keep your head above water from turn to turn and that ruins the enjoyment of the game

the cost to get from town to town is always the same depending on the route but the selling and buying price in the same town will vary each time you enter a lot of the time the prices go up to make your margins smaller and smaller with the price of travel you need to deal in bulk to survive in the game

travel lets you go to a neighboring areas click the areas in green and poof youve traveled there there is a risk and a gamble associated with moving from town to town you can get attacked by bandits that steal your goods or gold there are mercenaries to hire in each towns pub but even with the maximum five guys on my side i still found myself robbed

you see everything as a result with no way to stop the event its like a board game where youve flipped a card and just had a bad bout of luck sometimes there is a delay in a mundane travel route for whatever reason if you get obsessive you can always save at each town and then try to travel if you get attacked just reload the saved game and try again this process can make a tedious game even more so

without a level of difficulty the struggle and grind becomes a chore rather than give any joy or excitement while i never played the game as extensive as others it felt like most of the occurrences were negative ones

several towns have exchanges banks and pubs in the pub you can hire or fire mercenaries or buy them one of three drinks getting them a drink will offer up tips and overall flavor text the bank lets you buy or sell a wagon along with selling diamonds you can find searching caves searching caves play out as a result rather than an action

exchanges are where the bulk of the game takes place buy low sell high towns will only buy and or sell specific items at this point its time to talk about the awful touch screen interface to buy and sell its a number pad that you mouse click on you can go up or down buy or sell the maximum and press confirm

oh but if you buy a maximum amount of anything youve already failed because then you lack the funds to travel to the next town to sell what you have the buying and selling becomes an longer process than it needs to be first go to the map and find out how much it costs to reach your next destination then exit the map go back into the towns exchange buy what you need and then remember the cost of travel if you mess up thats just money lost

there are quests to break up the monotony of things but achieving quests becomes a waste of gold even if youre rewarded at the end take this knight to that city bring this innkeeper silk from a far away land fetch someone a bottle youre a merchant so of course youll do it any game with a quest means youll still do it unless a quest gets locked off for an alliance or something

as for the controls its a touch screen game you click everything and you click and drag to scroll the map arrow keys to scroll the map would help beyond exclusive click and drag controls i feel like using numbers would be more efficient

the graphics have their own art style but look cheap and rushed its the same townspeople in every town at a pub bank or exchange sprites are bouncy icons are jagged triangles that look slapped together haphazard to fit the art style even the interface for buying and selling is squares shifted around it just looks like an ugly game

with the culmination of a bad name tough to survive profit margins no difficulty levels and a lot of guess work in changing prices this game is tough to recommend its a dirt cheap game so that makes it more reasonable but theres nothing here to recommend playing even if youre a fan of the trading genre

#####

16bit trader is not a game about trading buysell prices for goods seem to be random and travel is so expensive that youll always make an overall loss from trading taking randomlyappearing quests and gathering onceperday diamonds are the only reliable way to make money

its a lazy port of a mobile game its designed around afewminutesaday casual play but it doesnt hold up well when you sit down to seriously play it dont bother

#####

for a trading game this has a lot of bad aspects
1 you have to pay to travel but no way of knowing how much a trip will cost until you take it and if you dont have enough it wont tell you how much you need
2 from what i saw in 20 minutes of play the trade goods between cities are impossible to profit off of you only make money from going into a cave and mining diamonds to sell or performing take me to city x fetch blah from city y
3 the price of goods seems to be random so even sucking up the cost of travelling to scout trade routes will do you no good as prices change dramatically even if you arent trading

im glad i only paid 150 for this mistake

#####

16bit trader is a game that is flawed from the word go although the idea of the game is a decent one 16bit trader fails to execute on what little potential it has the first problem arises when one attempts to play the game along its intended methods the prices of the goods being trade barely fluctuate between locations one can buy goods for one price in any given city only to find out that every other city sells the same goods for the same prices and that the price that you can sell the goods for is lower than any of the perchase prices anyware in moving between cities one will discover the next problem the cost for movement between cities can and will exceed ones profits for trading making actually making a profit to be next to impossible outside of fulfilling the sidequests that are at least quite plentiful or to find diamonds at any of the dungeon locations strewn thoughout the game world

the only positive thing i can possibly say about this game is that the art style is bright colorful and quite nice

pros
 wonderful art style
 it only costs 3
 the game is competantly coded and doesnt seem to glitch or crash with any regularity

cons
 the intended gameplay features of the game are functionally impossible to use
 the is frustratingly designed
 the developers have the audacity to charge money for a game that has inferior design to a game you can play for free on newgrounds
 any time you spend playing this game brings you that much closer to the inescapable reality of death time which can never be gotten back

#####

16 bit trader could be an intersting trading simulator if you have lot of time play it at once or you dont turn it off because saving not works properly but if you dont know this and you turn off the game after you saved you will be surprised next time you try to load the game that you lost all your progress

sadly many of the achievements not work either i still dont understand why devs add achievements to their game if they cant handle it

developers of this game dont even response on forums according to steam they released a game allmost every month this year so a sell and run game company

i could recommend the game but not working achievments and losing progress because of not working saving mechanism is too gamebreaking for me so i cant

16bit trader is a management game where you try to become the richest merchant in the entire land

story
 
in 16bit trader you are a merchant whose father is murdered by the richest merchant in the entire land you decided to take action and to become the richest merchant in the land by getting one million gold coins cause thats how most people take up revenge right 

graphics 

the art style of the game is all just static images that dont have any animations what so ever the only animation in the entire game is the head of a merchant moving up and down all the cities in the game look exactly the same so get ready for the tedium cause the worst has just begun

audio

theres only one song in the entire game and it loops forever it gets so tedious that after 30 minutes i had to mute the game because the song was driving me insane also the game has sound effects like swords clashing which are so loud that you will go deaf

gameplay

now this is where the game shows its true colors when you begin the game teaches you about reselling items at a higher price in cities so what you have to do is go to a store buy something and sell it somewhere where you can get a profit the game tells you to learn the prices so you can use it to your advantage but that doesnt matter at all once you actually begin trading you notice that when you leave a city and come back the store prices change at random which makes learning the prices and using them to your advantage impossible 

there are also travel costs each city is a fair distance away and you have to pay to get there sometimes there are random events like in oregon trail where you get stuck in a certain location for a couple of extra days and the most annoying thing in the entire game thieves and the kraken when you encounter thieves or the kraken they delay you by a couple of days and steal a random amount of your gold its always random and in one of my attempts to finish the game they stole almost 85 of my gold which made it impossible for me to travel the game lets you hire mercenaries so when you travel they reduce the risk of the chance of the thieves attacking but let me tell you it doesnt matter if you have 3000 men with you those two measly thieves will still steal anything you have on you

the game also has side quests which you can do to get cash most big cities have bars and shops which contain side quests all of the side quests are basically travel to one location and then to the next one and then to the next until you finish after you finish you get some gold but the problem is you spend way more gold traveling around those locations and your trips dont pay off in the end this makes side quests a time and money waste

so the game cheats any chance it gets and you might be asking is there any chance of actually completing it  well after a while you start to give up hope but there is one way to complete the game and thats diamond farming the game contains mines which have diamonds which you can sell to get insane amounts of gold go to the bar buy a drink for someone and get a map then hire mercenaries and mine to get diamonds until you reach the million this the only exploit you can use to finish the game as trading is all luck and no pay while the diamond farming glitch helps and even then it sometimes screws you over with the fact that you find nothing in the mine

verdict

16bit trader is in every sense a terrible game it has a steep learning curve the main gameplay mechanic doesnt even work and to finish you have to cheat just as much as the game which should never be the case in total i had 5 attempts to finish the game and with that farming technique i finished the game in 3 hours the game is just a waste of time and not worth your cash

final rating
110 

pros
na

cons
 main gameplay mechanic is broken
 glitchy 
 story makes no sense
 audio and graphics suck

its a nice combination of boring and broken

#####

16bit trader is a mobile medieval strategy management trading game where you try to become the richest trader in the entire land
the point of the game is to buy cheap items in one location and sell it for a higher price in a different location 
sounds easy right well it isnt

whenever i buy items the price for that item immediately drops in all the cities i visit 
as soon as i sell it it goes up
you can do quests but you need to travel to places
traveling cost money and often you come across some bandits that steal your money and loot
you also spend way more gold traveling to those locations than you get as reward at the end of the quest

i started to doubt myself was this game really that hard or am i just not playing it right
the game tells you to learn the prices so you can use it to your advantage 
i soon noticed that wouldnt matter because the prices are random
when you leave a city and come back the store prices change at random which makes learning the prices and using them to your advantage impossible
i always had to sell my items at a loss because i had run out of gold and couldnt travel any further
when you are out of money its just game over
keeping your money or buying items wont make a difference because you loose your money to thiefs and traveling anyways 

the only positive thing i can possibly say about this game is that i enjoyed the music the fact that it has trading cards and that i enjoyed the art style 
but dont let the nice cartoonie not even 16bit looking game fool you
the game is no fun and not worth 299

#####

so i tried to play this game for 30min but i gave up it makes no sense

first i start with positiv
 its cheap at the moment 029 cent
 graphic for this kind of game is good

cons
 translations are realy bad looks like google translator or even worse
 sound is a loop of the same 5 seconds all the time so i deactivated ist after 5 minutes
 if you want play this game regular you cant win you always loose money every castle and village produce the same some produce one or two other things to very high prices if you buy thing and travel to other castlevillage they have same price or lower so you loose money travel cost money on almost every way are thiefs loose money some ways are bridges loose money so you travel and loos half of you money and loose some money for buying sell make no sense
you can make money with diamonds you find in mines but you dont find always somthing so they may be useless
 this part of diamonds reminds me on freemium games but at the moment i cant buy 10 diamonds for 9999

summary
the only way to beat the game is cheating with save and load every move and try to get best solution and prices but this is not the way how a game should work

i won the game so i didnt loose any money but if i wolud bought it i would refund
so safe the money an search for an equal brothergame for free


#####

i recently picked up 16bit trader on steam and i have to say im really enjoying it the retrostyle pixel art graphics are really charming and the retro soundtrack is a nice touch the gameplay itself is really engaging as well as a trader you have to manage your resources and make smart trades in order to turn a profit its not an easy task and requires some strategy but its definitely worth it when you finally make a big score the open world gives a lot of options for trading and the different towns and ports you can visit offer a lot of variety i would definitely recommend this game to anyone whos a fan of trading simulators or just likes a good challenge

16bit trader is a merchant simulation game where you play as a merchant and trying to collect money to be the richest merchant in the world although i said the richest the game actually ends after you earn 1m gold there is no time limit in collecting the money however an achievement will unlock if you collect it before the 1500th day

h1graphicsh1
if you are thinking that this game is 16bit because of the title you are wrong although the graphics are just okay its not even close to 16bit

h1musich1
the music is relaxing it sounds like a market in the old games with a soft tone on it i like it very much

h1the gameh1
youll basically travel from and to places there are a lot of cities and villages to move into and sometimes there will be an event which will rob your money or delay your trip or both however these events can be cheated by saving and loading before moving to other places making this game mostly becomes saving and loading luckily you can do it fast

you can hire mercenaries to reduce the random event chance however doing so will be costly because your traveling cost will be increased mercenaries can also be used to help farming diamonds which is one of the money sources in this game note that hiring and firing tons of mercenaries can be a pain in the ass because the game only offers you to buy a maximum of 5 mercenaries at once

you can earn money by doing two things trading and mining however these methods are unbalanced because mining will net you more money faster than trading you just need to hire tons of mercenaries to mine diamonds and sell them back in the city to earn a lot of money note that diamonds are sold around 50150 gold while you can only get around 10 gold profit per item by trading not to mention the carts and mercenaries which you have to hire in order to deliver more items which will increase your traveling cost with the same amount of money i can get more profit from mining

there are some side quests each appears randomly in big cities or ports most of the time the side quests will require you to travel back and forth which can be costly they will reward you from hundreds to thousands gold

after you are having 1m gold the game will end and you cant continue after that some achievements wont unlock if you have 1m gold and there is still unlocked achievements needed to be unlocked

there is an ingame achievement although you cant see the list

pros
 random events
 mining

cons
 mining and trading are not balanced
 too much relying on saving and loading
 no options to hire and fire merchants in bulk

h1conclusionh1
although this is a decent merchant simulation game the saving and loading can make your brain explode it also took a while to figure out on how to earn money efficiently and when you already figure it out youll be bored doing it

h1should you buy this gameh1
bnob
idespite the achievements the game itself is very simple youll spend most of the time clicking the same things over and over especially when you are doing saving and loading trick and hiring and firing mercenaries unless you are a fan of merchant simulation game dont buy this everi

review updated 312018

thankfully the polish company httpgamesforeverentertainmentcom eventually woke from their drunken taverns and fixed a long standing issue with regards to broken achievements since the games release they also tinkered with a known save file issue which was causing them occasionally not to work while their customer service was slower than a monday at a pub many our thankful that it at least eventually happened

there are a lot of negative reviews despite the fact that a lot of time and effort has already been put into this game by the designers to make the graphics eye pleasing and the delightful background sound that accompanies the adventure to be very fitting indeed so why then all the negative reviews it boils down to a number of things

1 gamers waited several years for them to fix five broken achievements and a corrupt save file issue 

2 developers still never responded to the customers personally or in the forums this means that you might as well pull out your favourite teddy bear in your room and go to town on himher venting all your frustration as you will more likely get a listening ear from it than you will from the customer service of this company i guess partly broken game and never responding developers is what they mean when they call their company forever entertainment

3 the game itself was designed to be a trading game it isnt its more a save your game every five seconds because the thieves are coming to take everything you own in game it doesnt matter what you do the thieves will steal everything you have built up in no time whatsoever in fact it is so frustrating im not sure why they put them in at all take the thieves and kraken out of the game and the game has some merit to it and it wouldnt matter at all the fact that the save files dont work for many people as i said it doesnt matter what you do you can have an army of 3000 people and the 2 thieves will still take everything for this reason there is no point at all to learn any trading strategies to play this game instead you will have to fleece the game in another way to win

for those that have purchased this game this is how to win

as soon as you appear go to pub buy a 1 gold coin drink for all 3 customers until one offers you a treasure map go hire about 5 7 people at the pub go sell the two diamonds you already have at the bank now travel to the closest mine search the mine and you should get a handful of diamonds save game travel back to the start fire the seven people at the pub sell the diamonds you have at the bank ignore all markets save game slowly travel down to the bottom of the map to lousifa or zannadar ignoring all the markets you can buy drinks at pubs for the customers to get treasure maps or perform side quests you can only do 3 side quests at any given time you have to complete one to get another one once youre at one of the two places mentioned above hire as many people as you can afford knowing there is going to be some travel expense you should be able to still get quite a few maybe 50 people once you have them save travel to the closest mine search the mine go back to the town you have come from fire all the people at the pub and then go to the bank and sell all the diamonds you have collected save game roam around for a handful of turns doing side quests and buying drinks and then repeat that process again at one of the two places mentioned congratulations thats it you have beaten the game

its just very tedious hiring and firing people but using that above strategy you will get about 15000 diamonds and win the game in about half an hour meaning you dont have to learn trading at all because it will never help you

in a nutshell a long time once broken game nonexistent customer service rage quitting unfair events in the game that thwart every progress you have made and a game that complete misses the mark of being a trading game which it was originally intended to be and advertised as makes this game a forever thumbs down

there is nothing else to recommend except for the charming artwork b16bit traderb is repetitive boring and chance plays a huge part in your success or failure okay its really cheap and might not be too bad if playing on your phone for a distraction but even at the ridiculously low price of a few euros your money is better spent elsewhere since the competition is that strong in the pc indie game market

#####

i really wanted to like this game i enjoy management games and i liked the concept the layout of the map and the art is nice enough for a cheap game but the mechanics of this game are terrible to the point of it being nearly unplayable diamonds are basically the only consistent way to make money and even theyre borked because more than half the time you travel all the way to a mine only to find it empty 

robbers seem to get you regardless of whether or not youve wasted money hire mercenaries to protect you and theres absolutely no rhyme or reason to how prices go up or down ive played through and lost all my money over 20 times and i never even get to the point of being able to afford a wagon it would need a serious overhaul to become a good game and even then theres better out there for a similar price i would not recommend this game

#####

it has nice steam backgrounds and emoticons i guess
its only nice to look at
thats about it

#####

its entertaining theres some problems though like all goods at any given location scale at the same time so if the price of say food goes up so does everything else making large swaths of your tripp useless since youll come across many succesive towns with high prices this makes things very linear also you generally only start out with enough money to make a trip and usually due to the crumby scaling dont have much of a market to work with and usually youll get hit by bandits immediately so on average a game lasts only a couple of turns based straight on luck 

there really isnt much tactic because the prices can change so rapidly theres no point in noting them youll leave a town that is buying high you find a place selling low and buy that commodity up any of them since they all scale equally return to the town that was buying high to find the market has dropped out where you cant even stock a couple commodities to make up lost time and money cause everything scales together 

theres no point in plotting a course since its generally just luck wether or not you find a place to sell not actually knowing what things go for in different places also going back to how every commodity scales up or down at a location together there isnt even a way to salvage your wasted trip by buying up something at the location youve just revisited using the example situation still 

so you now have a full load have to spend probably what money you have left to make a trip to somewhere worth a damn and will undoubtably get robbed even if you buy mercenaries to protect you do they actually do anything im not saying this game is impossible but the deck is stacked and in peculiar ways that dont make sense

#####

a barebones textbased medieval trader simulator with childish art and wild randomization roguelike element which feels like youve played it a million times before locations are empty and look alike the map is small prices are unpredictable and demand handwriting to keep track it could be good if it had more content and some intrigue in plot besides whether the bandits will rob you clean on your next route or whether you get a profitable quest instead of constant irrelevant blurbs from the characters and eventually get broke to game over

простенький текстовый симулятор средневекового купца с детским оформлением и диким элементом случайности в стиле бродяги и кажется до боли знакомым посещаемые места похожи друг на друга и пусты карта маленькая цены непредсказуемы и требуют ведения записи от руки игра могла бы быть неплохой если бы в ней было больше содержания и сюжетной интриги помимо того ограбят ли тебя бандиты до чиста на следующем перегоне или получишь ли ты стоящий квест вместо постоянных незначимых реплик от героев что приводят к постепенному разорению и бесславному окончанию игры

#####

this game is basically a trading sim without the trading sim its 1982s taipan down to the winning condition with every single bit of the strategy removed

only two things affect prices in this game a largish yearly cycle and a small random fluctuation all of the goods rise and fall in sync all of the towns rise and fall in sync there is no intrinsic difference between the towns the only difference between the goods is their base price so theres never any economic opportunity to exploit except the yearly cycle

beyond the nonexistent basic trading game about half of the side features that have been in every game in the genre since 1974 arent here eg warehouses the rest are here with all of their strategy stripped out eg you can hire people to defend yourself against bandits but it actually has no effect on the bandit attacks

i honestly couldnt believe that there was absolutely nothing to this game so i went and checked the community guides and there are detailed walkthroughsbut they all tell you that theres no economic strategy in this game and beating it is just a matter of having 10 hours of patience and a bit of luck

the game is also buggy save files randomly fail to load people offer you side quests like i know this is far but i will pay you 0 of gold for this trip etc and the interface is terribleit simulates a phone interface on your computer and it doesnt give you shortcuts for anything so if you want to say hire as many people as you can to go mine a ruin and then fire them you have to hire them one tedious click at a time the music is a loop s short that youll be sick of it in the first few minutes but there doesnt seem to be any way to disable it except muting your speakers and all of those annoyances are the best thing about the game because they distract you from how pointless the game actually is

the most baffling thing about this game is that its being sold as a demoad for merchants of kaidan if you expect people to pay 3 for a demo to be fair i got it as part of some giant bundle of indie games surely youd want to demonstrate that you understand the basic point of trading games wouldnt you

#####

terrible execution of an interesting concept prices on items are completely stupid mainly rugs spices and porcelaine
art is good music is decent and thats all the good youll get from it

cons 
proofreadzero typos everyhwere
these guys dont know jack about economics youll learn better from watching spice and wolf
save system is broken on my end at least

#####

boring game and very easy to lose it is all about odds and chances you easily waste your gold or you are randomly robbed by bandits and when you have no gold for a trip it is game over

#####

my first negative review on steam the game is poorly designed in this game you need to buy items and sell them in other cities but the problem is the game has two price one for when you are buying items and one for when you are selling which means it is really hard to get profit you also need to pay a lot to enter cities and there are really no clues on which cities need certain items the trading system on 80 days is much much better than this

#####

more trash  buy only for the cards and not for over 1

#####

simple but challenging game it really shows that being merchant is tough
you have to pay for travel expenses pay toll pay mercenary pay for you stocks and etc

although its still not really a 16bit game well at least it show you the truth of being a merchant been there done that
the quest itself is really annoying the client tell you to find item a in town a then after youre in town a they tell you its in town b in town b they tell you its in town c after all the hassle to find item a you return to the client and he said why you took so long to find item a then he paid you only 150 gold the cost to travel to town a is already 200 gold

if you dont like a simple flash game then please just stay away from this game

#####

fun for the first hour  maybe half hour then it gets tedious i usually dont give negative reviews for cheap games as you pay peanuts and your expectations should never be high but this one im giving a thumbs down sorry devs interesting concept but not executed well as others have said this gets rather boring quite fast and as luck seems to be against the player it is really easy to call it quits and close the game

but hey it has trading cards which i like runs on windows 10

#####

as most of the reviewers of this game have noted the mechanics of 16bit trader are very unbalanced to the point of being broken this means that in order to finish the game you need to continually save and then reload whenever significant bad events happen i didnt do this as it seemed pointless to play this sort of game in this way after playing for more than 3 hours i have found that any enjoyment and sense of progress was quickly destroyed by a series of events that could not be avoided coupled with bizarre market dynamics i have no problem with the rest of the game sound graphics story but the mechanics meant that the game was unenjoyable and not worth the time and effort

#####

words are spelled wrong in the english version gameplay itself is very basic and has the kind of polish you would expect from a game that has words spelled wrong i launched this since i am trying to go through my library of games that came in bundles i havent bothered with this game makes me think i should check reviews before even doing that

#####

i need to hire more men to have more thumbs down for this killer of enjoyment

goal is to make 1000000 gold to become the richest merchant
it is very difficult to keep money in this game the trading is very random ongoing profit a lucky chance between two towns
traveling costs per person and is sometimes ridiculous expensive additional there are chances to get robbed while traveling
no problem to get broke just from traveling 

even if you make profit and travel cheap the robbers will kill the profit take more you can hire men to protect you but those need to be paid too traveling becomes more expensive with them nullifying the profit made between two locations and you can still be robbed the chances are just smaller and the stolen amount smaller what a laugh

waste of time waste of nerves 
i actually got angry about this game  laff 

achievements are bugged too

best i made was 2500 gold then robbers took 780 of it 
then next robbers took some more some of my bought goods  yeah why not had two hired men but they were probably taking a piss in the woods while i got robbed who knows its a simple game i dont see what actually happens on the streets could be full of nudists for all i know


if you like it very difficult go on enjoy yourself

#####

210 i would trade this game if i could

16bit trader gives you two choices 
 play honest try to have fun and youll never win  you wont even make progress
 cheatfarm with help of the broken game mechanics and win without breaking a sweat
both sucks and is not worth your time

the art is really good though thats the 2 points but what a waste

#####

ill just give a few tips for people who want to give this game a try its really not that hard but kind of gets boring after 2 or 3hrs
tips
always save right before travelling save 2 slots bug obviously so that when you come across bandits you can reload
 do not buy anything from the market at start pointless always bankrupt
sell the diamonds 
 look for maps you will need to buy drinks 
hire men travel to mines and search for diamonds then go to nearest city and sell and fire the men as they cost more when u travel with them
lastly do all the quests while going from mine to mine
i hope i was helpful to some of you guys 
have fun

#####

this game is too random its not a strategy game its a game of chance you might learn the minimal and maximal prices of each good but still you never know the prices in the next place you visit add random bandit encounters and you will most likely loose most of your money and goods

how to improve the game
make events that will determine the prices fe droughts would raise the price of food hunting season decreasing prices of hides etc
some places should have always higher prices of some goods but not fixed like villages should have lower food prices that cities castles

i guess it is ok for its 25c sale price
for me free flash game caravaneer was a better expierence in many ways though

#####

the game is actually quite hard at start the quests are sometimes rewarding but most of the time not worth your effort personally i got quite far just by traveling between the starting city zin ta ka and the first town miindor and occasionally going to the mine ragu dos going anywhere else seems like waste of money to me especially crossing bridges is quite expensive and you get robbed around 25 of your trips anyways so you cant really affort to move around much even with a bank of around 100k hiring mercenaries in the tavern is all right at the start but later it does not seem to make a lot of difference the gameplay seemed a bit limited  you buysell goods hire mercenaries and get robbed sometimes you go to the mine to pick up diamonds and sell them as well quest are just travel from a to b  i never got any useful infromation by buying someone a drink personally the most deciding factor for not recomending the game is the trading dynamic prices of goods are not determined individually but are based on the location that means all goods at one site are either cheap or expensive compared to other locations therefore you cant sell sth in a town and buy sth else furthermore you cant wait in a town or store your goodsmoney so you have to travel which means travel expenses and getting robbed this is quite annoying if prices in both towns are around the same and you just have to travel to waste time 
i played this game for around 6 h i would played it further to see whether i missed something crucial of the game if only i was able to save the game for some reason the savebutton does nothing 

#####

how these devs screwed up a simple bartering simulator this badly is astounding on paper the recipe for success in this game is to purchase goods at a low price then travel somewhere they can be sold for a higher price in practice i never once encountered a single instance where anything i purchased could be sold for a profit after the ridiculous costs of traveling were factored in thats assuming youre not robbed on the way which you will be which will put you even further in the red the only way to make a profit in this game is by plying townsfolk with beer for treasure maps hiring help mining for diamonds and then selling said diamonds and immediately firing said help even then you still incur costs of traveling which are increased proportionately to how much help youve hired and youll still get robbed both of which cut into your bottom line so you probably wont profit that way either im completely baffled by how any developer could be so incompetent that they could not cobble together a lowest common denominator smartphone game about elementary school economics

#####

i feel like this game should be called 16bit miner not the 16bit trader im not sure if this game is really hard or just not fair because some of the elements are truly weird mercenaries arent really helpful when you get attacked by bandits you still lose way too much money and merchandise also travel charges for them are way too expensive its especially hard at the begin of the game and this is probably mostly reason for so many negative reviews you need to spend some time knowing the game but sadly the game itself doesnt tell you much and you need to use guides for that anyway once you learn basics its still next to impossible to beat the game focusing on trading alone thats my reason for calling this game 16bit miner  mining diamonds are the only normal way to beat this game but no matter how will you try to earn 1000000 gold there is one thing that will drive you crazy  saving game if you dont want to start over again and again you will need to learn to save the game almost every few steps im glad that i didnt have problems with saving the game but there are plenty of people saying on reviews and steam forums that they had their save states broken

since its mix of simulation and strategy game i dont have much to say about the music graphics or other stuff  the only thing i really like is the map sadly there is way too much negative and confusing stuff that makes this game next to unplayable without trying some tricks i really looked forward to play 16bit trader after playing it the only thing i can say is that im really disappointed

#####

its not even 16 bit game

#####

16bit trader is a tradingcommerce game developed by forever entertainment sa your objective is to make 1000000 gold through trading quests and loot throughout the game while avoiding enemies and completing it within a time frame

pros
commerce and trading mechanisms are fun to those who enjoy it
art style is resonably okay

cons
broken achievements i played this game mostly for achievements and most dont even work
repetitive gameplay becomes boring pretty quickly
many many bugs in which you lose your save or the game suddenly crashes or some items dissappear

overall this game is a waste of your time dont make the same mistake i did
210

#####

its been a long time ive been trying to get complete out of this game but alas it is waste and broken so dont even start it best move would be a refund but if you cant for some reason like getting that piece via some bundle just idle for 5 hours like all of my friends did get the cards and trash it for good

now after all the major words are said ill tell you whats its all about 16bit trader is a shortbrained wannabe merchant little mobile game there i have to make a statement that i dont hold a grudge against mobile games most of them are tolerable in my book some are very delightful but every flock has a black sheep

so what is wrong with it
well on the very surface everything looks normal standard gui for mobile port runs fast looks good you play as a newbie with a single cart and 300 coins who needs to beat a 1 million stake to settle some score and thats all you travel between towns and villages buyingselling stuff and completing some post quests in the process
the first drek comes from the simplicity of the process of gaining that 1 million score it can be done under 2 hours by the ape maybe not every ape but im sure it is way too simple even for sucklings

but thats not all
weve got constant glitches with the saves uncompletable achievements and the worst of all  total neglection from the developers

so thats your typical junk pile which is so many on the steam recently
mark 310 it can be played but it will be a total loss of your time

#####

strangelty appealing i went into this not knowing what to expect its literally trade simulation you buy stuff you go places then you sell stuff are freaking miniquests in this game from dumb fetch quests to a multi event deal of helping a dying knight tidy his life up before he kicks it its honestly pretty cool

but bloody hell you cant win after a few tries the best i could do was almost break even almost but no every time i just lose a little bit slower i thought it might jusut be me but after some google it seems pretty much nobody can figure it out

if you want to give it a shot go for it otherwise wait for the recommendations to swing before considering

#####

i really wanted to like this game but it fails to engage i am not sure what makes this game 16 bit other than the 2d retro aspect the prices of this world fluctuate like crazy if you review a exchange go to another town find a lower price and buy and return you will often find that in the short amount of time you did that prices have already gone up the prices never stay stable for long which isnt really how a economy works i would expect prices to fluctuate in months or years there is no discount for buying in bulk which would have been an interesting aspect and similar to buying wholesale you can complete quests and mine for diamonds but they are mostly fetch style things that do not really add anything to the gameplay if the prices were more stable and the quests mining more interesting then i could see this being a nice diversion in its current form it is a very frustrating experience that i cannot recommend

#####

take revenge on your fathers killer whyyy oh god why me i had nothing to do with this
the game has nothing to do with trade more like gambling economic system is broken in every way possible
you expect some of the goods to be cheap in one city and expensive in another you wish the prices are equally low or high for all the goods in town ahha you might think buy where its low and sell where high but no prices are pure random so youll have to travel between towns a bit oh traveling costs money too you know buying some strikegasstrike wheat for your horse toll bridges guards upkeep why the guards there are robbers on the roads so count that too so your strikeprofitsstrike losses would be calculated as sell_priceamount_left  σtravels  σrobbers  buy_priceamount_bought and thats the only formula that works in this game
oh btw the achievements are bugged and saves are bugged too
dont buy this shit

#####

so this game is basically a younger sibling of urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp294020merchants_of_kaidanmerchants of kaidanurl and even though it was released a year later there are a lot of its features missing in i16bit traderi which is strange and sad i have played imerchants of kaidani in 2019 and have rather enjoyed it here is my urlhttpssteamcommunitycomprofiles76561198036297204recommended294020reviewurl
the story is pretty much similar to imerchantsi your father gets scammed by his trading partner and ends up dead as you are stripped of money and status you have to slowly rise in ranks to be finally able to exact a revenge on him

i will first mention the positive things the visuals are nicely colorful they are also simplified in comparison to imerchantsi which is not a bad thing per se the music is also very charming and thats probably it all other things about the game are bad or very bad

i16bit traderi is a trading game surprise you have to ride through the cities and sell low bought stuff for the highest price but its almost impossible you will barely make any profit as the prices are rising with your travels example city a  you buy food for 10 coins you will be able to sell the food for profit in city k all the other cities in between had the price of the food constantly rising it works even the other way around when the prices are dropping they are dropping in line so for you to make profit of a higher valued stuff you have to travel far far away here comes another problem though  you have to pay for your travels you cant just ride around the map to wait for a good price as you would just go bankrupt solution is to not concentrate on trading as your main income in i16bit traderi this wasnt a problem in imerchantsi really each city or village had a different price set and although the prices were developing over the time you had no problems sustaining your income with trading also you could see the price history 7 days back

your main income in i16bit traderi is going to be diamonds which you are going to find in old mines for you to be able to find more than one diamond you need a map and a lot of mercenaries you can find both in larger cities in the tavern you have to find the right guy and buy him a drink he will then sell you the map i have noticed that usually only the guy in white had the map for sale so if he wasnt there upon my arrival i would have just reloaded my save mercenaries influence your diamond income other than that they are good for nothing in comparison to imerchantsi so if you have a map and a lot of mercenaries you can find a true fortune in the mines its also random based so you can try your luck with reloading there is no limit to the number of mercenaries you can have only limit is your money as you pay much more for travels when you have a bigger squad as the mercenaries are useless and only good for mine searching its advisable to hire them in the city before the mine travel with them there and then kick them out important note you can buy and kick out 5 of them at once so its a lot of clicking really a lot of also when i realized that i need only diamonds i thought about going to mine back to the city and then back to the mine but even though you spent days on your travels the mine wasnt restored and upon my return nothing was found you have to be constantly moving and visit different mines regularly

in imerchantsi you could enter the mines and let your mercenaries fight with the monsters hiding there if you were successful you reestablished the mine and had a stable income another possibility was turning an old ruin into a winery again for a stable profit oh and mercenaries were not useless they were also protecting you on your travels against thieves or angry animals in i16bit traderi you dont have any protection even if you have thousands of them you will still get robbed the thieves are pretty greedy and when you make some nice profit they will jump on you on your next move only protection is to load up your previous save until your road is clear

another possibility to make some income are side quests which you can obtain from characters in larger cities they consist mostly of go there grab something and come back your reward isnt that high though so you cant win the game by doing only the quests also on your travels a lot of things can happen and you can be delayed on your route the good thing is that the merchandise is not deteriorating so you can go around with the same food you bought on your first day there are only bad things that can happen to you in i16bit traderi on the other hand in imerchantsi there were a lot of good things too like you could compete or bargain for high valued merchandise and this way you could make a fortune there was also a luck system which influenced what kind of situations will most likely happen to you

as you can see you have to save a lot because the luck based chance is working mostly against you here there are only bfour save slotsb have seen some discussion that only two of them are working but i have used all four without any problems you can save whenever you want but beware that the game automatically saves your progress on your city or village mine ruins arrival the game saves it on your last selected save slot so if you dont relocate your save slot you cant load it up after being robbed because it will be saved after it what you have to do is to always save two times in the city you are leaving one will be your safe spot which you will load up when things turn out badly the other one will be rewritten upon your arrival to the next city and like this you have to do it the whole game if you want to win you could work it out with just two spots but i found it safer with four because like this you can try for bigger income from mines 
there are achievements all of them working some are tricky also beware that if you raise enough money to win the game in one attempt you will skip all related achievements for rising in ranks you will then need to reload your progress and make smaller profits you cant divide your diamonds so if you have thousands of them you will sell them all wait for their lowest price and pray you dont overcome the 1 million mark thats what i did anyway or start again

all in all i16bit traderi is missing so much content of its older sibling that one has to wonder why it exists exactly there are no season changes no helpers or advisors that can raise your stats no artifacts or other items you can sell for profit story is rushed without any proper progress there is no point in trading as you cant make any money from it and you can exploit the mines for diamonds
imerchants of kaidani is definitely a better choice because even if its not perfect its not punishing you on your every step and it was rather enjoyable

#####

game is trash like others have said its basically impossible to make money trading due to multiple factors including unpredictable traveling expenses the fact that almost everywhere pays less than your buying prices i tried twice the first game i lost all my money within 15 minutes the second game i managed to make a little bit initially but then fell right back into the hole and lost money again believe that mostly negative score and dont waste your time

#####

sorry excuse for a strategytrading game sure it has some adequate graphics and an appropriate looping tune but from there it is a dull lifeless clicker in which the trading itself is pointless and the gameplay is entirely based on luck until you figure to use 2 saves and reload whenever something bad happens horrid

#####

16bit trader in a nutshell

 get into a town and save
 reload save until a quest comes up
 save with new quest
 repeat steps above
 travel with multiple quests running
 bandits what bandits load save
 pull into town deliver most quests and get minted

#####

bandits really suck the fun out of this you make 700 gold get robbed 3 times in a row and congrats you have no money to even travel to the next town to recover itd happen without fail anytime i made a really big sale

not being able to see how much a trip will cost if you dont have enough money is very annoying and youre almost always trading at a loss due to the travel costs so the easiest way to play is ironically by not trading at all and focusing on quests and mining instead

some quests and achievements are bugged and a lot of people have problems with their saves so probably not a game id pick up unless it had a big sale

#####

the game isnt exactly bad but needs some improvements and corrections in the following points

1 bandits  kraken simply ruin your game and are impossible to avoid or combat
2 achievements broken and poorly explained
3 very simple questlines that do not give you any real benefit

with a little more effort this game although simple would become very pleasant but it seems abandoned

i will recommend it only because comparing to other games i got for free this one has some merit but its not worth any money

#####

even if there was a way to keep track of prices in different towns you will never be able to buy low sell high by skill its just dumb luck if you manage to stumble upon a city that happens to buy items for a slightly lower cost than you bought them for travelling eats up most of the money and the cost for travelling greatly outweighs the amount you could possibly earn by selling
hiring men does nothing against banditsrobbers no matter how many men you have youll always get robbed about 50 of the time you travel
the only way i managed to get a slight amount of gold was by doing quests but theyre not guaranteed so you might just go bancrupt waiting for a quest to pop

a good way to earn a profit wouldve been to mine for diamonds but the game only lets you do it once then return tomorrow tomorrow never comes no matter how many daysweeksmonths pass

this game suffers greatly from a lack of basic ui to keep track of costs and prices that everything tends to sell for less and less each day making sell high impossible and broken mining making you travel with a ton of mercs for nothing
the dev shouldve had someone else but him test the game i assume its a oneman project the dev obviously knows all the cheatsexploits that would make the game playable

absolute garbage

#####

if you read the reviews youll see a lot of complaints that you never make a profit selling anything thats been my experience as well youll buy goods at one town and the next town you go to will always be buying at a lower price on top of that every travel action takes away your money as well

i dont really understand the developers motivation or vision for this game its like a simplified mobile version of the oregon trail but worse in every way

not recommended

#####

expensive fees traveling will cost a fees that doesnt even tell how much fees you have to pay or how much gold needed
the only way to make gold by mining diamonds from the caves and sell them also i cant even save my progress then ended up game over

#####

i usually hate giving a negative review about games and try to find positive aspects but this time it is hard to find anything that could encourage anyone to play this mess 16bit trader is a fine example of bad design choices as despite of its description is completely based on luck it has nothing to do with trading  simply go to tavern obtain a map and get some diamonds in the mines and maybe spend some time with quests yes there are dozens of different cities and villages and they are totally the same where you can do the same things again and again  random encounters are the most annoying events in this game it is possible to lose in 5 minutes after start and there is nothing to do against it completely based on luck and your saved games
i must admit that the world map does not look awful and the background music is not disturbing in the first 20 minutes but it does not worth any money or time avoid it

#####

h1this game is too difficult to play and i dont think it is possible to finish it h1

although the traveling costs remain constant throughout the game the prices of the merchandise increase gradually overtime making it harder to gain any profit from trading moreover the quests are very repetitive and they only give the players few coins that barely cover the money that the player used to clear those quests
also the achievement system is broken in this game no matter what you do to get the achievements the game will never give you any notification indicating the achievements have been accomplished
uif there is any reason to play this game it is the trading cards buy this game when it is on a huge sale and play it until all the cards are dropped then sell them on the market to make profit and never play it againu

#####

the main issue i have with this game is the economic system  the prices of goods rise and fall randomly  they all rise or fall together as well  the prices of different categories of goods should be impacted by external factors  for example a town experiences a heat wave and a drought so the price of food increases while the price of blankets decrease 

overall the game is quick to learn but only because it has very basic gameplay  this also leads to limited replayability if you aquire the game for cheap give it a try  otherwise dont waste your time and money

#####

no recommend hardly to play
1 expensive cost traveling between town
2 worst random goods cost cant make profit in game
3 the only way to make more money is going to mining some jewels sometimes you need to buy a secret map from traven when you mining jewels sometimes your map will be disappeared and can not find any jewels _

#####

bought this for 29cents  i really liked the look of the game and love trading games so for 29 cents i figured why not give it a shot 

heres what went wrong
bought goods in the first city for 25 a piece then paid to travel to next city get there and the goods are worth 11 pay gold to travel to a mine and find nothing pay to travel back to the same city only 1 route prices still terrible pay to travel to next town prices are even worse went bankrupt and died

wow what an amazing first time experience
you can spend money buying drinks in the bar and hear useless stuff no mention about prices in the town over there are no prices listed on the map there didnt seem to be any missionsjobs you can pick up for cash when goods are too low 

do yourself a favor if you want a boring trading gamethat at least works go check out windward 

this game looks like it could have real promise but the developer needs to rethink some of the systems 
including
give player hints about what goods are needed in nearby cities 
maybe even a map with a simple legend box 

give player real hints at the bar when they buy drinks

if there is going to be a toll road between a city in addition to the travel cost show it on the map

in the tutorial teach the player that traveling to different cities cost different amounts of money
give the player the opportunity to do free mini jobs 
to make money when there is nothing worth trading

give the beginning player some goods or a load out 
of some kind so hes not just guessing what to buy

make travel between cities less or free

if this game were updated it could be cool hope the developer didnt give up

#####

well i havent really started playing yet and im already annoyed
the german translation is so horrible and hardly understandable the english translation seems a bit better  but i wouldnt call it a good translation and im no native speaker

on my system the buttons react if i click somewhere left to them so im hovering over the screen hoping that the area i want to go to becomes a bit darker and click then

im not sure i really want to try the game but then it was only a few cents and it has trading cards

#####

h116 bit traderh1

story   
replay value   
overall 

#####

im pretty chill and open to experiences and therefore i rarely give out negative reviews but goddammit this game deserves a major thumbs down 

it seems like there was a spark of a good idea somewhere but it was long gone before the game was finished long story short all the games mechanics are broken market fluctuation does not make any sense hardly you will make any money actually buying  selling diamonds are easily exploitable

the only reason why i endured playing it was to complete the achievements if you fellow completionist ever ended up popping a single achievement for this game when trying it out well good luck enduring the broken mechanics and figuring out what each achievement actually means now i still have to open the game for a few more days in a row to get the last achievement before i can finally uninstall and hide it from my library

#####

hello folks let me tell you about medieval trading game

first of this is not even trading game let alone 16 bit game do you see anywhere 16 bit graphics and visuals i sure dont
this is mobile port with that said it already explains a lot what is so bad about it besides being mobile port before you can even travel to next town you have to pay for it not knowing how much it will be eg it can cost you 52 coins  192 coins  16 coins these prices are so random even from that games already lost each town you visit can buy and sell same goods which are provided only and again checking out each towns shop you cant know if trip was worthwhile only way to gain any profit is to go to abandoned cave mine and explore for diamonds and each town also has set their own price for diamonds during the trip there is possibility to get robbed by bandits which is normal but they can hurt you by stealing huge amount also its random amount of coins causing to loose game if you managed to sell something and gain profit from it then bring more goods to same place again prices will be lower than previously was even if you have to happen just to pass through town to get to another without trading prices are drastically changing with no good reason at all everything here is just complete random

shouldnt have bought it i only did it because i had coupon and game had trading cards in it but even then this action was questionable serves me right

boverall game is based on pure luck patience and your nervesb

#####

a little business simtycoon game that fails to deliver any fun

pros
 art style is neat

cons
 unbalanced gameplay
 frustrating trading mechanics

final verdict
its cheap thats ok but doesnt deliver anything new and plus it is antifun in all aspects stay away from that one there are far better free titles try caravaneer on kong

#####

h1im so glad i bought this game for 20p with my couponh1

first of all misleading title why is it called u16bit traderu wheres the 16bit graphics within the game also i just dont find the game fun at all it clearly deserves to be a free app on a smartphone store

bdo not buy this gameb

#####

honestly dont buy this 
you can find better cheap games then this
you start with 300 gold to move from town to town to buy and sell things and this it
you need luck to not to meet some friends on the road
you need luck to get to a town were you can get some quests
every time you move to diferente tows it will cost you
conclusion boring game to me



#####

i spent multiple days just travelling in the game and at no stage were the goods sellable for a profit not one on multiple save attempts this game is so stupid dont waste your coin

#####

i like casual games
i like casual management games
i like casual money games

i do not like this
i do not recommend this
not even on sale

#####

pro  you can buy people drinks if thats your thing 

cons  apparently no amount of hired goons can defend my caravan from bandits 

why does it cost so much to travel were gas prices really that high back then 

i have no idea what im supposed to be doing 

does this game actually drop cards

#####

very bad trading system game
pros  trading card

#####

the game at first glance seems appealing fund even but there are several buds that will quickly prove you otherwise

the game feels rushed and incomplete it gets boring super fast and there just isnt anything to prevent that from happening

its a trading simulator you are a trading merchant who buys low from shops and then sells at a profit again the game has quests and mini quests that you have to complete from delivery to pick up mini quests along with dealing with the personal favors of npcs

as i mentioned the game starts out fun but is quickly over turned the grind gets too boring and the joy leaves the game buying in bulk is a must if you wish to survive buy large here for cheap and then traveling to a different town to sell for high to make your profits and make back the traveling cots there is no way to determine where is the best place to sell high  upon entering a new town the buy and sell prices are what seems random so you could score or loose

the game is pretty much point and click point the mouse click and it will happen

the graphics appears to be unique but ends up being plain cheap

#####

simple merchant game where others have done better for free too not recommended as there are better games for free of the same genre but with more depth 210

#####

bland unoriginal and nowhere near as good as its competition

#####

i shouldve taken a 5 hour nap instead of wasting my time on this game it did make me sleepy though 
its a bad game with reloading saves tactics the mc is so unlucky its easy to get robbed or run out of travel money which gives you game over im on my 1200 day and im tired of his mundane travels and having to always reload so i dont go bankrupt the summary makes this game sound better than it actually is its also a clicker game you know how many times you have to click on the hire and fire button whenever you want to hire or fire some guys i had to hire 150 guys from the tavern to boost up my chance of getting more diamonds from the mines the max number of guys you can hirefire at once is 5 that means for 1 mouse click youll be hiringfiring 5 guys which means i had to click my mouse 30 times whenever i wanted to hire miners and then another 30 times when i had to fire them every goddamn time couldnt they give us the option to punch in the number of miners we want in the first place but no that wouldnt be oldschool nostalgiainducing trading experience the only way i can describe it as a medieval taxi simulator taxi quests can be fun  take neo cab for instance you could be playing as a taxi driver and meeting interesting characters on the way it doesnt have to be this boring take me at the point a and drive me to the point b idea like in 16bit trader this game makes paying taxes irl seem fun this is no rpg

#####

16bit trader is in every sense a terrible game it has a steep learning curve the main gameplay mechanic doesnt even work and to finish you have to cheat just as much as the game which should never be the case 
graphics 1  all the cities in the game look exactly the same
story 05 story makes no sense
sound 05 theres only one song in 16bit trader and it loops forever i had to mute the game
gameplay 1 
its not worth it

#####

a poor and extremely basic implementation of the trader genre star trader did it better back in 1974

#####

this is suppose to be a tycoon trading game instead it makes no sense and is a waste of time

the point of the game is to buy items in one location and sell it for a higher price in a different location sounds easy enough not how can you possibly progress in the game if you buy items for 15 and when you go to sell them somewhere else you only get 6 or less once you buy an item there is no one and i mean no one who will buy it for a higher price than what you paid which means you auto lose the game every single time it doesnt take even 10 minutes for you to lose and realize that the developer has just stolen your money and left you with a game that doesnt work

i was trying to be fair with this game and played it several times i thought maybe i didnt understand the game because there are no instructions but i came to realize the game plays just like what the developers have done to the players he has taken the money and ran they also take your money in the game and run

#####

there is no sense in trades prizes are not same and you feel lost travel needs much money but you never know how much there are better trading games on internet for free

#####

hum nope this game is a trader simulator with some quests music and graphics are modest it looks and feels like a mobile port

no bugs or crashes runs fine on win 7

overall is very basic and way too grinding you buy and sell items from town to town trying to make some profit that is always very little traveling costs money hiring people costs money and theres an upkeep involved you get mugged all the time for severe losses even if you hire guards so you need to save every time you are about to leave a town and reload if robbed the problem is that thats actually the only event of consequence in the game there arent lucky breaks and the quests are grinding scarce and poorly rewarded 

the objective of this socalled game is to get a 1000000 gold out of your starting 300 in 3 hours i was able to make like 6000 and then got robbed for half of it made another 2000 got mugged right away for 1700 i quit this thing with 3300 gold to my name so if you make a 1000 gold per hour of gameplay and that is the average it will take you around 1000 hours to finish it and win

as if

if you got it for free then be happy with some cards if you paid any money for it well a lesson learned is worth something right

#####

got this game for free
played it for 5min and its terrible opened game on background to get trading cards

#####

i like the art but thats probably all i like about this game its too repetitive and super imbalanced theres just too much pointless clicking going from one town to another with almost no possibility of making any profit i also cant seem to unlock certain achievements due to bugs in the game

#####

very hard game took tons of time to learn how to play without losing fast

#####

210 only get for cardsexpcontrast  the map is muddled and not helpful the trading and selling is less fun than the sidegame use in sid meiers pirates the traveling is more fun in freecell quest the quests are the only good part but theyre extremely difficult to even fund much less finish i will 100 it out of sheer stubbornness but i wont like it

normally i am all over any and all econ games and especially with quests and centered on revenge but skip this one

#####

16bit trader is a game where you navigate treacherous seas trade goods and try to make a fortune or as i like to call it pirate simulator litejust dont forget your eye patch and parrot

#####

i liked the design and the concept however its just frustrating either you have to be a genius or extremely lucky to survive enough time to really trade things the algorithms need to be checked the game goes from way too hard to impossible and absolutely not enjoyable

#####

its just a dope wars type game of trading designed specifically for tablets

#####

trash it is a no buy for sure just dont buy this

if you already have it you msot likely got it in a mass giveaway so ye if you are a completionist like me you wont like this one much rng based and nonsense in the same package so good luck on that

#####

remake of an old polish trading game while visually it is ok gameplay is rather unpolished
but ultimately it does not matter because the game is broken an unplayable for most people due to the saving bug where you are only able to do so once on every of the available three save slot and never again

while the developers were quick to respond to anyone that had complains on the game not being 16bit despite it being in the title with the same copypaste response every time once the people started complaining about the save bug they quickly disappeared from the forums and still many months after they are nowhere to be seen not even responding to the emails

i wish i could refund it but i didnt notice the bug until it was already too late for me
its a waste of money even on the sale now im making it a point to never buy anything from this developer

#####

too hard and too confusing seriously
or im very very dumb because this game is so hard maybe harder than dark souls
theres not even a tutorial
you could go search any games that worth your while or git gud 

not recommended for dumb people like me

#####

free trading cards for me

#####

its so bad the other reviews werent kidding its just so bad and it gets so bad very quickly

#####

in the introduction it contains my pet peeve of all spelling mistakes loose instead of lose

#####

it is enfuriating how awful this game is honestly its a piece of garbage the supply and demand feature works as follows 
1 go to town
2 buy stuff
3 you can never make a profit on anything because as soon as you buy something the price of said something will drop
4 
5 profit

it doesnt even matter if you buy anything actually just going from town to town lowers the prices of everything everytime 

then theres the bandits oh youve been raided by bandits theyve taken 100 gold and practically all of your merchandise everything about this game ruins this game 

if you want to play a game where you play as a merchant just go play some flashgame from 2003 because that will most certainly be infinitely better than this game

#####

this game is a little boring in this game everything is excruciatingly slow for a long time  profits are low and moving requires far too many taps

#####

first of all the game title is so wrongthere is nothing 16bit about this game music and graphics are ok i got this from some saleit was zero point something and im really glad i didnt pay more i hoped this was simplerelaxingtrading simulator its nothing like thatgame is so hard to playand i dont mean skillexperiance hardmore like that makers of this game dont want you to finish it or even progress a bit it should be named 16bit get robbed and fail the game douche instead of trader complete waste of time and money

#####

this game seems interesting but you supposed to play it by saving making a screenshot and then reload and so on you can not play the game just by making some moves if you are not saving the game after each move and if you fail to reload the game you eventually will lose and pretty fast

#####

boring and a waste of time
110  not recommended

#####

this game seems impossible to play its unfairly hard as its rngbased with highly punishing mechanics for any trivial action such as changing town or even just trading and game over can happen at any time independently of the players actions its lacking depht and character and the trader flavor is flawed by how exploring caves and doing quests that can be punishing too are mandatory this game is just not worth playing  it can even be considered as unplayable if you seek fun you might want to try port royale 2 instead that looks like a more complete and advanced version of this game and has really nice graphics even for its age though its set on a different background or recettear that is a bit different than these two but is just a good lovely game

as for the look and ergonomy 

 localization is total garbage

 graphics are basic but decent

 music is decent too but lacks character and some sounds can quickly become annoying

 there is nothing 16bitish except a few small pieces of artworks

 its a game built from a game maker there is an annoying small launcher window prior the actual game each time its booted up you can set the resolution and windowed or fullscreen mode from there and thats it the game does not even have actual settings in itself and the sound has to be managed as a single audio through the os audio manager

gameplay 

 ui is responsive and straightforward and allows for fast actions overall sadly this also leads to even faster game overs and reveals the lack of game depth even more

 its rng based and not fair it takes a ridiculously small amount of time a minute or two from the beggining to encounter a game over because it can just happen without the need of an actual mistake from the player go from city a to city b and lose because the game decided to throw bandits at you that steal all your gold and goods and its game over

 quests and cave explorations to find diamonds are mandatory and takes over the trader aspect you somehow would expect from this game cave exploration actually consists of clicking a cave through a direct road connected to your current location on the map clicking search to find diamonds on the cave window and then leave the location because you cant keep mining until it becomes available again go figure when

 there seem to be strange bugs leading to game overs be in the tarvern give people a 1 gold beer to gather some information one of them talks about a treasure and asks me if i want a mark of it on my map for some gold since i had more than enough i bought it and accepted a quest from a guy that wanted me to take him to another city on my trip upon terminating the dialog window i got a game over screen maybe the game calculated that i didnt have enough gold left to leave the city and no goods to sell to make up for it 

 there are 10 type of goods in total and there are not even small icons next ot them in the trading window to give them some eye candy flavor and no specific sound played when interacting with them

#####

nice idea and concept  ost however broken achievements and simplisity of the campaign do their job

#####

playing this game feels like being constantly trolled and punished for reasons you try to understand but cant 

on top of that every time you start a new game you need to go through tutorial messages which is a bit annoying

its a shame because art is nice and it could have been a nice game to kill some time but execution is horrible

#####

its worth maybe under 1 and buy it only if you chase some cards or badges

#####

game is boring and tedious

#####

h1tldrh1

kind of boring better as a flash game than something worth investing a lot of time on you get what you paid for

 bprosb

looks nice

bconsb

text
music is repetitive
gameplay doesnt make sense at times

h1gameplayh1 

starts off with a cute cliched type story introduction that makes you want to read it out in an overdramatic voice worth you end up due to unfortunate circumstances having to sell off the family diamonds in order to get some money and you get ripped off of course

the graphics are quite nice they look hand painted in areas and give a nice atmosphere to the idea of a merchant based game

 you can travel between places but it costs money and time to travel you can collect quests everything is basically text  based  a point and click adventure you dont have any controllable characters but rather you flick between screenshots of the villages youre in the taverns you go in and a still of a person you may talk or recruit with text underneath you spend so much time travelling at times its all you can do to keep up with the money costs

when you travel random events can occur good and bad during your trips  you can get delayed which costs you more money i admit i found the format of this game annoying to understand how i needed to progess and ended up spending a lot more money than intended travelling  how the system works is that prices vary from town to town you buy something in a town thats cheap and travel to a town where that commodity is worth more and sell it you run the risk of being robbed running between routes however so it doesnt always work out the way you hoped you can seize quests along the way for unique items and hire helpers who give you a unique ability such as decreasing the chance of a random encounter happening during your travelling and so on

the music is quite nice retro style but repeats after a while and gets boring  the textdialogue wasnt engaging enough really for something that is heavily based in it 

for its price its what you can expect this is a nice idea but the things it should focus on are not done so well  the gameplay doesnt always make sense either as it overloads you quite fast with different things there isnt a progression that helps you and you lose so much money travelling around from place to place chasing quest to quest that it doesnt feel worth it it could benefit from a small confined quest line before sending you off to travel crazy so i dont think its a good game

#####

i thought this game would be cool but trading is useless in this game the story in it is bad the goal is impossible i would call this game 16bit lame adventure the game isnt even 16bit

#####

it was a waste of bandwith to download this game

really the game is that bad

do your self a favor and dont install it even if you got it in a bundle or for free

#####

cons artificial difficulty all quests are the same go to city a then b then c then a again dialogs are the same for every character doesnt have any relashionship sistem reputation  how much gold you have not engaging  worse than most merchant flash games simply not fun

pro cards

#####

wow

the goal of this game is to make 1 million gold the problem is it so badly balanced you have trouble even making 10 thousand after playing it for a while the developers cannot have tried it alot before releasing it
there is a cost for travling which easily grows greater than the profit of buyingselling goods
if they would have fixed the values and made it easier to make money this would have beeen a fairly good game but now it isnt even a nice game to get from a bundle of cheap games

tldr dont buy it odesnt matter if its cheap  it sucks

#####

do not buy this game
this game is seriously broke the saves do not work the gameplay is faulted as you travel your costs outstrip your ability to make income by trading the only way around this is by using constant saves and retries but with the save function broke such that after a few saves the game no longer allows you to save everything just falls apart
i bought this with a 90 off coupon spending 30 cents and honestly even for the trading cards i feel like it was money poorly spent

really this is a shame becuase it could have been a cute noncombat based gameplay experience but the devs totally blew it with this one

#####

not only is the gameplay broken but also buggy

#####

first of all
my language is made by an auto translater
the text often make no sense so i play in english
first saving dont work
and that make this game unplayable because if u get robbed u have to load your old savegame
buy goods for 500 travel for 100 get bobbed for 400 sell it for 700 
yes 200 profit
wait no
200 profit  100 travel cost  400 for robbers
damn thats  300
and that happens every time u travel
so save and load if u meet robbers and u meet them every 24 towns is a must have in this game
thats why i said unplayable because u cant save
did i mention that if u could save u have to play the game by saving and loading the game all the time
there is no way to make profit with trading because travel costs and robbers all the time
u get your money only from mining and questing and not by trading
this grafic is bad too but i somehow still like itprobably the only work that somebody put in this game

geass i had luck i bought it for 029  for 90 less
otherwise thats 029  too much

by the way i found out later
this game is a realy bad copy of merchants of kaidan that is sold on steam as well
there is even a demo for free and before u buy this game get the demo of the merchants of kaidan
its the same as this game but better in everything
the funny thing is
merchants of kaidan is from the same firm
got produced 1 year or so earlier
and is like i allready said better in everything

#####

graphics  410
story  310
music  210
gameplay  310

overall  310

this game is 

#####

oh boy where do i even want to start

lets begin with the good points this game has to offer first the art style is comical without being overly cute keeping the audience broader since a lot of gamers are getting a little tired of cute second the dialog is cynical and funny most of the time without being dark

thats about where i have to stop the game is riddled with bugs inundated with gramatical errors has the oddest supply and demand system ive ever experienced in a trading sim the ability to buy drinks for tips in the game would seem to be helpful but would ultimately be a waste of money as the tips dont lead to exactly locations to use the tips

the period quests in the game are basically there to keep a little coin in your bank account as playing this as a straight up buy and sell affair would most likely lead to a total rage quit the most offensive part of the game though lies in the laziness of the developers here is the ultimate example there are 3 inhabitants in each of the 12 taverns in the game that means there is a total of 36 npc characters the graphics and names of the npcs are often and i do mean often reused meaning the devs couldnt be bothered to think of 36 different names there is likely a total of 6 different names and although there are female npcs none of them have female names

buthe doctors final report 210ub the humor of this game is enough to make it worth a 50 price tag as it will give you a little chuckle from time to time other than that there are much better games to supply your demands


#####

the buysell prices are random and revenue is just all sorts of imbalanced you will almost never make profit when selling anything you can earn  on quests but they are boring and tedious bad

#####

this game is not worth your time do better

#####

with a very short tutorial this game takes a very long time to understand its all about stragety and grinding lots and lots of grinding but you have to play the game and fail a few times to know what kind of strategy to use i have encountered a bug that wouldnt allow me to save anymore making me lose about half of my money and making me very salty but thats a minor detail the graphics are nice to look at and once you get into the hang of it the game is quite enjoyable the mini sense of achievemnt you get when you make a profit makes all the grinding and failing worth the while in my opinion i feel the tutorial should be longer more detailed but other than that its a fun and enjoyable game i definately would recommend

#####

i intended to give a positive review here but then i changed my mind im not an expert on trading game especially games without detailed tutorial or instructions i have to say its a nice mobile game if i really like it but its pc this definitely cant satisfy me

also it has serious design flaw on incomeoutcome system for example just take a look at my

urlhttpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid552841462screenshot hereurl

you can see that i even owned negative money for trading all i did is just hiring multiple people and the program didnt even check if i had enough coin thats unacceptable when i was at bday 0b be good to noob

#####

my friend i play with said that if i post a review about the game and it gets 200 likes and 100 rewards hell buy me a bag of chips and a rtx 4090 so ill leave this here

#####

horrible its extremely hard to keep afloat and practically impossible glad i only paid 19 pence for it but even that was a stretch for it







#####

well i wont lie that i didnt really found this game fun for me much
maybe indie strategy rpg games isnt my type or maybe there is something about it that makes it boring
the idea of the games is nice i wont lie but nothing else isnt more interesting than that

#####

16  bit trader is a simple touch screen style medieval trading game with gameplay consisting of traveling from town to town buying and trading while trying to spite your fathers killer and solving various quests i really wanted to like this i love trading games normally but for some reason i found this lukewarm it feels like the balance is off somehow the graphics and sound are functional if grating after a while and the writing is ok i was initially not going to recommend this game as i really didnt have any proper fun with it but it does occur to me that i dont have a steam game that i can say does the same things but is superior gazillionare not on steam is a space trading game cut from the same cloth as 16bt but despite the fantastically bad art and sound is far more fun to play and feels so much more compelling than 16bt ever did

h1 good h1
everything works until it bugs out and crashes
not too many games quite like it
was updated last year so its devs are active but im not holding out hope for a balance patch
pretty nice world map

h1badh1
bland towns feel homogenic goods feel unimaginative and arbitrary sound and graphics are pretty meh as well as not looking like 16 bit have you even seen a 16bit game before or what
poorly balanced in the name of having a dynamic economy also the random events should have a grace period to let players get on their feet super annoying to loose all your cash in the first 5 minutes
certain game elements could be a lot more player friendly

in my opinion 16 bit trader could have been great but hasnt tapped into the strengths of the trading genre the game should be about opportunity to make money but in 16bt it feels like the deck is stacked with ways to loose your money bit of a shame really still it has very few peers so if you really really want to play a medieval trading game perhaps have a look when its on sale will have to try merchants of kaiden to see if its any better h125h1

#####

even if it wasnt basically impossible its just far too simple to enjoy in its own right

#####

hey everyone and this is my review about the game

this is an idle cards game


h1interfacemenusettingsh1

there are many resolution sizes available
you can play the game on fullscreen mode or windowed mode
there are some different languages available
you can only toggle the musicgfx volume sound

h1about the gameh1

you are are merchant and you have to get like a ton of gold during the trips you can get attacked by bandits or find stuff the only thing what i dont understand why it takes money to travel from city to city also there is no market overview on what your last purchases were so if you bought in city a some food and then u sell in city d you cant see what the prize were in city a again you can hire people to reduce the chance to get attacked but you have to pay them overtime the idea is nice but the execution is poorly done i got 2 times attacked in a row quests that you are able to do arent even worth it because you pay more for travelling then as a reward from time to time the prices changes but its nearly impossible to keep profit coz of travelling bandits finding higher price to sell for

there are 3 different save slots
there is some sort of story
there are useless quests
you can hire man to protect you its good because you have a wonderful income anyway right 


h1other thingsh1

totally not recommended at all
almost impossible to play it in a fair and legit way



i give this game a 210

#####

achievements are mathematically impossible

#####

not a 16bit game
not a trade game a boring mining one

#####

the music is pleasant and the visuals arent bad other than that i just find this unfun take that with a grain of salt as im not a fan of economy games to begin with but there isnt enough logic in this for me to enjoy the strategy of minmaxing profits

#####

a really simple trading game you go from town to town in your cart buying and selling food clothes etc 

it wouldnt be a bad game on your phone or maybe on your tablet but on a pc it just cant compete with any other game

#####

too full of bugs to really be worth it at least in its current state save files dont work often causing hours of lost progress achievements dont get unlocked when they should be were it not for those things this game would probably be an okay trading game very simple to play but frustrating to accomplish anything in because of high travel costs unless you get phenomenally lucky with some good buylowsellhigh cities playing this game involves hours of repetitive gameplay with little to keep a player entertained beyond maybe this time i can turn a slight profit and not have it be stolen by bandits

and if thats your thing then consider this game but not until the glitches are fixed

edit  and it seems like the company has just dropped the game and wont be fixing any of the glitches that make it so unplayable seriously dont bother spending any money on this one even a free game wouldnt be worth it if you cant play it

#####

this is far worse than the trading games youd find for free in kongregate back in 2010 so if you wanna sink your teeth into a trading game go look for the free flash options

#####

played this for 5 minutes and i regret it even though i got it for free i wish i hadnt it needs some serious updates before becomes playable again imo

#####

in this game you play as a medieval merchant working up your way while trying to take revenge on the killer of your father i played this game a year ago and back when i used to play this game i actually enjoyed it quite a lot based on this i am still going to recommend this game but i can definely understand what the negative reviews are all about although you shouldnt focus too much on trading and more on the quests

#####

looks nice and thats about it your success depends largely on weather or not you had a four leaf clover salad for dinner wearing your horseshoe necklace and geting shat on by owls all while watching a meteor shower

#####

16bit trader has a terrible german translation the dialog is poorly edited and bugs are common
there are just better games you could play

metacritic
tbd  100 metascore
tbd  10 user score

#####

people are complaining that it isnt a 16bit game well that isnt even the biggest problem


the biggest problem is related to the saves if you close the game expect to lose save data from the autosave other than that the other 3 save slots dont work at all for me

dont expect to get all of the achievements in this game either the game wont let you get them

#####

it is not a good game at all you are trying to earn money but its almost impossible as you almost always will be at a loss when selling quests are the only real way to earn revenue

#####

meh 210

#####

tldr  basically a train wreck numerous missteps mar an other middling experience with broken gameplay and bugs 210

the trading genre is what you expect buy goods move goods sell goods upgrade transport etc its present in the gameplay of 16bit trader quests are periodically available and the rewards for which are great enough that theyre quite worth the time while visually its ok overall gameplay is rather unpolished just to illustrate the laziness of the games mechanic there are only 12 taverns in the game each with three inhabitants the names and images of these people are reused in different cities its funny to see how lazy a developer can be if they cannot think of 30 different names or any female ones either

the dialog is poorly edited bugs are common crashes slightly less so theres no indication of which cities are ports and therefore connected by sea routes and the map doesnt seem designed with any particular gameplay goals in mind ultimately it doesnt matter because the game is broken due to a saving bug where you are only able to do so once on every of the available three slots you have while the developers were quick to respond to anyone that had complaints on the game they dissapeared once people started to complain about the save bug 

dont buy it please its not worth anyones time unless you want cards or achievements which are hard because of bugs and glitches

16bit trader a retro trading adventure

rating 

review

step into the shoes of a daring trader and embark on a nostalgic journey through the pixelated world of 16bit trader this retroinspired trading game offers a simple and straightforward gameplay experience for those who enjoy strategic decisionmaking and economic simulations while it may lack depth in certain areas it still manages to capture the essence of classic trading games

in 16bit trader your goal is to buy low and sell high as you navigate various towns and cities trading goods and commodities to make a profit the gameplay mechanics are easy to grasp with a userfriendly interface that allows you to manage your inventory track market prices and negotiate deals the simplicity of the mechanics makes it accessible to both casual players and those new to trading games

the retro pixel art style of 16bit trader adds a nostalgic charm to the game the visuals evoke a sense of classic gaming reminiscent of the era when 16bit graphics reigned supreme while the pixel art may not be the most detailed or visually stunning it successfully captures the essence of retro gaming aesthetics

one area where 16bit trader falls short is in its lack of depth and variety the gameplay can become repetitive over time as you find yourself engaging in similar trading activities without significant changes or challenges the absence of a more robust economic system or additional gameplay elements limits the games longterm engagement

however despite its limitations 16bit trader offers a relaxing and casual experience the absence of time constraints or intense pressure allows you to approach the game at your own pace making it a suitable choice for players seeking a more laidback trading simulation

the soundtrack of 16bit trader complements the retro aesthetics with chiptuneinspired tunes that transport you back to the era of classic gaming the catchy melodies and upbeat rhythms add a nostalgic touch enhancing the overall retro experience

in summary 16bit trader is a simple and nostalgic trading game that successfully captures the spirit of classic trading simulations while it may lack depth and variety compared to more complex titles in the genre its retroinspired visuals and straightforward mechanics make it a suitable choice for casual players and those seeking a relaxing trading experience if youre looking to relive the nostalgia of classic trading games or enjoy a laidback economic simulation 16bit trader is worth a try

personal rating 4 of 10

if you are familiar with the classic game named dopewars this is actually the enhanced version with fancy graphics some added features and challenges

you basically travel from one town to another while doing trades by visiting the market in each town there are added random encounters where your carts can be raided during travels instead of cops in dopewars however these raids only reduces your gold you can hire mercenaries to decrease the chances of encounter but there are no combat with more mercenaries you can purchase more carts to increase your inventory size but this will also increase your expenses upkeep

you can visit pubs in major town and buy the drunkards booze for tips and sometimes they will offer you maps you need to purchase them these maps will be used automatically when you visit mines once per day and you will acquire more diamonds to be sold for addtional income without maps you will only get very few diamonds

the major addtion to this game are quests so there is a nice closure to the game apart from the main quest you can also perform side quests to earn some extra gold however the side quests are pretty straight forward when you are in major town take note of the quest marker on the pub market or merchant these quest simply requires you to visit certain town to complete which has totally no impact to the game itself

this game does seem to be a nice time killer if you are into tad simple resource and trading casual game pesonally it gets really boring after a while the goods that you purchase is always the market selling price and selling them as cost meaning a goods selling base price will never exceed the purchasing price this makes trading rather difficult as you can only make profit when there is a price hike demands for the item in the town several items are only available for sale in major town and selling them in other towns will guarantee a loss since the town always buys them with a flat rate

some of the side quests has inaccurate description it clearly says go to town x but the quest doesnt trigger when i am there i end up travelling from town to town in order to find the actual place for the quest also some achievement do not unlock i did some research and many players have the same achievement problem some claim that the developers knew about this but they stopped supporting this game entirely already so my guess is there will not be a fix any time soon

#####

310  boring it reminds me of an app

not a lot of substance here a basic trading game no real plot or story you have to earn 1000000 gold through mircro trades while getting robbed traveling etc 

just not enough to compel me to keep playing id much rather play space trader or another kick ass game

worth 029 if you suck at real games and like to play boring apps

i dont even remember where i got this trash but it looks mildly interesting make money trade items make more money do quests right wrong this game is unbalanced and unnervingly difficult and when you do actually manage to make a profit the robbers come and fuck you did a little experiment got 30 men for hire went to the mine for 48 diamonds had just enough money to get back to town got robbed twice on the way back to town alt  f4 uninstalled

#####

first of all 16bit trader is not a bad game its just one of those casual games for mobiles that dont try to impress you or provide any special experience but pursue only one simple goal  to let you kill some time and all in all 16bit trader does the job pretty well its a simple trading game that allows you to kill some time without thinking much and  or remembering anything exactly what you need after a long and hard day well at least on paper youre a good guy who needs to avenge his father by making a lot of money to make the bad guy suffer the goal of the game is to make 1000000 of gold after you get the gold you see the ending and thats it the game is over and you cant continue playing you can get the money by traveling from city to city trading goods in our usual buy cheap sell dear way mining for diamonds in special places and doing some simple quests that basically want you to travel from city to city

in other words the whole game is just that  click click click the game supports touch controls by the way so you can get the same experience with the mobiles if you want and theres always something to do its also somewhat addictive thanks to simplistic ui unfortunately i cant recommend this game for three reasons first it quickly becomes boring just because its waytoo repetitive as ive already said all quests here are the same  travel from one city to another so soon youll stop reading the text and just look for your destination more variety will be really nice here second you can solve almost everything by just saving a lot you was robbed during the travel load your saved game and try again thats basically it theres no strategy just luck all problems can be solved by saving often but thats exactly where we find the final problem of this game  savegame bug the thing is  at some random point the game begins to refuse to save after that point the only way to finish your journey is to do it in one long run should i say that like any other tradingoriented game this one can be pretty long or just use the cheating software to hack the amount of money thankfully its a really easy thing to do as far as i know players were unable to find the solution for this problem while developers just cant fix it even though they tried at one point

so in the end i must say that 16bit trader had a really good chance to become simple but fun time killer unfortunately lack of variety and strategic element together with the savegame bug ruin the whole experience and since it wasnt even supposed to be something big to begin with it feels really bad i mean cheap and poor casual game is a one thing some players can even develop some sympathy to it but when it feels so repetitive without asking anything from the player and at the same time trying to ruin your progress by refusing to save its hard to like it nice attempt but unfortunately the failed one

#####

this game was a huge disappointment i had previously played merchants of kaiden and enjoyed that game so i waas fully looking forward to playing this one now i dont know which game had come out first but upon starting 16bit trader it was basically the same story i was ok with that because as i mentioned before i enjoyed mok but after playing for 5 minutes of this game i bankrupted because the  prices of things arbitrarily go all over the place the only random events that happen seem to be highway roberies to put it bluntly this game sucks and you shouldnt buy it go buy merchants of kaiden instead if you wanna play a merchant type game

nein10 would never play again

#####

you can get far better trading games for free oh i got this one from a dollar bundle  i still wish i didnt

#####

nope

110

#####

the save system is buggy cant use my second save slot and sometimes when i load up save slots from slot 1 or 3 it doesnt use the most recent data saved to that slot sooooo thats broken
almost as broken as the rest of the game you can buy food for 10 gold and then sell it other places for 1619 gold other than that there are no other noticable ways to profit quests often lead to annoying quest chains with no reward until the final quest or in rare cases dont have any rewards at all
this game is very unbalanced and unplayable in my opinion 

#####

the prototype for merchants of kaidan which is a much prettier game with a lot more polish and a lot less wasted clicks  different world map but same plot and same quests

#####

16 bugs trader a total failure bugs everywhere when the game mechanics are very simple and the small bit which is working scripted sidequests they didnt get wrong look like theyre made to be frustrating and annoying
most achievements wont unlock devs are already working on their next failure and dont answer any of their angry players inquiry

#####

this is basically one of those games that the developers create to have this trading cards situation its bland its pointless its buggy it might as well be shovelware  and even then theres no quantity so theres that

#####

good game is a bit difficult at first  but once you save the game nearly everytime you move towns you get the hang of it 810

#####

good cards

#####

i mean theres a game there i almost wanna recommend it because for the price there is some gameplay to play however the gameplay loop isnt as interesting and without external help i find it difficult to have a fighting chance to win it looks like its made in unity and they forgot to use textmeshpro cause text look pretty blurry on 1440p

i would say buy it if it looks interesting but for the average user i would probably just go find something free to play thats better

#####

looks like they tried to clone merchants of kaidan only they removed all the profit from the game and messed everything up just go buy merchants of kaidan instead its 1000x better than this mobile game trash

#####

i got this game for free and i still feel ripped off 

the only good thing about this game is that it has trading cards but you probably wouldnt get any of them unless you used something like steam idle master which i did because you wont even play the game for 5 minutes

dont buy this

#####

there is clearly something wrong with this game and its saves they simply are not working properly and so on

#####

saving function works randomly
once you discover how prices work you can beat the game by travelling between two places a city and a nearby castle
if i knew it was this simple and bugged i wouldnt have bought this game

#####

unplayable really not fun in any way shape or form

#####

i am an avid fan of tradewinds series and click and point adventure or trading types of games like this but 16bit trader is simply infuriating and slow 

the main problem is luck all prices and bandit encounters are simply based on randomized luck there is no logic like a farmers city would sell food at low price or a hunters town would buy arms at a high price there is also no base way to protect yourself from bandits who will steal about half of your belongings if you run into them without hiring protection along the road 

as a 2015 game i expected better mechanics than this extremely not recommended

#####

i honestly expected better from forever entertainment as i quite liked their frederic rhythm games but despite this mobile port having charming artwork and a low price theres nothing much else to recommend the game is repetitive boring and chance plays a huge part in your success or failure 

httpwwwchoicestgamescom20160416bittraderreviewhtml

i will say that as of now this game is very moderately playable the randomnes but yet sort of guided gameplay is unreliable it is very possible that you will be robbed like 4 times out of the first 10 dayswhich happened to me three times thus making it nearimpossible to successfully complete that game

 it is somewhat fun once you can reach earlymid game and have plenty of money to back up your journey from the very common raids but up until that point it was almost purely a game of completing quests which are often wild goose chases after all of the quests if you dont lose too much money you should end up with several thousand gold that is when you start working as an actual caravan tradesman 

 which brings me to my next point the trade is fluctuates very rapidly and it is nearly impossible to trade successfully with the beginner goods which is another factor that leads you to have to do quests to begin with and once you move on to the more expencive items it is easy to lose most of your investment if you are buying large quantities of the stuff unless you observe the prices on the stuff before you start investing

 all in all i give this game 610 so i would say play it as long as you can get it at a discount definately not worth the 3

#####

i like this game allot its simple straight forward and works 810

#####

i usually love trading games but i dont know what this is prices are random and most times you cant make a profit as the buy prices are higher than the selling prices anywhere city descriptions give you no clue about what to buy or sell either one city for example had in its description that the people eat lots and lots of food there so i thought i could make money by bringing them food but their food was the cheapest cant recommend at all

#####

it was fun got my time and money out of it worth 3 i play and its take a minute to get use to all in all its a game

#####

plain and simple but the german translation is a horror to grammarnazis d 
maybe you shouldnt use googletranslator but a guy that actually can translate from english to german 

i gotta play it on english  thats a lot better tho
nice gameconcept with an old traderstyle not bad

#####

httpsyoutubefl8kty7pera

the economy in this trading game is completely askew with almost no reasonable way to make a profit

#####

very hard 

#####

will not recommand interesting at start but unable to save and other issues is a huge turn off for this game

#####

 get into a town and save
 reload save until a quest comes up
 save with new quest
 repeat steps above
 travel with multiple quests running
 bandits what bandits load save
 pull into town deliver most quests and get minted

#####

theres not really a sense of economics in this game it seems more of a way to stumble around trying to get random chance to work for you if there is something more to the game its really not explained in any capacity

#####

i bought this with some money i had left from buying another game i only expected to joke with it for some time but the trading market traveling etc made me like it its like wall street simulator

#####

absolutly broken gamefilled with glitches do not buy this game no matter what

#####

there is no real trader in this game
it should be 16bit load save again

#####

there is no exit function needs to altf4
its pretty much boring and it looks like you can make a deal only with food
you need to save every move

#####

it is next to impossible to make money tradeing in this game  and that is the main feature

#####

merchants of kaidan is better  not only because of the casual slant im surprised to see its the same developer

#####

the backgrounds are good i guess game is garbage

#####

there is no logic to this game everything is completely random and mostly negative

#####

really wanted to like this game however there seems to be no reason behind price fluctuations and no way to actually tell who is in need of what so buy a lot of something and randomly wander around until someone is buying it for more the exception is if you buy someone a drink enough they might just tell you where you can get a good price but from what ive read that seems to actually create the price and only until you visit once leave and its gone 
the random prices are 98 of the game and cant hold it up pass on this one

#####

god

#####

i was going to post this as a positive but then i thought about it for a moment and decided to go with negative  why  because while it is a decent enough text adventure when you actually get lucky enough to get going its far too luck based

or like me you could just get annoyed at it enough and decide to bump up your starting gold with cheat engine  which to me seems like a general failing of the game that i had to cheat in order to get any enjoyment out of it

i got it for free and its general premise is good  i honestly did try to like it

i got free achievements and i got trading cards out of it  after i 100 it ill likely never look at it again

#####

no why way to win easly i mean the rules break so much like what are rules here i see none might play more looks fun to play but get on sale hope the cards pay off 232016 cause of a bug with opaning volume mixer the game is unplayble for me wow dont get just for cards even removeing this 548 pm fixed on my end all games work excerpt this tis is a sad game

#####

the real bandits in the game is the game

#####

    i cant save my progress


#####

16bit trader is very unique compared to other games i usually play in 16bit trader you are the heir to your familys throne and you must try and restore its former glory selling the only diamonds your family has left you must travel from city to city buying and selling goods and accepting quests from strangers although i highly recommend that you buy your own drinks it seems the people in this game have no problem accepting drink after drink and spilling their secrets

 although the game does not involve action or dedication to become succesful it does require a certain amount of skill combined with luck you will need to know the knowledge of buying and selling products it will take you a lot of tries in order to win but you quickly get the hang of it

quick tips visit the mines frequently for easy diamonds right of the bat

pros cozy relaxing feel easy on the eye graphics interesting quest and much much more
cons although i am sure there are flaws in the game as far as i can tell it is well put together
rating 710
thats all for now

 reapr

#####

meh

#####

the rare times i would find things to buy at low prices happen to find someone buying high the next day the deal is gone back to the negative

#####

it does everything wrong in a trading sim
1 you lose money selling if you can buy at 40 will only sell for 35
2 you lose money traveling so moving from a lowprice city to highprice will cost 50100 or more
3 you lose money in random events to thieves or tolls so moving is even more expensive
4 the maximum price difference between low and high is perhaps 50

take that together spend 400 on 10 units spend 100 traveling lose another 20 to events get to a town with 50 prices so 60 each sell at only 45 each you spent 520 on buying and travel only to sell your goods for 450 and a 70 loss you count yourself lucky at least you didnt take a loss on the goods themselves for once

its utterly obvious that the devs never actually tried to play the game without infinite money hacks there are countless free webbased flash games that do this better and just as a note this isnt even 16bit so the name is a lie too

#####

good game  well played i like it

#####

i would trade this game i could do that bring me back to the darkness please

#####

alright so if im going to be honest id say that i found this game to be a chore i love the idea of the game but i find that im not playing it properly the reason why i say that is i find it impossible to actually beat the game because i am always coming across bandits or running out of money because my character cant fix the holes in his pockets after reading the community guides for this game i then realized what to do if you are up for the challenge of beating this game i suggest you try because its crazy difficult but if you invest enough time and research youll eventually get the hang of it or youll jump off the tallest building you can find either or

#####

best

#####

a trading simulator but not a good one

#####

when i bought this game i went ooo im good at buying low and selling high  the stuff sold in towns though seem random and doesnt make sense  first thing i saw was ooo food is cheap and the town next seem to never be able to get enough food  i go there    they sell the food for less  how does that even make sense

#####

the only way to win is to abuse saveload the game tries to be an adventure but has no end objective

#####

to date this is easily the worst game i have played on steam and that is saying something this game is literally a broken turd a buy and sell game with fundamentally flawed and broken economics which means it is impossible to plan ahead and selling lots of one good raise the prices of all goods being sold its a game of flip a weighted coin its 100 luck but youre more then likey going to lose withing saving and reloading every step of the way

so you go around losing money getting robbed getting shafted by crazy economics seriously dev go and study economics for a day and youll have 100x more of a clue then what you had when making this game and thats about that

just dont buy it not even for the cards this is never worth your time even if you waste just a fraction of a second on it 010

#####

#####

i know this game has gotten a lot of negative reviews but honestly its not as bad as some people will have you believe yes this game is difficult but if you play smart its not impossible i dunno maybe im just a patient oldskool gamer whos used to the harshness of permadeath roguelikes

this game requires a slow but steady approach instead of a get rich quick scheme the problem most people seem to run into is that they upgrade their wagon too early buy too much merchandise they cant sell and then bleed money on travel costs and bandit attacks bandits while random are proportionately attracted to larger merchants the more cargo you have the more likely you will be attacked if you cant recoup from a bandit attack then youre expanding too fast in short dont bite off more than you can chew a smaller wagon with less cargo will be more successful in the long run

with all that said this seems to be a lite version of merchants of kaidan which is bigger and offers more in the way of trading investing and politics so if you enjoyed this game you will definitely love that one

now go and make some coin

tldr hotspot trader with high rng and penalty for every move incured comes across as unplayable and mechanically wonked out

buy low sell high a concept that worked great in web games such as drug wars on websites of the nineties completely botched here no way to know what to buy when seems like everyone mostly ever has the average price for everything and you can only sell at a loss given that you must pay to travel will suffer banditry and mishaps wich will penalize you even more unless you pay for insurance in the form of mercenaries which costs a flat fee and maintenance then its not hard to see that all the odds are stacked against you through attrition to make it impossible to survive let alone turn a profit or  lol make a million coins a ridiculously broken game probaly programmed by dr evil

you can make such a game within few minutes even in ms excel via vba for free this title is overpriced and even playing it for free will waste your time

all you do is just click on building click on an article buy some click on map ride to another city and pray for random number generator to be mercy with you generating sell price at least 1 less than your buy price you may repeat this infinite times to achieve 1 000 000 to make vengeance on the richest merchant and fill your fathers dream

#####

i love trading in games and i thought for 029 usd i will give this a shot this is by far the worst trading game i have ever seen free to play would be too expensive for this game if i could give a negative 10 out of 5 i would you do the quests they dont give you the money you buy anything eg food for 10 to sell for 15 but the taxes on the way to finding a town that actually sells for profit and youve lost money in the end anyway 80 of towns arent tradeable with the previous 5 towns

utter trash im more disappointed that i gave this game a few play throughs to see if it was just me but no this game is trash

this is probably the first time i regret buying a game with 029 just what in the hell is going on in the game and what are we trying to achieve

boring rpg but a fairly nice concept barely any introduction

#####

three word hard and meaningless

#####

nice

#####

the plot of the game is not bad but the gameplay is very hard its easier to get 1 million in real life than in this game

#####

your goal is to make 1 000 000 gold

but youre not going to make it

#####

just for steam trading cards nothing else

#####

achievments dont work there is no real balance in this game you can lose by chance and the trading in the game can be completely avoided

#####

if you want to play this game then i hope that you like getting frustrated over nonsensical broken mechanics more than you like trading

the actual trading of 16bit trader quite frankly doesnt work if you plan to make a profit off of it instead of having cities specialize in making certain products thus letting you buy said products in those places at a discount the prices of all goods seem to fluctuate in waves across the map as far as i can tell if you enter a town and theyre selling cheap goods there then theres a good chance that every other town surrounding you is also selling everything cheaply so your only option is to haul your cart across the map one town at a time in hopes of finding a town thats buying things for a decent price but its likely that the wave of low prices has decided to go in the direction youre traveling there is no way to check what the prices of things will be without actually stepping foot in the town unless you manage to get lucky when giving a tavern patron booze and they actually tell you something useful so you end up just blindly traveling and hoping that when you hit the next town you can dump your 20 units of food that youve had for over a month for a 40 gold profit

speaking of profit you cannot reliably hold onto it there are costs every time you travel between locations that are in some cases utterly obscene one of the routes leading into another town from the starting city end up costing 100 gold to travel on as reference you start out with about 550 gold and i had 200300 left by the time i finished buying goods in the starting city there are also random encounters that provide one of two effects either your trip gets delayed by a few days which is pointless unless youre going for the achievements or you get attacked by bandits bandit attacks happen far far too frequently and drain far too much money when they happen i had 1800 gold and bandits took 600 of it when they attacked and they can attack whenever and however frequently they want you can apparently hire mercenaries to protect you and the frequency of bandit attacks did seem to decrease when i hired one but that could just be luck and i was wary of hiring more since it said that they require upkeep but did not specify how much upkeep

that leaves the tens of various quests for you to do in order to hopefully make some money to cover the traveling and bandit raids every quest that i saw was essentially the same thing go to x city and in the case of fetch quests travel back to the city you got the quest in however this game just has to add on a frustrating twist to every mechanic and the quest system is no exception many of the quests give you extra go to x city steps along the way without telling you about it when you get the quests taking a man to a certain city nope he meant a different city and will only tell you that when you get to the original city he said finally brought someone to their destination they wont pay you until you also go to another city to get them something they want going to a city to pick up an item for someone the merchant doesnt accept money so you need to go to another city to get an item that the merchant wants so you can get the item you actually need these surprise steps along the way make it impossible to estimate your total traveling costs for the quest to see if its actually worth doing or not i got a quest with 56 surprise steps to it once and was not pleased at the 1000 gold i received as payment because i was so frustrated with it at that point

basically this game makes you want to change your job as a trader to a much more desirable and profitable career where you travel across the countryside to slaughter any bandits and quest npcs you find

wow this is really really bad completely random with a horrible interface

#####

couldnt save game properly naturally this makes it rather unplayable unless you dont mind marathoning the game

#####

overall score 0510

fun factor  it has its moments but can be frustrating in the begining

controls  easy to use click with a mouse  no issues

gamplay  smooth and no lag

graphics  decent for what the game is

sound  works fine  no glitches

music  ok music nothing super fancy or catchy

content  buy sell trade repeat  easy concept  similar to other games in its style

replayability  there is some since you can start off differently each time in how you want to start your trading

price  i used a coupon and would recommend it

conclusion  overall it seems like a tough game to get going but a ok time killer if you want some thing to do or make some quick trades for profits in game

its a cute little game where you run around trying to gain a bunch of money for revenge 
all the prices are random within a certain range for example the foods sell ranges from 8 gold to around 17 when you figure the low sell points that part gets easy
but you cant make the big bucks in the market 
take up quests whenever you get the chance even if theyre redundant and make you run back and forth a dozen times
and hit up those caves and ruins for some easy money

biggest pro is the price its a cheap fun time killer
biggest con is the repetitiveness once you get the ropes you pretty much do the same thing 

i would say this would be a good game for an 814 year old shows them how an economy works in a cute game

litteraly best game for idling 1

i am 32 years old

my exwife and i have a daughter together and we adopted our son together both are now 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i felt lost and unhappy i was selfdestructive one day i was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that i punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion this resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right handthe hand i worked with played games with and used to carry my children to bedthe hand i desperately needed to ensure i could continue providing

upon learning the severity of the selfinflicted damage i became almost suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i had never experienced anger outbursts nor was i the type to break down and cry but i was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side

with nothing better to do i looked for a game i could play with one hand while recovering somehow i stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments i decided it was worth a try i must admit i didnt beat the game nor did i play as much as some of you in fact i may have played this game for only a day or two that being said after doing so i had a new joy and hope for life i managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me i could experience the joy and happineass of other people i relaxed for 5  minutes listening to this music long enough to realize that i would be okay

after realizing this i turned off the game and went back to work my hand hurt a lot but i was motivated i stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father i needed to be at that moment not the weak boy i was behaving like

today i am close friends with the mother of my children we dont fight argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

now i have 3 children my third child is wait also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each others lives we have been dating for a year and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life has in store for you and if i had given up when all odds were against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

pretty hard but fun

i thought i could trade this game away for 16 bitsdisappointed

#####

i had high hopes for this game it could have been a nice trading game but unfortunatly the game has some problems which stop you from enjoying it

the goal of the game is to get revenge of your fatherhow you do that you ask you get richier then the guy that was responsible for your father doom by getting an extravangant ammount of gold 1000000

soo far soo good they give you a basic tutorial but thenthe first thing i notice is hmm where are the 16bit style i was expecting nowhere misleading titlewell the artstyle is really good soo i let it slide 
then the real game problems start to make themselves clear your not trading your gambling if you buy a maximum amount of anything youve already failed because then you lack the funds to travel to the next town to sell what you have

pros
nice artstyle

cons
misleading title
really hard to start a new game
a lot of luck required
more like gambling not trading

would i recomend it 
nohas someone else on the reviews already said i would trade the game

#####

16bit trader is a management game where you try to become the richest merchant in the entire land

#####

tedious grindy too little rewards not enough to make profit travel costs too expensive lose lose lose before you make a profit maybe i didnt make any game doesnt keep track of prices you have to write down prices randomize at each new game more writing down did i say grindy

forget it not worth your time play freelancer if you want a good experience at trading it keeps track of every price and it doesnt change play elite dangerous also better at trading it keep track of prices but prices may not be accurate or play privateer ii easier to make money than this all the other alternatives i mentioned are easier at making money plus way more fun

better leave it and save your time and energy for better things

very confusing and not enjoyable

#####

disclaimer i got this game for free thanks to indiegala

i wouldnt recommend this game at least at the start its just a grinding game of buying things in some towns and selling them for more at other towns the problem is that you get robbed all the time and you can only reduce the penalty by hiring people and this will make travelling more expensive it is already very expensive

i cant say if theres much outside of it because i couldnt get past that starting point there are quests but you have to travel to the other side of the map then return and go back again to collect a small reward you can also get some diamonds at some mines but thats it

i would have liked to get past the starting point but its ridicolous or at least antiintuitive and very luck dependant i will point out that half of the positive reviews are because of the trading cards or because or funny reactions to an unfair game the only way some people played without problems is by saving constantly so as to cheat on the random bandit encounters

constructive criticism do something about the bandits also there are no places where theres just  one product that is cheapermore expensive there are places where everything is cheaper and places where everything costs more it would be great and more realistic if you could buy cheap food somewhere and where you sell it a pricey towncity buy cheap clothes for example

final notes buggy apparently saves dont work nor do some achievements difficult in a bad way there are people who could get past the start and it seems that it will be grinding the whole game

16bit trader is better than alleged paragon of the genre tradewind series as it does not make you fight pirates and bandits instead of trading
indeed you can not do that at all instead highway thieves peacefully rob you of cash and wares regardless of the size of your retinue social standing and exploit foul play reloading an autosave will only help you so far as it does not work for long first you loose the ability to save then you find yourself no longer able to autosave
to further boost robbers moral your character is prohibited to store cash in banks feature not implemented or at least cars 500 gold pieces being the selling price and 1500 the acquisition price thus these devils attack you once in every 34 land moves while on sea mighty crackens stand guard the most perilious place is not thieves guild base too but rather royal army training grounds

porcelain makers village does not sell porcelain hamlets will sell food for the same price as big cities
the only way to recieve your margin is to buy at the lowest level of prices yes prices for food and jewels do only rise and fall simultaneously wait for 100 days or so and sell at the highest possible price amplitude does not change throughout the game even if an undead army scourges the southern lands after which there is more waiting untill the prices fully recede
so if you deal in jewelry of which you can load 250 units on one car you can expect roughly 30gold250u7500gold margin which gives you 7500gold200days37gd with the base travelling cost ranging from 2 to 7 as well as bridge tolls that leaves you at the very best 960 gold to give to the robbers taken that they will usaully rob you once in 16 days 

therefore you must either take pleasure in a very slow growth rateexpect 10h of gameplay and remember you cant save or loiter around looking for diamonds and doing quests which will result in a slightly faster my farmlike experience


recap 16 bit trader is a demo version of merchants of kaidan

pros to cons

you will come to know game content in 5 min             game is unbeatable unless you can endure a 10 hours sit
fair price if bought at a discount                                   demo versions are supposed to be free
not obliged to lead armies into skirmishes over groceries           brigands will drive you into bankruptcy 
longterm price change                                                 no forces godly or manly can disrupt the 200 day cycle
