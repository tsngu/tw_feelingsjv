i was really bad at video games when i started playing this game by all means i was not the target audience for this almost 5 years and 136 hours in game later i have finally beaten the devil and beat the game for the first time 1010 gaming experience

#####

remember when you were a kid and you got sick you got to skip school and stay in bed watching cartoons all day but in the evening your sickness got worse you had a fever and when you fell asleep these cartoons came back to torment you in colorful surreal nightmares
this game is exactly what you saw that night

#####

this is how you make a videogame
great price for the content it offers
no problems on day 1 for pc users
no stupid season pass or preorder bonus
great cure for detail and only a few occasional glitches

i tought the best 2d game i played this year was hollow knight but this holds up for a goty

edit  finally finished the game took me about 910 hours
its a great experience if you want an hard and fair challenge
every single enemy and boss is unique making the game very diverse and giving you a lot of fun troughout it
and if you feel like challengin yourself when you beat the final boss you unlock the expert mode with is insanely difficult
overall its a 910 because even if its not too long the hours youll have with it will be really fun

idk man
its hard
why does mugman take a sip out of his own cup before every fight
like really wtf is he drinking

boverallb ok so  the game is currently rated overwhelmingly positive and theres tons of gameplay footage and hype surrounding this game so you probably already know if you want this game and whether youll enjoy it  but in case youre one of the few who doesnt know already lemme just lay it out for you

this is a platformer bullet hell lite game  dying carries no penalties  which is good because you die a lot  theres a guy on isle 2 that keeps track of just how much you died  i hate that guy  still its hard  bosses have patterns and the patterns are difficult to master and sometimes you still screw up even when you know exactly whats about to happen  it takes several tries on each boss and each boss is its own type of challenging  a lot of people struggled with the flower guy but i breezed past him  but then i had trouble with the candyland chick and shes supposedly super easy  so give yourself some slack

but not too much slack  the tutorial is easy  if you struggle with the tutorial you have a problem  if you dont understand the reference look up the cuphead tutorial videos  i promise youll find it

anyway winning feels super rewarding because its hard  but its not maddening and unforgiving like dark souls  you get an instant retry with basically no lost progress  and when you finally get it youll get that really satisfied feeling that has me addicted to this game  and every boss is beatable and no boss move is broken or undodgeable you just have to learn how and thats part of why its so rewarding  you really feel like you earned it

the game is very focused on boss fights  there are some side scrolling levels with the same general feel to them  the controls are intuitive the animations are honestly the most fun and entertaining out of any game ive played bar none  the soundtrack fits perfectly  i laughed at the shift between boss forms several times  its just fun

try it  youll know before 2 hours if you like it or not  obviously most people did  personally i think its the most refreshing game ive played in a while

bbottom lineb easy recommend

fantastic i hope the studio can survive the incredible cost of time money and blood sweat and tears they poured into this game

quite frankly id pay to see them make actual cuphead cartoons

i finally beat the tutorial

#####

it took me a while but i finally beat the tutorial

#####

i this match will be red hot here goes i

lord knows what attempt number and you again hear the ring bell the level boss keeps laughing taunting your every failure the brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache your eyes are moving on their own the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense the anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try the reactions become pure instinct flowing in a quick relentless succession of moving shooting and dodging a thousand projectiles but suddenly it happens 

ia knockouti 
phew that was intensetime for the next one

this is the very essence of cuphead a punishing yet immensly satisfying game of bullet hell mixed with a beautiful and just so goddamned perfectly recreated animation technique that will have you wondering what crazy stuff they will make up next this is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment its a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didnt just put blood tears effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years they put so much love love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten

the most pure fun i had raging in the whole year absolutely recommended to anyone up for a challenge that will give as much as it takes

#####

hours of exertion honing my skills and drinking caffeinated beverages but i was finally able to do it i beat the tutorial

#####

totally 1010
 hilarious and versatile boss
 brainwashing music
 most importanly nostalgical atmosphere

remind me of casper donald popeye contra era when days were just simply happy

#####

brilliant truly brilliant

gameplaywise it reminds me quite a bit of 8 and 16bit era platformers like contra and super contra gunstar heroes or a spedup mega man the only way to win is to practice and learn and get better learn how the bosses move learn when youre safe to move and learn the entire sequence of the boss battle its difficult but very compelling  you want to try again right away because ah ha now i figured out his pattern but the boss stages have multiple waves so you dont learn their one trick and its over you have to remember the tricks to each wave of the boss stage its the perfect balance between challenging and frustrating you can do it youll just have a good number of fun failed attempts along the way

if cuphead were just about the gameplay it would be a solid title but not exactly groundbreaking but that art oh my god that art i was already a huge fan of old cartoons from warner bros fleischer studios disney and others so even if cuphead made a mediocre attempt at the style i would have loved it but im thrilled to say the art style the humor the little touches here and there perfect the game is a visual delight and its not just the style thats compelling its the black humor throughout like characters shooting craps in an empty coffin its like the bleakest betty boop or porky pig cartoon where every animal vegetable and mineral is an anthropomorphic nightmare

while cuphead is a combination of 1980s platform gameplay and 1930s cartoon stylings it feels like one of the freshest experiences ive had gaming in quite a while very warmly recommended

#####

been playing platformers since apogee era games in the early 90s and have to say that this is among one of my favourite games out of the entire genre cuphead isnt just a masterpiece in terms of its artistic audio and visual work the games design and gameplay shines just as much as those do 

the games art style is a tribute to 1930s cartoons and the gameplay mechanics are a mishmash of 90s shootemup side scrollers such as contra metal slug and gunstar heros more so the latter and though there are a few run and gun levels which involve platforming collecting coins shootingavoiding enemies until you reach the end of the level the games main focus is on boss fights each being very unique from the last 

the game itself is not easy either although i wouldnt say its as hard as a lot of people make it out to be it is very forgiving seeing as youre able to retry bosseslevels at your own leisure rather than getting slapped with a gameover screen after your continues are depleted the fights are completely fair too although punishing should you lose concentration and mistime a dodge or not memorize the way certain attacks work and repeat the same mistakes over and over again until even the announcer begins to sound bored of announcing the start of battles 

the audiosoundtrack is incredibly well done all original music composed for this game sound in place for a 30s cartoon as do the sound effects

meticulous effort went into every aspect of this games design it was hard to wipe a smile off my face while playing it although a few bosses came close to achieving that beyond having a great time with this game whats even more great is that something like this exists in this era of gaming aswell being a critical and commercial success it gives me hope for the future of this industry for newcomers dont be intimidated by people complaining that its too hard it really isnt each fight is fair and although admittedly some bosses for me almost took the same amount of time to defeat that others took to complete the entire game the joy of overcoming a challenge was monumentally satisfying 

highly recommended game and deserves every bit of the praise it has recieved looking forward to seeing what this developer delivers in the future as there was no lack of effort put into the creation of this game

#####

if you dont enjoy a good challenge this might not be your cup of tea

#####

i cant beat the devil because i am color blind and cant see the little pink sparks but the most of the game is very cool

#####

paying debt to the devil is not an easy feat

highly recommend for anyone who miss punishing 80searly 90s run n guns like contra and megaman the 1930s animation style is also amazing to look at with surreal boss designs very similar to silly symphony

the controls are very arcadey with 8 directional shooting single jump descending platforms and a special attack but it also adds parrying and dash which were way less common back then parrying is not the same as most games as you can only parry certain pink bullets or enemies done by bouncing off it while in midair working as a double jump it does not shoot the projectile back at the boss but instead gives you one full card for your your super meter letting you use a special attack for the specified weapon you have equipped or a super attack if you hold 5 cards 

you can have two weapons equipped during a level and switch them instantly whenever you want the weapons in the game are situational enough for that i would switch them around for specific bosses though the charge shot is currently a little too strong so i used it for almost every boss in expert mode when i found out its strength but theres still good use for the other weapons since it doesnt give crowd control like spread shot and boomerang and lobber bullets that drop after being shot and chaser chases enemies let you have better positionings on some bosses

every boss has multiple phases and are only 13 minutes long but due to everything you gotta dodge all the time without much breaks just one minute can feel waaaaay longer this is something i felt for furi as well another amazing challenging boss rush game i recommend the boss phase transformations are very surreal and they can go from being a couple battletoads turning into a slot machine or a bird stuck in a bird house to a featherless bird carried in a stretcher spitting up its heart that attacks you you can choose between fighting them in simple or regular mode simple mode gives you linear patterns while regular they will be random so you have to be more careful with what the boss will do next you can only get a contract by playing on regular mode required to advance the game but simple mode  is okay for practicing the patterns the difficulty of the bosses curves really well too it starts out a little rough but gets really challenging at the second island and even more so at the third island then the finale after that is a true satans work

there are also shoot em up bosses with the same parrying but instead of dashing it lets you shrink to move faster and dodge projectiles since your hitbox is smaller as well but it also reduces your range and damage to balance it out

platforming sections which were added later in development and got the game delayed are actually pretty good too they really feel like old arcade platformers most platformer levels also have a miniboss at the end so theyre still not bossless even a mega man 2 reference in one of them the intensity of them are on the same scale as the boss fights you wont be running around without enemies coming at you from multiple directions only thing i thought could be done better is hiding the coins theyre a little too easy to obtain so most of the challenge is just finishing the stage itself with a good rating you generally wont have to replay the level just to try and find coins you couldnt 

but on the topic of coins you can find hidden things in the overworld some characters will reward you with a coin for doing things for them and there are a few hidden paths granting you a coin or a shortcut to later levels its a really nice touch i wasnt even expecting from this type of game

the replayability is also great for with expert mode being unlocked after beating the game and trying to get s rank for every boss there is also a pacifist rank for platform stages where you have to beat the stage without killing anything which can be tricky since most stages have midbosses or walls that you need to find ways to skip

i had been waiting for this game for years and it honestly went beyond my expections its definitely one of my favourite games after just 10 hours and hope you all buy it its a very rare gem you wont see much of in modern gaming

#####

look at my playtime
this game is the best game that i have played in my life

#####

its a good game at the beginning but then after you get past isle 1 everything goes downhill everything kills you you stay on the same boss for hours until you get a lucky shot and barely win and after you celebrate and think the worst is behind you it gets worse your family and friends begin to worry about your mental health because every time you see a cup you breakdown crying remembering this game which is the equivalent to hell overall good game

#####

remember when you were a kid and you got sick you got to skip school and stay in bed watching cartoons all day but in the evening your sickness got worse you had a fever and when you fall asleep these cartoons came back to toment you in colorful surreal nightmares
this game is exactly what you saw that night

#####

if you pirate this i will find you this game is a masterpiece and the devs deserve every cent

please add online coop

ive been waiting for cuphead since it was first revealed in 2014 now its finally here cuphead a super difficult platformerrun  gun game with outstanding visuals one which mimics the aesthetics of 1930s cartoons to perfection the game is pretty but we knew that for the last 3 years but is the gameplay any good

cuphead is basically a series of boss fights with the occasional run  gun level in between all accessible via an explorable map it was originally designed as a purely boss fights game but when it got a lot of attention at the 2014 e3 studiomdhr decided to make something bigger and better and i for one am glad they did nothing in the game feels as if it was just an afterthought every boss and every level is well thought out and just feels great

if you look at the screenshots im sure you will agree they are absolutely stunning the game doesnt just look similar to 1930s animations it looks exactly like it not only is it drawn perfectly it also mimics the animations spot on combined with a nice filter that simulates the flickering of an old film the illusion is complete you really feel like you are in an old cartoon

the sound is equally convincing the game plays an original song on the title screen and right away it feels like this is a very authentic reimagination of the cartoons of yore a style that extends not only in regards to the visuals but also the audio all sound effects music and voices sound like they were taken directly from an old film reel

but how does it play responsive controls are very important for this type of game and they are responsive that is you have just a few actions the basic movement itself a dash move standard and special attack and a movement lock which keeps cuphead in place while shooting aside from that you can switch through your available weapons while in the air combat missions you also have the ability to hold down a button in order to morph into a smaller version of yourself that is more agile just doing lesser damage thats as far as the controls go the game is not about complexity quite the opposite you have a very limited set of moves but need to execute them perfectly in order to succeed if you die in a level its most likely your own fault

you may already have heard that cuphead is supposed to be quite difficult indeed it is both the bosses and the run  gun levels are extremely challenging sometimes so challenging that it took me 20 or more tries to get it done so dont let yourself be fooled by the kiddy graphics this game is hard and you will get bogged down on certain stages if you dont enjoy fighting a boss over and over just to get a little better every time until you eventually beat him just barely better think twice before getting cuphead as brilliant as the game is  it is certainly not for everyone it might look mainstream and even childish when looking at the screenshots but the reality is that it is a niche title for a niche audience it is fast pure and unforgiving it wont hold your hand it wont help you on the way however if you can handle the difficulty you will enjoy cuphead a great deal nothing is more satisfying than beating a boss that you really got stuck on for the last hour

cuphead is the game we were all hoping for the presentation is unique and nearly perfect in both video and audio the gameplay is simple and precise it is challenging and addictive i suffered from just one more try syndrome quite a bit for those who dont mind challenge and brutal difficulty it is nearly perfect with very few things to criticize it may be a simple game but what it does it does extremely well if you are even remotely interested in this kind of game and dont mind the difficulty this is a mustbuy

 gorgeous visuals a beautiful reimagination of 1930s cartoons they couldnt have done it better
 sound design music sound effects and speech all feel very authentic
 boss design every boss fight is different in both the look and mechanics
 difficulty a welcome challenge to some but a deal breaker to many others
 hectic gameplay you have so much to dodge on the screen and the game is so unforgiving that you dont have the time to admire the beautiful art style

#####

do not trust the cute art
this game is about pain

#####

paid full price for this game on steam and i am glad i did not skip over this after hearing a lot of things about this game i decided to look into it this game is quite challenging but it makes you want to continue playing and see what is next even if you have to do it over and over again 

the control is pretty good and you move well even with a mouse and keyboard i beat the game using mouse and keyboard a controller is not necessary but it probably might make the game slightly easier or a lot i was able to beat expert mode with a keyboard so for people who just want to use keyboard it is doable

the music is great and fit the game beautifully the design of the bosses and worlds really does make the game stand out  i dont write reviews much but i did it because this game really deserve recognition also i needed to write a review for the steam awards badge i am a casual badge collector i like badges i just collect them casually

#####

omg i love this so much
fun to control it runs fine on my potato laptop
its colorful
its fun
its amazingly well animated
i love the map i love the bosses so far i love everythign about this
lock on aiming with rb is awesome special weapons parries and attacks you buy from the shop  this is 
pure gold

concerning the difficulty

i bought a cute little mini super nintendo recently and have been working my way through both super castlevania iv and contra 3

those adorable little super nintendo games are fucking hard as fuck much harder than cuphead

cuphead borrows many of the design philosophies that govern those older games but really rounds off the edges in various ways to make it a much more entertaining and forgiving experience

cuphead demands that you learn tells and find the best way to survive attacks oftentimes needing to split your attention between two or three different onscreen threats and rapidly navigate them into constantlymoving safe zones but the tells are obvious and getting into the right position isnt too tough

despite a difficulttomaster parry move cuphead also feels perfect to control once you remap the buttonssee my guide those older super nintendo characters control like bricks in comparison

you also get a pretty sizable arsenal of weapons and perks which can be changed for every encounter i found that each of the weapons had their moment of being the most useful against a particular boss so much of the difficulty can be eliminated once you figure out the best weapons to use

thankfully each level only takes 2 minutes to beat so instantly restarting to try again doesnt feel too punishing or frustrating one endgame cuphead battle is the exception to this  expect to grind through a 5minute run before attempting the boss hardasnails final form

cupheads most important oldschool design quirk is the inherent randomness to onscreen attacks which give the game both its highest highs and lowest lows

on the plus side you can never truly memorize any sort of attack pattern and rinse and repeat the same strategy to win cuphead requires you to stay on your feet reacting on the go since attack patterns are randomized and always thrown together with different timings

this makes cuphead endlessly entertaining but it also comes with a serious caveat the randomness at play means you will often get trapped among attacks that are impossible to avoid no this is not a simple case of git gud it is legitimately unfair and will put you in inescapable death traps quite frequently you can and will improve though and good players should be able to consistently kill bosses on most runs getting a perfect score however which evaluates your time health parries and special moves is another matter entirely

super castlevania iv and contra 3 both feature this randomness  getting impossibly cornered by a boss is par for the course and its basically how most sidescrolling games were designed at the time but these games are significantly harder because you have to progress through much longer sections of the game to reattempt whatever killed you and the controls just dont feel good by todays standards

cuphead is a onehour game that will take you around 812 hours to finish unless you go for high scores and achievements i got my 100 achievement completion at the 17hour mark this was the same way in the olden days  if you paid 70 for a onehour game you would feel cheated so the difficulty was a way to keep players invested cuphead is more than worth your investment even at full price its a fantastic game

whoa ho ho cuphead i picked up this game the moment when i heard that it feels just like the classic contra runngun shooting but in perfect 1930s disney cartoon style where else can you ever find another like this 

so here i go became cuphead boy dressed in red or mugman in blue if you play local coop with your partner shooting magical droplets out of my bare fingertip bashing in an alice in wonderland style cruel little damned island

i used to stay up all night beating contra with my dad when i just started primary school this game for what it is went immediately into my collection 

where should i even start for a game developing team thats made of 3 people after 3 years of development theyve really made sure that almost every aspect of the game for its own genre is done birightib 


b i the pros i b
list
 aesthetics its eyecatching retro colorful cartoon style for this genre makes this game in this apsect one of its own kind they decided to stick to the original 1930s disney cartoon style by using exactly the same technique used for disney cartoons to create the entire cuphead universe  the result you got the jawdropping stunningly goodlooking boss battle runngun shooting game as it is 

 the runngun levels even if they were made after boss battles still deliver what it should have a smooth intuitive and fast paced shooting experience hell even the angry flowers have the similar ai pattern to dodge jumping from the cliff like those busboys in the classical contra for this type of genre such detail really shows up how much theyve dedicated in the game development to make it feels just right

 the boss battle designs do not disappoint every single boss has their own unique attacks and patterns making the whole boss battle experience feels so fresh and rewarding when you just want to beat up the previous so to see what the next boss looks like bosses taunt you scorn you and tease you everytime you die or even during the battle makes your revenge victory even more rewarding

 the character designs are what truly makes this game worth every penny and makes the whole game feels alive and vibrant from the loading screen bouncy hour glass to the angry flowers that chase you around and bosses b everything b is vividly alive and having their own personalities angry sad mad mean etc all shown up on their faces their faces 

every enemy in cuphead encourages you to just shootemup without hesitation this is how such genre of games should be

 the ingame soundtrack is so much more important than one might think for this type of games if its bad or repetitive it directly affects the battles and making the game unenjoyable fast this is also why this game is so good in this aspect because the music is so good 

the cheerful jazz is so well composed even if you die from the battle you still feel you can do it next time thanks to the soundtrack of the game similar to contra who also has great background music that suits every stage of the fight cuphead inherited the good music tradition to be able to deliver a hardcore shootemup in such classy and classical way 
list

b i the cons i b
list
keyboard control even if feels surprisingly smooth and intuitive for its own right is not optimal for this game no designated keys for cornercutting aiming which means you have to hold down 2 keys to do that in the game for a fastpaced shootemup like this you can still do it but might not be as good as using controller at least to me 

 loads of cursing and frustration accompanied by replaying the same level if this is a huge downside to you and affects you a lot dont buy the game

 lacking of online coop
list

heres something i almost forgot to mention
for every game section in cuphead there are utwou difficulty settings for you to choose from bsimpleb and bregularb by default the game will always run on the regular difficulty unless you select simple otherwise simple mode excludes your ability to fight certain bosses whom you can access in regular mode so its completely up to the player which difficulty they want to beat the game on 

b i conclusion i b
for such quality of art design character design and battle design if you enjoy dying your way to perfection this game is for you youre prolly gonna die a lot but if you dont mind such means to achieve faster reflex and having sense of great achievement in having perfect runs even with your partner then go grab this game now

#####

cuphead is a punishingly hard 2d platformer run and gunshmup styled after cartoons from the early 1930s lovingly handdrawn this game is extremely stylish the whole thing recalls cartoons of the 1930s from the audio to the visuals to the fonts to the characters in the game every bit of this game is bursting with 1930s style unlike retro video games this is genuinely a game intended to look as if it was made in the 1930s

at its core cuphead is a boss rush game most of the levels in the game take the form of some sort of multistage boss which transforms itself into new forms as you fight your way through there are no hit point indicators in this during the course of a match you simply have to beat on the boss until it transforms into its next stage with your hits only registering as brief flashes on the boss to indicate that your attack had indeed scored

this gives the game a rather intimidating aesthetic as the bosses are not easy the game starts off with a couple of fairly simple bosses but rapidly ramps up to much more difficult fare by the end of the first world youll be fighting bosses harder than what you see in most 2d platformer games by the end of the second world things are even harder

but you will persevere the game while very difficult also is designed to help you predict the enemy movements which while somewhat randomized are telegraphed albeit without much time to react in some cases and can all be dodged every level can be beaten without taking a hit  and youd better get good at dodging as you only have three hit points

the bosses operate on 1930s cartoon logic as well and often involve both pun names and visual puns the enemies change their attack patterns and often undergo physical transformations  often wild ones  as you fight your way through them unlike modern childrens cartoons at times these could be fairly dark and the bosses become increasingly intimidating in many cases as the game goes on while simultaneously often maintaining their comedic air and recalling ideas from the early 20th century like mysticism hypnotism and old school circuses and amusement parks

the games core gameplay is pretty simple  you can move around angle the cursor to shoot at angles including downwards crouch and shoot do an aerial dash and parry pink objects which absorbs them bounces your character upwards and charges your super meter there are five stages to the super meter and you have both a basic super attack which deals some extra damage and goes through enemies and a more powerful one that consumes all five super meter stages and gives you a devastating super attack that can chew off about half of a boss stages hit points makes you invincible or boosts your attack power

in addition to the boss stages there are a relatively small number about 2 per world of levels that consist of running through a stage beating a series of enemies in a more standard sidescrolling type game these levels themselves can be fairly challenging though theyre generally breathers compared to the bosses and they help mix up the gameplay by incorporating more standard 2d platformer elements

there are also five or six shmup bosses in the game in the game where cuphead is in an airplane fighting against a flying boss these levels tend to be by far the hardest in the game you cannot customize the planes weapons which are a preset pair and the bosses themselves veer into bullet hell territory as projectiles often fill the screen save for a relatively narrow path while some of the 2d platformer levels occaisionally have a lot of projectiles it is the norm for many of the bosses and oftentimes these projectiles are a mixture of multiple kinds of projectile each with their own path which makes dodging them significantly more challenging  especially given that there are sometimes four different ways in which they can be combined in a single stage of a boss and which one comes up is the luck of the draw it is here that the game can feel the most unfair and the very last of these  a medusa mermaid  is likely the hardest boss in the game and her attack patterns can feel almost unavoidable at times

between the stages you walk around in a world map type thing where you can interact with a small number of npcs who will sometimes challenge you to do things and reward you with a coin or going to the shop where you can spend coins to buy new options for your characters some are new attack options  such as tracking shots that deal less damage or the ability to charge up shots like megaman at the cost of not being able to hold down the button to fire continuously  while others enhance your character in other ways such as making you invincible during a dash giving you an extra hit point at the cost of dealing less damage or automatically parrying when you jump

this game is fun but not in the same way that something like portal 2 is fun rather this is a game which is fun because of its challenge and because the aesthetic pairs nicely with the gameplay you are going to die if you play cuphead you are in fact going to die many hundreds of times before you get to the end and win your soul back from the devil gambling is bad kids if you dont like hard games  if you dont like failing many times while learning the bosses patterns so that you can finally succeed  you wont like this game as repeated deaths while learning the boss patterns is all but inevitable on all but the very easiest stages

if you like the idea of working hard to overcome a series of difficult mechanical challenges this game is likely right up your alley and while the game is hard it is ultimately fair in its difficulty the charm of the game helps to make the challenge feel less miserable and the fact that there is a constant goal hovering ahead of you pulling you forward makes it feel like you are in fact making progress no matter how many times you fail overcoming the bosses feels really good and after you beat them it is remarkable how much easier they are to beat again for a better score it is remarkable how much better you get at this game simply by playing it and while it is quite the gauntlet when youre done with it youll feel like youve earned your victory

cuphead seems to be perfect from every possible aspect the art the gameplay the price

words cant describe how much i love this game i feel that i got a lot more value for my money than i initially expected
its one of the best games ive ever played in my recent memory and is definitely the game of the year for me

i could never recommend this game enough its amazing  



#####

i played it solo and i enjoyed it
i played it coop with my 13 years old cousin and we enjoyed it
cant wait to play upcoming dlc

#####

cuphead is contra granted a contra with only two proper levels per world and a half dozen nasty bosses but its contra

the 30s40s cartoon aesthetic is on point without a hint of modern cynicism or fauxretro nonsense its a beautiful charming game in every sense

it is hard though because you have infinite retries and the level select goes straight to the boss or level the game takes the liberty to make the bosses tough elaborate affairs were talking ys levels of boss design after world 1 you should expect to be clocking anywhere from 1040 deaths just to get a handle on them theyre all tough imaginative and fun most of the deaths are pretty fair though there are some pattern combos that the bosses can do that ring a little bs to me but because death is such a small penalty its hard to get that mad

cuphead understands everything it is referencing on a fundamental level from the classic cartoons to the classic game design this game really is as good as it looks

#####

hey guys its actually exactly what we wanted in every way apparently that can happen

good on ya studiomdhr

ulike my reviews go follow my urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator33012112gandhitalksgamescurator pageurlu


hoo boy so lets take some time to talk about cuphead

ive been looking forward to this game since its reveal at e3 back in 2014 as time progressed i found myself losing interest in the game despite the obviously awesome visuals but nothing really stood out to me but it came out and people were calling it one of the best indie games ever made among other things and as someone who loves to support passionate indie developers like these guys i knew i had to give the game a shot and after 17 hours of sweating uncontrollably and shouting profanities every five seconds of playing i finally took down the final boss i had a hard time gathering my thoughts for this game and while i absolutely love most of it i cant help but feel like this game is a ilittlei overrated okay please dont lynch me yet

h1graphicsh1

do i really need to talk about the visuals its one of the main selling points of the game and of course its gorgeous the attention to detail is staggering and even in the smallest things for example as pointed out by the completionist some npcs in the overworld will turn their head in your direction regardless of where youre at you can really see that the artists ensured that every aspect of this game is topnotch visually one thing i love about the visuals in particular are the variety in the boss designs some like satan and wally warbles utilize very basic designs but are an incredibly versatile and allow for some really creative animation ideas for example the former can take his head and turn it into a serpent or a spider both of which are transitioned into seamlessly hell upon further thought id even be willing to argue that this is one of the bbest looking games of all timeb just because of how impressive the animation is but this is a review not a debate and i did say i felt this game was overrated for a reason thankfully that reason isnt the graphics

h1gameplayh1

but instead the gameplay i know i know how dare i criticize one of the socalled best indie games of all time that is definitely a justified reason to want to lynch me apparently so before you decide to shit all over me let me explain what the gameplay does irighti first of all the basic mechanics like dashing jumping moving and shooting are all extremely tight and incredibly polished this is very important for a game like this where precision is crucial to progressing through the game i also really enjoy the variety in the bosses from a gameplay standpoint as many have completely different attacks to learn testing you in every way some like the phantom express have a big emphasis on mastering parrying dr kahls robot is a big final test of your mastery of the plane segments beppi the clown is probably the games rite of passage as it tests your patience more than any other boss up to that point the mausoleum as well as the run and gun stages are a little lacking but are still a nice change of pace so where does it fall flat well that lies in the games difficulty hey i said to wait on the lynching now i love games that are difficult dark souls 3 and dark souls 1 to an extent is one of my alltime favorite games as well as super meat boy now why do i bring these games up im not trying to make myself seem like a pro gamer or whatever because im really not i havent even beaten super meat boy truth be told but these games while difficult are fair they give you a task that seems impossible at first and through repetition and patience youll quickly be able to progress forward and be rewarded for that cuphead unfortunately feels too unfair at many points throughout the game why because of the games overreliance on rng i dont care if its thematic or not this is a game thats trying to be based around skill not hearthstone some bosses like grim matchstick and rumor honeybottoms require you to jump from platform to platform and avoid falling to your death but the problem is these platforms are randomly generated that means you can and likely will die of circumstances way out of your control speedrunners tend to restart a fight if the boss theyre fighting starts with one of their harder to dodge attacks most notably with djimmi the great on top of this though some attacks from bosses have no telegraph for their hardest hitting attacks hilda berg and cagney carnation which means nohit runs can end due to attacks you had no time to react to this type of stuff happens a lot through out the game and it really did ruin part of the fun for me however thankfully not all bosses suffered from these issues and the main mechanics are so tight that in some cases you could easily respond to these bs moments overall these poor design choices and overuse of rng do hurt the game but not to the point that my experience was completely ruined i am giving this game a thumbsup after all right

h1storyh1

theres not much of a story to be honest its there but theres so little of it that i cant really evaluate this i will be omitting this from the scoring

h1audioh1

im a big fan of jazz music especially considering that i am a jazz trombonist i was right at home with this soundtrack everything just iworksi here some of the pieces do some really clever stuff like railroad wrath with the horns mimicking train horns and the drum set sounding like a train moving on traintracks as well as murine corps foreshadowing the final phase of the fight by having the saxophones mimic a spoilercat meowingspoiler also bonus points for having a real ensemble playing it just give it a listen for yourself because any fans of jazz will adore this games soundtrack i also quite love the games audio design as it adds to the authenticity of the 1930s vibe they were going for with the slight static in the background and the barelyaudible voice acting overall the sound is incredible in this game and i will be listening to the soundtrack for many years to come

h1replayabilityh1

cuphead is a pretty short game if you know what youre doing but theres enough depth in the gameplay to keep you coming back with an expert mode being unlocked upon completion of the regular game thanks to the questionable rng moments of the game im not quite sure if ill personally replay this game again but theres definitely some there for people who really want to master this game

h1verdicth1

overall cuphead is a very very good game its definitely not the best indie game ever made by any means  its not even my favorite of 2017 so while its not amazing its a total blast to play if you can power through the weird design choices with some of the bosses id definitely buy it at full price if masochisms your thing now if youll excuse me im going to therapy thanks to the trauma king dice gave me

after 2 hours of playing this game i want to die

#####

dont let the cartoon graphics fool you this is actually dark souls iv

#####

a masterpiece

pros
 simple to pick up difficult to master
 nostalgic art style inspired by cartoons of the 30s for those who are into cupheads art design there is an official art book named the art of cuphead which is absolutely gorgeous and a musthave
 great animation details however you wont be able to pay much attention to them since you will be too occupied by the bosses
 great variety of level design the bosses their patternsmoves etc just never feel repetitive
 jazz soundtrack 3 hours of original recordings wow also à la 30s which is really rare these days
 sweet visual and auditory bonuses for visuals you can spoilerunlock the 2stripe and the blackandwhite filterspoiler for sounds you can spoilerchoose between big bang or piano solo for the map background musicspoiler and you can also spoilerunlock a vintage filter which makes the music sound like coming from a gramophonespoiler
 upon beating the game expert mode unlocks reserved for those who think this game is not challenging enough
 if even expert mode is not hardcore enough for you there is a local coop mode for two players needs at least one controller you and your friend can fight hand in hand against bosses that have double health
 great plot spoilerhaving gambling issues you cuphead have lost all your money in a casino now you owe your soul to the devil and you have no choice but become his debt collector so you beat up every other deadbeat on the isle on a whim you also beat up the honest casino owner and even the devil himself thanks to you debts are forgiven and all deadbeats live happily ever afterspoiler

cons
not that i can think of however just a little caveat for casual players this game is hard like really hard as an average player i have died 500 times during my first playthrough which lasts around 15 hours however most levels last less than 2 minutes so you dont lose much dying just press on practise more and you will steadily progress through the game

verdict
absolutely recommend it is such a pleasure to look at the animation of this game and to listen to its jazz soundtrack you surely shouldnt be daunted by its difficulty and deprive yourself of this unique experience

edited
after nearly 30 hours and 1084 deaths i have completed cuphead on expert and got all the achievements if i can do it so do you

#####

a true masterpiece ive been waiting for the dlc for quite some time now and what a blast  the dlc has more quality content than most triple a games the art design is magnificent and the soundtrack is amazing buy this game

#####

h1 cuphead woow what a beautiful and cartoonish journey h1

as the game started i instantly fell in love with the artstyle and that beautiful looking cartoonish style when i was a kid i always watched those old disney cartoons from 1930s and so on and instantly felt a flashback into my childhood 

the warmth the good old cartoons with donald duck goofy and such it was entertaining and honestly this game describes exactly that

its tough really tough dark souls tough if you know what i mean but its worth it sometimes you get damage from something you cant see that fast because enemys are spawning everywhere

if youre bad at platformers and rage really fast this game is nothing for you but the most important thing is that this game is like the past you pay for something and get it 100 without season pass story missions behind a paywall or whatever good ol days

highly recommended

one of the greatest philosophers of modern time me once said a man that dies a thousand times is immortal i am that man today 

excellent game 1010 would die a thousand times again

#####

there is no support for colourblind players which unfortunately makes the game unplayable for me some enemy attacks need to be distinguished by colour alone which is impossible for me because of my redgreen colourblindness a colourblind mode would probably be not too difficult to implement for this game which makes it more disappointing that the devs havent addressed this issue

#####

this game holds a special place in my heart i consider cuphead to be one of the greatest games of all time and it deserves its spot in gaming history

i want to thank my friend mikedrop for gifting me this game for my birthday it was truly one of the best gifts i ever received

cuphead is a brilliantly developed game with no bugs or glitches found throughout the gameplay whatsoever
this game is definitely worth to buy if youre into this quirky 30sinspired animation style and if youre up for difficult challenges which i believe might be a little bit too hard for younger players to complete with a variety of different colourful levels and with a good and fun storyline this game is for you
there are two characters in cuphead so two players can play this game cuphead himself and his brother mugman the challenges you will have to complete along the way are always different and fun as you advance forward levels begin to get more challenging but thats the fun part beware cuphead can be addicting cuphead can keep you up playing for many more hours as you try your hardest to complete the levels but between levels you get to have a break as you can roam around the existing maps and talk to the different characters and buy useful items charms weapons from the shopkeeper porkrind that will help you in harder levels
but we must not disregard the beautiful art style the art style is unique and oldfashioned much reminding me of 30s animations from picture companies such as fleischer studios and the jazzy soundtrack in the background is just the cherry on top the founders made an excellent job keeping the game original and entertaining
although i couldnt finish the whole game i thought back of cuphead and remembered how good this game was in so many ways and felt like i had to review this and replay it with my friend this game definitely deserves a 5 stars and definitely deserves your attention if you havent tried it out yet

#####

better than fortnite

#####

as a man who died 2099 times in this game i highly recommend it

#####

one of the most frustrating yet laughable games i have ever played i never laughed so much at my friend raging and how difficult the bosses can be the artistry in this game is stunning and i love how unique every boss fight is and the items you can purchase in the shop for utility the game is so satisfying when you have accomplished a boss fight and is very addictive truthfully i would recommend playing this with a friend unless youre a psycho who loves games like these lol

#####

not for people who give up easily you will die a lot in this game but once youve finally beaten a boss after hours of trying it is really satisfying the bosses are definitely the highlight of the game

#####

mug man is very hot

#####

i love the game i think that it has minimum 60 hours of game play if you want to unlock all the achievements it took me 60 hours to unlock all of them and like 10 hours with dlc included very nice game

one of the best games i have ever played the devs really knew what they were doing every part of the game was an unforgettable experience challenging in the right ways beautiful audio gameplay effects animations

#####

spent 1 hour and 30 minutes trying to beat a boss 1010 games should be difficult

#####

average cuphead enjoyer

#####

i got to say that the devs put their heart into this game and it shows this game gives you that old cartoons vibe and i love it i knew this game was awesome but man it sure is something else when you play it yourself

epic combat epic visuals awesome music funny characters made in that 30 style

definitely worth buying

im asian and ive never opened my eyes so damn wide

cuphead is a game where you have to be constantly aware of your surroundings theres a lot going on onscreen and it tests your focusing abilities and also your reflexes on how quick you react or dodge danger without doubt this game is really difficult even on normal mode lets be honest here even normal is tough dont give me that you never tried hard mode then crap you get a really satisfying feeling from completing each boss though sometimes you might feel like its unfair that you lost most of the times you hate yourself for making a silly mistake every time you replay a boss and thats what makes me smash that replay button every time i did a silly mistake

this game 1010 with an amazing artwork im glad i managed to finish the game

#####

was fighting the final boss when my power went out which deleted my file so i had to beat the game all over again those boss fights became personal after that

#####

the ultimate rage simulator

h1cuphead a silly little game from an widely unknown developer its subgenre could be put into the bossrun segment but oh boy that is not all keep reading and i will try convey everything what is in my opinion making cuphead the best retrobossrunshootem up of 2017h1

first thing i heard about cuphead game reviewers saying omg rofllol new darksouls tutorial unbeatable and afterwards bought it because well who doesnt love a challenge

immediately after starting up the game 

the most beautiful music it really brings out the ambience in each and every stage of the game just beautiful

the graphics are really amazing that mustve been a lot of work bevery animation is handdrawnb such commitment must be praised

straight foreward oldschool 2d run and gun game even with a little collect coins to get weapons segment

for an old dog the first few hours of gameplay were a cakewalk but the difficulty rises with each boss having more and more actions that you need to learn adapt and overcome

the bosses range from simple vegetable to trains rollercoasters and dragons ugh the pain


ill keep it short if you want a little ragy game that puts your platforming skills to the test this game will definetly answer

great game had a lot of fun frustrating and raging moments with it which are now eternally embeded on my youtube channel

thank you for reading if you found this helpful please give this review a thumbs up that would really help me out

#####

my hands hurt not because ive been playing for so long but because of the hot mermaid lady

#####

like a child who grew up on disney cartoons i could not help but buy this game this style of animation is incredible the first 3 hours i ran and looked at everything every soundtrack is amazing created and recorded exclusively for this game below i gave the link where you watch the process of recording one of them
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv6h1vm9w2nm
yes this game is hard i often was angry but the aforementioned things allow you to forget it
if you love disney cartoons like me you should buy and try it i guarantee you will love it

#####

the game is hard but not as hard as i am when i see hand drawn animation that perfectly compliments the gameplay my only complaint is that its way too easy to accidentally summon djimmi and there is no way to decline and cancel the wish when you summon him

#####

bcupheadb is exceptional overall there is very little to criticize about the game and was simply a pleasure to beat mind you cuphead is not an easy game and is probably not suited for the casual gamer even though there is an easy difficulty setting on each level in addition to a learning curve cuphead expects the player to be familiar with 2d platformershooters and have decent reaction times since 2d platforming is one of my favorite game genres i had an absolute blast playing cuphead especially coop for those of you who arent new to gaming and are up for a challenge i cannot recommend cuphead enough

great example of simple game mechanics with a steep learning curve regardless of what others might say cuphead is actually very fair sure it might not be easy but nearly every attack is avoidable if you position yourself and react correctly i love that you have to understand your strengths and weaknesses and adapt to each situation
the music especially if youre a fan of older music is phenomenal not only does it compliment the visual style beautifully it also amplifies the thrill of fighting each respective boss 
the art and animations oh the animations i mean you can take a quick glimpse at the trailer and feel all the hours that has been put in to making cuphead look gorgeous i encourage you to take the time to just sit back and look at the game beautiful my favorite was the facial expressions of the clown boss when hes riding on a bumper car will he charge at me wont he hes constantly taunting me with that ridiculous smile but i love it
my favorite part of cuphead is the levelboss design although the game mechanics are straight forward every level has a unique theme to it like a vegetable garden a pirate ship or a candy castle each level is composed of unique enemies backgrounds music animations attack patterns and more this is great for three reasons
olist
 extremely aesthetically pleasing it feels like you are bombarded with new high quality visuals and audio every time you enter a level
 you are constantly met with new challenges no boss is like the other you are expected to die learn and adjust to be able to take down any boss
 each boss has several stagesforms you are expected to adapt and refocus as you whittle down the boss hp which to me is very exciting its like you get several adrenaline shots throughout the boss fight  its painfully addictive 
olist
all in all it never feels like you are repeating yourself cuphead is extremely refreshing and exciting from beginning to end
coop is great but what is less mentioned is how well balanced coop actually is you get to revive each other but both players hp are considered when receiving a stage score  it doesnt matter if one player plays perfectly the score will be based on the worst performance furthermore the more often you die the faster your spirit rises allowing for a shorter revive window its also very fair that bosses are more difficult and have more hp when you play coop the difficulty also seems to readjust when one of the players die to clarify if one of the players dies and cannot be revived the boss difficulty reverts to what it is for single player less hp fewer projectiles its simply brilliant as it keeps the game challenging but fair perhaps i am just imagining things but if cuphead was really designed in this way i must give props to studio mdhr they really know how to manage difficulty  
once unlocked you have a decent selection of charms weapons and supers available the equips you choose not only require you to change your playstyle but can make boss fights much easier or much harder experimenting with different combinations to see what worked in which situation was quite fun 
very pleased that cuphead allows key remapping

the total game length left me longing for more cuphead dont get me wrong completing the game left me with an immense feeling of satisfaction and fulfilment furthermore cuphead offers in my opinion plenty of replay value whether you want to improve your level scores play coop with friends or simply rechallenge yourself a few months later however cuphead is so great that i simply wished it was longer blooking forward to a sequel studio mdhrb

strikethe only attack that i found somewhat unfair was the medusa boss petrify gaze i could not figure out a way to avoid the attack in its entirety but instead just had to button mash when petrified and hope that nothing hit me i dont mind the petrification per se as it adds an unique element to the boss i just wish there was a way to avoid the attack  perhaps a perfectly timed perrystrikeiturns out the petrifying gaze is avoidable oopsiei

my favourite soup is chicken and mushroom

not only is cuphead a fantastic shoot em up game with excellently realized game design difficult but fair its also an unforgettable tribute to 1930s animation 1990s gaming and one of the best party games that wasnt even designed to be one 

one of the best games on steam mustbuy

#####

after finally beating this game all the way i could including all achievements i can without a doubt say it is one of the hardest and most rewarding games i have ever played if you are considering buying this you will not be dissapointed in what you get out of it just know that when you go through it you better be prepared for difficulty and one hell of a time

#####

harder than dark souls d

edit the delicious last course is finally out after 3 years since it was announced and i must say it was very well worth the wait it takes what was already in the base game and improves it to another level that its jaw dropping the visual music and the gameplay are simply amazing and the difficulty is brutal as before but fair if you love cuphead please do yourself a favor and play its dlc you will be amazed by how much work has been put into it its delicious10

#####

brilliant game i waited until recently to play this game because i knew i would be hooked the bosses are all unique and challenging in their own way i enjoy the simplicity of this game its a nonstop boss run ultimately this is something i would recommend to anyone who likes a challenge this game is generally heralded as one of the hardest games of the modern era and for good reason

cuphead himself feels responsive and every time i died i truly felt it was my fault and not the games this is doubly impressive when you consider the developers hand drew every frame of animation this game runs in 60 fps while the background animations run at the traditional 24 fps this game is truly a trip into the dawn of animation and i could not be more in love

#####

this game prove you are not pro player 

everything about this game is awesome and you cant find any bad thing except yourself  100100

h1cuphead delivers on its promise of a old school hard run n gun shooter with a presentation surprisingly not seen in many other gamesh1

i always had high hopes for cuphead since it was shown of in 2013 and 2014 konami wasnt making mainline contras anymore and metal slug was relegated to ports and crappy mobile spin offs i was surprised no other major indie title tried to capture the art style it imitated i anxiously waited for its released and waitedand waited eventually it came out in 2017 after i lost my good job and couldnt afford it fast forward to 20192020 when i can finally spend money casually on retail games and buy the #2 game on my wish list 

h1cuphead was pretty much exactly what i wanted it to beh1

bcuphead is a run n gun shooter that focuses on boss encounters with occasional platforming stages which is the inverse of most games in this genre the core gameplay is about learning boss attack patterns and when the best time to attack dodge or jumpb the boss animations perfectly imitate its inspirations and its always amusing to find out what they will throw out next how they transition to new phases and how they react when they are defeated it is some best of the industry level of presentation causing the birth of imitations and inspirations and of course copyright breaking mobile games

byou start off with the peashooterb which shoots continuous shots of average damage as long as the shoot button as held beventually you can hold up to two weapon types and buy different shot types from the shop on the world mapb such as a homing chaser shot a damaging boomerang shot a enemy seeking chaser shot a short ranged high damaged spread shot and a high damaging charge shot that makes short work of enemies and bosses if youre willing to wait 4 seconds per shot

bthe dash mechanic can get you out of tight spots help maintain a little bit of air and help with platformingb in side scrolling levels where cuphead transforms into a plane the same button is used to switch to minimode in which you move faster and shrink in size but sacrifice shooting range

bthe parry is essential to beating bosses fast and clearing some threatsb cuphead and mugman can parry bounce pink colored objects after jumping allowing a second jump and prevents you from being damaged from the pink object pink objects are usually projectiles from enemies but can also be enemies switches platforms or random butterflies you can probably beat the game without parrying but its not recommended

h1causing damage and parrying builds up your super meterh1

super used for up to five enhanced attacks of your weapon and fully charge bar can activate a super art like a marvel vs capcom style shinkuhadouken of milk temporarily invincibility or a giant cuphead ghosts that attacks enemies for you once you find them at the mausoleums

bthe shop also sells charmsb such as extra health a smoke bomb for invincibility during dashing very helpful an axe parry that damages when you parry bounce and a parry sugar that activates parry upon jumping instead of activation also very helpful purchases are made with coins picked up from run n gun levels much like yoshi coins in super mario world

h1from here the game is a test a skill and memoryh1

bcertain weapons and charms will definitely make some situations easier but cuphead is purely a game of skill and level knowledgeb that can be annoying since its pretty rare to complete a boss fight or level in the first attempt the need to practically study boss patterns and level design will turn off many players who didnt game in the 8bit16bitarcade era of very difficult games

bi cant say cuphead is unfair  mistakes are generally your fault for not being in the right place at the right time but i will also say that the timing of things can be a bit unpredictable at times and i wouldnt be surprised some gamers will hate this game because of itb

h1many times i barely missed a parry or jump timing causing me to take unnecessary damage or deathh1

im not sure if it is input delay frame delay or just too short of a active frame window on parries but there were many times i was angry i missed a parry when i knew when and where i had to parry an object worse off parrying makes you automatically jump and depending on how the boss decided to randomly make one object of a wave of projectiles parryable you may accidentally jump into another hazard or miss a jump or charge for your super art when you need it most the parry sugar charm helps with that sometimes but that also means that jumping to dodge hazards wont allow you parry something when landing so it isnt great for all levels  bit would be nice if you could manually prevent the instant activation of the parry sugar jumpb

h1worse off the bosses have an rng factorh1

bosses generally have about 35 attack patterns but its almost completely random which one they choose so you cant quite learn the pattern as you would in other shooters like this as i said before the boss may send out a volley of objects with one or two that can be parried but which the one that is parryable is somewhat random  leading to scenarios where you cant quite save yourself when you really need to or minmax your damage output its slightly annoying that the game rates you on your skill at the end of each boss but also has such rng that can ruin your run even if you know the bosses patterns bthe perfect execution cuphead requires is a jarring juxtaposition to the cute and familiar art style that made this game so popularb

bas a person with experience in this genre its strange that this game is easy when using high damage weapons but its also monsterously hard requiring multiple restarts  at least it is easy to restart a boss battle quicklyb

h1cuphead is a mustplay for people like myself that cut their teeth on hard games of the 80s and 90s while growing up watching reuns of classic 1930s1950s cartoons i had some irritations with some of its mechanics but if youre willing to repeat and improve yourself until you win you will have a great time h1

nobody will read my review so i will just say i am gay

#####

process of playing cuphead

1 boot up game
2 listen to amazing soundtrack
3 get mindblown by the animation
4 actually try the first boss
5 die
6 die again
7 die one more
8 repeat step 57 until
9 rage quit curse word screaming optional

10 remember how fluid and tight the gameplay was
11 boot up game again
12 go back to step 4

note after 200 failures or maybe 2000 failures youll have the peace

#####

cuphead is a very decent game that requires patience assertiveness and of course reaction despite the fact that this was my first game in this genre i felt comfortable in it all bosses are unique some of them were challenging but the pleasure and emotions after the victory are worth it
b can you play it with a keyboard yes b i dont have a gamepad so i play all the games with my keyboard it took me 33 hours to get all the achievements and complete cuphead twice normal and expert mode
i also want to note that everything in this game was drawn by hand and the music was recorded and performed by a real orchestra which already deserves your attention
you should try cuphead even if you are new to this genre once you understand how everything works here you wont be able to stop 

#####

short sweet brutaly hard nutcracker but beneath the shell lies one of the most artistic vision you can possibly see in this media this game is a charm from start to finish

#####

right out of the gate the game is hard but you already know that what you may not know is after a while you start to see the patterns and get faster with your combosmovements i decided to go for a 100 or should i say 200 the thing is on my second run on expert i felt the bosses a lot easier except that damn robot but after 20 attempts i managed to kill him by staying on the left on its third phase a little tip for ya it was a more relaxed run because i had already gone through all of them and i knew exactly how they attack and was able to see the changes in their expert counterparts 

but your first run is going to be hard im not going to sugar coat it so believe me when i say that it requires commitment concentration and will remember to never rage and if you feel you are losing very often just leave the game for a few hours and get back to it cool headed

the game is beautiful the style and the music are awesome and it certainly gives the 30s vibe it was based on so buy it and try it i know you will beat it and youll feel proud of yourself

h1look we can skip all the fighting if you would just give me the contracth1

if you ever needed a reason not to gamble come here and go through the story of cuphead and mugman against the wishes of their caretaker the boys decide to visit the devils casino and manage to get a winning streak however they caught the devils attention and the bet is raised if they win the casino is theirs but if they lose the devil will own their soul to their dismay they lose but the devil decides to strike them a deal the boys couldnt refuse the devil will let them keep their souls if they collect all the soul contracts of other debtors with three worlds to go through cuphead and mugman if in coop has a lot of work to do

there are two different types of stages run and gun and bosses each world has two run and gun stages which has you running through a sidescrolling stage occasionally gunning your way through or perhaps dodging to be a pacifist these stages may not be bosses but they do have their fair share of difficulty while completing run and gun stages optional only needing to get the contracts to proceed its your main source of coins other than finding them hidden in the worlds these coins will allow you to buy the various upgrades that would ultimately help you on your journey and with all the bosses varying in their approach both between each other and in their own phases just having the basic weapon will just make it harder

the upgrades while helpful each have their advantages and disadvantages for weapons this means how far it goes how much damage and their path that it takes if a boss has a phase that takes part on the bottom of the screen with platforms above you might want to bring in the lobber which has the downwards path but is slow firing have difficulty aiming while dodging equip the chaser which homes onto the boss at the cost of lower damage and possibly other enemies confusing it you can also buy charms or passive abilities that gives cuphead an advantage such as a small invincibility window when dashing or one autoparry per jump

the vast majority of cuphead is the bosses who are mostly the debtors all the bosses are unique and have at least three phases all of which switches up the bosss attack or adds more onto it mixing and matching your loadout is best as some weapons may or may not work well with some bosses and you can switch out your charm or super art to accommodate your weaknesses however this will not exactly make the boss easier each boss has their own patterns that are choreographed and apart from the first couple tries to learn the boss getting hurt is your own fault with cupheads controls being responsive most damage you will take will not be because the game decided to not respond to your button presses there are some randomized parts but you can clearly can still tell what is coming react accordingly and you are destined to win

you dont just dodge attacks there are some that you can parry that is shown by the pink coloring each parry with some exceptions charges a full card on your super meter were it would usually be slowly filled by landing hits charging the cards lets you do ex attacks or super arts the ex attacks costing one card is different depending on what weapon is equipped and deals more damage than the usual attack super arts however is granted by completing mausoleums cost a full super meter and can either deal a ton of damage or grant temporary invincibility if you get into a rough spot just make sure you equip what you need getting parries and using your super meter will raise your grade on the stage card as getting under a certain time and not being hit as much will not cut it

it is no secret that the visuals are absolutely amazing they totally captured the look of 1930s cartoons and you can tell how much they put into every background and character you can clearly tell where you are discern what is background and what is projectiles and see upcoming threats if they appear in the background first the jazzy soundtrack is great and ties in with their corresponding bosses easily while also not being annoying after multiple replays despite how many times i retried a boss i never got tired of the music nor art just my inability to not get hit despite knowing the attacks just admit defeat i was right on top of the end flag when i failed

there are a few things that i wished was put innot a problem i found that sometimes parrying is inconsistent and wont register when i press the button to parry even worse when i have the charm to autoparry when jumping i would take damage while also getting the super meter charged the rng can easily go against you in the few bosses it is a problem in just as an attack forcing you to one side at the same time a background attack is coming forward or not getting enough parries the foreground can also hide projectiles that can just blindside you lastly i do wish there was a way to switch between cuphead and mugman especially when the story focuses on both of them give poor cuphead a break and let mugman get tagged in

bverdictb
i honestly liked cuphead more than i thought i would getting it on a whim i just wanted to check it out and suddenly i went on a journey of constantly dying winning then dying all over again i did take breaks when i got into a rough spot but i had fun and felt a sense of accomplishment when each boss was defeated i even went as far as completing it again in expert mode which just makes the projectiles faster and changes some patterns cuphead certainly is a hard game and if youre up for the challenge consider picking it up

#####

this game obviously has a huge appeal we all know the style music graphics and so on are amazing however even though i loved the game at first sight i didnt buy it i heard the game was extremely difficult to put it into perspective i am trash at these types of games i was afraid i would get it and then just rage anyways the style got to me and i still bought it i mean cmon it looks awesome

so i played it and died and died again but i kept playing playing and playing sure the game is frustrating to many people but it just adds to the experience furthermore by restarting the levels over and over gain you get to appreciate the game even more 

overall i reccomend this game ignore those people who say its too difficult you dont have to be good to enjoy it 



#####

the perfect game for masochists

#####

the cuphead experience
 die 
 realise you were so close to beating said boss so you try again
 die

funny cup game

#####

god its a gorgeous game theres something about hand drawn animation that is so organicthey didnt use computers for the animation of this gamethey handdrew it to capture the old feel more
truly an amazing piece of artwork right there

#####

its fun

#####

having just beat this game with a friend in coop i can safely say that none of the hype which tends to swirl around innovative titles such as these is in any way unwarranted this is a masterpiece and a labor of love the likes of which are seen only rarely in gaming history along the way you will inevitably find yourself angered at the games unrelenting difficulty but various things such as a progress bar displayed immediately after death an incredibly quick and easily navigable menu and a truly beautiful artstyle go a long way in assuaging your ire then when you finally triumph the sense of accomplishment sticks with you and makes the whole experience worth it

dont let the cartoon graphics fool you this is actually dark souls iv

#####

i am not really good at this type of game but this one had the artstyle and music to make me still want to try it i took much longer than better players to beat the normal game but i eventually did it 
it really follows the tough but fair aspect that i grew to love when a boss gave me a hard time or i couldnt get past one of their phases i would highly recommend grabbing it if you enjoy the lovely artstyle or catchy ost as the gameplay growns on you and while it punishes you when you make a mistake it also rewards you with one of the better games this year

ill be tackling expert mode eventually and maybe update this review if i ever beat it

#####

good game i am not that good so it took me about 50 hours i raged a lot

#####

this production is a real masterpiece think that each frame was drawn by hand incredible

#####

thank you thank you thank you thank you for putting handdrawn animation back in the spotlight where it belongs disney could learn a thing or two from you guys

#####

good game 1110 but the difficulty is a dark soul level

#####

cuphead is a video game

#####

hand drawn graphics has always been my favourite style of visual
gameplay is simple and solid easy to pick yet hard to master
should be play with a controller

#####

a good day for a swell battle

cuphead is a nearperfect game but caution its clearly not for everyone at the time of writing only 162 of players had completed the game without dlc given that the game can be completed in almost 10 hours its the difficulty of the game that will prevent you from finishing it

what i liked about it
 an insane ost and art direction thats quite rare in video games its so refreshing
 calibrated gameplay plenty of content
 perfect lifespan for this kind of game and if you want more the s ranks are there
 the feeling of triumph when youve beaten a boss youve stuck on

negative points but quickly forgettable
 some scenes are visually overloaded which can make the action unreadable but with practice its fine
 the rng on certain patterns seems strange from time to time damn cloud on the dragon
 the game crashed only once in 14 hours

in short are you the niche gamer that cuphead is targeting put your ego aside because if you dont its 20 in the trash if you are this is a delight 

knockout

long version
ucupheadu is a 2d sidescroller that mainly focuses on intense boss battles and was developed and published by studio mdhr you play as the titular character  cuphead  or his pal mugman after getting too confident while playing poker and losing these two must collect the souls of some characters and deliver them to the devil
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1156588917
the story is very straight forward but it works this game is pretty much a boss rush so a story based on the simplicity of 30s cartoons was super pleasant

gameplay is cupheads most important quality it is amazing  fluid and challenging
you play it like many other 2d sidescrollers moving left and right and occasionally up and down platforms while shooting enemies and dodging their projectiles
the controls are super intuitive and responsive a very much needed inclusion when you are dealing with enemies that can fill the screen with bullets

all bosses have patterns and phases so you need to memorize what happens after certain animations to successfully avoid damage as you are very easily killed emerge victorious and get better scores
a new player might struggle at first with a certain boss but you progressively get better and eventually triumph you die fast but you reload faster so frustration never really sets in you might find yourself thinking a certain boss or move is unfair  maybe you need to swap weapons maybe it has to do with timing  there is always a solution for every obstacle out of all the moves and bosses i can only think of one that felt cheap and mildly annoying

weapon variety is great  you get a versatile arsenal of destruction a boss spams projectiles from across the screen but stands still maybe a slowfiring highdamaging weapon will work another one sends weak minions against you while covering the floor with lava you can go for a weapon that homes in on the weakling while you focus on dodging you can always take two weapons and easily switch between them  while you can stick with the first two you get in the first chapter it will not be viable to always use the same weapons experimentation is needed and rewarded
while weapons are all useful some of the upgrades you get are not that viable if you decide to equip the upgrade that gives you an extra heart you will find yourself dealing less damage there is another one that slowly gives you super meter but it is unreliable at best the smoke bomb upgrade that makes you immune to damage while dodging is the best one handsdown
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1161782082
there are also run n gun stages these are basically platforming levels filled with enemies and coins you can collect to buy new gear  there is a fun extra ingame challenge to complete these levels without shooting a single bullet

some boss levels have you pilot a plane and those segments are the ones that are truly bullet helly i still enjoyed them very much but i found them the least interesting out of all other types of battle

after every level you can walk around the map looking for secrets this was a delight example you have to help a barbershop quartet find its missing member and you are rewarded with a wonderful song that encourages you to take a break there are even secrets during boss battles

ucupheadu is a visual masterpiece  everything exudes quality the backgrounds are gorgeous the character designs are splendid and everything is so colorful you cannot help but feel like a young kid again as i mentioned before bosses have phases  you might see the boss evolve into something even more bizarre or fight a completely new character i cannot say enough good things about great this game looks  it feels like a classic 30s cartoon and it is filled with personality and heart

the soundtrack is super catchy i listen to it regularly which is something i usually do not do for most games it always matches the setting you are in it is frantic and loud perfect for battle the sound effects are also great
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1157555706
a friend got me this game for my birthday shortly after it came out and it was a wonderful gift  i could not be more grateful i recently came back to it and decided to 100 all achievements which got me around 30 hours of total gameplay it currently costs 20 and i feel like the price is justified its quality is undeniable it can be quite brutal so i am not sure if it is suitable for a more casual audience but if you enjoy a challenge and enjoy its whole aesthetic i confidently recommend this amazing experience

final score 95 out of 10

before i start this review i just want to say the overreaction to the comparison to dark souls  difficulty towards cuphead isnt fair at all in my opinion the best way to describe this game is that its a 19201930s cartoon version of metal slug contra  mega man

the laughs were great though at all the fails this game has delivered from streamers  etc with no selfawareness for their surroundings at all even if i dont understand how cuphead can make someone break their keyboard or controller at all its really fun to play with a friend  is more of a chill game for me when the game makes it clear that every death is the players fault httpswwwyoutubecomresultssearch_querycupheadragecompilation

the only way i would understand anyone raging at this game is if your playing pacifist on a run n gun level or expert mode

the tutorial debacle was honestly the cringiest thing i ever watched though  for anyone that hasnt seen it prepare to lose some brain cells httpswwwyoutubecomresultssearch_querycupheadtutorialfail

now to start with this review the only con i can give the game is the default keyboard controls theyre really bad  my personal preferred control scheme for this game if i do play on keyboard is

awsd  move cuphead

space  jump

up arrow key  fire gun

left arrow key  dash

right arrow key  lock

down arrow key  ex move

e  change weapon

the game plays well with a controller too so it doesnt matter what you pick

if you delve into expert mode i would recommend the spread  charge gun combination

you might have to change the gun combo up a bit for hard to hit bosses like the dragon for example which i would recommend the lobber  spread but overall i think the spread  charge combo does the job of finishing boss battles as quickly as possible  

for the rest of the review all i can say is that this is the most original game i have ever played

im extremely impressed that the 2 brothers that are responsible for every animation in this game used the actual old methodstechniques that warner bros fleischer studios disney  etc used to make cuphead so unique  i would watch a cuphead cartoon series if it was possible at all httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcxpvf9z2gg8

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrxjow5o0h8o

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvm2orkirhubg

i dont have any words on how amazing the jazz maybe blues too soundtrack for this game is  the behind the scenes for some of the tracks is extremely impressive httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnxb2k9l6s6e

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvv6h1vm9w2nm

no dlc at all which is how games used to be so a for none of that crap in cuphead  an extremely fair price for 15 hours of gameplay

2 player local coop for this game was the most fun i ever had in a long time since i barely play any multiplayer games anymore because in my opinion online multiplayer was a nice thing for a while but then it got boring when game studios got less creative  i wouldnt be shocked if cuphead does get an online coop feature in the future

every boss battle on this game was fun for me to play against king dice is my fav boss  the phantom express was my least fav on regular mode  im still playing through expert mode so i might update this review  i hope to god the two brothers behind this game dont dumb the game down in anyway because this game to me can motivate anyone to improve their skills in platformers

the story to the game is pretty straightforward about cuphead  his brother mugman owing the devil money at the casino so i wont talk much about it

overall if you havent played this game yet i would strongly just buy it full price because its one of the few games in my opinion that deserves it  studio mdhr dont let greedy corporations like microsoft or ea for example buy you out

ps as irrelevant ign is heres the 2 brothers fighting the bosses httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5dantxipdey

2 vids i found showcasing what old cartoons inspired cupheads characters httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkyj425wvwns

for something really cool i found a vid of someone playing cuphead on an old black  white crt tv httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrpcyw9dtauw

edit after doing further research i just noticed that the 2 brothers might be street fighter enthusiasts if you compare ryu  ken with the frogs  balrog bull sagat tiger  vega snake with the slot machine symbols off the final phase of the clip joint calamity level httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlqshvkxqevw

the rat pack infamous jazz music group from the 1900s featuring frank sinatra dean martin  other famous jazz singers is a huge influence for the very 1st boss battle in cuphead httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmps2dyypfgw

one of the studio mdhr animators explains the creation process of cala maria httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrmgbju3uvq

theres a ton of videogame references in cuphead but im not going to name them all because that would take forever

edit 2 after playing for a while on expert mode my least fav bosses have been cala maria the devil  wally warbles

if you value your sanity i would advise doing both wally warble  cala maria both of these bosses are pushovers in regular mode 1st if youre going for the expert mode achievements because they both have terrible patterns to memorize  most of the time the rng will screw you over

sally stageplay captain brineybeard i struggled with him on regular mode but i had fun learning his pattern  king dice are my fav bosses to go through on expert mode

edit 3 studio mdhrs future is looking very good  im happy that theyre going to continue using the old 1920s1930s animation style in their future games httpnichegamercom20171115cupheaddevelopersarestickingwithhanddrawn2danimationfortheirnextgame

cuphead is a aesthetic platformer that focuses on bosses while there is a few platforming stages the bosses are the meat of the game and what people remember from it

the game is visually amazing the setting and environments all are based on the golden age of animation from the 1930s while nothing is a direct rip off of any existing real character they are so well done they could totally pass for real characters from that time it pretty much never leaves this style either no power or effect used contrasts this style so it flows seamlessly its absolutely gorgeous

as far as the controls to the game go it all feels fairly responsive and it all works you have a decently wide range of shot types and powers so you can go at a boss with a different style if one is not working and there are multiple charms to make use of that also can completely change how you go at bosses be it aggressively or defensively you do need to make use of these styles as well because one style wont work on some bosses at least to the most effective level lastly the game uses what it calls a parry system which more accurately is a guard absorb any shots or attacks that are pink can be parried to destroy the object and gain special meter learning and mastering this is required in this game

the game boasts 19 bosses each with their own styles of attack and themes all the bosses attacks lend to their designs some of their specials you see if playing on regular or expert get a little weird a queen bee turning into a buzzbomber get it but it still is enjoyable to fight all of it some bosses you have to fight in a 2d shooter mode as an airplane which were my least favorite parts of the game simply because there wasnt any variation to how you can configure your character going in so they are only fought one way still i say least but they were still enjoyable just the weakest part of the fun

cuphead is a game that has a reputation people compare it to being the souls of platforming i more compare it to being the mirrors edge of platforming the patterns are simplistic enough that anyone can eventually beat the game but youll always lament that stupid hit you took so much like mirrors edge it makes you compelled to have the perfect run with flow unbroken that might be the biggest secret to the game design the patterns seem extremely overwhelming at first but then you slowly realize just how simple they are much like the animation of the time

overall the game is very fun and i reccommend it but even when i say the patterns are simplistic there is some skill demand in this game and i dont recommend it if you struggle at platformers on the whole overall though you cant really go wrong with this game its a fun ride and with simplistic mode to learn the patterns and the heart upgrades anyone can at least beat the game

#####

in my humble opinion one of the best games that has and ever will be created

#####

you know a game is hard when you finish every god damn mission with c grade and you are still proud and happy
this game is pure evil 

#####

tom n jerry vibes 1010

#####

its tough but when you beat a boss or one of the run n guns its very satisfying

#####

the videos made this game look easy
how wrong was i

#####

good 
 vintage styled artwork looks amazing 
 gameplay is smooth and very responsive
 bosses are intriguing  nonrepetitive
 good variety of weapons
 neat unlockables
 parrying system

neutral 
 the abilities are what youd expect with one of them being vastly superior to the rest
 the soundtrack fits the games theme and is great at adding intensity to levels but nothing memorable
 20 price tag if youre not into that contra  mega man style of game not sure if youd find it worth otherwise definitely a great price for the 12 hours it took me to beat it

bad  
 when an object spawns on your cup guaranteeing damage

great game id give it a solid 810

open your cutlery drawers rebel against the reign of forks spoons muffins and dice against the noble cup this is cuphead and finally the cup is fighting back 

h1well cuphead and his pal mugman they like to roll the diceh1
i every time every single fucking time you start the gamei

i sranked every stage in cuphead i dont particularly recommend doing this since srank obviously just stands for stank but if you dont mind being stinky then it does push the game to its limits

most of the time it holds up sometimes it breaks 

cuphead for the 05 people left that havent seen or heard about it is a run and gun shooter where you take on 19 bosses and 6 platform stages for a wholesome neat total of 25 levels most stages only take 2 minutes to complete and with the games punishing nature that means it took me about 5 hours to complete the game on regular and 35 hours to push it to its absolute limits 

maybe im just terrible i did srank the game after all and stinkiness is inherent to being bad you might srank it in 20 minutes if you do dont tell me itd break my heart

presentation wise what youre seeing on the storefront is there from beginning to end and then some the art is intricate animated with incredible skill and theres not a single aspect i can point to as lazy gameplay got the full attention with cutscenes just being static images its hilarious

h1by chance they came upon devils game and gosh they paid the priceh1
i buried in my skull in my soul in my hearti

ost holds up alongside the art with jaunty and varied tunes that make the soundtrack worth picking up alongside the game itself its committed to aesthetic and puts a melodic ring on that finger

this is a unity game made by an artfocused studio its mostly indie its heaped coveted praise by the gameplayfocused crowd which as far as miracles go is up there with witnessing the birth of baby jesus

praise that it has earned mechanically first and foremost this is a polished and fun game with an emphasis on variation no boss is really like the other and the 90120 second time on them means that theyre shifting through their phases and attacks quickly 

as a premium cup of the premium cup drawer you bring in your own loadout of 2 out of 6 weapons a super and 1 of 2 charms there is technically 6 charms but 4 are worthless stick to coffee and smoke bombs also applicable to everyday life 

iprotip the chaser might seem like a crutch for players but its actually terrible in every situation and not worth using so youre making things harder for yourself thats pro you should be writing this tipi

instead of just a menu selection you even get an overworld its just a level select with extra literal steps but its appreciated helps tie things together maybe pick up some extra coins

there is a story the story is no

h1paid the priiiiiiiiceh1
i look if you think the review is bad just blame the song it was the harvey weinstein of my dreamsi

theres a few caveats the whole big chunky sprites with big chunky hitboxes doesnt give you nearly as many ways to play nimbly or stylishly as say a regular stg the stg sections themselves are pretty slow and sluggish compared to regular gameplay and there are just way too many random elements 

the spread on the genies clutter attack the platforms in honey bees level the spawn on the bomb on hilda berg werner deciding whether or not youre getting parryable objects or just bombs on half the levels there is at least one major element generated within a random range that means you can get a relatively easy ride to an s rank or just get clipped

which is as good as a d rank if youre gunning for the stink

ipro tip you dont even get anything for sranking the whole game not so much as a line of dialogue if youre gunning for achievements then you can just get the s rank on king dice not very hard just nail down the dice rolls and call it a dayi

thats about all there is to cuphead it is a simplistic but responsive noveltydriven and ultimately fun arcade game i recommend it to anyone looking for either a quick getaway or someone looking for something to sink their teeth into for a spell to get decent at

#####

yes

after 118 hours and 916 deaths i beat the game 1010 would recommend


aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

#####

this game is awesome ive beaten the game with expert s rank and all achievements and let me say ive enjoyed nearly every moment yes the game is challenging but when you get that knockout it is so satisfying its a 1010 game and i would recommend it

#####

im not into difficult games which navigate you through anger rage and frustration requiring you to memorize patterns perform pixelperfect jumps and repeat large portions of the game over and over now im so happy to say that cuphead is not this kind of game

before playing i already knew that cuphead is difficult but i felt attracted to its unique visual style and music now after finishing whole game on expert difficulty but with no intent to srank every boss however i can say it was totally worth it  true the games is challenging but it feels quite fair   you try you die you learn and you are sure that next time youll succeed and then obviously you die again then you start to understand whats going on and how to tackle it for me it was after 3060 mins regardless of difficulty level maybe a little longer on two bosses and you finally win and move on to the next boss

in short  cuphead is certainly worth trying for its unique visuals great music and overall concept its difficult but fair and satisfying

#####

graphics unique and pretty good looking
atmosphere nailed it
gameplay great but sometimes it feels like theres too damn many things happening on your screen
difficulty if darksouls had an easy mode
length for a seasoned player this will last you about 810 hours

synopsis

cuphead is a homage to the golden era of cartoons and was obviously made by true artists with a profound love and passion for the style and era hidden beneath that homage  is a deeper layer  that of a tribute to good old fashioned platform gaming where finishing a game took serious effort and training with no guarantee of success whatsoever unlike most games today

after being advised by elder kettle not to set foot in the devils casino  cuphead and mugman find themselves in a pickle they were tempted to bet it all win all the casinos money  or lose their souls after cuphead throws snake eyes and loses the bet the duo beg the devil for mercy  which they get in the form of a deal collect the contracts of runaway debtors   so they can get their own back so the adventure begins


 review 

gameplay

although a present era game  cuphead is a vintage 2d platformer with modern mechanics in mind jump shoot shoot special dash and parry the latter of which means cancelling out whatever is coming your way as long as its the right colour thats all there is to it  and no more is necessary  because this game really is 1980sstyle difficult and then some

in typical platformer fashion  the player starts out with a map view of all the places to go and bosses to defeat  as with the exception of a few levels to collect an upgrade or two  its pretty much all bossfightsallthetime 

levels are mainly classic 2d side scrolling  with a few variations such as flying a plane

that is not to say the levels arent unique though because every level is more unique than ever before seen in a platformer  virtually no repeating of style at all each level is lovingly crafted to reflect the personality and style of the boss that owns it 

youll find yourself having to adapt your playing style all the time and learn to dig deeper and deeper to muster up the patience to give it another go but i say that in a good way  there are no cheap shots in this game  its just really really hard


visuals

its as though this game was drawn by the original warner brothers disney and hannahbarbera tom  jerry not later works themselves  all rolled into one the whole game is a work of art with deep respect for classic cartoons


soundtrack

the soundtrack  both music and sound effects got just as much love and attention as the visuals in this game the whole thing is a roaring 20s gold mine of original tracks that really contribute to both overall feel and authenticity as well as adding to the games adrenal overflow its fantastic as a jazz musician myself i purchased the soundtrack just to jam along with it  because its excellent


story

not much to add without spoiling anything its a simple story  though effective enough to build a big game around that much the creators have proven a game like this isnt really about the story  no more than people liked mario or sonic for their profound storytelling  thats not what its about its a rollercoaster ride of fun filled levels visuals and tunes  no more and certainly no less


performance

very low system requirements a cherry trail generation intel atom with intel hd 400 graphics will play it fine at 720p while anything with an intel hd 515 or higher will play beautifully on 1080p any discrete graphics card with 1gb vram and a clock rate of 600 mhz should do nicely


bugs glitches

none that i experienced


price

worth every penny  even the soundtrack dlc is worth it  but then im a little biased on that one


 

conclusion

this is a true work of art that radiates with the love and respect of its creators for the golden age of both cartoons and gaming  despite being many decades apart it will require a lot of practice patience and endurance  but then thats what games were mostly like back in the day the original marios sonics megamans  all quite difficult especially megaman its tempting to say the game is too hard thats why i listed it under the bad ish but really were all spoiled with having so many games to choose from that we dont have the patience to really make an effort any more not like back in the day where a person might only have a handful of games at first and spend weeks months maybe even years before completing it

the game is a blast  i highly recommend it 

overall rating 95 out of 100

this was actually the first game i purchased on my steam account and it took me a couple of months to complete and achieve 100 completion its a real challenge but once you grasp the mechanics master attack patterns and find a loadout that suits your playstyle defeating even the toughest bosses becomes much more manageable the learning curve is steep but immensely rewarding with each victory theres a sense of accomplishment that keeps you coming back for more this game truly tests your skills and perseverance making it a memorable experience from start to finish

#####

i lost my sanity completely playing this but its nice

i played cuphead when it launched on xbox but it was so fun to replay on pc again amazing game with great bosses fantastic music and beautiful art style i would definitely recommend it if youre looking for a challenge

#####

brilliant to look at and listen to relentless and attentiongrabbing in every single aspect of it cuphead is a love letter addressed to old school side scroller shooters in the vein of contra or metal slug which chooses to focus on tough as nails but rarely unfair boss fights instead of cannon fodder enemies questionable design choice perhaps is it still a joy to play regardless of it damn straight it is

 gaming journalist memes galore
 solid and tight controls platforming roguelike style
 engine runs on the souls of rage quitters
 reminds you of weird cartoons youd watch way back then while homestuck due to a cold
 developer is a fit man literally named chad
 fun time for anyone used to contra  megaman  jumpandshootman
 game is mostly bosses but there are regular stages as well
 a bunch of different abilities to buy and equip
 official ingame support for pacifist runs
 probably fits your hardcore masochist fetish too
 story plot is as simple as you gambled too much now youre screwed
 runs decently even on my deadbeat dell laptop with 4gb of ram and 256mb integrated vga but remember to update your drivers  windows you cheap boy

cuphead made me feel more good and more bad than any other game ive played in the last several years i swore laughed and hollered with delight i hated it and my own fingers for long stretches but having finished i realise thats more or less the point  i emerged from all that pain smiling rather than simply offering the player what they want cuphead makes them earn that right  the rewards if you can hack the tests are absolutely worth it 

cuphead is incredible for more than just its looks but before you dive in make sure you actually want a game that plays like this and not just a game that looks like this

#####



#####

first game that made me think about jumping off a building

#####

and his pal mugman

#####

pretty fun if you manage to beat the tutorial

#####

i sold my left kidney for this game completely worth it though

#####

played for 23 hours only thing i felt was pain and suffering
thats just what i wanted

#####

just the art and music alone is worth 20 bucks then it comes with a great challenging and fun game ontop of that

best game of 2017 so far

#####

my kids like watching me play and watching the show on netflix

#####

life is suffering life is pain life is joy life is learning the hard way from your mistakes 

cuphead is also all of these things
9510 

still havent beaten it and who knows if i ever will but goddayumn is it good

#####

before buying this game consider that it may cost way more than steam stores price for me it cost about 560 spoilernew monitor  controllerspoiler
the real challenge in this game is finish it without breaking ur controller specially the last part of the game
but it definitely worth it

#####

this game is so detailed and beautiful and the amount of effort and time it took to create it is spectacular
i love it so much

#####

attention to detail

great musicsounds

1930s inspiration done right 


lady maria is satisfied well i guess ill be sitting in my clocktower again to relax a bit after a brutal rage moment in this game 3 

not a fan of hard games you may want to skip this one but still even your not a fan or play it casually you will always appreciate this work of art the learning curve is hard but when you accomplished it feels satisfying


1010

did you 100 get all the achievements

me yes

at what cost

me 103 hours 

is it worth it

me oh hell no  

#####

i got killed by some vegetables

cuphead is one tough nut to crack no doubt about it this games got me duking it out with some serious challenges but boy its one hell of a ride the vintage cartoon vibes and those snazzy tunes theyve got this magic touch that keeps me grinning even when im getting schooled left and right ive danced with defeat more times than i can count yet its like a neverending carnival of fun no matter how many times ive bitten the dust the charm of cuphead still has me hooked its nothing short of swell

but let me tip my admiration to those hardworking devs who went through the wringer to birth this masterpiece i cant help but salute their sheer grit and gumption cupheads visual pizzazz and toughasnails gameplay are a testament to the devs dedication and artistic chops earning them a truckload of respect from me the blood sweat and tears poured into this indie gem by studio mdhr shine through turning it into not just a game but a love letter to the passion and skill of its creators

if you havent jumped into the cuphead fray yet i strongly reckon you give it a go its a real knockout trust me youre in for one hell of a time playing this game

#####

let me be as blunt as i can
do you like a game that easily could tick you off to no oblivion but still fall in love with the gameplay the story and characters for a relatively priced game then look no further than cuphead

yeah its pretty hard especially when you unlock the hardest difficulty there is but theres a reason why its so challenging the very moment you pass the level or beat a boss is so much more rewarding its unbelievable
also screw you beppi the clown gosh that was such a pain in my butt

910 for sure
id give it 1010 but it really did peeve me off pretty badly in some levels

#####

this game is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very difficult

#####

played this game over 100 hours and loved every second of it just got every achievement done but its also enjoyable even if you dont like to torture yourself to that extent  im ready for the dlc this summer d

#####

ahhh finally cup souls

or like my wife calls it dark head

i dont want to remember what my wifes boyfriend calls it something about too many cups and not enough head

cuphead is to put it in the best if not simplest word possible fantastic

cuphead is brilliant period the presentation is second to none and the animation is one of a kind in a world of repetitiveness not just the gorgeous retro visuals not just the awesome music not just nostalgia for an long past era but really it does everything right 

the animation style has so much love that it makes me long for the days when i would watch the old felix the cat and popeye episodes i loved so much with my dad

the game really looks so beautiful ill never forget the days i first started playing it my dad walked into my room saw the screen and asked you watching cartoons again gods i love that old fart but like my ex wife just because something is beautiful doesnt mean it isnt difficult

i have never had a game that pushed me to my limits like this before its a very difficult game and you will die a lot but the game is completely fair if you die its your own fault some people say that theres parts where rng can destroy you but in my experience there was always a workaround be smart skilled and most important of all persistent

battles are almost like a dance in a sense you have to keep moving on your toes at all times while keeping in rhythm with the bosses attacks once you master each dance the bosses become much less brutal and thats what makes it so satisfying because not many games can you actually see yourself improving as you play like that

not to mention each boss is completely utterly unique keeping the game fresh with new hazards and attacks and learning how to counter them 

if youre able to persevere through each new challenge youll be rewarded with amazing music and animations crafted with love and incredible detail sit back and enjoy the ride

if youre into action or platformer games or youre looking for a game that really challenges you to get better in order to win dont think it over any longer this game is worth every cent unless you really suck at video games or pattern recognition of course

after getting almost every achievement and playing the game 70andso hours and still counting i cant recommend this game enough

man does it feel good to git gud

910 because of too much cup not enough head

#####

a brawl is surely brewing

#####

no game has ever filled me with such rage except for that one time i accidentaly deleted my minecraft save

#####

intense 2d boss rush shooter in the vein of gunstar heroes and metal slug that offers a decent challenge

absolutely gorgeous and endlessly charming

#####

pain just lots of pain

#####

i want king dice to do things to me

#####

the devsartists put so much effort into the game and it shows the art in this game is truly astonishing and the music is a piece of art the bosses are difficult but they are very very fun to fight every time you beat a hard boss you feel so proud of yourself and you want to continue if you ever have the money to get this game i would recommend it all you need is some skill and some endurance easily 1010

overall this game is truly incredible and deserves all the love it has been getting in my opinion the art is a blast from the past and difficult is hard but fair i would definitely recommend people who usually do not play platformers to give it a good try because it surely is one hell of a game

#####

there has never been so much serotonin brought by a combination of cups and jazz that being said i will personally make sure that genie never sees the light of day again

cuphead is a shoot em up type of game that mainly focuses on defeating challenging bosses and dodging incoming attacks
each boss encounter is creatively unique and offers an incredibly difficult challenge on all levels learning the games patterns is crucial
additionally there are run  gun moments where you have to collect coins and jump over obstacles
you get to choose which boss you want to go to and the difficulty level you want to take on the boss but to unlock the expert mode you have to defeat the boss on the standard difficulty even if theres a simpler difficulty the game remains challenging and doesnt forgive you as you start with only 3 hp you have upgrades and different spread abilities for your gun and ultimate abilities but overall it follows the same principle dodge shoot and kill

h3  fun h3

its hard to describe this game as fun if youre looking for a relaxing walk in the park this game isnt the one to provide it its consistently frustrating and challenging even during platforming segments nevertheless i can still recommend it 
 
h3  visuals  presentation h3  
  
the beautiful art style reminds me of disney movies from the 1920s and 1930s each character and boss is uniquely crafted and i havent seen such a level of detail in animations before 

if you want something unique this is it 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3047853397
 
h3  sound  voiceacting h3  
 
the music is just as good as the art style it draws inspiration from oldschool jazz music of the 1920s and complements the overall game beautifully 
  
h3  story  writing h3  

cuphead tells a simple yet interesting story about two boys cuphead red and mugman blue who played against the devil at the casino and lost as a result the devil wants their souls but in exchange they ask to collect the souls of all the residents in the world
from there youre tasked with taking control of either cuphead or mugman to carry out the mission at the end you can decide the outcome of your story but keep in mind that you can replay and change it for different endings

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3047853849
 
h3  length  difficulty h3  
  
its not a very lengthy game if played on the lowest difficulty but it can become quite long if you stumble and try multiple times expect a challenge so dont be surprised if you die a lot and have to replay levels that may seem visually easy but are not anything that touches you can damage you and if you accumulate enough damage youll die 

h3 verdict h3  
cuphead is an exceptional game that holds a special place in my heart it may not have been the most fun but it was the most fascinating game ive ever played i didnt expect it to be challenging but after defeating each boss i felt a sense of reward similar to what ive experienced in soullike games its a great game with unique boss fights art design and music i highly recommend it

difficult but immediately addicting

#####

its fun but if you get easily mad or dont like hard games i wouldnt recommend to you edit this has become one of my favourite games so i have a bit more to say this game is good because its simple and easy to learn it is very rarely rng based except for one or 2 fights so you can get better at it and dont need to worry about that messing you up its a good game for people who like to achivement hunt or 100 because its so much fun

after finishing the game on normal and expert i thought i really have to make a good review about it

the game is simple in terms of gameplay nothing too complicated you get different weapons and abilities throughout the game to help you in your fights the gameplay can get difficult in some parts of the game but its difficultfun i would say not so frustrating with each fail you learnread more of the bosss movements which are easy to learn so you can counter them next time its not so punishing

the art style is great and boss fights are well designed and very fun with the music in the background it just all blends perfectly together its really something different and creative you dont see many games like this

if you enjoy boss fights that require learning and patience then this is a must buy there are a couple of platforming levels in the game that are fun as well but i would say this game is heavily focused on boss fights not platforming

#####

cuphead is the definition of insanity
cuphead is doing the same thing over and over again expecting this time youll do better

and everywhere you go theres this one boss whos super overpowered you have to face and you just keep telling yourself
this time its going to be diffrent and then 1 minute passes and you say something like no no no no and then you die and press the retry button like the sucker you are thinking again this time its going to be diffrent but it never does

buy this game and see yourself slowly lose your sanity

#####

never doubt that this is a finely crafted piece of software  cuphead and mugman respond as fluidly to your button taps as the sumptuous rubber hose animation suggests  and i dont need to tell you that the art and animation are inonpareili because you can see that with your own eyes  paradoxically while this gorgeous animation which is fully worthy of the great fleischer studios has iuniversali appeal and makes everybody who sees two seconds of it want to immediately start playing the game itself is only for a small subset of enthusiasts  gamers who like incredibly hard shootemup 2d platformers  and guess what  its even mean to those people    

being an nes kid with a masochistic streak i had some fun with the game  i even grabbed all achievements save one and i am just about there  the problem is half of the time i wasnt having any fun  i forced myself to hurriedly uninstall icupheadi after i began losing my sanity to king dices expert mode my will was shakin my mind was breakin every time i reached those farspaced pink cards  yes yes i know nobody twisted my arm to try to 100percent the game  but theres something unwholesome about the way it combines adamantine difficulty with gameplay addictive as heroin to someone of my gaming proclivities  i say i enjoyed the game isomei and i did when all was said and done but it felt like every time i played it i compulsively played far past the point of fun because i just couldnt let the damned game beat me  the emergency uninstall was a lastditch attempt to salvage the remainder of my vacation for more enjoyable things

icupheadi is a welldesigned game in many ways but i think its a little much for ianyonei not just casuals  mdhr studios are a oneofakind talent they just need to lighten up next time around

#####

watches streamers play it
this looks really easy i bet i can beat those bosses easily once i get the game
buys the game
kill me

ive watched a ton of cuphead playthrough videos but nothing beats beating the game yourself that sense of accomplishment

i dont have a lot of words mostly because every step of the way theyve been replaced by a combined usage of wow and fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

its a bos rush title with a phenomenal art style pacing and grasp of challenge and reward in gameplay if you read nothing else read this get this title this is gaming as art that also kicks your ass 

video
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvs5n3wians_w

text
the visuals should need no introduction reminiscent of old disney cartoons the animation and style as well as overall feel of the entire game fits to a t this very much extends to the sound design that works along side the visuals to create the perfect mix 

if there was one negative i can add about the visuals its the response you get when hitting an enemy that isnt as clear as i feel it should be on occasion

on to the bosses themselves they are excellent and near damn perfect from start to finish  each boss is designed in a unique way and each fight is rewarding as you learn mechanics and boss movements the game is hard but its never unfair  so learning the bosses is a massive joy as you see yourself getting closer to that victory screen with each try

lastly this game was very much designed for controllers in mind and it shows playing on a keyboard is less precise or enjoyable and the default keybindings are pretty much the worst ive seen this year they are thankfully full rebindable so thats not a massive roadblock

its really really good go play it

pc port runs like a dream even well optimized for weaker computers with the nice touch of a chromatic aberration slider though this is one of the few games i think works well with ca as it does fit the aesthetic of an analog tv or a vhs well but its nice to have the option to change the intensityturn it off the style of the game just oozes quality with beautiful handdrawn animation catchy music that fits the 1930s era cartoon style the game emulates the game chooses to run at 60fps a creative liberty which does make the animation all at once not quite fit the aesthetic but also looks gorgeous with the added frames in motion and greatly helps the fluid gameplay

its challenging but fair the mechanics are completely solid and responsive as well as the threats are well telegraphed which helps that you never really feel its the controls which make you die rather than your ability the bosses are creative memorable and fun all with multiple stages and often are somewhat tasks of dealing with multiple threats at once theres some platforming runandgun levels and it may take some people used to mario and the like to unteach themselves to not jump on enemies heads but those who were fans of contra gunstar heroes etc should immediately feel at home

seriously this is a quality video game that perfectly encapsulates the addicting one more go mentality and the style charm solid mechanics and fairness in the challenge all make it so instead of frustrating it often is addictingly fun it truly feels like they hit the nail on the head to accomplish everything they wanted to with this title and i fully recommend it

the game is amazing but really hard broke my ps4 controler in the die house when i needed to start all over again but i drove to the store to buy a new controler hope this will survive a bit longer probably not 


overall 1010 would destroy my controler again

#####

the levels are like school

i keep getting a d or lower on them

#####

one of the best games i ever played i cant believe that after all these years of waiting i had a chance to finally play and experience this masterpiece its everything i was hoping for and more from addictive tough but fair gameplay to amazing art style and ost at moments it can even feel surreal playing game of this quality in times where we are bombarded with remasters remakes firstperson shooters multiplayer games

please mdhr dont make us wait till 2022 for cuphead 2

#####

one of the best games i played recently the soundtrack is a blast the visuals are stunning and the gameplay is smooth pure fun definitely a rare sight the mdhr studio passion is displayed in every fight every scene every map ive been disappointed with the current game market but titles like this one refresh my energy

definitely worth every damn cent

#####

cuphead dont deal with the devil is one of the most imaginative and beautiful game ive ever played the bosses are all  unique and diverse the games difficulty is where it really shines some people could have shrugged it of as non difficult or easy but under the games cartoony fascade hides a rage enducing runandgun platformer in the vain of games similar to contra this game was an enjoyable experience and i loved every minute of it cant wait for the dlc

#####

the best game where cartoonish angry potato crying onion and psychotic carrot can kick your ass d

hr

cuphead is awesome it gets harder to surprise seasoned gamers but cuphead delivers i had much fun playing it

visuals and sound are top notch bosses are hard and interesting to master feels satisfying to finally see knockout and get rank s after so many tries

once you become a master and get s ranks everywhere you can even visit old friend from another country and help him beat the game in coop just like i did p

hr

some downsides for me

 no linux native version it runs flawlessly via proton but if a hobbyist can make a working one from mac os version of the game search rutracker cuphead unity3d then why cant the devs do having all the sources
 no 219 out of the box its good for walking on islands runngun levels and some bosses but a quick hex edit helps see urlhttpspcgamingwikicomwikicuphead#ultrawidescreenpc gaming wikiurl

#####

excellent game especially like the art and music

#####

okey this might sound stange but this game helped me make homework and do other things i was to lazy to do you really need to have a lot of patience for this game and that is absolutly awesome im not trying to be dramatic here but if there was an other world i could live in it would most defenentkly be this one

its a fine day for a swell game

#####

frustrating yet incredible

#####

do not sell your soul to the devil

#####

its an incredibly beautiful game like a 1930s style cartoon and soundtrack absolutely slaps 1010

#####

one of the most charming games ive ever played topnotch presentation awesome graphics and soundtrack worth every penny

#####

it so good i peed on my cat

#####

this game is amazing the sound and the visuals are topnotch the game is hard and challenging but fair and rewarding its also very addictive the dlc delicious last course cant come soon enough

#####

yes

#####

a great game if you like a challenge not many games are like this anymore

bcuphead is a side scrolling action platforming shoot em up game it utilizes early disney esque art styles for its visuals with complementary big band jazz swing and barbershop back ground music to really emphazise the 1930s theme its presenting b

h1you bet the devil on a game of dice now its time to pay the priceh1

cuphead and mugman are the main protagonists of our tale of side scrolling local coop only action just thought id get that out of the way they made a deal with the devil on a game of craps thinking they couldnt possibly lose they were wrong 

the plot sets the mood from the very beginning a game with an innocent cartoonish look and innocent looking characters but underlying adult themes are afoot moral of the story dont gamble with your life

h1gameplayh1

cuphead plays very much like the original contra games except the colors are reversed this go around p1 cuphead is red and p2 mugman is blue you walk around an overworld map choosing destinations to venture in to some are bosses some are side scrolling levels 

theres always more than a single option available to you but in the end you have to complete every stage to progress the main story there are side quests to embark on by talking to overworld npcs and hidden coins to collect theres a shop to buy different styles of shots and charms to help balance out your weaknesses as a player

once an area is selected you then choose your difficulty at first only simple easy and regular normal modes are unlocked once you finish the game expert hard mode becomes available 

bdisclaimer the final two boss fights in the game can only be played on regular normal and expert hard modesb

the differences between modes are as follows

bsimple easyb enemies have slower attack patterns their attack cycle pool is a bit more shallow meaning they wont use all of their available attacks and some phases of a boss fight will be removed entirely

bregular normalb a normal level of play for above average gamers most boss phases are available and most attack cycles are available enemies attack at an increased speed over simple easy mode highest rank you can earn is an a

bexpert hardb for true masochists all the stuff from regular normal mode is here except now all boss attack speeds are increased by about 15 some bosses also have an extra phase added in and some even combine attacks together its like playing the game on turbo mode but you can now earn the coveted s rank if you perfect the stage good luck

once youve made your choice in difficulty you proceed to shoot jump parry and dash your way through some side scrolling areas 6 in total to be exact but the meat of the game is just an all out boss brawl theres over 20 bosses to fight all with unique patterns and looks no two bosses are alike so youre going to have your work cut out for you

at the end of each stage youre graded on your performance based on certain criteria 

how long did it take you to finish the fight  stage
how many hits did you take 
how many parry attacks did you perform
how many super attacks did you land

trying to get a on regular mode or s ranks on expert mode seems to be the meat of the game and where most of your time is going to be spent you could always just breeze through stages never thinking twice about how well you did but if you want to be a cuphead master youll have to practice 

rank bin no wayb hinders you from completing the game bthe ranks are inconsequentialb to your progression of the story once you finish a level or beat a boss more of the map will open up to you and you can venture onward

h1final thoughtsh1

its a fantastic game as someone who grew up with contra its a love letter to that game series as well as fans of a lost age of art and music its actually one of the only high quality side scrolling shoot em up games on steam of its kind that stays true to form simple yet incredibly challenging

i would recommend the purchase if youre interested in something different for a change put down the mouse and keyboard and pick up ye olde game controller and go to town i played this game for 8 hours straight and finished it in a single sitting it took a lot of patience and concentration but its completely doable on regular mode simple should be a breeze for the casuals it helps to have grown up in a generation where this genre was a household name and not so niche as theyve become today if youre an old boy like me this game should be an adequate challenge but not impossible by any stretch of the imagination

theres a lot of stigma going on with this game right now and some gamers are saying the difficulty curve is causing them to think twice about purchasing rest assured theres a difficulty selection built in to the game before you access each level so theres really no excuse to be afraid if you cant handle it play on simple mode remember you have 2 hours to refund

the difficulty spikes fairly quickly so you know just dont be a dean takahasi and take 10 minutes to beat the tutorial and youll be able to see if the games challenge is truly for you although if it does take you more than an hour to beat the first stage even i would suggest refunding it youre not going to make it

even though ratings are highly subjective and dont really mean anything its like an 8  10 an above average game and will end up being a cult classic

h1gripes o mineh1

its a great game but its not a perfect game by any means it can be insanely unfair and frustrating at times especially if youre going for a or s ranks this is where the game shows its true imbalance

the devs could have did more with the equipment system as it seemed kind of basic aside from the peashooter spread shot and chaser homing weapons the extra weapons and charms we never saw in promotional videos were all lackluster and really gimmicky i tried them all once and switched back to the basic stuff the variety of weapons just could have been a bit better theres also no way to upgrade your weapons either weapons are always at the same strength level youll never feel over powered in this game ever

some bosses are a bit ridiculous in length some bosses can take upwards of 10 minutes to complete which is a bit crazy and defeating at times it actually makes the first phases of the boss fights tedious unfun and annoying to have to endure if youre only having trouble on the final phase

im also not impressed you cant choose to play as mugman in single player youre basically forced to play as cuphead in single player mode not that it matters its just an asethetic thing but i personally perferred mugmans design over cuphead options are always nice and it wouldnt have taken them much effort to throw in a character select screen before you start playing

it only has local coop which is also another copout from the developers i mean i get it its supposed to be retro but please were living in 2017 theres no excuse for not programming some netcode in this thing just for convenience sake 

the developers claimed if the game sells well they may include online coop  im not going to hold my breath on that one if we ever do get it this game will be long forgotten by that point

#####

pros
great price for the content it offers
no problems on day 1 for pc users
no stupid season pass or preorder bonus
great cure for detail and 0 glitches
cons
 nope
note this game is not very forgiving
dont roll the dice

#####

played this game with my son who was 7 when we completed it the game is effing hard on normal in singleplayer in coop the game is twice as hard because each player does half the damage and if your buddy dies you get a chance to parry their ghost to bring them back you only get three hit points in the game and that is usually not enough as the bosses are fast and have so many attacks floating around all the time at first i thought this game was impossible but my son and i beat the devil together and it was an amazing achievement we died literally thousands of times but we got better and persevered if the game was easy youd finish it in 30 mins the difficulty is what makes it playable its a classic old arcade boss fight runngun like a game from the early 90s but with this immaculate 1930s cartoon aesthetic which is really authentically done the games a work of art but not for casual gamers or those who cant persevere through a very challenging 2d shooter
