i spent 60 on this game last year  i didnt do my homework had no idea of its horrible history and was still fairly new to the concept of todays scams know as early access  i just thought hey new rct game i need dis

i was naive  i was wrong  rctw is ugly as hell  there is no covering that up with scenery because everything has a strict placement grid so decorating is frsuterating to the point where you just want to leave everything bare large groups of ugly poorly animated guests just vanish in an instant  building a coaster is kind of cool at first glance  there are different axises to build in and it seems to be very physics based however i spent hours tweaking a coaster only to finally call it a failure and scrap it  

today it is selling for 17 but i wouldnt even drop that much money on it  they said it left the early access phase but that was a lie  there is absolutely no point in buying this game now that planet coaster is out  maybe try this is if drops to the five dollar range  it will

#####

here we go
bad simulation
bad framerate
bad graphics
bad communication from the developer
poor future plan
poor bug fixes
poor coding
poor attempt at pleasing everyone
poor attempt at keeping what an rct game even is
poor game life its had due to having 3 seperate developers

overall i wouldnt recommend this to anyone if this changes in the future than fair enough but as it stands now its is not a full product releasing this product as a full game is ridiculous and i wouldnt be surprised if trading standards in the uk fined the publisher andor steam removes it from its services the game did not live up to anything originally promised along with the fact that it has had basically no optimization done too it throughout the entire time of it being in alpha not only that but releasing this a day before its competitors when its no where near feeling like a full game just goes to show how much of a waste scam and poor attempt at trying to make your own market with an already estabilshed franchise went for this publisherdeveloper

buy planet coaster instead this game is a buggy laggy cash grab defacing the roller coaster tycoon name planet coaster is developed by frontier the original developers of rollercoaster tycoon 3 and they are doing an excellent job if you dont believe me there are plenty of lets plays and player made videos of the betas that look far and away better than this game ever will

just buy planet coaster instead

bsince its early access release the game has improved a lot however this is not enough yet and i still cannot recommend this game in its current state you will be better of playing rct3 or planet coaster b 

yes the game is finally playable and you can indeed have some fun in simply slamming rides down and charging people however the more you play the more annoyances pop up luckily for you i made a list

lets start with the positive
 huge improvements made since the first early access build
 i like the floating smileys above the visitors heads that tell you if they need something shows what is needed very clearly
 quick and responsive ui and placement of paths and path scenery these were my biggest annoyances last time
 good framerate maxed out on a gtx 1080 always 100 fps or higher
 the physical water simulation is nice

the unsure points
 graphics have improved a lot but compared to planet coaster they arent great either
 the guests have transformed from zombies to real people but still arent anywhere near the level of planet coaster
 famous people visit your park with twitter like #responses
 rides and scenery can be unlocked by spending tycoon points these points are earned by completing special and usually easy challenges however if you just complete your challenges there is nothing to unlock very quickly since you simply earn too much points this makes it a useless feature

the bad
 famous people dab if you please them something that will only be funny for a month or so
 mission objectives dont check the state of the park if you place an objective item before the missions opens so you build a mechanic stall and afterwards a mission tells you to build a mechanic stall then you have to build a new one since it doesnt recognize the first
 physical water moves way too fast
 camera height is based on terrain height so if you have a steep valley and your camera middlepoint moves through the valley the camera will lower significantly even though you were just scrolling through the map
 many problems with terrain covering paths
 you cannot delete scenery when building you have to use the delete tool which is annoying
 why can paths be curved but queues not
 no freedom in ride entranceexit

the very bad
 many simulation problems namely
 a notification tells me congrats twister 1 is very popular so i check the ride which tells me total customers 1
 mission achieve park beauty level 100  place 7 very misplaced flower beds and mission accomplished
 max people in the park seems to be limited to your fame level which rises when you please a famous person too bad they only visit like once a year so if you have a great park but dont have any guests you simply have to wait and lose money until a famous person turns up allowing you to have more guests in your park at once
 closes coaster that was open cannot reopen coaster since i do not have the money to purchase the coaster
 famous person comes with family says the message in the end she comes alone and doesnt even want to pay 2 euros for a ride and rages time to fast forward to the next famous person to come in
 cannot combine scenery only special piece by piece stuff can be combined for example topiaries cannot be used to make a large flower bed
 the music the game only has one song in 6 variations which are not that great either
 zoomed out guests seem to move with 1fps while the game runs at 140 fps
 had many crashes and freezes of the game orand my pc with this game could be related to my overclocks but i dont have any problems with other games



original review 3132016

bplease people do not buy this game in its current stateb 

the first release was a buggy beta okay no problem just fix the annoyances it before going public then they extended the releasedate with 3 months great i hope the game will benefit  but nope almost all of the complaints made with the pretty unplayable beta 5 months ago still remain in the game and if a developer does not fix the main problems in the game within 5 months i lose my trust in this game becoming anything great i tried to like it  i really tried but its clunky controls and camera ruined it all just like in the beta

i had such high hopes especially with the extended release date and the great competition that is planet coaster and parkitect i hoped that they would learn from those games and see how it should have been done but no the controls are still clunky the game still sound terrible and  the worst is that most anoyances like fence placement still hasnt been fixed its not that they didnt do anything these months they implemented the peeps more rides a piece by piece coaster builder a strange campaign and graphics options but no fixing the main problems

so in short if you want to play a new game like rollercoaster tycoon 3 buy bplanet coasterb which is in early alpha right now on their website and if you want to play a game like rct1rct2 buy bparkitectb which is also in early alpha and should arrive at steam in a few months but please dont be as stupid as me please dont buy this game in its current state i really hope they can turn the sinking ship around and still make a great game of it after early access

hmm where to start obviously you can tell most reviews are negative with that said i still decided to purchase the game mostly for the fact it was only 15 which i could spare and because i was interested to experience this game for myself being a huge fan of rct

also i have not played planet coasteryetjust to let anyone know im not comparing


pros for me

 coaster building is awesome at first it took
 some time to figure the controls and menu but quickly it was very simple

 workshop is awesome adds some more content to the game depending on what youre looking for

 visually the game for me is an enhanced version of rct3 maybe thats a bad thing for some but
for me it was fine im not picky on graphics in tycoon games

 scenery mainly center pieces huge waterfall temple mine cave for building coasters around or in very cool

 camera reminds me of the sims 3 camera very easy to move zoom in zoom out etc except

cons ugh

 you cannot colorcolour rides only coasters

 you cannot build rollercoasters undergound or make them pass underground at all this killed me

 you cannot curve queue pathways but you can curve normal pathways 

 entrances and exits for rides cannot be moved and are already placed

 landscaping tool is way too slow and way too small for big projectsbut without having anything underground whats the point

 the coaster camera when youre in the front seat the back of the seats are all cut off also when the coaster is going at a good high speed it does this realistic type of thing for the camera basically making it blurry and giving you montion sicknessgood maybe but not for me

 navigating the menus is such a pain first of all why would you put icons of rollercoasters for each different type of rollercoaster in the coaster building menu when you cant even tell them apart  they all look the same forcing you to hover over each name to find out what type it is also finding reports of income staff advertising etc is all a pain to get to

 when i first loaded the game it was completely blurry i had to turn my pov to 100 anything below that and its blurry as a foggy night on the east coast in fall



overall this game does have potential that is if the developers are going to be updating it
the price has me worried that theyve given up and what we have is what we have if so then i cannot recommend this game if they were to update the game and change what they clearly missed the mark on doing then yes 

all i want is to build underground and change the colors of my rides  whyyy

#####

if you want a game like this but good get planet coaster
if you want a modern game reminiscent of the old rct games 1  2 especially then get parkitect
just dont get this

#####

honest review incoming if you want seriousness

i really wanted to give it a thumbs up

the game is enjoyable not great but enjoyable unfortunately yes there a ton of issues which are making it feel hardly worth 20 even they give you a warning that says its early access and to expect some issues but theres more than some if you will ill break down some basic pros and cons i have not played rct3 my last was rct2 if that helps judge any of you guys looking to possibly jump back into this franchise

pros
 you still get to make a theme park and make rollercoasters
 menus seem pretty clean and pretty easily navigated
 some of the customizable options for paths and such are cool
 probably couldnt be stated enough the spline with coasters has so much potential and upside if it works but still seems a bit too frustrating at the moment
 ugc could make this insanely awesome once implemented

cons yes theres quite a lot but its just things i honestly think they could improve on and make this game much much better

 lag this is arguably one of the most frustrating issues noted switching around in the menus seems to just not sit right at all with the game theres so many points in the game that lag becomes an issue that as much as im trying to actually play the game with a positive outlook i physically cant

 very minimal customization options mostly scenery things but a few others

 path creation is quite annoying putting a stand or booth down or whatever nonride hut you put down if it doesnt form a line you should have the option to automatically have it connect to the path at the easiest and shortest route creating a super small path 1 inch away from the building and not being able to connect it gets very frustrating im sure they already know this

 coaster creation again i cant even make a basic loop on a coaster anymore some of the prebuilt pieces offer some neat designsideas but they ultimately feel kind of lame i figured theyd have an option to add a loop and then you can choose the metrics on it but you have to do some funky spline work that right when you think it looks good and you budge just a hair the whole piece you just spent messing with is all messed up adding a straight track with spline feels ridiculously hard when it shouldnt be they need to have some snap options or something to help the building process of coasters simplicity honestly goes so far if it works which i know it has in previous games honestly i could explain so much more but im just assuming theyre working on trying to fix the relatively poor custom coaster design process such a good concept so poorly executed 

 premade coasters feel halfassed and thats being generous not even going to get into that

 not sure the bigger park staff huts works any better i could just be confused one how it works i had a small mechanic hut near some rides with 1 employee switched it to 3 and it felt hardly any better to fixing the rides i finally get to the bigger mechanic building employee 10 and i literally feel like its producing 0 work itll have like 1 ride repaired when 5 are broken down right next to it not sure again if im dumb or if thats just not working eventually rides get fixed but it takes much longer than i think its supposed to be

 campaign has some very bad issues if you want someone who hasnt played your game before to really get into it you have to give some better direction and descriptions ie you dont get all coaster style options right away you should be able to highlight over the items you dont have and it tells you how to obtain them one of the biggest issues though is the freezinggg games over pretty much after you get so far my buddy and i both bought 2 expansions of land to our parks and that seems to be the sweet spot that you have permanent game issues his saved game in campaign no longer loads and mine takes about 34 minutes to load my park and then another 23 to become functional as the screen is froze trying to load it i have a very good computer and internet connection as does he once i finally get in its just consant issues to the point i cant play the game

 deleting is a nightmare if you ever get that feeling in your stomach trying to do something super simple but its beyond frustrating prepare to get that feeling a lot you give the delete a bulldozer emblem make it a bulldozer let us just cruise over those trees and bushes with ease obviously we want confirmations on deleting our rides and such but dont make it take 40 minutes trying to clear some land

 i actually tried the music for some of the rides cmon





tldr review should you buy

i want to say yes buy but i dont feel comfortable doing that the game has so much potential its 2016 right it has a lot of issues and if theyre open to actually reading reviews i think they can knock this game out of the park

unfortunately everyone knows a game is defined by its launch sad but true and this one failed pretty hard its labeled early access but ive played much less developed games in early access that ran better

but dont give up on this game give them some time enjoy older rct games companies typically respond pretty well to issues well assume theyll do the same ill continue to attempt to play the game and keep up with some updates but for anyone looking to invest wishlist it and let the game get to at least a playable state

get planet coaster instead

#####

i was one of the first purchasers of roller coaster tycoon world as you can see i have more than 150 hours invested in the game when the game was released lots of things were missing  like transport rides dark rides etc the game was playable barely but didnt come close to the quality of planet coaster or even roller coaster tycoon 3

in the forums several times myself or others who were concerned about development asked if nvizzio and atari were in it for the long haul we wanted to make sure they wouldnt just drop the game because of negative reviews and not finish it we were assured several times that the game would be finished 

it never was atari moved on to other projects leaving those who invested in rctw to realize that ataris bad reputation is welldeserved  unlike others i withheld judgement on this game with the promise that it would be finished  that we would have transport rides dark rides and tons of other missing elementsfeatures well the others who said dont waste your time  they wont finish it were right and so now my judgement has arrived

do not buy this game or invest in other atari games until they stop lying to their customers and until they put a solid effort into developing a good game with good developers sadly this isnt it and is the first major stain on the roller coaster tycoon name

i would give this a 0 out of 10 stars if i could thats how i feel about being lied to

#####

epic fail i was determined to play though this game despite the many many gamebreaking bugs i had to replay many of the levels multiple times in order to fulfill the level requirements sometimes an influencer would just never show up you cant advance without influencers sometimes an influencer would show up and then just run around without fulfilling his mission occasionally peeps would refuse to get on some of the rides or all of them often the game would require me to put down 4 hat shops or 2 family rides just for example  but would fail to recognize when i completed those requirements

still i persisted for most of the game i found ways around these inexcusable inconveniences i had to play certain levels 3 or 4 times but eventually i figured out how to complete them despite all the bugs unfortunately my luck ran out on the last 3 levels 2 of the last 3 levels just would not let me complete some of the requirements no matter what i tried and no matter how many times i replayed them the final level would not load like ever ive never even seen the final level because the game crashes every time i try to load it 

i spent many hundreds of hours playing rct3 so i was determined to get through this game at all costs call me nostaligic i was willing to overlook the games many cosmetic issues and minor glitches i was wiling to replay levels and to invent workarounds  something i shouldnt have to do obvi but even with all my stubborn determination i was unable to complete three buggy levels ive owned this game since alpha and ive put off writing this review because i hoped against hope the developers would fix enough of the bugs to make this game playable unfortunately thats not the case this game is broken dont waste your money 

#####

ive waited for a long time to leave this review i purchased in the first preorder and had been anxiously waiting for this game
i played during the early access i kept up to date on all the developments watched the dev streams browsed the official forums the works i truly believed this was going to be the best rollercoaster tycoon game yet

i was wrong

ive patiently waited for the massive number of bugs and just plain bad designs to be fixed but the last update atari released was now over 4 months ago they have given up on this product after sucking the money from the long the fans of this long beloved series

the rollercoaster builder is pretty solid  and so it should be seeing as i believe it was the first feature they designed and the longest tweakedfixedimproved feature for the entire development and release stages

this is where the good news ends the overall graphics are poor the effects are poor the sounds are poor the bokeh effect that was used by the promo screenshots extensively broke after the second postrelease update and they never bothered the fix it

path placement is buggy placing shops on paths is buggy setting staff zones is buggy deleting objects is buggy hey guys remember in the dev stream you said the massdelete tool was in alpha and would be improved you lied

the game comes with like 4 songs to choose from you cant customize the colour of your rides the guests glitch a lot they walk through objects they mostly walk around depressed their animations are poor

there are no water rides there are no dark rides light passes through pieces from the pxp builder so you cant make a dark room you cant make dark rides you cant build underground

the water looks like jelly the water placement and removal is super buggy be careful not to flood your whole park even with a milimeter of water or everything will bug out

i could go on but there is no point
dont buy this game dont give them your 5 or whatever stupid price they put on it

atari you killed rct

#####

just buy planetcoaster

#####

rollercoaster tycoon is an important game for me it is that game what i install everytime something bad happened when im ill or when i want to destress install rct 1 2 or 3 and you have a smile on your face in a minute i can guarantee you

the game has its own character the colors the happy peeps balloons and the cartoony artstyle without being a casual game at all is proven a strong a concept and i think after many years this game is still a lots of gamers favorite 
it was rct that i saw on friends pcs screens even on them who never play any other video game

rct world fails in every aspect to reproduce the freedom and creativity and addictive feeling of the older rct games
even when the game did not suffered from technical bugs 3d glitches broken soundmusic bad optimization and way too less content it was a bad game its missing spirit comedy freedom and everything what makes the rct series great
the peeps are boring to look at they dont have any style themself it seems the dev team could not choose between realistic and cartoony and choose to design a mix of photorealistic characters with cartoony movement models everything moves too fast even on slow setting on a slow engine i did met the sys req for the game the minimum but whatever graphic setting i use after i place my first rollercoaster the game cant deliver anymore

object placement and path placement is ridiculous the terrain tools very user unfriendly you cant place path where you want even if it seems to fit perfectly the engine dont allow you to place anything on random places tools you have like a grid and a snap grid makes this even more worse

you can only place objects directly to the ground you cannot place anything on top of something else you cant even place banks lights carbage bins anymore on paths when the path is higher then the ground level you can not build anything anymore in the game itself its advertised that you can build anything in any other 3d tool and import it

there is almost non to zero customization you cant choose the main building the entrance building thematic entrances place of entrances etc etc its all setup for you so the only thing you can do is build a prefab item no creative building anymore

you cant assign staff cant train staff cant change the colors of them its all setup same for food stalls ticket stalls peeps etc etc

the management tools are not complete the menu to read info about your parc is very hard to read its just a plain spreadsheet directly imported from the engine to the game no nice menus no humor no cartoony style and just a plain and simple click and place building game with a tycoon parc theme around it

last but not least the amount of content you get at the moment is 130 part of the original rct games you have 6 rollercoasters to choose from 4 different terrain types instead of 18 in rct 3 a few thrill and a few junior and family rides all rides are fixed and you cannot change anything yourself but even if you could the amount of content provided by the game itself is so minimum you can choose between some rocks and some trees and a handfull of decoration pieces 

theme parc building should be something that makes you happy and should be happened smooth and relax this game is slow frustrating ugly and simply misses anything that could make a game like this fun

#####

i grew up on these games the last one i played being rct3 so when i reentered the scene and saw there was another one released i ignored reviews and bought it for the nostalgia man what a mistake buggy almost worse graphics than rct3 10 years ago ten an absolute disappointment on the same scale of the initial release of no mans sky in 2016 yeah actually that bad i took to the internet and discovered planet coaster and found the reason for rctw being lame frontier left atari to make their own game planet coaster and atari had to hire three different studios to make this game all of whom were completely inexperienced and although im sure worked their asses off on this game straight up cannot compete with a next gen parkcoaster builder like planet coaster it really is a shame but do not buy this i could barely play it i knew immediately upon opening the game that i had made a mistake u do yourself a favor and buy planet coaster the spiritual successor to the rct franchise u

#####

i had high hopes when i originally bought this game since the first three games were absolutely amazing but having played it i found myself very disappointed the controls are complicated the park simulation is confusing honestly planet coaster is what this game should have been get planet coaster instead

#####

where do i start  ill keep it simple i have been a strong supporter of rct since the day rct1 was out  and couldnt wait for this installment sadly atari have not listened to the community and decided not to spend the money on a proper software house like fronter who made rct3 instead a decidedly poor version has been created 

the beta looked promising but it went down hill from there the graphics are awful the scalling is all wrong the audio works randomly the frame rate on a highend machine is poor and the over all experience and ambience of the game is a total letdown 

this does not keep the rct franchise going im afraid i cannot recommend this game to anyone  especiallly when the competition planet coaster was so much better in every single way 

ive just deleted it from my pc waste of money

#####

buy planet coaster instead

#####

it is hard to believe this game was released in 2016

i have been fan of the series since i was a kid  and was excited when this game was first released but the outrageous amount of negative feedback kept me from purchasing until now with a sale price of 374 i figured why not give it a go and at first i thought even with the shitty graphics controls limited content etc i could still play it through then came the freezing and crashing unplayable for me refunded

#####

an absolutely horrendous excuse of a game to even bare the tycoon name  so disappointed and ripped off that i bought into this in early access i think it was upwards of 50 canadian  should have tried to get a refund years ago it seems like the developers have abandoned this game a few years ago also  so unless this game gets a complete overhaul do not purchase this game
buy parkitect instead 
its a much better game that gives you that incredible nostalgic feeling of playing rct 1 2  3

#####

i received this game for free and i still feel scammed

#####

dont get this game this game is not made by the original creators of the rct franchise its made by some noname dev studio thats still trying to figure out the rct vibe

ui is trash its full of bugs it doesnt offer much customizability outside of the realm of the old game rct3 released in 2004 it runs like a pile of crap you need a monster machine to get any kind of useable framerate im on a gtx 1060i5 4670k and i cant push 30  medium settings

one of the major downfalls of the game is that it relies too much on the steam workshop and usergenerated content ugc to support the game if the devs would actually bother working on some of the rides in the game they might have a game worth 30 but at the 50 pricepoint that theyre asking for youd be better off flushing the money down your toilet at least youd get a little entertainment out of watching it swirl down the toiletbowl

the game is absolutely not worth the money youll end up paying for it if you want a real rctstyle experience go with planetcoaster its cheaper and infinitely better and its made by the same guys that made the other rct games why are you still here reading this go buy planetcoaster

tldr dont buy this game its trash compared to planetcoaster

edit the price has been reduced from 50 to 35 since the initial creation of this review it is still not worth it go pay the extra 10 and get a good game thats actually worth your money

#####

get planet coaster

#####

well that was quick 
well at least the pictures look cool


my 04 hours is me trying to get the game to run









fast computer not gonna take more time to write a crap review no one will read

#####

get planetcoaster

#####

horrible game couldnt even complete the tutorial game wouldnt register the events it told me to do to continue just simply stuck had to do them from scratch repeatedly just to finally hope it would register

if you are a rct fan do not buy this game buy planet coasterits leaps and bounds better

ui is hideous and overwhelming
controls are annoying
music is horrible
gameplay is boring
ai is ridiculously simple customers all pretty much just say the same thing
roller coaster building tools are just annoying and difficult to work with
unlocking items with earned points is just stupid why not just offer everything
no filter for scenery objects nope just scroll through all of them till you find what you want want a certain theme to persistyep scroll to the end every single time

just dontsave yourself the heartachedevelopers should be fired for even putting rct name on this garbage

#####

dogshit

thanks for ruining chris sawyers legacy atari

#####

i really really wanted to give this game a good review but i cant even after reading all of the negative reviews i still couldnt believe that rct would be a bad buy 

however it was

the graphics are pretty good there is room for some improvement but over all good graphics

this is where positive remarks come to an end 

you cant build buildings you cant make your own pavillions or themes i miss that 

the path system is pretty clunky you sometimes cant connect to specific places 

no tunnels want your roller coaster to go through a mountain you cant

it just feels like this game is trying to be to slick with that it fails

#####

buy planet coaster a true aaa theme park game

ive deleted my review of the beta version oct 2015  and will review the whole game and development

atari took my money along with everyone elsefor a pre xmas 2015 promise of a aaa game after they had fired the first 2 developers

beta weekend one had beautiful gfx but an awful game there so however so much potential 

the promised beta weekend 2 never happened

atari went to early access when they know planet coaster was taking them apart  that didnt work as 4 months after the game was due out  the first ea was buggy played poorly lacked so many of the promised features and the gfx had been downgraded so badly it looked like playdoh

the final insult is that rctw release copy 10 doesnt even launch if it did you see a buggy  awful looking game that has no dark rides water rides or transport rides that were promised for release

avoid avoid avoid urgently and buy planet coaster a true aaa theme park game

#####

what are you doing in this game page go to planet coasters page

#####

this game was very disappointing it had upgrades that one would expect such as smoother integration of paths custom buildings and coasters into the environment but the building controls are far from ideal and the variety of rides and booths are surprisingly sparse compared to previous games i still enjoyed parts of the game but the number of times the game has crashed and lost my progress has led me to uninstall this game

#####

while planet coaster is vastly superior in terms of graphics object placement freeform coaster building ride and peep animations terrain bugscrashes and a charming atmosphere even at its alpha stage we still have to wait until the end of the year for a game with any sense of challenge or park management 

in the meantime we have to hope that rctw improves to satisfy our park management cravings while we wait
these pros and cons are against other major finished park management games like rct 1 2 and 3

pros things that are better than they were 12 years ago

there are curved paths
you can build a truly freeform coaster if you have the patience of a saint
the water dynamics are so impressive that i assume that they were already part of the unity engine and not the rctw developers
there is a car park at the entrance i like this


cons things that are worse than they were 12 years ago

  graphics and ui
if there were no curved paths in this game it would almost be graphically identical to rct3 2004
 i get memory leaks where the game eats up to 26gb of my ram i am guessing not all players have 32gb ram to deal with this issue 
the interface looks very bland i am not asking for candy crush but ive seen accounting software that looks more exciting than this

performance issues 
my fps is actually fine for the first 1000 peeps on max graphics as soon as i get over 1500 peeps easily achievable with 2 of the 9 park tiles my game becomes unusable the game freezes for 5 seconds every 30 seconds crashes around every 15 minutes and takes over 2 minutes to save the game no joke
i have i7 3930k gtx 970 32gb ram ssd
once my park starts to be a decent size 3 tiles or 2000 peeps the game can no longer save or open it without freezing 
i have not heard anyone with over 2000 peeps in their park claim that it is running smoothly

how can i be motivated to spend time building something that i can no longer use once it starts to get interesting

  paths
building paths can be a pain when connecting to other paths or building up or near hills 
changing the path material means destroying anything connected to those paths like shops as the game will not allow you to place the path directly next to them again
   to fix add a material paint brush tool in the path menu and avoid the issue altogether
the game is so picky when it comes to snapping benches bins and shops to paths they wont snap to positions that look perfectly acceptable and by default they seem to want to snap off the path onto the grass 
   to fix allow intersecting geometry and free placement of path scenery and allow shops to be freely placed much closer to the paths let your users judge what is intersecting and what looks good for them

  peeps  staff
the peeps animations are very wooden and they dont walk as families or groups like they did 12 years ago
peeps sometimes stop walking in queue lines and hold up the entire queue for a few minutes
from birdseye level the peeps stutter around the park at 2fps
sometimes all the peeps in the park disappear all at once and gradually start spilling in through the entrance
staff are often seen sliding around the park without moving their legs like ghosts
staff are often seen walking adjacent to the paths phasing through all the scenery like ghosts
mechanics are often seen congregating at ride exits phasing through each other like ghosts
i am pretty sure the staff are ghosts

  rides
there are no log flumes
there are no transport rides how hard can it be
while you can build rollercoasters piecebypiece like you could in rct3 parts like helix sections loops and barrel rolls are missing 
coasters built or edited with freeform tools lead to a very unsmooth ride when finished something as simple as a descending helix can be a nightmare to build smoothly 
adding a liftchain is way harder than it needs to be
it is not yet possible to change the colours of shops and noncoaster rides 
the prebuilt coaster stations are much larger and more realistic than rct3 but you cannot choose where to put the entrance and exits
tweaking an existing coaster can be dangerous clicking on a section of track to make a banked curve sometimes causes the camera to move which causes that piece of track to move way out of place you then have to spend ages putting it back into place to avoid an unwelcome sbend in your coaster 
to fix give us an undo option alternatively allow us to lock certain axis when needed
deleting parts of a coaster can be very tiresome after it has been built 
building prebuilt coasters from the menu is an absolute nightmare in any park that is not perfectly flat and barren
to fix give us an option to snap lowest part to terrain height and automatically bulldoze any scenery that would get in the way at the very least allow us to see the ride supports during placement so we can see how ridiculously high off the ground the base of the coaster is going to be
prebuilt coasters do not display any excitementnausea stats
all my coasters have ridiculously high nausea ratings while i think it looks quite safe 
   to fix allow us to see that nausea heatmap on our ride while we are building it if we want at the very least give the guests time to visit a toilet at the ride exit before puking everywhere there are never any staff nearby to mop it all up

   terrain
adjusting terrain under rides or rollercoaster supports is totally forbidden
there are very few terrain materials available this is like an hours job for a texture artist
there are no waterfalls like there were 12 years ago
you cannot build tunnels like you could 12 years ago

  scenery
no building blockswall sections like in rct23 i dont want to have to trust an amateur maya modeller for welloptimised and decent looking models without ridiculous stats from the steam workshop every time i want to build architecture i want to design things myself look at what planet coaster lets you do
selecting scenery items freezes the game for up to 5 seconds each and occasionally crashes the game entirely
   to fix if you dont have budget to optimise your game any further at least allow autosave

if you can bear these problems for a few hours zoom out and look at your park from above with all of its curvy paths and freeform coasters it can actually look quite realistic 
the fully working park management aspect is a fun challenge and is just as addictive as the original games
since no other title can claim both of these points at the same time yet yes i would recommend this game to keep you busy until planet coaster comes out at the end of the year after which you will probably never touch this game again
however as i am unable to open saved parks loading screen crash  and experience memory leaks after they start to get big i cannot yet recommend this game

#####

this is my first review i feel so strong about this i felt i had to say this stay away from trhis game 

the only way to be creative is to use third party 3d modeling softwear
the level of detail is the same as a 10 game made in 2005 yet they ask 35 in 2016 for it
they rushed out of early access to beat another roller coaster game coming out less then one day after this one


#####

 biggest video game flop of the century 

an absolute disgrace from atari releasing this abomination  

quality control team went awol

very poor animations
very poor peep visaul art peeps are very ugly
very poor peep ai
very poor and buggy pathing
very poor and dated graphics
in game ui looks like a place holder
peeps walk through each other all the time
peeps have clones of them selfs you see like 5 of the same peep
no motion blur setting in the options
game has no soul life less game

rctw is the worst game ever it was rushed out of early access with no care for anything

buy planet coaster instead

#####

this game is awful  strike it off your wishlist devs say its over 50 complete but imo that statement is crap and they know it ataris community management staff also need a lesson in etiquette and accepting popular opinion more on that below

to start with the game briefly its not even close to 10 of what rct3 already gives us yeah i can hear the fanboys screaming oh but geek  its early access  and it is  but nothing has improved since that original alpha i stream this for just 2 hours yesterday and despite the graphics and textures looking like something from 1995 even on highest settings fps barely struggled to nudge far past 50 on a system with an i74790k and sli gtx 970s peeps were also blurry up close or moonwalkedstutter across the map if you zoom out to far foliage and other assets were pixelated trees actually look like minecraft up close and often just disappeared randomly for no reason staff also dont work and scale of buildings is way off a drinks stall is larger than the carousel for example dont even get me started on the apparently fixed coaster builder theres no banked corner pieces of track in any rides for a start and motion paths look very rigid for the coasters it doesnt look natural 

then theres ataris community management want to make a thread saying the game is not great it gets deleted make the thread again you get permbanned from their site mention planet coaster on their twitch and youtube streamschannel get purged buddy go look at the forums on their official site  its all full of praise and users defending the title if they perhaps put as much effort as they do in moderation into the game itself it wold probably be a lot better

save your money buy planet coaster or just hold off on this until its finished if that ever happens theres a very very long way to go and they have no money how do you think this game will turn out i have a rough idea

#####

i was a hardcore rct fan from the first day it was released that changed with rct world and the release of planet coaster planet coaster is far better in my opinion and if i could get a refund for rct world i would

#####

gave this game a fair shot with over 20 hours played but honestly its just terrible the new pbp builder is ok if you can get used to the clunky control system the trouble is the rest of the game is dire it feels pointless spending time making nice looking buildings only for horrible looking peeps to walk through and micturate on the foundations of the building you spent hours fighting the game to make 

outside of the pbp builder the rest of the game is a rotten cabbage the peeps roam around aimlessly in an eternal hunt for food stopping only briefly to hate your rides and urinate on your pathways the coasters look feel and sound weird that is of course when theyre actually working which is rare the staff management system involves you peppering the park with terrible eye sore buildings for each service which spawns a selected amount of staff thatll walk around at running speed being completely useless the entertainers are as about as entertaining as a hemeriod and look absolutely terrible overall the game just looks and feels rubbish even when you take into account the fact its an early access title 

you might be tempted to give them the benefit of the doubt because this is early access and could be improved at some point to which id advise you exercise caution theyre wasting time adding features like the pbp builder rather than focusing on improving the core game first theyve had many months in which to do so but theyre clearly more interested in adding shoddy looking attractions and more features so they can advertise a bloated feature list in the final game the game is so broken that it would require such a radical redesign of everything to fix it that they might as well release it as a different game entirely if youre a fan of the theme park sim genre this is one to avoid any of the other games are far more enjoyable rctw is the first game ive played where i found myself just wanting to do household chores instead of playing 


#####

preordered this one on the reputation of its earlier series that i had a ton of fun with was accepting of the bugs during the beta

but this game is now live  during the tutorials i had it crash twice on my high end system running at normal levels

went to sandbox mode more bugs in the camera as i could not unlock my view from a peep that had left the park  after i figured out a work around 10 mins later the game crashed as i was waiting for a special peep to get to the park so i was doing nothing special  time in this game reflects the time i spent playing the beta with a few mins of crashing after the game went live

do not purchase this game  even if they publish bugfixes i would no longer trust the makers

i would not recommend this game that i had high hopes for  look for planet coaster as an option

#####

buy planet coaster instead

#####

first off ive been addicted playing the rollercoaster tycoon games ever since i found a demo of the first rct game on a demo cdrom ive played every rct game since and enjoyed all of them offcourse i preordered the deluxe edition of the new rollercoaster tycoon world game

for those of you who still deciding if you should buy this game i can honestly say dont

the game has many issues that are too hard to overlook in base the game isnt even fun to play because of all the random stuff that is happening i can overlook the poor graphics of this game i can even overlook that there is basically no soundtrack to this game i can overlook that the guests are lifeless but what is cant overlook is the numerous bugs that the developer stays quiet about after the game has been out for more than a year

instead of fixing the real bugs you keep getting these useless theme packs that nobody asks for i thought there was a user generated content system for that what i want are more diverse rides better terrain tools a working pathing tool a better designed user interface a nice soundtrack that i can choose for the rides adding my own music for the rides

luckily there are alternatives for this abysmal joke of a game
since the release of this game ive played more hours of the original rct and rct3 than the latest one just because the older ones are fun this game isnt

for anyone still not sure if to get this game please do not buy this game for more than 5 dollarseuros
if you want a good themepark buildersimulation game play planet coaster or the older rct games this game just isnt worth it


#####

several years later and im still sad about how disappointing this game was they took a franchise beloved by millions around the world and sucked all the life and joy out of it this game is buggy graphically uninspiring and feels like it was made because they had to not because they wanted to

if you love rollercoaster sims pick one of the others out there instead of this

#####

if youre looking for a worthy successor to rct 13 that takes the rct interface to the next level and is still charming fun and easy to learn get parkitect instead

if youre looking for the next generation in theme park simulation with unparalleled realism and flexibility get planet coaster instead

either way avoid this one it has nothing to offer that isnt already done much better in parkitect andor planet coaster after buying rctw for an extremely low sale price i just want my 9 hours most of which were spent fighting with its horribly clunky and counterintuitive track editor and 6 bucks back

#####

this game is abysmal 

im a lifelong fan of the rct series and rctworld has shat on them all from a height before promptly walking off laughing into the sunset with one finger raised 

getting it working a challenge it doesnt like doing simple things such as loading or playing for long durations without a crash

once you get it working its riddled with bugs and has captured next to nothing from the original games its clunky riddled with ux screwups such as only being able to place fence panels one at a time ah you know what i cant be bothered with this review the games shocking do not waste 3000 on it

if you want rctworld buy planet coaster  one of rcts original teams have built it and its highly rated if you want a classic feel try parkitect 

save your sanity and money uturn here i will never buy another atari release after this complete scam they call a game just another earlyaccess money grab

#####

i could write a ridiculously long review of this game mentioning all the issues it has but ive already put more then enough time into trying to help the developers get this game in to a fit shape but it was all wasted effort and time so there will be no more effort from me put into it not even to make a proper review 
its terrible in almost every way enough said

#####

ive played this game for a couple of hours today and it crashed on me twice so lost my savegame twice i had this in the alpha as well so i stopped playing until the final release the game is still crashing come on devs what are you guys doing

#####

rollercoaster tycoon world early access

this game is heart breaking to say the least as a huge rollercoaster tycoon fan i was greatly disspointed with the outcome
unfortunately it comes down to the cons outweighing the pros

problems ive encountered while playing the game

the park guests they are unrealistic in the way the move around the park they constantly glitch and get stuck in queue lines which holds everyone else back seems like 1 out of 3 of them ether puke on the floor or throw garbage making it impossible to keep up with the cleaning of the park you cant pick them up anymore i could go on

 the park workers picking them up is very choppy and not smooth having to find them instead of having a menu with all of them listed gets frustrating because so many guests seem to want to litter and puke every 10 steps you need an army of them to keep the place clean you can no longer set them to be in a certain area  was nice to set them on specific always messy paths

 the fps the frames per second of the game dramatically drops after you get over 1000 guests which can happen within the first hour or so of playing and yes i have a great gaming laptop that should allow me to run it it becomes unbarable and unplayable after just an hour or two of building up your park

lack of customization can no longer render the buildings or coasters a different color can only select a small number of premade buildings designs of premade buildings seem lazy copied like other buildings with slight changes

roller coaster building it all feels confusing and complex and its so difficult to get it exactly the way you like it it should be a simple build consept first and if you feel really creative go into the expert custom mode you can no longer change the train cars or how many train cars you can have the train stations are too big

my personal thoughts i believe they really wanted to deliver a great game but unfortunately for everyone it just isnt up to par rollercoaster tycoon has been one of my personal favorite franchises since i was a kid and to me a game like this shouldnt be about graphics but more about the gameplay the options the customization i think all those qualities suffered because they wanted the game to look pretty which is unfortunate because the game will even make the strongest of computers lag and make the rollercoaster tycoon experience unenjoyable little glitches here and there can be easily fixed but from what i can see so far the major issues are irreversible at this late stage of the game even at early access

it pains me to say this but i do not recommend this game
510 rating

introduced my girlfriend to this game 

she played 6 hours straight

game crashed after 630 hours without warning

no autosave   everything lost  girlfriend cried  ruined our day

bought planet coaster 

lived happily ever after

this game couldve been a little more to me but alas refund period expired

#####

before you buy

you should be aware that this is not the only rollercoasteramusment park simulation available at this time planet coaster is another game in direct competition with roller coaster tycoon world ive played the early access versions of both games  and based on my experiences i feel that planet coaster is a more polished and ready for release then rctw

 because i have not had significant time playing full builds of both games this is not a full review  i simply want to help alert buyers of options before they buy this product based on the roller coaster tycoon name prospective buyers should research both games and make decisions based on their own opinons and findings to anyone confused i hope this helps

#####

they killed a once great namefranchise

#####

i came back after 6 months gave you some time to fix your game nope its still bad tons of new added stuff without fixing the reliablity of game crashing i crash every 10 min it seems now come back in and all my work is gone if you cant make your game stable at least put in an auto save feature that updated every few min so this doesnt happen nothing is more frustrating than having to redo everything that wasnt saved i get into the game and forgive me for not remembering to save every 10 min i shouldnt have to til you fix this the game its unplayable for me and will not recommend til its fixed

#####

ill make this quick  heres a list of pros and cons

cons

no walls to build structures with
poor range of textures to paint the terrain with
cannot create tunnels for rides paths and queues
cant change the look of the stations
cant change the look of the park gates
decor offering only consists of 1 lamp post and 5 candy canes
only 5 facades
no smaller parts to create our own centre pieces with ie a large rock skull instead there are just large premade centre pieces to use
again no smaller parts to create our own specialty pieces just premade ones to use
coasters cam is not smooth and feels jerky around corners no i dont mean frame rate
coaster building can be irritatingly fiddly at times
the delete tool is terrible you can only delete one item at a time
removing small bushes is really difficult
small choice of coasters
not a massive graphical leap forward since rct3
some texures look shocking close up
crashed a few times when placing paths but this is an early access game
other than the coaster builder spline there are no improvements over the rct3

pros

coaster builder spline based could be great if the mechanics are ironed out
looks visually better than the video that was released a year or so ago
shops are okay


summary

dont waste your money on this just yet hold off for 6 months in the hope they add loads more items to play with its a very steep price to pay for a game that feels like its still in alpha its not a complete broken mess as some other reviews suggest its just got very little content to keep you interested for more than 45 hours my general feeling is that the developers are completely missing the point of what people want out of a theme park simulator  its like theyve sucked all the fun out of the game by taking away the creative freedom of themeing a park by themeing i mean creating something from scratch not simply placing two premade centre pieces side by side my main gripe with it is that its doing anything to build on rct3  even if they add lots more content it will only be on par with the previous game in the series 


#####

before reading this be aware that i also own the alpha of planet coasters but gave both games a very fair chance

i purchased rctw because it was due to release last december well before planet coaster release date
the beta came out and well i thought it wasnt bad and that they were just hiding the features from us to keep as a suprise turns out its cause they didnt actually have anything 

in its current state this game is completely unplayable i have an absolut beast pc but the game lags so hard all the time even with an empty park that i cant play for more then 10 mins 
path making is the worst iv ever seen in any game period is the snap function some sort of inside joke because its always on paths do as they want and there is no room for people to get creative as there is no clipping allowed the grid system is just some sort of crule prank and the peeps animations are reminisant of early gameboy graphics 
dont get me started on placing buildings just just dont its not even worth explaining how frustraing and down right crap it is 

one pro i will give this game is that the way you build coasters is really really fantastic its so simple and feels so natural to me shame the game can only achive 2 fps on a 980ti and i7 so you cant enjoy that either it honestly has gone backwards from the beta weekend please atari get a new developer on this asap as nvissio seem to be the most budget and clueless group to ever make a game

playing the alpha of planet coaster well it already has a ton more content far better graphics and runs like a dream it leaves you to create anything you can possibly imagine trust me when i say you should pick it up its just the game we always dreamed of made by the original devs of rct3 and their passion   love and attention clearly shines through on planet coaster

edit alot of people say that the 2 are totally different games but that isnt the case at all obviously they have differences but they are the same its crazy not to think that my biggest beef is that this game had a release date last year and what they have now is easily 1 or 2 years away from release as well as cheating all the november beta testers who i bet are all the ones leaving the negative reviews as i am

#####

i would have to say that the series has been my absolute favorite series i have every played except for this game

this game i bought early with the expectation that it would live up to all of its predicessors and introduce modern hardware to the mix it scrapes by as a very eh game

the good

 the rollercoaster editor is actually pretty great if you come from an art background and know how to use splines
 the graphics look pretty good

the bad

 the graphics settings are horribly broken on my system dual monitor
   the game fullscreens on a monitor that does 1080 but limits the resolution to the max of my other monitor which is a different aspect ratio so it looks terrible there is no apparent way to override which monitor it chooses for fullscreen
 there arent many rides and now with the story mode released it feels like a free to play game where you get internal game money from playing and completing objectives you then spend that money on rides attractions and scenery i just want to build my parks up like i want without the distraction of dealing with this overarching store this is just my nitpick and person preference some may actually enjoy this
 the story thus far feels overpowering to the actual fun of running a park instead the whole thing is playing out like a tutorial of how to do every little thing in the game even though i figured it all out in early access and there is no way to skip or rush through it you have to tediously do it all

my advice this game is absolutely not worth 35 if you are paying it thinking its going to the same creators of the previous games that is also not correct the original creators dont even agree with this games current ownership frontier created the last game and did a great job in my opinion since then they have created planet coaster which looks pretty great i believe i will be moving over to that game instead

#####

i regret buying this and not planet coaster 
pre ordered before release played through early release i expected the bugs to be fixed now nearly a year later but it is still awful to play
spent 15 hours building an awesome coaster today for the game to just spontaniously close crashing very very regularly if i can get a refund then i would

#####

started with the open sandbox quite enjoyed it there were a lot of bugs and glitches but no dealbreakers as its still early access
but when i started a scenario and looked at the way those parks are built horrible seriously who builts a park like that

the coaster builder really needs some work when i build a coaster over water it crashes when i try to make a coaster as realistic as possible it crashes for unknown probably ridiculous reasons the prebuilt coasters are built really bad and therefore should definitely crash but they dont they really look like a 2 year old designed them

other problems i encountered
 peeps couldnt enter a coaster the entrance was properly built but it seemed like there was an invisable barrier
 you can only adjust the direction by 5 degrees when building a coaster normally this wouldnt be a problem for me but sometimes it gets stuck at for example 42 degrees when you need 40 degrees so you get ugly wobbles in your coaster
 coasterphysics when it comes to speed it just keeps going really could use some more loss of speed over the course
 the breaks on the coaster builder dont make sense you cant fine tune them at all and are almost impossible to use midcourse
 result of the break issue running more than 2 trains is almost impossible
 the image rocks a lot sideways when riding a coaster
  paths are difficult to build when you want to connect two paths it restricts you in only a few possibilities
 the game randomly crashes so be sure to save your progress often
 peeps keep walking around hungry even though i placed an abundant amount of foodstallsrestaurants

this list could go on a while
for now i wouldnt recommend this game as its not worth the price
i really hope these problems are gonne be resolved i know its still early access but there are so many problems which make me question if it will be fixable

#####

buy planet coaster instead its waaaaaay better than this crap plus its made by the same peeps behind roller coaster tycoon 3  already have nearly 40 hours into planet coaster after a few days in beta and those are hours of pure bliss unlike those 7 sad hours i spent with this gameand to be honest i only bought this game to tide me over until planet coaster anyway sooooo

#####

would no reccomend this game even to my worst enemy the game constantly crashses the animations are just terrible the mechanics are frusturating and the gameplay is just terrible i was a huge fan of roller coaster tycoon 3 and now i just feel let down by atari i would get a refund but i bought this at walmart and activated it via steam atari should seriously recall this game buy planet coaster it will be worth your money

#####

buy planet coaster

#####

buy planet coaster

#####

been gaming a long timesince the textonly version of hitchikers guide to the galaxy own and played all the rcts got into this in early access and gave it chance after chance after chance bottom line after a hundred hours its just not a good game its resemblence to the previous entries in this franchise is vague at best theres no real financial engine to speak of peeps behavior is erratic and unhuman graphics are okay but just okay i want to say the price point is too high but im not sure i could recommend it at any price

at the end of the day its not fun it doesnt have to be giggly wacky funit can be challenging fun but its no fun really dont be tempted steer clear sorry im disappointed too

addenduma lot of people are recommending planet coaster and thats fine but you might want to check out what the parkitect guys are doing its coming along nicely and the econmics model seems like its going to be more robust than pc

#####

i am a long time player of rollercoaster tycoon i remember even getting the second game in a cereal box many many years ago i went into this game desiring the same heart and soul previous rct games have gave us it does not 

1 the first time i ever booted it up it would not open it just kept loading
2 most rtc games have you engaged for hours for the 13 hours i have played of this game i do not feel much desire to come back to it it bored me
3 the controls from past games have come naturally i had to literally google how to swivel the camera and swivel objects that really turned me off usually the controls have been fluent and easy to get 
4 where are all the rides seriously i was preparing to build usually one of the many tram systems and  it wasnt there they only have a few categories for types of rides flat rides  junior family and thrill and then rollercoasters correct me if im wrong on the ride types but there is very little in other games you could expect over 150 rides id say this has under 50 this aspect also applies to food and service buildings

i honestly wanted to give this my own try ignoring the very negative reviews rating however they arent wrong it makes me sad and somewhat relieved i payed under 8 for this with a steam sale however id say maybe pick it up for less if you really are curious 

there are other issues too the game feels outdatedeven though its only come out within the last year or so 

i would give the game 3510 its playablebut so lacklustre and so bare bones

#####

do not buy atari destroyed the rct series with this game buy rct3 complete edition parkitekt or planet coaster whatever you do do not buy this trash the list of things they did wrong is too large to go over in a review

#####

do not recommend  at this time  deleted my thumbs up review  comments suggest people have lousy computers the pc this game is installed on exceeds system requirements but the game continues to crash  so its not that  i want this game to work  so please fix it   ive tried many times  crash crash crash crash crash crash

#####

if i could get a refund i would dont waste your time buy planet coaster far better than this

#####

here we go
bad simulation
bad framerate
bad graphics
bad communication from the developer
poor future plan
poor bug fixes
poor coding
poor attempt at pleasing everyone
poor attempt at keeping what an rct game even is
poor game life its had due to having 3 seperate developers

and i paid 60 euros for this wtf

#####

rollercoaster tycoon world is a terrible amusement park management game however it is a decent rollercoaster building game the controls are glitchy and horrible the buildings dont align properly and the paths are stupid the new rollercoaster building tools are useful to some and are definitely a benifit but they are shadowed due how bad the usual controls can be used the graphics are decent as is the framerate 100 fps pretty much constantly the peeps look like shit tough in my opinion planet coaster and the previous rct are far surperior in every aspect espicially planet coaster if you like park management games as much as i do then this game could be worth the 5nzl price but youll only get a few hours gameplay max

#####

not even for a discount of 75

#####

just came back to this game to see if they added any new features from the alpha that i played 1 year ago they did nothing new like seriously you think there would be a peep maker as it was a feature in the previous rct but no its not there

pros
list
 enhanced coaster maker which allows custom coaster tracks
 thats it
list
cons
list
 build height limit is iveryi limited i didnt even bother looking at the height as i quit the game asap i was trying to make kingda ka from six flags great adventure and only made like 50 feet of it
 no ing peep maker i thought it was a permanent feature not a one time deal
 the available coasters are a joke and there is only 5 to choose from
 etc
list

honestly i could go on all day with the cons tbh if you went back to rct1 you would have more features and that is 10 cheaper this game is not worth the 60 i original payed back before it even came out and even when its 1520 today its still not worth it if you want a good modern coaster game buy planet coaster its from the people who made rct3 which was one of the best rcts even to this day or buy rct123 you have more fun guaranteed

ps i regret looking at this game and thinking it would be better than rct3 or even ing thrillville

h1summaryh1
when i heard there was a new birollercoaster tycoonib game in development i was very excited like many others unfortunately the developers of birollercoaster tycoon worldib did not deliver a game worthy of the rct franchise which is plainly evident by the welldeserved plethora of negative steam ratings i purchased the game when it was first available for preorder and installed it the moment it was available in early access the overall game was extremely rough however the rollercoaster builder was not bad and actually worked pretty well there were some poor control choices that made some of the builder a little cumbersome but after a little while of using the system it wasnt terrible the rest of the game however was extremely frustrating and cumbersome to work with

i recorded a screencast with feedback and published it on the developer forums in hopes of seeing some improvements to the core gameplay i tried to fight through the chore of doing basic park management for a while and then decided to take a break and wait for some patches to get pushed out i checked back in on the game periodically to see how things have changed and what improvements have been made each time i reinstalled the game in hopes of improvements i was greeted with the same terribly implemented core mechanics i should have written this review earlier when they moved out of early access and launched the game however i simply forgot about this travesty of terrible design and development choices in the meantime i played a much more enjoyable experience in biplanetcoasterib

h1the goodh1
list
    decent rollercoaster builder
list

h1the badh1
list
    terrible pathqueue system the path system is hands down one of the most infuriating systems in this game the way things try to snap to nodes on the path system is awful this is even worse with medium and large paths because they are effectively just wider skins for the same actual small path system
    aweful park management system specifically managing park employees
    horrible engine optimization i have a decent system with plenty of memory a fast ssd raid array and a geforce 1080 gpu the game takes forever to load initially to the main menu and when loading a park once there are 1500 guests the game really stutters and lags clicking on anything to bring up a menu or popover takes 20 seconds for it to actually apear
     the piecexpiece system was a clear attempt to ripoff the shopbuilding construction system from biplanetcoasterib rctws implementation however is just as cumbersome to use as the path system its simple to snap together walls and other pieces however building a structure with multiple shopsstalls is nigh impossible
     guest simulation doesnt apear to be very good or their pathing is just so terrible it seems broken ive watched guests neumerous times who need to use the restroom are standing 2ft away from a restroom and will walk halfway across the park and get on a ride just to piss themselves when they get off the ride
list

h1conclusionh1
if you are looking for a amuesment park simulator do not buy this game even with the drastic price drops even when it goes on sale save your money and use it for biplanetcoasterib instead if you are looking for the latest frustration simulator then this is the perfect game for you

#####

  it is a real shame this game does not run as intended i really wanted to like this game the developers could have easily put another 6 months to a year into the game before even putting it on early access 

  ive played a solid 12 hours so far it always starts out great but as you grow your park the glitches keep coming peeps walking aimlessly to no where there is no control over park staff paths constantly moving on me cannot delete some paths for reasons i cannot understand one of the biggest bugs is saving your game logging out then coming back later it takes about 20 minutes to load up sometimes a lot of the time as soon as its loaded it crashes instantly ive had a start 4 new parks because my saved games would not load if it does load its a mess paths moved and uneditable terrain changed drastically peeps in the middle of nowhere its very frustating building a park and borderline impossible to continue after leaving and coming back

   with all that there is a lot of potential for the game the graphics look great for a rt game the rollercoaster building is absolutly amazing the possiblilties are endless when building there is actually a good amount of content rides coasters stands scenery the game itself looks and feels great at short glance but in the long run it needs so much more work i would recommend buying this in 6 months time so they can work out the glitches

#####

do yourselves a favour and buy planet coaster

#####

h1bas of august 14 2016bh1

i was really looking forward to the next successor but this is a failsessor at the moment 

ive been keeping track and reading every new patch they put out but i havent played it in a few months now i just looked it up on youtube to save me the headache and i watched olli43 give it another shot he put up a vid about it on july 6 2016 to his and my disappointment the path systems are still a mess the game is still not optimized for full sized parks and the peeps literally float around like ghosts from a short distance away i guess to make up for the fps that doesnt really work given that the engine needs a complete overhaul
in fact this game needs to be completely redone 

do yourselves a favor whoever is the publisher maker take this game off steam rework everything from the ground up and start over these parks are so bland and boring you cant customize hardly anything besides placing a limited amount of assets i guess they rely on us to make all of the cool stuff what a lazy approach and what happened to the days when it was like rct 12 they had assets and scenery out the wazoo

my money is on planet coaster yeah i said the name this game is miles behind them pc is way better than this now prove me wrong oh and pc is coming to steam so watch out rctw

i want this game to be great i really do but i fear the worst right now i mean look at the reviews on here an overall rating of mostly negative with an approval rate of 33 that is a lot to bounce back from thats why im suggesting to just start over

good day
chief

#####

planet coaster is out go buy that

#####

i tried to give this game a legitamte go go in with an unbias take on the game
yes this is early access but nothing in this game feels like it will be special when its done its essentially a worse version of rct3 without a grid system its also much more awkward to work with than rct3
planet coaster is the way to go with this generation of theme park games it doesnt have everything yet much like this game but what it does have is stunning it looks beautiful it runs beautifully and it has a clear vision
please avoid this game

as a fan of the rollercoaster tycoon series after 11 years since the last installment this was absoluetly heartbreaking the peeps dont look as what would be expected the realistic coaster supports are just never there with any of the games in the series unless modded in the limitations in the options menu is saddening seeing the difference between planet coaster and rctw rctw isnt the same and its missing quite a lot for what this game use to be as a fan im heartbroken to even suggest to anyone who could be a fan as well im giving it a chance and hopefully the developers will listen to its fans who have patiently been waiting for years for the next installment and make this series worth playing again its gameplay has some good ideas within the game but it greatly needs improvement im giving this game a 610 in my opinion it has a long way to go

#####

warning do not buy this game this game is full of bugs glitches and tons of crashes i have had this game for almost 3 years now and nothing has been fixed there is still multiple crashes to this day and that has never been fixed since the release of this game this game should still be in early access due to the amount of bugs and glitches i have never seen so much problems in a released game in my years of gaming in my opinion rct 3 will be by far the best rct out of all the rct games anyway do not waste your money on this game if you want a good rct game get rct 3 and wont have to worry about glitches or crashes also the performance on this game is absolutely horrible i have a 2080 ti and cant even hit 144 fps on medium settings if the devs ever fix this game i will be surprised if frontier could come back and help you make a better rct then this game would be way better than it is now

#####

dont waist your money buy planet coaster instead

#####

i dont write many reviews but after playing this game for the past few months i have to say i am sorely disappointed it wasnt until after i purchased the early release of this game did i learn that frontier had nothing to do with this and that planet coaster was more of the successor to rct3 than thos game i came back periodically to see if game play had gotten any better and while certain aspects did improve overall it was a very blah experience i really wanted to like this game but sadly the developers could not pull it itogether i finally broke down and bought planet coaster today and i am totally convinced that atari made a huge mistake in not keeping frontier on as a developer pc is by far the better game in every aspect

#####

this is the worst rct game ever created and i have played them all since the first version i would have taken a refund over writing a bad review but since steam refused they earned it

the gameplay is glitchy when it runs and the graphics are awful i have a 36ghz i7 16gb ram with an nvidia 4gb video card i regularly play games much more taxing like diablo 3 with 0 problems so there really is no excuse after dealing with the initial failures constantly locking up before the game even finished loading then the actual ingame crashesgraphics errors i can definitely say this product should be a free demo until they figure out what they are doing it should never have been offered as a pay item in this condition

i understood that the game was a bit buggy when i bought itthat is one of the reasons i think imposing a time limit on the refund is absurd most of us were wating to see if the game ever became playable and not just jumpshipi have learned my lesson next time i will request the refund at the first sign of problems instead of waiting in hopes of someone actually fixing the problemthat way i do not exceed any time limits



#####

it is now sep 3 2017 and they still have mechanics not fixing the rides i bought this game when it first came out for 50 they took the money and ran pretty much

#####

steam needs to bring back quality control to weed out unfinished games like this

#####

i have been a fan of roller coaster tycoon ever since the first game and ive played 1 2 and 3 almost religously rct was always a favorite of minethat is untill this installment i eagerly awaited for rctw to go on preorder and i prepurchased the deluxe edition the day it was available during the betas the game was unplayablebut i had hope that upon at least early access they would have most of the bugs worked out and the features that i know and love would be availabel 

clearly i was duped here the game is finishedwhich is a laughable statement the bugs are terrible there are no water rides transport rides or dark rides the learning curve for building coasters is steeplike about as steep as a dive coasters first drop the coasters dont even have shuttle mode the piece by piece building tool is horribly insufficent and it just doesnt feel like the same series that i know and love 

i honestly had hope with the node system that finally i could really build the coasters of my dreams make the buildings and scenery i had fantasized abouti believed i would be able to make coasters with the great scenery and storytelling that disney does so well at thier parks nope the potential for buildings and structures is severely limited the amont of scenery items is decent but nothing like the past titles building a working and fun coaster is a treamendous chore requiring so much trial and error when before it was more inuitive despite the grid system 

do yourself a favor and save your money if you want a theme park sim that actually is fun i do suggest planet coaster its defintly different than rct but in my opinion it flows much better runs smoother and the scenery and buildings potential is what i have been asking for for years i think pc still needs more work but its miles ahead of rtc

#####

this game is absolutely awful i have been an avid supporter of the rollercoaster tycoon series and have purchased each game released despite its negative reviews i purchased this game out of fan loyalty i regret my purchase

this game is laggy buggy and completely underdeveloped the excitement from pervious games has somehow been lost there are fewer rides less customization options for your park etc and as if that werent bad enough the sheer number of bugs just make it worse i stopped playing for a bit with the hope that these issues would be fixed however when i returned to te game i found it still underdeveloped are you all still making this game or is this it are you just done did you decide to just give up because if thats the case i would prefer a refund to this utterly disappointing mess of a game

#####

just play planet coaster

#####

edit got the game to work finally
another edit lagspikes when picking something to place really lagspikes everywhere

please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others
please remember to be polite and follow the rules and guidelines 
this is what steam is telling me to do if ill write a review well ok then i was about to curse the crap out of this title but ill keep it polite for steams sake

oh and dont think ill be adding any fancy headers to this review the devs didnt put effort into their game so i wont put effort into my review

where to begin ah yes ill start with the early access period since thats when i bought this game
ive got something important to tell you about this period the game actually started and i could build a park yea i know right it worked somehow that is until the game couldnt keep up with all the things i placed and the park actually getting busy at this moment the framerate dropped and at that point i usually just quit the game but hey no hard feelings this was early access after all its still under development and i knew this

fast forwarding to the present

full release is finally here the game is complete and playable or is it
well for me its not the only working thing seems to be the play button in the steam client after that i get a black screen with nothing on it except for a working alttab steam overlay i thought i mightve been the problem so i went to the discussions board and guess what i wasnt the only one with this black screen of death the devs even put up a sticky explaining what to do to fix the issue and guess what again the fixes didnt work so now im stuck with a game i paid 3199 for and i cant even play i trusted these devs i believed in them even when things close to release were still buggy or not even working and they didnt fix shit

so this game doesnt work for way too many people this isnt some rare bug thats happening this is just another broken on launch game like so many others nowadays this shouldnt be a problem but it is 

if anyone is reading this i recommend you to wait till tomorrow and buy planet coaster it looks like they do have a working themepark game that happens to be 10x more advanced than this excuse of a game hell the game was more advanced in their alpha while this was in the beta

remember today is the day rollercoaster tycoon died

yours sincerely
an angry customer

#####

some of the things that were super easy to do in rct and rct2 are so difficult to do now  i dont like how you cant delete trees or scenery just by left clicking while building rides  also trees and scenery arent automatically deleted when placing track like it used too which makes it difficult to build  when building roller coasters it will say invalid location and it isnt very clear why it is an invalid location  is it because it is too high  or are there treesscenery in the way  the bulldozer tool is also very hard to use  its hard to delete small objects  i find myself clicking on items 10 times before it actually deletes  this game honestly is a pain to play  the new track building tools are cool but not very easy to use  this game needs a lot of work

#####

i preordered this crap for 60 the only reason i bought this was because i had such a great time with roller caster tycoon 3 so i was so hyped there would be a better version of it i opened the game full off hope after 10m of gamplay i gave up and never played it after rip my money

#####

well i waited to do my review hoping it would get better sadly to say even after more than 2 years the game still sucks you can hardly even get through the scenarios because of bugs it is not just the bugs that are still there either the game itself is just a massive let down after rollercoaster tycoon 3

the coaster design tools are the worst i have ever seen the paths are limited to 3 widths and locked in a grid so they do not always do what you want you are almost stuck just building a grid system of paths because they will never do what you want if you try to go free form and forget attaching narrow and wide paths together how you want the toolspieces to build free form buildings are horrid as well the list of poor programming just goes on and on

if you like rollercoaster tycoon 3 and want a new coaster game get planet coaster not this planet coaster is made by frontier the same dev team that made rollercoaster tycoon 3 so is just a much much much better game in every way the coasters rides scenery you name it are all better and more varied

on a side note if you are hoping atari is still working to fix this game forget it they chose to make rollercoaster tycoon adventures instead i for one will not be buying adventures this game left me with no faith in atari at all i own and play all of the rollercoaster games out there but will never buy another release from atari

#####

were sad that we have to give this a thumbs down my husband  i have been atari fans since we got our first atari game system back in like 1981 anybody remember pong yeahwere old
we bought the deluxe version of this back in nov thinking the release date would be dec 10th  we arent upset about spending that money however were shocked at what this has turned out to be so far

the pros
1 early access good on atari to recognize that they needed to put something out there
2 performance we have a great computer that my husband built so no performance issues like others have had   occasional choppiness but hey its a computer game
3 graphicsthe parks actually look really pretty
4 coaster builder far from perfect but we actually made several cool coasters  each one took less  less time the problem is that both the coasters  the pieces to build with are disproportionately large  the test stats are way off what exactly is the safety rating about does anyone know i hope some of this is fixable  being worked on

the cons
1 navigation we shouldnt have to use the keyboard to scroll around the park its not 1989 and can i please have an undo button i make a lot of mistakes
2 music i know matt said theyre working on the custom music but can we please put a rush on that before my head explodes the music from rct3 was so superb id love to be able to import that into this game does anyone know if thats possible
3 the vomit really every peep pukes coming off every ride and now they pee on the path if they cant make it to the rest room sorry but its disgusting  childish
4 paths we dont even know what to make of this very cumbersome and we cant place buildings right on the main path not liking that at all
5 the peeps its like night of the living dead went to a porn flick whats with the weird moaning and can someone please make the kid stop crying i think my ears are bleeding the peeps have no personality at all they dont appear to be happy sad or anything in between
6 rides again many seem disproportionately large it just seems as if things arent properly scaled the fact that we cant move the entrances  exits is very odd why not also the rides seem pricey so why do we have to purchase the sign going over the ride
7 complaining theres too much of it it appears as if you all have taken a page from the first zoo tycoon  not a good page the animals were great in that game but the peeps made me stop playing because of the constant complaining about things you couldnt even fix please dont make that same mistake with this game 
8 buildings way too many restaurants  the builings are huge seriously who goes to an amusement park thinking gee i hope i can get a great moo goo gai pan while im here and if you eat sushi then get on a roller coaster youre an idiot no wonder theres puke everywhere dont get me started on the huge ugly unnecessary employee buildings i hate this idea but the dev blog dated april 1st states they will also be adding an admin building and where are we supposed to place that we have no room left in the park to place a rolller coaster and with the park entrance being so huge cant we just pretend thats where the employees go to rest its just a game it doesnt have to be that realistic it just has to make sense
9 breakdownsis it just me or did the rides start breaking down as soon as i opened the park
10 entertainers oh my god this is the worst thing of all to me  the dev blog dated april 1st said the entertainers will amuse guests while theyre queuing i mean no disrespect but did you guys actually play this game i watched one exit their building walk down a path enter a queu interact with exactly no one turn around  go right back to his building i told you those employee buildings were a bad idea and im sorry but that huge hulking ominous predatory owl looking thing is just scary remember the shark entertainer from rct3 my husband  i still love that guy we named him jerry we would turn the game to its lowest speed so we could watch the kiddies laugh  jump up  down as he tried to bite their heads off then he would joyfully skip away with his little red sneakers on so cute yeah thats all gone along with all the charm cuteness  personality that was rct3

we dont know what this game is but we do know that it isnt rollercoaster tycoon we have nothing but faith in atari to make this right we will continue to play for what its worth and will amend our review as we see fit thanks for listening

ps im not kidding can i please have jerry the shark back

4716so after todays update still awful oh sure the peeps look better while theyre peeing on my path right in front of the rest room but my janitors are still ineffective i do think the mechanics are working faster  i do appreciate the flat map they have a long way to go before this review comes out of the thumbs down status

52416so i went in the game today for the first time in weeks sorrystill awful its not even interesting enough or fun enough to waste another minute playing rip rct

112816 holy crap they took this thing out of early accesss yikes sorry to have wasted 6000 on this my husband  i are done with you atari considering we have been fans since you first started in 1974  we were just kids you can imagine our disappointment funny enough we also own planet coaster  arent impressed with that one either although its better than this nonsense at least they werent ridiculous enough to have peeps pissing on the path shame on you atari good luck digging yourselves out of this one

#####

this game had potential  when it was first released they released it the same day as coaster planet i think in order not to lose market share versus the other game  the problem with that is the game was not ready  and because it was released as finished when it was total garbage no one liked it  it sank like a rock  coaster planet rose quickly and stole all the market share because it was actually finished  after that the company that created this game stopped working on it entirely probably due to lack of funds  this game will never be fixed  it will always be garbage  if they had only waited to release it until it was actually working i bet it would have been great and popular

#####

oh god no this game is not good
graphics graphics are better than launch but still not good occasionally the game will freeze for a second and once it un freezes all the shadows and lighting are gone

peeps no they have no facial animations the textures are trash the models are trash the animations are horrific the peeps dont ever even walk in groups no families or anything they walk around the park alone and horribly i dont think 8 year olds go to parks alone nvizzio just saying

coaster builder best part of the game but thats not saying much you can make some cool things but its very finicky the physics are much of a pain the sounds of the coasters are horrible the coaster cam is jittery and not smooth at all

buildings there isnt any piece by piece building system the premade buildings are a pain to place not very good looking alot of them have pretty much the same exact design with just a small little change to signal that this is a differnet building than this other

ugc arguably the best part to me this is the only thing that is going for this game

paths no they dont even want to connect to 90 of other paths

performance  optimization trash the optimization is not good at all

overall this game is not worth the money spent less than half of the money for the full version of planet coaster its second alpha is much more polished and has much more features than this game that was supposed to be fully released in december of 2015 buy planet coaster it is the true sequal to rct3

#####

crash crash freeze crash this is crap

#####

i can not in good conscience recommend this game not even as a standalone game for those who might be new to the sim genre or rollercoastertheme park sim arena let alone as part of the beloved rollercoaster tycoon franchise i know we all love the first rollercoaster tycoon and have held all following titles to that standard and perhaps could be kinder to some of them but this this particular instalment is an absolute mess 

for starters there is a bug that appears to have been around for several years at this point that prevents you from starting a campaignstory mode unless youve started a sandbox game before attempting to do so i found this out on a forum from 2016 and the bug is still there i havent played the campaign as yet because sandbox is just so nothing its nothing

then theres the ui which while i do kind of like its appearance its just doesnt work as intended in my opinion nothing is clear and it was a lot more fun being able to spam handymen on top of eachother than having to purchase several buildings at almost 1k a pop and then pay wages on top of it there isnt a simple zoom option as we were accustomed to you have to go and look into the controls rather than there being a nice simple  button handily located in the upper left hand corner rotating the camera is a total pain if youre using a laptop as its binding is the mousewheel  shift yes there are alternates and the ability to change these bindings but it all just feels so clunky and ill judged rotating anything whether it be the camera or a new coaster is just awkward full stop

even the graphics seem to be pretty poor for 2016 standards 

everything about this game is quite simply an insult to this franchise id highly recommend avoiding this at all costs and only buying it if the pack works out cheaper than the products you actually want 

sure this review probably isnt that helpful of a read but im just angry about this game it could have been wonderful it could have paid homage to sawyer everything that it could have been it isnt i love rollercoaster tycoon i love atari but this game is a blemish on both of their records fortunately theres the original game and those that followed to go back to and enjoy their simplicity whilst remembering the game itself can be challenging if youre not careful

#####

get planet coaster instead

the developers continue to add new content but fail to optimise the core part of the game moving the camerathe game just lags

#####

this game is aweful in the year that ive had it according to the steam player ive spent 8 hours playing the game but i havnt i have never once gotten to play it even with beta the 8 hours ive spent playing have actually been multiple attempts at running the game i waited about 45 minutes each time trying to open the game and then it crashes for a total of about 8 hours when the game does run it is extremely lagging and crashes less than 2 minutes later the worst part is that steam wont give me a refund ive tried for a refund several times and they refuse every time even after i tell them that i have never played the game because of the lagging and crashing and refusals to load

#####

kind of fun i would wait for release too buggy right now lots of frustrations i cant even play it anymore because the load and save buttons dont work  their forums registration server has been down for weeks so i cant even report the bug they only want your money right now

#####

so many lies when it was released they promised rain for example never arrived there was a list of lies in the forums this game is a disgrace  crying and suicidal material lol please avoid this and buy the rct classic on steam it is the full experience and fun  trust me

#####

if i could get a refund for this game i would awful 
buy planet coaster instead
this game does not have a place in 2018

#####

even with several updates this game is unplayable it repeatedy crashes even on a newer gaming pc save yourself the head ache and skip this game

#####

after rct3 i wanted so bad to like this game but  its awful
sluggish controls and awful loading times and no its not my pc before someone guesses that there is a great drop in enjoyment and playability in this game that has destroyed the brand and all it stood for  planet coaster has passed where this has clearly failed dont waste your money on this buy plant coaster

#####

the game cant be compared to planet coaster
its lacking in so many fundamental ways and it seems that is in its core which will never change

its a mobile game at best
that may be satisfactory for many people though
it has not brought much new to the table and it even lacks quite a few things from rcts past

the coaster builder has its merits and its flaws 
the sound design is terrible
coasters sound like metal carts rolling down an empty marble floored hallway with little to no nuance in regards to to the action they sound the same on an airtime hill as they do at the bottom of a fast highg trough

the pathsthey dictate what you can do most of the time youll run into no not there more often than not

many of the ride animations are incorrect if you are a fan of authenticity 

many of the rides are just ugly as well take the radioctive glowing in the daytime wave swinger for instance boy is that an atrocity to behold

the newly redesigned peeps are still terrible the animations are just bizarre 
rct 2 introduced peeps in pairs and rct3 introduced groups rctw decided they should go back to the begining and only have single peeps unsupervised children no less 

the peeps will wander around aimlessly through your park and ignore the very things they are looking for 
you have no clue how to satisfy them the emoticons really floating over their heads are there to help because the peeps are emotionless 

its good that they redid the scenarios for shorter play missions because the older your park gets the less the peeps care to ride anything even for free

forget trying to attract as many peeps into your park as you possibly can most average computers will start catching on fire at around 3000 peeps the rival game becomes unplayable at around 15000 peeps thats five times the crowd

this game really has no soul at all there is nothing endearing to draw you in instead it is rather off putting

i do not recommend this game to anyone 
i voted it as worse game of the year

#####

dont buy this its not what you want you might think it is but its not its bad very very bad im playing rct3 instead much better

#####

very very disappointing  i have wasted my money

the developers have departed from the very successful player placing of ride entrance and exit in favour of the fixed variety which makes formal or neat park design virtually impossible  add to this the peculier pathing which forces odd angles on path junctions  every park will end up unplanned and  higgledypiggledy 

there seems to be no concession to disabled players with too many actions dependent on key pressing which many disabled gamers cannot do or can achieve with only great difficulty and in my case pain  shame when the older rct games and so many other games allow for this  just two examples of many the sims or for a real cheapy designed by a very small developer good folk  all or almost all actions should be available through use of the mouse as a secondary method of playing

rotating of rides is unbelievably slow and cumbersome even for those with full use of their hands  my son gave up in frustration within a few minutes of attempting to place rides

my advice to the developers is  back to the drawing board  though it will be a very long time before i consider buying any new versions of rct

#####

i bought this game because i have played alll of them and enjoyed them very much  but just recently i started playing it  and it crashes after 1520 minutes  my suggestion would be to either save your game every 10 minutes or go to planet coaster 

#####

ive never left a review before but this game is awful not because of the game play but because of the fact that its completely unplayable

every time i start getting my theme park going and getting close to that second year mark in sandbox mode the game no longer loads when i come back to play multiple save files sitting there with theme parks i was having fun making all inaccessible

the loading screen just gets stuck at 100 i even left it loading for a good hour  in the background with no luck

my computer is pretty good too no issues with running any games or crashes can run wow dragonflight on ultra high graphics comfortably as an example

do not purchase this game it is unplayable

#####

a shameful attempt to carelessly bank off the success of one of the pioneers in video games almost offensive

#####

do not waste your money on this please learn from my mistake wait for a planet coaster sale and get that instead 310 25 d bad game

#####

let me start off by saying if you want to play the true sequel of rct3 buy planet coaster early bird alpha edition this is just another park construction and management sim that got called rctw im not going to point out the reasons if you dont believe me patch your eye for 2 hours and try both games

straight to the point

the track editor works well with less than 5 minutes toying around you will be able to create smooth visualy fluid and funny rides

no transport rides no mini golf among others

there are some restrictions while placing scenary objects that sometimes can be a bit anoying

it is possible to make curved paths to do them visualy pleasant is not that easy

terraforming works like a charm

textures are not impresive for a 2016 game

peeps are not same we used to see in rct3 which is the most iconic part of the game

as expected in early access you will get some lag random freeze

there is a lot of work to be done and i hope the game improves over time but for now is not possible to enjoy it


my advice if you are a diehard rct fan please do you a favor and get planet coaster if you just like park sims in general you can also buy this one and cheaper than 50

                     edit 04092016 

im going to follow the changes coming to the game until its officially released ill change my review based on the final product

#####

going to be honest about this game when it first was announced i was excited bought it though had its issues i liked it then dlcs were planned never happened no bug fixes no nothingwhere are atari and what are they doing now  concentrating on destroying the franchise by making several variations for mobile devices

thank you atarithank you for ruining a once great franchise

#####

a lot of people have issues with details such as park management mediocre graphics horrible staff and peep ai etc

i fully agree with these but was able to look past this for me making freeform coasters was the absolute dream im a bit of a coaster freak and i finally had a chance to rebuild my favorite coasters around he world in my parks i could not have been more hopeful and after hours and hours of figuring out the finicky coaster building tool i finally created an exact replica of el toro at six flags so when it had an intensity rating of 217 ultraextreme and no peeps would ride it i was understandably disappointed my next few attempts produced similar results though they were all exact replicas or closely based off of many of the prominent coasters in the world today to put hours into this difficult process only to have the majority of my peeps not ride it and a massive pile of vomit in my exits is well not good

fine gameplay mechanics be damned i would do what i could do build an aethetically pleasing park incorporating realistic roller coasters i put even more hours and hours into this process only to have both the parks i built crash the game before being able to load all of my time lost

update after update promising updated coaster mechanics and improved realism and all we get is this bull i wish i hadnt played this so much already so i could get my money back a decadelong disappointment

#####

planet coaster is better rct world is just too buggy badly optimised and missing features planet coaster has the game is not optimized at all and lags once you make a large park even if you have good hardware
edit phrasing

#####

this game is a joke dont buy it buy planet coaster instead

#####

just another voice to add to the chorus of negative comments about this game  

i own all versions of roller coaster tycoon  i also own no limits 2 and planet coaster alpha so i have a pretty good vantage point for comparisons  i have no ties or loyalties to any of the dev shops making roller coaster builders  

i tried over and over to make rctw work for me  yes it does technically run but it is just a plain bad overall experience  even after waiting to allow more dev time before playing again i was sorely disappointed  this is an absolute waste of money

i know its been said many times already but planet coaster is where you should set your sites  i have no affiliation with frontier whatsoever but it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see they have their st together



#####

the game as it currently stands is not what was advertised during preorder and well into development it is unfinished and problematic with absolutely no indication that any issues will be addressed at all let alone in the near or distant future support regarding technical help goes unanswered and general communication at this point no longer exists the game as of now stands extremely flawed and dishonest but the lack of support and communication is enough to raise the red flag with more than just this specific product 




#####

im pretty sure i paid full price for this game when it first came out rather than fixing the game it would seem they just lowered the price and moved onto releasing the older better games take that for what its worth

#####

as someone who grew up playing tycoon games this is a disgrace

#####

i had very high hopes for this game like most people i grew up playing the rct series i have very wonderful memories about those games however this game did not really give me very good memories like i had as a child i bought this game back in june and it is now november what has changednot much this game is still very barebone and restrictive unlike planet coaster which i waited to buy till now why i actually hoped and believed the game would be better unfortunately it is not and still plays as if it is in an alpha or a beta path glitches very unsmooth gameplay when riding coasters the coasters feel fake and in the scenarios half the time i failed them because the special guest never found the dang restuarant or ride they wanted or thought it was too expensive im still going to play this game to compare how it is to planet coaster but i kinda have lost hope in this game as it still does not have water rides or transport rides at launch

#####

awful ive played rollercoaster tycoon for years and this is by far the worst regret buying it

#####

ughhhhhh i tried i truly tried to like this game it just isnt happening the coaster designer is either really buggy or incredibly hard to figure out the lack of content is appalling gone are the classic flat rides and thrill rides no go karts no log flume no bumper cars no mouse coaster no transport rides it is a glorified version of rct 4 mobile it is useless to try to build a park because it lags even the best machines the path system is rubbish the freeform placement is not that at all it a money grab do yourself a favor and go grab planet coaster and parkitect atari went all ea and murdered a classic game it is heartbreaking 210 dont click buy its a scam

#####

buyer beware this game is very unstable it keeps crashing every hour and lacks an auto save feature making all the progress you make in the game pointless the graphics are nice and building and managing the park is nice as well until the game crashes out of nowhere if atari fixes the crashing lagging and add an auto save feature me and many other people would be greatful until then i cant recommend this game

#####

hey atari i want my money back 
bought this piece of junk code back in 2016 and im still waiting for the patches that make this game playable
atari ruined the whole series with this just because they didnt manage to cooperate with the software studios poor nvizzio just was the last studio after several others before and atari failed to deliver properly good thing that your former partner frontier did it better
definitely my last game from atari

#####

i was honestly giving the game a chance ive played all the others and loved them i saw the reviews and thought it cant be that bad sure its not as good but it will probably still be enjoyable i shouldve listened to the reviews
first off it runs my cpu and gpu around 30 but for some reason i still have low frames and sometimes its freezes for a half second on an empty park lot
second placing stuff down can be a hassel because you want it one way that should work but the game dosent let you you have to select the align mode for it to let you do what you want but if placing down walkways gotta go back to grid mode so you can have straight roads
which leads to the third problem sometimes linking a pathway to the entrance of something will for some reason twist and glitch the path where you connect the two seperate paths
stick to the original 3 go with planet coaster all much better alternatives

#####

so here we are release day having been with rctw since day one i have seen the development process and its many ups and downs quite frankly its shocking that people are still here on release day playing it to see if anything has changed nothing has changed its still buggy its still lacking any personality and its still dreadfully bad 

shame on you atari you have killed the franchise

h1this game actually ruined a part of my childhoodh1

the first video game i ever played was rollercoaster tycoon 3 back when i wasnt even 4 years old this game is very important to me still today and has a special place in my gaming memories i remember wondering why none of my early coasters worked because it only had one station block or making a working coaster that crash onto the path and people i was an evil child then i remember when i got internet priveleges to explore the net freely and i downloaded mods into the game now lets fastforward to 2015 while looking for more minimods i found an article stating a new rct game was coming out soon i was so excited and i asked my dad if i could preorder the game i gave him the 50 bucks and then i had preordered the game but then i started noticing the quirks first i noticed they kept delaying the game they delayed the game for about six months i think but i cant really remember when the game finally came out it was okay but im sure i was just lying to myself im also sure the game also has some sort of rendering issue because it is very laggy even on computers with gtx 1080s and vega 64s all in all i just have two words dont buy

#####

i own both rctw and planet coaster and have spent about the same amount of time playing each one  planet coaster is by far the better game

i purchased rctw back in 2015 when it was going to be released in december  i played the beta and then i was sad

pc is better at the tycoon functions its path building is way better the graphics are better performance is better and peeps are better

about the only thing that rctw has that pc doesnt is that the ability to purchase more land

i guess the most important thing for me is that rctw feels like work not play  pc is fun i want to play it  i find myself dreading rctw and looking forward to pc  because of that i cant recommend rctw

#####

do not i repeat do not waste your money on this game  first time ive ever written a review on here but thats how disappointed i am by this game  it has some many glitches in it graphics are terrible possibly worse than roller coaster tycoon 3 which came out years ago and for a game is just not enjoyable  feel so conned by this though have now learned my lesson as the game is just not ready i guess hence early access which from a major developer is pretty shameless to still charge full price  this game will take months and months to fix do not spend your money on it i made that mistake and am now regretting not getting a lovely bottle of malbec which would have been so much more enjoyable  by the time they get this fixed planet coaster will be out and that already looks 1000x better  please save your money dont even think ah im sure hes wrong ill give it a go i repeat save your money 

#####

okay so its 1st of september and i thought that i will give this game a go again the last time i played the game about 6 months ago it was the most upsetting game ive ever played but because it was still in early access i could not really judge so i moved on and played planet coaster back to today and i can say that im still upset with this game im also angry at the developers to rob our money because they fooled us to buy this game because of its name rollercoaster tycoon 1 2 and 3 was really good games in their days i remember i was still a kid when i played rollercoaster tycoon 1 

what is wrong with rollercoaster tycoon world

well everything especially if you played planet coaster the list is too long to name it all 

all that i want to say is the following

1 im really angry that i bought the game and that the developers and studio stole our money
2 if you want a park sim game go buy planet coaster
3 i gave the game another go long after the game was released and its still a very bad game
4 still lots of bugs in this game
5 the developers does not even update or patch the game anymore the last update was in may 2017
6 planet coaster give us new content and updates on a monthly basis
7 even parkitech is a better game than this

i wish i could refund my money on this game i have lost all faith in the rollercoaster franchise and will never make the mistake again to buy a game from these developers

that is my story i hope i helped some people not to waste their hard earn cash on this junk

the developers are welcome to contact me and proof me wrong but trust me they will be too scared to contact me because they know they stole our money and delivered this poor game

#####

this is plagued with so many issues that i cannot recommend this game at all for the time being other reviews have stated in more detail why and what performance issues there are

this is just another case of an unfinished game brought out too early for early access regardless of its current state my msi afterburner shows in game as my gpu at 19  cpu at 10 and my ram at 12gb yet my fps was horrendus hovering around 9  13 fps with only a single tile filled and a second tile part filled i wouldnt mind if i had a low end system but running an i7 4790k  16gb 2400mhz ram  gtx980ti and installing the game on an samsung 850 evo ssdjust tells me this is poorly optimised with little progression since its release

ill be honest i made the mistake of thinking that frontier was behind this at first considering how i love rtc3 luckily i only paid 999 for this on the site that shall not be named so i can live with my mistake seeing how good rtc3 was and how good elite dangerous is i think this game is going to be abandoned in my steam library and ill happily pay 3x what i paid for this for frontiers upcoming rollercoaster development

sorry nvizzio studios this is a poor effort and shouldnt be on steam for the price it is

#####

bought this game in early access last year before i knew about planet coaster biggest mistake of my life not even at 362 is it worth it dont even waste your time or money even if it was free i still wouldnt play it

#####

time for an honest review 

normally i would not have recommended this game when it first released but over the past 2 weeks the game has been updated with bug fixes and optimization that has steadily improved the experience the fact is that this game has a solid base to build off of and that is what people need to take away from it i own both planet coaster and rctw both are hardly finished and both in my opinion have a positive future ahead of them also hats off to nvizzio for keeping in touch with the community and rolling out updates as quickly as they can with all of that said ill list my pro and cons

pros
coaster editormaker in this game is excellent sure its a bit finnicky sometimes but its damn good and can only get better i prefer it to the piece by piece editor in pc its one thing i hated about rct3 
decent variety of scenery to start and im sure this will be expanded upon
solid amount of flat ride content with a new one coming every 2 weeks in major patches yes i believe them they have stuck to that schedule so far
ill probably be crucified for this but after the latest updategraphics have improved markedly and id expect that to continue
the management aspect is there could be better but its decent for ea
terrain tools are easy to use and effective need an option for underground building though
there is more but ill leave it at that for now new update is scheduled to be rolled out tuesday or wednesday next week so ill edit this review at that time

cons
peeps need work animationstextureetc
optimization at this point is a bit shaky people across a wide array of system are getting mixed results once the park gets large it really starts to slow down apparently this is getting addressed in next patch ill update if that is the case
pathing is shoddy at the moment
ai behavior is pretty poor in the current build mechanics dont always fix rides janitors are slow etc
water quality sucks lol
cant change ingame graphics while in your park seriously guys
cant place scenery on elevated paths again really guys
coaster ratings need work every coaster i make is a vomit comet
general bugs and such

overall id recommend this based on the rate it is improving and the committment nvizzio has shown to the franchise id expect good things as time goes on

#####

i definitely would not recommend this game in its current state  so much needs work nearly everything  they talked so much hype for this game being the next generation coaster builder but its exactly the opposite

#####

you know a game is bad when every single one of its previous versions are miles and miles better

#####

like many others that have played the roller coaster tycoon series i was super excited when this game was announced and that excitement continued up until i was first able to play the early access version  i was not impressed then and im still not impressed today after converting to the full version of the game  had i known then what i know now i would have saved my money and bypassed this game

#####

please for sake of you sanity do not purchase game at any cost and that includes free it is bad really bad the mechanics stink it is buggy even after all this time glitchy if thats a word i can not say much more i truly regret purchasing it

#####

tried the game was initially very happy feels like the original games 

then it froze

and froze

and froze

i have a pc with 16gb ram 8gb gddr5 vram powerful cpu and republic of gamers motherboard getting the picture

#####

being a huge rct roller coaster tychoon fan i was excited when i originally saw this game being developed  i have watched it grow be modified revamped and finally finished  it is with a sad demeanor that now have to write such a butchering review of what could have been the best rct yet  

the most frustrating issue with this game is the lack of reliability and performance  varying from tenminutes of game play to just over onehour the game begins to stutter and eventually lock up  regardless of restarts reinstalls computer reboots or whatever fixes the forums suggest the games only consistancy is that it will lock up and cause you to restart  additionally once your park expands to approximately 500 attendees the game begins to show signs of reduced performance  the multiple forums state this is due to a number of factors but all those factors point at a poorly designed and rushedtorelease product just so the developing company could beat planet coaster to release  can you say greedy  i knew you could

performance being the primary and most detrimental factor i shall not continue to this review  if the game cant perform why review any further

i must recommend no one buy this game unlessuntil the developers repair the glaring performance issue this game issues forth

#####

if youre like me and cant find an alternative to planet coaster because you cant run it or for whatever reason do not make the same mistake i did and think you can live with a few bugs its not a few bugs its a million core code game breaking bugs holding hands and being sold for 1499 on steam its a lottery if it will start upload a game at all and after that its simply a matter of waiting for it to crash for no reason at all there is also absolutley no hope of improvment in the future as the dev team do not care one bit about its issues and refuse to fix anything as well as rufese to even post or reply to forum posts and help tickets do not waste any money time storage space or thoughts on this garbage fire atari and the rct franchise should be very ashamed of this affront to their community and fan base dont think youll be fine with it you wont

#####

ive read so much about this game especially compared to another i wasnt going to buy it but the price at the last steam sale was just too good to pass up to just try i paid 499 for the deluxe edition ive now played it for 2 hours and i feel  i have enough to compare it to rct 13 and the other current game if you pay  more than 499 for this youre being ripped off its not that great the graphics are meh the paths suck i have a hard time creating actual coasters in this game which is a problem ive not had in any of the other games the pathing actually  seems like a step back from rct 3 although easier to figure out than the other game at first fewer options to customize  including entrances and exits so my final  verdict is this  5 or less go ahead if you really want to but buy the other one or buy 3 or parkitect

#####

i read all the reviews the good and the bad and decided to give the game a chance anyway  i should have listened to the negative reviews and all  of the warnings  i didnt get through  an hour of game play i would give up and try again the next day and then the next   crash after crash after it loads 100 the game launches and i try to lay a path and suddenly the game freezes and crashes i have tried more than ten times to play since i purchased and it crashes every single time   i uninstalled and reinstalled and that didnt work  this is the only steam game that crashes on my computer  rct3 doesnt even crash on me  i am very disappointed and was looking forward to rtw despite the negative reviews  i gave up and i just put in for a refund  ill stick to the wonderful planet coaster which has never caused me an issue

#####

save your money go with planet coaster this game belongs in the trash sloppy controls rct3 looked much better compared to this avoid it

#####

they really sold this game on a name and did not deliver what they said they would i paid for the game when it was 50 bucks because of their promise to be amazing they had great videos and demos of how next gen this game would be it is absolute trash save your money and enjoy what you once place with the origianl three ignore the idea that this game will be something worth playing

#####

buy planet coaster

rct4 as been in development hell since rct3 came out a few years ago atari woke up and announced 2 rct games a pc version and a mobile game yes its bad

since then rct world has been around 3 dev studios before being released and it clearly shows the game looks nothing like the original trailers which makes me expect that atari forced the companies to start the game from scratch maybe each time

this game is a buggy slow loading bad performance mess the only reason it was released was because of frontier announcing planet coaster frontier who made rct2 dlc and rct3

the only interesting thing about this game is that it runs unity which makes the workshop support a little different because people can just give 3d models to the game and they turn into scenenery so you can have nearly anything

#####

bugs crashes freezes and no updates for 6 months when they say they will start working on the gama again

#####

edit i just played the finished game spare your money it is still not worth it the graphics is not that much better compared to rct3 and honestly the gameplay is worse i found the first bugs in my first 10 minuttes of playing 

in an early access is it too much to ask for a roadsystem that works it is almost unplayable i am disapointed i really am 
everything that i was hoping for is bad the graphic is not that good compared to rct3 the way things work is bad the way the people move laggs hopefully things will get better but for now this is just a really bad game nothing else

#####

this is not a game it is a complete disgrace it is as if they went out of theyre way to create something so unfathomably unfunctional and frustrating so as to cause the highest degree of anger in anyone who experiences it do not buy this

#####

grrr this game is so frustrating

i really wanted to look past all the negative publicity for this game and give the devs the benefit of the doubt but there are so many issues that ive noticed and ive only been playing for about an hour the controls for one thing are so unintuitive and ive been trying to tweak them for the last 20 minutes who defaults q for right and e for left rotate and i tend to frequently change game speeds so i always enjoy the 123 controls in most games except this game thats not the case and there is no way to assign keys to change from pause to speed 3 instead i keep having to tap on tab not a huge issue and i can look past that

placing scenery now it looked so simple in the trailer but when i attempt to place scenery it doesnt automatically lock onto the nearest snap location and instead makes me scroll through degrees of angle and direction until it finally finds a snap spot in cases that there are only two snap spots why not just snap one or the other why should i have to scroll through the rest when i cant place my items between anyways

when i attempt to place scenery it always seems to be defaulted backwards or upsidedown so 9 times out of 10 i have to move it around until it faces me wouldnt it be simpler just to have scenery face me first then let me move it around where i want

unlocking scenery and rides now fine its the developers decision to lock everything up and force you to play through the scenarios unless you play sandbox but i want to build a park and turn on research like all the other rct games before this one but i dont see the research option on here at all i enjoyed that aspect of the game and having rides unlock as im playing just adds more fun to the game in my opinion

placing scenery and objects i was trying to add objects to the path and for some reason it picked up a peep and threw him in a deep ravine so i went down looking for him and did not find him anywhere did he fall through the ground i was getting a warning message that an entity is under water so i tried to remove the water and he was nowhere to be found the warning went away though personally the message could have said peep is under water or help peep is drowning something funny like that i still cant explain how i was able to pick him up and throw him into the ravine while i was rotating an sign object that was clipping through the path and looked awful 

unfortunately this appears to be an unfinished game and for the price i think its too expensive right now there would need to be a major overhaul of the entire game engine to make this game somewhat intuitive and user friendly but at this time its just frustrating and hard to have fun with it

so at this time i cannot recommend this game in its current state

#####

get planet coaster instead this game is riddled with bugs lacks content and crashes every time i play it

#####

short
i dont recommend this game in its current state the developers has put in little effort into creating the rides and has done little research in their functionality if the game ever gets a major patch i will consider it

i do hope this game gets better as i really do want it to succeed but by this rate it wont ever come close




long detailed explaination of my latest experience i had that should give you an idea of what issues are at hand

yesterday i launched up the game for the first time in awhile and for the first time on my own steam account

for this i wanted it to be a twitch stream showing how the game is doing since the last time i touched it and if any improvments were made 

here is what i have found      no



so lets make a list of some of the major issues i came across here

1 major stutter problem

the first thing i noticed when i launched up this game was that there was a stutter in frames every 3060 seconds at first i thought this might just be a hardware issue so i turned down the game settings in hopes for a solution but none were found this appears to be a poor game optimization issue i cant remember if this issue was present during my last playthrough but regardless if it was present or not its here now and cant be fixed without a patch to my knowledge
for those wondering
gtx 970 i74790 16 gb ram
can run planet coaster at 60fps on max settings


2 crashes oh the infamous rctw crashes

while trying out the story mode to see what else there is in it i came across multiple crashing errors 
 crash on exiting the 2nd career map
 crash on loading the 3rd career map
 crash placing down water during the ravine map cant remember the number

so that hasnt been fixed and for those who keep saying that they have fixed it to people who are deciding on which game to purchase rctwpc please dont lie about it you know its there and you know that the new customer will find it


3 coaster elements oh coaster elements where are my coaster elements

the coaster elements in this game needs a complete overhaul
most of them are not even sahped properly and i was able to make better premade elements i made by hand with very little effort corkscrews have a uneven curve to it loops are poorly shaped and are worst than the loops on the coaster desert storm and the cobra roll is not even banked properly
also if you have a track slightly sloped up or down by like 1 degree the element you placed will be on that slope so sloped corkscrews

to add to this point
prebuilt coasters in this game are a joke
1 arrow coaster has a loop taller than the initial drop and the devs placed boosters instead of increasing the drop or decreasing the loop most of the coasters have a booster on it due to poor layout designs by the dev team


4 career mode is really a tutorial mode

so far in the career mode its been a tutorial with no true scenarios im at the point where i dont want to play any more but there is no true way to skip it so im stuck with sandbox an ability to skip the tutorial for experienced players of the genre would be great


now lets talk about minor issues that i would consider as personal preference

1 ui when selecting guests and items should not be following the object on screen this makes it very difficult to navigate i know you can toggle this by clicking the pin button but its so small and sometimes its the hardest thing in the world to hit

2 ligthing feels off feels a bit too bright during the day and night

3 coaster builder needs some work as sometimes its difficult to create certain shapes even the most basic i feel like this is why the premade coasters are poorly made as the builder didnt function well for example curved lifts

4 ride designs i dont like the pre seleted entrance and exit positions and how some of the rides animate for example the sling shot ride constantly spins while its operating which is very unrealistic


anyways thats my lastest experience with this game has gone
so now would i recommend this game
no
just go buy planet coaster

but wait
do i want to see rctw succeed
yes i do

i really want this game to be good but unfortunately its just not doing it the developers did not put in the effort into actually researching or developing this game i love the rct franchise and all games in the genre but this did not exceed my bar for the most basic tasks yes there are some aspects i like such as the parking lot in the distance but thats it

if the game gets better then great lets see what happens as of right now no


so for all people reading this
i love both planet coaster and the rct franchise so i want to see this game do well but if it wants my support then the devs needs to pull their socks up
i am also writing all this out so people sees the main flaws of this game and any personal prefence matches that will discourage them i am also writing this for new readers to see the issues that are indeed present that are posted by a user who wants both games to do well instead of a bias one 


so thats all ill post more soon when i play the game further which will be on twitch until then proceed in this game with caution and a fair warning

#####

nothing works it needs to be taken down but dont buy it

#####

do not be me i saw the name and was suckered into preordering this potato game i tried to enjoy it didnt happen they said they were going to fix the issues in future updates the game is not much different from when i first got it years ago i was just an idiot and played too many hours to get my 80 back goodbye money

now do be like me go buy planet coaster instead frontier didnt keep the rct name but they kept all the talent of being able to make a theme park game enjoyably playable  do some self care and purchase a game that runs better than this potato purchase planet coaster

#####

they lied period the things and the fun they promised they did not deliver all that public feedback went to waste as they never listend to anything the only good part about this game is their rollercoaster builder and the park lights thats it everything else is a complete and absolute mess even with all of their upgrades before full release the game is an absolute mess i bought this game in early access and i will never make that mistake ever again especially when it comes to atari games i feel like ive been manipulated and robbed and ive never felt that way before about a game they kept making all these grand promises even from last year this time when it was originally supposed to be fully released and still the game is a complete mess i wish i could honestly get my money back i should have gotten a refund when they went into early access but i believed their promises instead of the many people suggesting i should have gotten a refund i preordered the deluxe edition and thats a lot of money down the drain just to get something not even close to what was promised im really sad 

#####

this isnt what i wanted play planet coaster instead a billion times better and it achieves what rctw wanted but failed to do

#####

in my opinion it is a mess you should get

1 parkitect

2 planet coaster

#####

not recommended
i downloaded this game a few days ago i tried all the fixes but it still crashed mid game or wouldnt load at all
thanks goes to steam or refunding my purchase thumbs up guys
do not buy this game go with planet coaster instead

#####

i love this game but it seems to crash a lotwhich makes you not want to play

#####

ill try to make this short i really wanted this game to compete with planet coaster but it doesnt even come close at all dont waste your time and money on this farce of a game everything from the peeps rides paths and their overhyped piece by piece system theres always something wrong with it and dont believe the whole well its in early access so it has an excuse to be crappy well what atari doesnt want you to know is that they were planning to release this game at the end of 2015 claiming to only need to do some last minute polish so why the jump to early access after claiming that it was ready planet coaster

so what am i getting at here if your going to buy an indepth and deep simulated game with limitless creative possilbilities with the passion of its developers to back it up go get planet coaster roller coaster tycoon world is a basic soulless debacle that isnt worth sharing the name of chris sawyers masterpiece

#####

game crashes after 15 min before crash graphic card maxed out rtx3070ti some kind of memory leak still in 2023 that new support development team really is putting in a lot of effort not

#####

preorder regret simulator

#####

shitty game just buy planet coaster or the rest of the rollercoaster franchise

#####

you have the choice to buy the ferrari or the dacia they both cost the same 
well i took the dacia

#####

well 

even tho this game had negative reviews i bought it anyway 
just thinking maybe just maybe it would be ok 

but  crash hang freeze stutter
and thats before i get into the game even when i do its 
crash  hangfreezestutter 
dont matter where i set the graphics it runs like all over the place 20140 fps up and down 
the optimization is terrible 
this is an atari game 
im gna repeat that atari game what is going on 
anyway 
the park itself is pretty and the settings seem good 
some of the game mechanics are good some of the park building is good too 
and even the layout you can achieve is acceptable 
this this is not enough 
the building is cranked full of errors  
you cannot build paths and lanes in nice ordered ways the game inexplicably stops you randomly from joining a path 
then sometimes allows you to build over one 
then there is the people  more than a few feet away and they turn into statues with there arms sticking out 
i get that is for making the game run better but it is so visable 
and dont bother building a park that is of size or complexity the game 
will either crash out  freeze or run at wild 0120 fps for no reason 
you will need the pc from the future with 400 cpus and 40 graphics cards  

i wish i could say the developers are on this and there looking into the bugs 
but reading the disscussions page looks like there gone and abandoned this game 
this is an atari game i cant get over it being like this 
what are they doing 

and dont have deph of field on 
the game will be blurry and you cannot see anything at all even close up
i struggled for ages trying to work that out 
stupid and simple to fix but a game breaking thing 

so  right now  this game 
altho seems intersting and fun in the clips 
the game is buggy  annoying and feels very unfinished 
i have early access games that run better than this and this is a release 

if your reading this do not buy it  and if you thinking like i did 
and saying well maybe even tho the negative is bad i will try it out 
that is what i did so save yourself  

i would say add this too your follow list and see if the developers come back to the game 
and fix all the serious issues and there are way more than i have said about 

my gutted rating is 110   getting 1 because you can pick people up and throw them ingame 

and my final word gutted 

#####

the biggest dissappointment of 2016 hands down  even worse than no mans sky  aside from the mild update in the graphics this game has nothing to offer that rollercoaster tycoon 3 doesnt in fact it has less  

first off game performance is not great  i will says its better than when it started off in early release but still even on my 1070 i get some stuttering when panning around the map

secondly the one thing i loved about all of the rct games was park management this version however has next to no park management  sure you can do some things but not nearly to the level of detail or variety that you could in previous versions

thirdly you cant customize anything  in all previous rct games you could customize your stalls rides etc  nope not here in this game what you see is what you get no more  you cant change the colors of the rides the lights on the rides  you cant choose the color of the ballons that your balloon stalls sell you can choose the types of foods your stalls sell or what goes on your foods none of that is here


there isnt alot of content here either the previous games had a ton of content but again not with this one  this version of rct is but a pale reflection of what the original games were  it seems to me that they went the extra mile to produce a watered down pale reflection of what the previous games were  i cant imagine what would make a company look at the success of its predecessors and say nah we dont need that  

bottom line is if youve never played rct in any other form than you might like this game  but if your like me and were expecting a better and greater version of a legendary franchise than your better off looking else where this game aint got it   crappy launch combined with the shady way they marketed this game and even put out retail copies of the game while it was in prerelease is enough to make me swear off atari and any further iterations of this game forever  rct died with this game rip rct

#####

i loved the older rollercoaster games and i really dislike this one the game is broken it crashes and the mechanics and graphics look like 2007 all over again can i please just get my money back

#####

rating  25

rollercoaster tycoon world recently caught my attention but unfortunately my experience with this game has not lived up to my expectations as someone who has spent hours enjoying the previous rollercoaster tycoon games its disheartening to encounter a game that consistently crashes and fails to deliver the same level of enjoyment

having played and cherished the earlier titles in the rollercoaster tycoon series i had high hopes for rollercoaster tycoon world however the constant crashing and technical issues have severely hindered my ability to fully immerse myself in the game its frustrating to invest time and effort into building and managing a theme park only to be interrupted by crashes that disrupt the flow of gameplay

furthermore despite rollercoaster tycoon world being released for a number of years now i still hold out hope for an update that will address these issues and bring the game up to the standard it requires the game demands specific system requirements and as a player i have endeavored to meet those requirements only to be met with disappointment due to the ongoing technical problems

i understand that game development can be challenging but as a loyal fan of the franchise i expected rollercoaster tycoon world to provide a stable and polished experience its disheartening to see a game with such potential fall short due to technical shortcomings

i genuinely hope that the developers recognize the concerns of players like myself and take the necessary steps to address these issues promptly as someone who has enjoyed countless hours of amusement from the previous rollercoaster tycoon games i eagerly anticipate an update that will allow me to fully enjoy the game as it was intended

#####

just get planet coaster

#####

if you review this as positive you are delusional i bought this right around the same time planet coaster came out my what a difference this game added nothing new from rct3 and actually felt like it was incomplete not to mention when released pathing was soooo bad and i mean placement of pathing i would like my money back and the time i spent back on it i originally was going to get it for my daughter but told her no after trying it for myself she loved rtc3 i cant name a positive for this game not a  one it was just that bad

#####

heres the thing i paid full game money and got a prealpha build i expect more from atari this is why you see everyone everywhere saying not to preorder games reminds me of when the new sim city launched now maxis is dead i get that were on the 3rd dev now but this is insane

dont buy this game it is not worth 50

first off the graphics are subpar at best and even on low settings the frame rate is awful there are terrible issues with building scale little food stands being as big as full rides for starters there is barely enough content to make a themed section of a park

i basically used up all the rides in 2 zones you get 9 zones wtf am i supposed to do with the rest of the zones make my own coaster with 20 fps and a terrible coaster builder the coaster builder sucks it is not intuitive it doesnt let you add special tracks easily you cant make the kind of coasters you want i was trying to make a simple six flags superman style ride cant do it rct3 could do it how does a full version of the game not have at the very bare minimum what the last version had rct3 came out in 04 and you want me to believe you cant have all that stuff added into a new game in 16 if they had just taken rct3 and put it into a new engine so it looked better and ran smoother id be more happy than i am with wasting the money i did on this garbage

pathing is awful there is a lot of really weird snapping and even using the grid its hard to make straight lines curved paths almost seem easier which doesnt make sense

the delete tool is garbage and oh whats that you want to play one of the scenarios cool have fun trying to place rides anywhere if there are trees or tiny little bushes you cant plop stuff down you first have to use the godawful delete or move tools to get rid of the plants one by freaking one you would think you could just right click and the game would know you want to delete that stupid bush but apparently thats too much to ask for

the list goes on and on you cant get your staff to do what youre paying them to do there is literally no guidance for how to please people or how to keep them from puking after every damn ride even the giant slide the economy is dumb

dont buy this game odds are atari is going to pull the plug on it rather than give it dev time it needs you would literally be better off taking 50 and and burning it for the few moments of heat it provided you


#####

my 5 hours are idle master for the trading cards

ive never made it past the loading screen as it crashes

#####

trash performance with an 960 4gb i5 4440 and 8gb of ram i have games with better graphics quality that run at 4x the frame rate not to mention the game itself is terrible if you like the look of this game either get rollercoaster tycoon 3 or planet coaster

#####

after reading so many negative reviews i thought stop your bitching there must be something good about the game 

and there is building a coaster works great the freeform mode enables you to go loose on your wildest imaginations after building an awesome wooden coaster i was satisfied with i thought it would be time to form the scenery 
so after going to the scenery and clicking on a rock hey wait where is my rock wait is anything still happ no game crashed because you clicked on a rock

does a scenario like this bother you no great
do you like a very pixellike ground to refreshen your nostalgic feelings of rct 3 no perfect
you want to have a futuristic park where earth has been invaded by robots and have humanlike robots in your park well look no further this game has it all

im sorry for being so sarcastic honestly i went into the game with a positive vibe but this game just is not going to do it for me im also sorry for comparing the game to planet coaster as everyone is doing but once you play this game you know why everyone is falling back on planet coaster the alpha already looks incredible and their scenery building options already surpass rctw please save your money it is a waste of money

#####

theres a lot of arguing going on right now but the fact that almost every negative review has the words planet coaster in them is worrying im going to try my absolute hardest to give a review on the game without resorting to comparisons any point of interest i place an asterisk  at the end of is possibly subject to change and reflects the march 30th launch only

the good
coaster builder  very useful and wellmade the color safety guide is also very helpful for setting up your coaster in advance as well so that you can know what does and does not work
area themes  adds an interesting way for scenery variation to effect certain areas also contains variations of each building as well
steamworks support  modding adds unlimited potential in every game
terrain editing  excellent terrain manipulation tool not really much else to say without adding pointless padding

the okay
paths  we finally have curved paths along with several variations only problem is that it can occasionally get wonky with terrain collision or pathing intersection no curved queue lines sadly
scenery selection  decent amount of stock scenery with the base game however certain themes such as scifi are lacking in options modding could fix
difficulty  this is bad for me but some people prefer it easy im a veteran of rct and rct2 so i prefer biting my nails when it comes to funding however just building a small portion of the park and working on a coaster can set you for a good while in terms of funds

the bad
fences  fences are badly implemented can only place them one at a time and at angled intervals hopeful they will add line tools or at least an option to place along paths
staff  staff control is basically minimal at this point place the building down select how many you want hired and hope they do their job let alone efficiently
performance  there are certain options to minimize graphical load in exchange for increased performance however certain tools will bring your frame rate to a crawl under certain circumstances ex path tool works fine unless its clipped to an existing path in which case my frame rate drops by at least half
graphics  not great to say the least but they could be much worse i dont really come in to unity games with high expectations though

overall its not as amazing as rct1 and rct2 obviously but i do like it more than rct3 which i never really transitioned into on launch its a 610 for me im curious to see where the future updates will bring this though as i really do see potential

#####

it crash it keep crashing fix this shit atari 

safe your money and buy planet coaster

#####

this game was great until it locked up and i havent been able to play it since  i attempt to start the game every now and then and it never starts

i paid 4999 for this game and only got to play it for a short time  do not waste your money on this game

there is no way to contact the vendor and steam said they can not do anything about it and that i need to contact the vendor  stuck

dont buy this game

dont buy this game

dont buy this game


#####

do not buy this game its an absolute pile of trash save your money and buy plant coaster i do not know how i played for 8 hours

#####

it has been some time since the release of rctw early access and i feel the game has reached a level where a review is warranted there have been many negative reviews and i can see the frustrations that led many to leave such but a lot of those seem to have dismissed the game after a few moments of play not giving the game a chance to show off its potential

and in early access potential is what we want to consider the foundation that rctw has laid is such that it may very well grow into that potentail we can glimpse should ugc become full and each day we see more pieces added should piece by piece building with the ugc be solved and each update we see that happening then the foundation could lead to overwhelming success

at present for those who are creative the park builders i would say the game has enough that you can find many hours of contentment playing it for those who are problem solvers and want to play scenarios we are not quite there yet with needing ai to balance better with the scenarios to be tweaked better 

but for the 50 price it is closer each to day to be the successor to rct3 at present the trajectory that it is on may never get us to being equal or better than rct3 but perhaps one rung below it though should more coaster types more rides more more more be released then it might even surpass rct3 for at present the graphics are better should the gameplay expand ugc be optimized and the others items that we can see the potential to better happen then yes we shall have a game

#####

really wish i would have read the reviews before buying this online never had a problem with the rollercoaster tycoon  games so i assumed this one would be good but i cant even play the game i payed for just crashes everytime i try to play 

#####

its not good but i really wish it was considering the other releases the initial view was very exciting and hopeful i spent 60 before it was released and was met with something understandably bad then two years go by and nothing improved poor optimization impossibly low framerates broken path system ai without a brain a terrible ui all for 60

the game is now 15 i hate being negative about something people must have put tons of work into but clearly someone somewhere was not doing their job

#####

i play rct since the first one that i almost threw away from a cereal box thinking it was an aol disc but no it was the first rct game this is not a joke the first game came in a cereal box

played the 3rd one like a maniac bought it on mac appstore steam discs i have almost every port of the game

fast forward to today i decided to play a little of this monstrosity by a little i mean 3 hours because i played 2 when the game was released

the game is machine translated to my language one of the thousands of examples in the graphics options screen the shadows setting hard and soft was translated to rugged and sweet candy

when the peeps go to a ride they disappear before sitting down is it so hard to make a sitting animation

the peeps ai is somewhat between a potato and an earthworm if you put a new ride they will stop everything theyre doing and queue for the new attraction

peeps want to pee but stay in the front of the bathroom stalls holding their crotch

move the camera far away and look at distant peeps they will be teleporting while tposing

sometimes the game struggles to run and turn into a powerpoint slideshow like the ones your aunt mass mail to the entire family every sunday morning with low res red flowers and gifs with the classic gray cat it happens with no apparent reason

this piece of coding art crashes a lot again without any reason select the coaster cam by mistake and press the escape key hello darkness my old friend

ungodly lack of care about the franchises faithful fans new players and anyone unfortunate to pay for this i mailed support thrice since 20170630 about the same gamebreaking issue and how to reproduce it logged in today redownloaded and guess what still broke

the feeling of the 90s shovelware cheapness everything you wanna do you cant because it isnt here or if you find what you want the game crashes or simply refuses to do what you want try to put two stalls front to front


i can write here for a day play the game a little more to point more on a list named 50 reasons why watching your trousers spin on the dryer are better than rctworld but its better to watch my trousers spin on the dryer
im glad i didnt found it on my cereal id exchange the disc for an aol one in two seconds and i would never eat fruit loops again

#####

game is pretty buggy despite having been around for a while  transport water and pool rides are removed and despite running on high end hardware the game struggles frequently to putter along  i wish i could get a refund

#####

honestly the game really isnt that bad some parts of the game dont work like coaster building when youre trying to twist and delete parts of your coaster and path building is awkward because certain pieces like slopes have to be above a certain incline but these issues are largely dismissable what cant be ignored is the game crashing if the devs would just fix the game from crashing this game would be a great value at 5 or even 15 i just hope they read this and fix this i really want to play this game but the crashing is putting me off

#####

game is unstable and crashes randomly i have and intel i7 with 32gig of ddr4 ram 1080ti video this is a good gaming computer and definately able to run this game if it was stable

#####

the game is very difficult to get adjusted too and theres a lot of issues walking animations path ways etc i dont recommend buying until the full version is out

#####

despite all of the negative reviews this game really isnt that terrible although there are some annoying bugs and some funky features none of them are really game destroying theres been a lot of hate about things not snapping correctly or things not snapping at all and although it is a bit annoying theres really easy ways to work around it people have been commenting about the graphics as well too and although they arent top notch they are pretty good and much better than rct3 

so yes it is buggy it still has many problems but in reality none of these are truely game destroying bugs me and my girlfriend think this game is absolutely amazing and look forward to playing another 6 hours tomorrow lets just hope for some basic fixes too and im sure this game will pull through just like the others did 

#####

im going back to rct3

#####

yes its not a complete game
yes they published as complete
yes a lot is still missing

but in the end they update it from time to time and it is getting better and better more features getting added and overall you can have fun in the game right now if you like the sandbox mode

just remember  right now its early access keep that in mind if you want to buy it

#####

scam buy planet coaster or parkitect

#####

do not waste your money
i was the first on the band wagon the frist day it was available i purchased this game over 8 month before the pre releasei kept following waiting for the game to be released as optimistic as possilble i absolutely love the other rct games 12  yes even 3 but this game is a total disaster it takes way to much effort to build anything in this game the previous games were set up for you to build manage and watch your park grow 
if you want build something here is the scenariofirst you find where you want to position your item holding shift and scrolline your mouse to rotate the item very time consumingthen back out and go to destruction mode and delete treesif the trees are in a field then you can use the mass delete but if they are close to a path you must individaully click on each itemi scream everytime then go back to the buidling menu find your item againreposition it where is was originally place the item 
then go to build a pathbecause its not grid based building paths are an extreme pain not exagerating i really want to know the thought process given to changing the way paths are built it is because of this that i have hated this game from day 1 it is just way to challenging to waste buildin paths i did not purchase a 60 game to struggle with building sidewalks all day and yet that what i have done in this game

next major issue is moving around in the game you must use wqesdzx to move in the game or take you hand off the mouse and use the keyboard arrows in order to change your angle holding control and moving the mouse all this is way to time wasting in previous editions a simple right click and moving mouse worked perfectly and would do the same here but this game is not about simplicity i promise you that

the final straw for me
today i clicked on a janitor to follow him around for a few secondsbut then couldnt stop following himno matter what button i clicked or key i pressed i was locked into following the janitor i had to save and quit the game then relaunch the game to go back and continue playing this shows that after 3 years of building a game there are still major flaws that just make the game suck not to mention that after 3 years i still dont have a full game

rct world took the fun out of managing a theme park and instead just gives you something to struggle and get frustrated with nothing in this game is simple everything is very complex confusing and boring sorry rct i will continue to play previous rct games but this one is out you failed majorly

#####

this game is the definition of the word scam
you pay 50 for a game that supposed to be working and supposed to have a postgame support

the game does not work properly in fact beta games work better than this
and the support oh my i have no words to describe that
and you gonna love the community forum as they delete and ban all criticism especially if being compared with other games in similar categories

i want my money back you useless atari

#####

batari should never again attempt to create a theme park gameb 

i played all rollercoaster tycoon games 123 however this game is not worth the tittle rollercoaster tycoon the thing is atari hired developers that didnt had any clue how to build a theme park game and to make it even worse the development was taken over multipile times throughout the years the budget was way to low in order to develop this game while atari has the right to use this name the original developers from rct 1 trough 3 are not involved into development this is something you will notice right away

cons

 performance drops significant while park gets bigger big parks are not possible
 community forums are dead there is no more support trough the official forums
 promised updates like water rides where never included
 highly likely they will bring out dlcs without any support
 community feedback is ignored throughout development
 linux support cancelled
 all support and effort is going to mobile versions of rct

pros

 coaster building system is quite advanced
 steam workshop

info

rollercoaster tycoon world had so much potential all of the base pieces are here but we will never get them i dont recommend buying a game without a active community and or development team i would suggest you to do some research first before deciding to buy this game all there effort and developing is going to rollercoaster tycoon touch for ios and android and yes its just a other mobile scamming game with micro transactions

#####

really disappointed id rather have spent my money on planet coaster

#####

this game is beyond awful this game crushed my hopes and dreams for a theme park game with tycoon in the name planet coaster is where i will be spending my future money tycoon world lied about the gameplay its not at all as intuitive as the trailers or gameplay had shown i was roped into buying the deluxe edition which came with all prior tycoon games i played the world beta it was awful then played it again a few months later after it was delayed i thought they would have fixed the issues such as pathing placement and coasters always flying off the track touchy little buggers nope i attempted to get my money back but was denied since i played the old tycoon games more than 4 hours what a rip off 

i have no faith in tycoon world or the developers i feel cheated and lied to just awful so sad

#####

as a die hard fan of the rollercoaster tycoon series i was extremely excited to try out the latest installment in the series i avoided the reviews and lets plays on youtube purposely so that i could judge the game by its merits alone 

that being said there is unfortunately a lot wrong with the game 

the path system is a disaster and half the time it refuses to let me place paths in places that are unobstructed 

the peeps are completely lifeless while they are on rides and you can watch them cycle through various terrifying facial expressions while remaining dead silent the entire time its honestly only a bad soundtrack away from being a horror movie 

perhaps this is just a glitch on my end but half the time buildings and rides dont actually show you whether or not they are closed which led me to accidentally forget to open half the stuff in my park oops 

i also noticed that the days seemed shorter like almost ridiculously short i feel like they could be slightly longer in order to see my park at night i have to lock the time set to night time or else youd miss it if you looked away for two seconds 

there are so many little things that could be fine tuned that would make this such a great game i want to like this game so bad because a huge chunk of my childhood was spent playing both rct2 and rct3 rctw is just not holding up compared to even rct3 

im hoping the developers really are serious about improving the game because it has so much potential until then i cannot recommend it

#####

full of game breaking bugs dont get it

#####

worst game ever waste of my money and time planet coaster is a  thousand times better

#####

i bought and launched it only to check if its as bad as people are saying

it is that bad

buy planet coaster instead this is not worth even 6 that i spent on this maybe if it was 3 years more in development then we had at least a few reasons to play this but currently it brings nothing but pain and anger

310

#####

terrible game 
waste of money 
bring on planet coaster already played the alpha stages and its already better to play  
this game feels like its years old to begin with

#####

i brought this game when it first came out in early access i got this as a reward for learning my time tables off by heart and i was so excited for when it would come out but when it finished downloading i thought that it was trash the first advert look nothing like the actual game the game took forever to load and to put the cherry on the cake it was rush that ment that the game just did not work and it was a complete wast of 30 just to buy this and guess what it didnt get better it just got worse my dad only gives us a gift if we learn our times tables once and my gift was a wast of monny i think atari should just do old games because that is what they are good at i think if i where you you should buy the amazzing game planet coaster which i have done a possitive review on it and it was not rushed

#####

i remember begging my dad to buy me this when it first came out because i was obsessed with rct 3 and played rct 2 when i was very young im pretty sure i payed full retail price at around 40

i couldnt even play it because of the framerate id have to close everything on my computer to get a steady 15 frames per second i played for about 20 minutes before i got bored and closed it

i tried to play it again in 2018 and i dont think anything had changed i was able to play it because i had a better computer but jesus it was still bad frame drops every few seconds and all i remember was that the game was so utterly boring that i just closed it again after an hour tried a few times to play it but its still bad dont buy this its an insult to rct

#####

i just bought planet coaster yesterday and have been playing non stop it was amazing so i decided to come back to see if the new updates would be comparable to planet coaster only to find not only is it inferior but also the price of rctw is only 4 now wtf i paid 60 back then during early access what a shit waste of money this game was literrally a waste of money

#####

waited 5 years to play this 3 years of waiting for the release and 2 years of not being able to play it due to it not working on any computer i try it on then i finally got to play it and all that 5 years was for playing crap that tries to keep up with society

#####

tons of bugs it lags it stutters broken gameplay memory leaks crashes data loss and the lack of promised content make this game a piece of total garbage

#####

dont buy this

yes i know its early access but it feels like an alpha

im running on a gtx 970 and i7 3770k and the game is horribly optimised the highest graphics settings look only a small upgrade from rct3 the coaster builder is overly complicated and its almost impossible to get a smooth track flow not to mention that inversions are near impossible to do well the game crashed when i tried to delete half of a coaster id wait to see what future updates bring before even thinking about buying

#####

in its current state rctw is a complete flop  there ive said it i am keeping in mind that this is an alpha however it is stil just as dissapointing to me when you look at roller coaster tycoon you recognize a franchise that is well known for being composed of quality games well im sad to say that after rct4  mobile and the alpha of rctw that this may now be a false statement as a lifelong fan of this game ive been playing it since the original and since i was old enough to understand how to play video games i am remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of this game i see its potential and the ability of the community to greatly improve each others experiences through the vast network of custom scenery objects now available on the steam workshop

in its current state id rate the game no higher than a 510 and heres why

 the coaster builder is very clunky occasionally it becomes impossible to continue building as you need to use the presets to place a piece before you can freeform it this causes issues when your piece wants to dive underground yet you wish to freeform it and keep it above ground

 staff buildings now some will say this really isnt an issue and i agree to an extent however by making staff members simply components of the building we place we lose our abilities to both customize them and set specific routes for them two things that were nice about rctws predecessors i do like the idea of the staff buildings and it adds a little more realism however for it to work for me the same level of customizability present in its predecessors must also be available

 fps drops now i have a top of the line computer one capable of running fallout 4 on near maximum graphics settings so running rctw shouldnt be a problem for my computer at all unfortunately the reality is that im plagued by random fps drops and input lag at least 70 of the time i spend on this game the worst part is that it happens in almost entirely empty parks  atari you really need to work on this

 lack of flat rides i understand that this is an early release alpha if you will however it would be nice to have some more generic flat rides that arent soo heavily themed perhaps an option to toggle what the rides theme is im not sure if anything will be done about this but if youre going for one specific theme your options are quite limited

 scenery placement all of the previous games had this issue as well planet coaster is the only one ive seen that has done this right soo far id love to see scenery that we can place anywhere so that we can properly theme ridesareas what is the point of having a giant tree with a hole that looks as though you could run something through it if you cant put anything through it

 lastly id like to say that i feel this game should be much farther along than it currently is no i do not know anything about video game developement and yes i know there were three developers working on this game nvizzio if youre reading this please take what ive said and will continue to say as constructive criticism i love the rct series and i want to see this become a aaa title but right now i see a game that is waiting to die upon release rctw was originally announced to release in early 2015 it is now early 2016 and we only have an early access slow and steady wins the race and making a quality project is 100 always better than rushing out unfinished garbage however i feel a year of delays for this game is enough nvizzio atari this is crunch time the community will not continue to stand for delays youre already losing your fanbase to planet coaster im not saying rush a finished project im saying make sure you do this right in a timely fashion the fan uproar that you see now and the fanbases lack of faith in you is only the beginning if you really mess this one up

to conclude i would not recommend this game to anyone not until some serious work is done i will continue to mess around with it but i really doubt i will play this anywhere close to as much as i played the past three if you want your moneys worth now id buy planet coaster or parkitect although honestly who knows i have faith in the team at nvizzio that they truely want to deliver a aaa title for us fans and im willing to ride the storm out and see where they take us

#####

after countless hours on the predecessors i figured i would try this one out despite the bad reviews unfortunately the reviews on here of this game are right it is awful it literally crashed 8 times in one hour no matter what the settings were at it just crashes constantly because of that i got a refund the first time ive ever done that

  the game is just completely literally unplayable

#####

i have played all of the rct series i enjoyed them all but i like rct 1 our of the lot the best

rctw for me is quite a disappointment from a technical stand point

firstly the graphics are weak let down by poor quality textures the world feels like it has no charm as the world lighting appears washed out

building experience is more prefabricated than the original you cant choose where to place entrances and exits but at least you can free rotate to any angle

building paths is clunky and has annoying link snap points its not true free form construction i have not found it possible to place shops how i want at path edges and construct a plaza style area they have to have short paths leading to them
while you can do curved paths you annoyingly cant do curved queues

the coaster spline tool is quite good however the tools feeding back intensity nausea and excitement data are very frustrating to work with you have to open the ride and let it run to get the info then close it again and make your adjustments rather than being able to get the data from a test run

overall there a quite a few minor annoyances with this game that are just about enough to ruin the experience

#####

this game is horrible dont buy it get planet coaster instead

#####

i grew up with rct series and rollercoaster tycoon world is pure shit bad gameplay bad fps game crashes every 20 minutes i had to delete all files and reinstall it like 4 times 

very very bad

im going to planet coaster

#####

dont listen to anyone who says this shitpile has redeeming features

it doesnt

play rct 1 2 or 3 parkitect or planet coaster dont give these morons your money even if its only going for a few bucks

#####

i was on board with this game since early alpha and dear god was it a mess and i checked back every few months to see how they improved it   there were little improvements here and there but it was like a kid failing with low f and who keeps turning in extra credit to improve his grade  it helps but still not great 

now official release comes around and now its like a bland relationship thats noones fault its sparkless so you just keep saying ill just stick it out for a little longer maybe things will get better right its not bad just i dont know if im happy here things never get better they never get worst they coast along content but not really enjoying yourself

tldr this is the most adequate of all mediocre average experiences that ever made someone vaguely complacent

#####

just dont

#####

dont waste your money this game is just bad in every way everything is buggy the options are limited a choice of three world types limited coaster designs limited flat rides and limited stalls one really stupid thing about this game is the lack of control when placing staff buildings you dont really have control over any of them like you could in rct3 if youre a big rct fan and looking for rct4 dont get this game it isnt even in the same league as rct3 just go and preorder planet coaster made by the same people as rct3 just look at some of the youtube videos from the early alpha its miles ahead of this game and its 10 cheaper just dont waste your money on this game

#####

purchased dispite the bad reviews easy to use once you get used to the controls and edge scrolling is on turned off by defult which is annoying not as buggy as i was expecting it to be but have run into the odd bug which is expected with an early access game still a work in progress but happy with my purchase 

#####

this game has more bugs than 3 years ago it released the most terrible game i have ever experienced after release they invested in making 30 campaign missions  instead of fixing the 10000 bugs the game has dont expect it to be playable run far away and if you can hurt the developers  publishers with any chance you get

#####

horrible game
1 no autosave
2 constant bugs 
in my experience i made a coaster opened it it needed repair after a while okay got a mechanic no longer says its broken as it was fixed no one rides the ride after this point
so i try to delete a path
game crashes
do not buy this game if you

dislike losing your save file

dislike bugs removing your hard work

dislike bad game design

buy this game if

its from a pack of games on sale for 66 or higher or  you love horrid games

010

#####

i own both planet coaster and rctw and i wouldnt buy rctw again 
if your looking for the next gen of rct3 we all loved planet coaster is it 
games look like they are years apart graphics wise and game play

#####

save your money on this luckily i bought it for less then 10 bucks not the rct we all grew up with

#####

this game has single handedly ruined any chance of the franchise contining 

dreadful gameplay tons of bugs and glitches all they had to do was deliver a modernised version of rct3 but they failed on epic proportions 

if youre wanting an epic theme park builder try planetcoaster if youre wanting to relive youre youth with rct redownload rct 12 or 3 this game is dreadful

#####

preordered rctw deluxe edition without getting a complete game dev took the money and ran

really wanted to like the game and hoped for usefull updates to come thay never came

#####

its got the same similar visuals from rct3p which was the best game of my childhood with easily over 1000 unrecorded hours but this really doesnt live up to its predecessors planet coaster is much more worthy of the title of a spiritual successor especially seeing as it was built and published by the old dev team from rtc3p frontier
rctw may have more coloured trees but the overall quality of this is honestly poor
dont waste your money on rctw go and buy planet coaster instead nvizzio have done quite a bad job at living up to frontiers high old standard that was rct3 and from memory of when i tried it at launch it doesnt come close to reaching halfway to it

#####

this game is nonfunctional i cant even begin to look at its merits because it crashes nearly constantly windows 10 8700k 2070 super nothing fancy but more than enough to play a game like this the game ctds so often that it will hiccup for but a moment and i already concede that i lost everything since my last save i really hope i got this game in a humble bundle or something because i dont want to take direct responsibility for giving someone money for this game

#####

i cant even enjoy this because it constantly crashes mid game might as well try planet coaster

#####

wanted to like it tried to give it a chance poor lagging menus making interaction frustrating multiple crashes  just not up to standards of the older games  and whilst ive not played it to compare planet coaster sounds much more polished

#####

im gonna recommend this game for the following reasons 
 
 the game is in beta stage and theyve made beta testing mainly to fix bugs and find main issues on the way however after ive seen this beta so far theres still alot theyll need to improve but the tools you do have are excellent compared to other coasters 

 its like cities skylines of roller coaster games mainly because the community is huge for this game and steam workshop a lot of people fear that theres only 10 coasters dont worry just wait 13 months and youll have pretty much every coaster in the world to play around with not only can you share what youve made but also most likely see legendary coasters ingame but for every coaster i guess theyll look on highway systems from cities skylines for an example where you could pick different interchanges from the community in this game under speciality youll most likely find extreme versions of loops corkscrews and etc 

 even though the game is pretty good so far as i said earlier theres a lot of features theyll need to add its almost impossible to make something 100 straight and i will go cry in a corner if they dont add such a feature because thats mainly one of the few things youll need 

so after this review i would say the game got a bright future but it takes some time to get used to i really wanted a tutorial in the beta just to know how the mechanics work its nice to being able to tweak everything on your coaster but they should add classic mode coaster building from the older games all in all if it was up to me i would give it 710 for now but its only in beta and hopefully it will only improve from full release 10th dec but lets see how the next beta goes and if the game actually improved or theyll need to push the release date a few months

#####

i bought this game over a year ago and remained optimistic throughout the beta and early access cycle even while the final version was downloading i was hoping atari would pull the rabbit out of the hat that optimism was immediately shattered when i was greeted with a black screen on launch luckily i was able to find the problematic files and delete them 

yes my reason for this is mostly over that one bug which apparently affects only people who installed the game while it was still in early access but its not the fact that the bug exists and prevented game play but the handling of it by the atari and nvizzio 

when i found out i was unable to play i immediately took to the community page and found the post saying the release was out accompanied with instructions on deleting a file if you have problems that didnt work instead it took me deleting the entire folder then i watched as developers and producers spent the day telling people to delete files in hidden folders and edit the registry these are things even microsoft advises against especially editing the registry

we are talking about a bug that could easily be remedied with a dozen lines or so of code and a hot fix instead the developers opted to have users jump through hoops access parts of their system that shouldnt be accessed by the average user and risk doing irreparable harm to their operating system this is one of the biggest failures in not only public relations but also custom service i have ever witnessed i have been doing development for 30 years and the past 15 years has been as the owner of my own company if i ever even dreamed of taking this approach to a failure on my part i would expect to close the doors the next day and rightfully so 

the latest release in the series i have loved for years has been fatally plagued by this decision from the publisher and developers i was hopeful for improvements and expansions to rctw but after the lack of response over yesterdays problems its painfully obvious that we most likely wont see these when they wont even fix a bug that was known at release and causing a pr nightmare shame on atari and shame on nvizzio

#####

using a broken game with a beloved title to rob you of your money
ill be playing rct2 bye

extremely disappointed in this game but hoping it will improve by the time release date comes around the rides and shops available are extremely limited compared to the older gamesno transport rides like monorail train elevator etc as in tycoon 12 and 3 terrain editing is not as flexible as it used to be either and theyve taken away the undo button which is also extremely annoying especially when it comes to terrain editing not as many different textures available for the terrain either dont waste your money with the early access wait until the final game comes out if you are really feeling optimistic good thing i at least got it for less through an employer discount but still a waste of 20

#####

the game might be a lot of fun if it wouldnt crash constantly it is impossible to get anything done this way do not buy this game

#####

i did not touch the game for a full year and nothing has changed since this is not the professionnal roller coaster tycoon team we had in the past it is a team people who do not know how to properly manage their time and think more about switching the teams around frontier was great in the past why switch we see the success of planet coaster now

i do not suggest anyone to buy this game if you want something in the style of roller coaster tycoon 3 go for planet coaster frontier remained as amazing as they were in making roller coaster games

#####

cant understand the negative players so had to review the very limited beta i think the spline based rollercoaster construction system is superb just bit challenging which makes it fun you can use grid to make straight pieces seems like the players are the one how are lacking

h1 comparing development continuously updated review h1

b as most people tend to compare quasisimilar games to each other perhaps its best to provide a review that does so without any bias or prejudice as the vast majority of reviews lack the most important elements these should have honesty and objectivity so lets get to it b

both rollercoaster tycoon world rctw and planet coaster pc are halfway through their alpha stages or beta the difference in meaning has become insignificant over the last years and both games show great promises and annoying bugs at the same time which is completely normal for any game under development of course pc has just seen the release of its second alpha the second out of three and rctw has had major and minor updates over the last two months since it has entered early access on steam lets start with pointing out what pc delivers and lacks at this point in time

pc is a game which features a more or less cartoonic graphic style and is mainly focused on building custom scenery and constructions by using various structural elements and decorative items this way no two parks will look the same and the possibilities are numerous not endless as thats technically impossible especially with the latest update in which it has been made a lot easier to fine tune the movement of objects on multiple axes the amount of different structural elements to obtain such a desired beautiful park is quite decent although it remains to be seen how many will still be added in the future before its final release in autumn 2016 as the amount of newly added objects was amazing during the first alpha but rather disappointing in the second another main focus within the game is the animations of the park guests these are far from optimal at this point but its obvious to see that the creators tend to accomplish guests who accurately reflect their mood appear to be responsive to their environment including the rides of course and behave as natural as possible this feature still needs development but its too soon to tell whether they succeeded or failed as the park management which includes this feature as far as im concerned will be released in the third alpha stage next summer so i will leave this part of the consideration for now moving on to the flat rides it seems the developers were bereft of any resourcefulness as most rides are mere copies of previous rollercoaster tycoon games rct 1 2 and 3 and in the second alpha they even added a second ferris wheel whereas one would have been more than enough and dont forget that another flat ride  the whirley rig  is also a ferris wheel to tell the truth is it really that hard to come up with rides that are actually different from predecessors and at least somewhat different from other rides let me give you another example the newly added insanity ride is just a copy from previous rollercoaster tycoon games and its also remarkably similar to the hammer swing why dont they add rides which theyve actually come up themselves instead of merely copying others andor existing rides just compare the brain surge from nickelodeon universe to the psychola ride in the game to be fair the same mistake was made with the development of rctw as they added two slides whereas one would have been more than sufficient and they failed to provide rides which are different and interesting enough from my perspective just as the developers of pc did the number of flatrides is still quite low within both games but im sure this will improve on both fronts finally lets move on to my biggest disappointment of pc the coaster builder it contains some nice features such as being able to change colours of the tracks and the supports although the colours of the carts cant be changed for some unknown reason and theres a good amount and variety of coaster types but the building itself is downright frustrating and tedious as you constantly have to move the cursor from the screen to the interface at the bottom of the screen and back again to build track sections the building process is also rigid and doesnt feel natural due to a lack of flexibility and a poorly designed interface this feature has barely been improved upon since the release of rollercoaster tycoon 3 in 2004 which is clearly an impairment in this game the second alpha delivered us the finished coaster builder according to the developers so apparently they deem it to be completed

lets now move on to rctw this game features a style similar to parks like six flags or hersheypark as opposed to pc which is more in the direction of disneyland or disney world and is mainly focused on the coaster builder although various flatrides and scenery items have been included of course the coaster builder is not perfect which will be improved in upcoming updates but building coasters has quite a natural and flexible feel to it does possess a good interface to make use of all the different functions the spline based building tool has to offer and provides the option to change colours as well this feature has clearly been improved upon since its last installment of 2004 whereas pc failed to do this on the other hand the flexibility and possibilities pc offers for scenery items and custom constructions are not included in rctw as the latter does provide a freeform placement system but is not aimed at allowing players to make their own buildings within the game at this point in time this feature will be added to the game later on probably once the game is pulled out of early access which will happen given the amount of regular updates since its release although many claimed it never would moreover the animation of the peeps park guests is fairly poor in rctw in comparison to pc they behave and move unnaturally and need quite a few improvements but the developers are still working on this my aforementioned criticism on the flatrides also applies to rctw several other missing features are more striking in both games however as both games dont include water dark or transport rides although both the developing teams promised to add these to the final product of games and both games dont contain any kind of weather system or simulation this feature has been promised for rctw but not for pc at the moment

so which game would i recommend to you  both as long as the promises that have been made regarding both games are met which game should you buy thats up to you i bought both games to me it all comes down to preferences do you prefer a theme park builder which mainly focuses on beautiful scenery items and custom buildings just like disney world then go for planet coaster if the building of amazing coasters and parks such as six flags is more to your liking then go for rollercoaster tycoon world i truly believe that both games are on the same level at this point in time as both contain both good and bad features and both offer promises and bugs which is utterly normal for games under development as i already said lets hope that we will have two good theme park building games coming out at the end of this year

#####

keeps crashing so many limited options you place paths and the ground beneth it pokes through

#####

in short a dissapointing let down and waste of money

i bought this game knowing that it was early access but liked their vision for the game enjoyed their previous rct games and wanted to support them 

i installed the game played it for a little while and decided that it wasnt at a good enough stage yet but left it like that 3 months later i did the same again 45 times later i could see lots of room for improvement especially alongside planet coaster

then it happened planet coaster was coming close to its release date and the rctw devs had a panic theyd spent so much time and money developing yet another game was coming that did it better they had a decision to make should they take their time learn from others and fix their game or should they do everything they can to rush an unfinished product to market in a bid to steal peoples money yep you guessed it they announced a release date a week prior to that of planet coaster and charged slightly less for the game

having had the game in my library for so long with 8 hours played im not entitled to a refund leaving me rather annoyed that my money has been stolen and my good will has been taken advantage of

i should have seen it coming really they pretty much pulled the same move with tdu2 hype it up release utter drivel not give a crap

the only plus side is that they are trying to continue on with this title so it could suddenly become a great game and i could win the lottery

#####

march 2018 paid 1499 for game and expansion pack only to find after 5 hours of installation through the steam platform never had a download take so long in my life game crashes doesnt go back to main menu it crashes doesnt let me delete paths or flower boxes crashes so you play the game like a minefield saving all the time hoping it wont crash again to play same level dodging previous items that crashed so i have a park i cant delete items from infact what part of this experiance is even game related i could open windows standard mine game and dodge more mines than crashes here
laptop i7 and brand new out of the box runs game perfect until it constantly crashes poor workmanship on craetors front

since being 11 years old i have played rct rct2 rct3 always bought all expansion packs as i have done this time again
not worth a penny

reviews on this game couldnt be more accurate wish i had listened to them instead of thinking i know better because iv played every other rct game

creators need to fix this considering this is march 2018 game was released september 2016 one and a bit years horrific reviews and still creators dont care enough to fix this please save your money

#####

despite all the negative feedback this game really isnt that bad it offers a lot of content for an early access game more than some aaatitles these days im also a fan of their splinebased coaster editor once you learn how it works you can build any shape with it the graphics are mediocre but thats okay for me
there might be some performance issues and bugs but im sure theyll fix that
keep it up nvizzio

edit about a year later the game still doesnt run great it definitly got better but its just not enough so thats a bummer they improved the graphics fixed some issues and added more content though the workshop is a nice addition too i guess ill try it again next year im still confident that nvizzio manage it at some point but i doubt that the game will recover from its negative reviews

#####

i gave this team the benefit of the doubt when i purchased early i am afraid to say that i wish i could have my money back as this game is the biggest let down ever

dont bother wasting your money

#####

i bought this game 1st day of early access release i purchased under the impression it would be several months while the developers released features and fixed bugs during the almost 8 month wait i believe 2 flat rides were released and a few pieces of scenery pxp was a huge step in the right direction  ugc is a fantastic feature however 90 of the releases were bug fixes  updates  i held my breath for the final release but only to learn that they were releasing it a day earlier than planet coaster 

finally realease day the game will no longer take 10 minutes to load a sandbox map  im gonna be so excited for all the new rides and scenery  shops but it was the exact same content as the early access just the story mode changed i dont care about story mode i want a huge selection of flat rides water rides transport rides it has none of that 

unless this game comes out with a release with a crapload of new rides and shops i cant recommend it the only thing this game has going for it is the ugc im sorry but planet coaster is what this game was supposed to be 


#####

yeah i dunno it stood between planet coaster or this one and i wanted to give the original a try despite all bad reviews i wanted to make my own opinion hoping this game would bring more original rctfeels and nostalgia however it does not it just feels wrong all from the start i tried it once or twice not even immersing myself into the game fully because i completely lost interest the game lacks soul it stirs so far from the original series in a way i cant even comprehend to me it looked like planet coaster was too modern and complex in its design to bring that same feel and i for some reason liked this games graphics better now i can clearly see i made a mistake and it is the other way around 

if you are like me then remember the bad reviews are there for a reason and not just because of some silly bugs which according to comments are completely gamebreaking however i did not play enough to see any bugs  i just didnt like the game enough on its own account

#####

a pretty fun game but its full of bugs one of them being a crash bug that happens often at random you really have to get in the habit of manually saving every 5 minutes or so if you dont save often you will hate this game as it is

with the bugs i dont think its worth the money if the bugs were fixed i would say its a great game with a lot of room for improvement

#####

please save your money and buy rct3 a much better game that has a lot better camera motions while riding the sorry excuse for a coastercam the camera jolts forward all of the sudden the coasters themselves make no sense because when it says intensity im not sure we have the same understanding for that the amount of detail is amazing infact you can zoom right in and see lots of little details about the peeps but thats the only good thing about the peeps the peeps complain about everything i had 50 peeps in my park with all wide paths and they complained it was crowded

please keep in mind that this game is in fact early access but its no good right now i played about an hour and have now requested a refund because its in my opinion not very good

if you are going against the 1066 negative reveiws as of april 4th 2016 at 825pm make sure you have a very beefy computer im above the minimal requirements at got 2015 fps

please developers work really hard because what scared me was this game was almost the full release 5 months ago

#####

its disgusting that steam still refuses to reimburse players for this terrible failure of a game a lot of people including myself spent 70 on this out of sheer loyalty to the rollercoaster tycoon series and we were so excited about this one after several promising hours in the beginning the game was subsequently broken as updates progressed and we were left with nothing but a serious distrust of purchasing from steam i purchased planet coaster directly from frontier and have been happy with it but i havent forgotten that steam would only look at how many hours were played on rctw and refused to listen to reason it didnt matter how many hours were played initially the game was irretrievably broken and it doesnt look to ever be fixed steam wasnt responsible for the development but they sold it and i hold steam responsible for the money that was wasted clearly this marked the end of the rct franchise as well that too is a shame

#####

long time fan of the rollercoaster tycoon series this one however sucks so much its not even funny if you want the true rct4 look at planet coaster planet coaster is created by frontier the same developer that made rct3 and so far its an amazing game this game rctw is maybe worth 15 bucks at most its a waste of time and money

there are so many bugs and lagging issues that are not being fixed instead of fixing the bugs the devs just keep adding more shit

fix the fucking game first you fucking faggots

#####

this is more of a thumbs in the middle leaning up recommendation i like most other people reviewing the beta grew up with the first two games and still play them to this day 

h1prosh1
terrain editing and manipulation is fantastic very easy to use and navigate much more so than any of the previous games creating valleys hills mountains holes etc is super easy and intuitive and the water tool is much simpler than in previous games 
pathing is also a huge improvement in rctw you can change the size of paths as well as create curved paths much easier and less tedious to lay down as well 
game itself is very pretty to look at 
camera works like rct3 a positive in my eyes 
i dont hate the coaster editor like some other reviews have stated to be fair i rarely messed around with it in the previous games im not creative or talented enough to create anything worthy of laying down in a park so i always relied on prebuilt designs and online downloads for my coaster needs that said i found it simple enough to use after getting through a relatively steep learning curve my biggest complaint with it is that the mouse sensitivity is too high but im assuming hoping that we will have the option to tone it down upon release 

h1consh1
physics seem way way off coasters seem much too slow and coaster stats appear to be questionable at best 
time passes way way too fast an ingame day goes by in what seems like 15 seconds even on the slowest setting 
everything seems too big this is a difficult one to explain 
this seems like a game that is six months to a year from release not one a month and a half away menus are basic and ugly to look at there are very very few decoration items assuming that there will be mcuh more at release and descriptive text in menus is completely missing or occupied by generic placeholder text

#####

bleh i was warned not to get the game but really dont do it the game made me angry at whats been done to this once great franchise 10 minutes of buggy hell and i was done as atari has seemingly given up on supporting this game i urge you not to buy this game it will make you mad it will make you sad and it will make you frustrated just bleh

#####

once you get over 400 peeps in your park the game lags and makes the game very slow it is pritty to look at and is easy to use but with the problems the game has i would not recommend this game

#####

constantly crashing extremelly frustrating

#####

the developers of this game have obviously never set foot inside of anything resembling an amusment park  dont buy this garbage  get planet coaster its infinetly better than this trash they are trying to pass off for a theme park sim

#####

this game is really glitchy and freezes up a lot 


#####

fun game when it works except that the game crashes on every scenario trying to remove something crash trying to blueprint someting crash  so frustrating wont recomend this game to annyone who wants to sit down and chill its to frustrating fix the game and its well worth the money

#####

i will keep it short and sweet in this stage its more like sim city 2013 when it should be more cities skylines thats my comparison

#####

as a fan of rct series 13 rctw is an absolute abomination the game is very buggy limited to how you can build less coaster types than previous games and all round not a fun game the flat rides are ok but thats it

#####

i have been playing this game since day 1 and i put a lot of hopes into this one as all of the game series is great
for a long time i even had this comment on positive  but today i have to change this 

i am running this game on a brand new overclocked gtx1080 and still it lags i guess that is all i have to say about the games performance it fills up 8gb of vram gpu clock rises to 2000mhz and it still doesnt keep 60fps in all game situations especially with a lot of peeps in the park

gameplay iswell its okay not a lot of rides to chose from but the community created decorations are cool it would be an average game  but the weak performance destroyes everything

#####

waste of money stay away nothing like the original play planet coaster instead

#####

what to say i was so hyped when the first trailer came out but then a huge dissapointment with the mobile looking gameplay trailer that came out after all still desided to buy the game and give it a go well bad decision i can tell you graphics are horrible coaster builder is not user friendly at all so many bugs this game really ruined the roller coaster tycoon title so sad  

#####

so far the game feels incomplete you can sense the power of the spline coasterbuilding system but there are plenty of fixes that need done before this can be recommended

peep ai is horrible as is their animation they all seem like zombies no animation no character 
peep thoughts does not seem to work
should be able to hover over attraction and get information ie number on ride number in queue wait time
should be able to rightclick to remove an object when in build mode
janitors and mechanics seem brain dead they walk past trash they dont fix rides perhaps patrolling zones needs to return

allinall having fun playing game with my 6yearold son but i think the game is far from complete he thinks its great and i guess thats all that counts

#####

release review 111816 game blacks screen while starting i know this going to happen and decides that planet coaster and parkitect is the best games beside this pile of crap atari hired the wrong guys to do this game and ruined a game series that almost runs through two decades and people love once again dont buy this game and go and buy yourself planet coaster made by frontier or if you have a machine that cant handle it then go parkitect which is made by a small group of indie devs remember that you can also buy rct2 on steam and install openrct2 not worth the 35

review update 422016
so i have played the game again when it came out as early access and they added flat rides into the game but it doesnt meet any of my expectations the coaster builder is laggy and physics are so horrible the game crashed on me when i have my park while in load of 1950 guests which is total disapointment i had that problem on rct 3 most of the times on my older machines i run a pc with a gtx 760 2gb vram 16gb of ram and an 2nd gen intel xeon and it would lag like crap while building a coaster 

october beta weekend 1 review 1122015
this is probalay the worst game that you would buy for 50 i feel like they are rushing to push this game out and they have over a month left to complete and polish it so it looks like 50 but not this piece of unstable crap when i test ran my coasters that it will crash on random parts of the track yes this game doesnt have any sense of physics what so ever when i put tight banking that i get a message slope too steep this is the first rollercoaster tycoon games to not introduce grid building the game will crash and freezes at times and i guess it has something to do with the camera modes

well i cant really expect or recommend this to be good just for the 60 i have spent i have bought the deluxe edition if theres any improvements if this game came out this way then i will feel very turned down and regretting myself buying this game that wont work at its price if you want a good roller coaster management game then try to get either parkitect if you like rct 1  2 style or if you have the money then go and get planet coaster early bird or else wait 

pros
no grids unlike the other rct games
different size stalls
curved paths
a bit of good lighting

cons
poor phyisics on the guests coasters and flat rides
coaster builder can be very laggy
game will crash if your park is in heavy load or the game wont handle the graphics
limited music selection
the lack of objects to build buildings with scenery
coasters would fail if not built correctly
brakes can have a very strong force into them
terrible graphics and shadows

#####

bad graphics bad road placement i feel like a dumbass that i bought it

#####

i understand that it is early release but the game is not even playable  there are frequent crashes saved games wont load user interaction is cumbersome and the most important part the roller coasters are really difficult to build because of the game play  

i honestly dont understand how a company that cares about its namereputation would accept any form of payment for a product like this

#####

even though i got this game for free its not worth it theres no way my coaster is pulling 15gs when going gently down a hill at 90kmh paths are buggy peeps are never happy coaster building is bugged riding the coasters makes the camera shake like crazy since the parts dont smoothly intertwine

#####

made from people who dont care about video games or the comsumer

#####

im confused by all the negative reviews i just bought the game and spent a few hours building a park and rollercoasters etc im enjoying the game the camera is smooth and the placement is fairly good i love the coaster builder in this its leaps and bounds above rct3 i have no trouble linking my track to the station like i did in rct3 sometimes

its not perfect it took me a few minutes to figure out the menu and camera controls theres a lot missing but i think it will be in the final release the fences are really bad and i hope theyll rethink those to be able to snap to the pathways or allow users to shape them like pathways speaking of pathways im not sure why you cant make cue lines curved but i would like to see that other notable things thats missing are the transport rides which is the thing i like the most in rct3 there needs to be more default rides and scenery but whats in the game is pretty solid so far as far as the frame drop goes i did have a pretty big frame drop but the honest truth is i never noticed it until i looked at the fame counter

 right now i would recommend this over planet coaster if you can only afford one the only reason i say that is because you can actually play this game now the steam vrsion of planet coaster hints to being able to play early if you buy the deluxe package but thats not so i have watched videos on youtube about both of these games and rollercoaster tycoon world doesnt look as fleshed out as planet coaster but after playing it despite the negative reviews im quite happy with this game

#####

the worst game of the franchise unfortunately me and a friend were duped into buying this from atari several different developers had their hands in this feels like a terrible mobile port and was abandoned by atari  the unity engine was not exactly a great choice for a game where people like to heavily decorate theme parks as there are huge slow downs

if you plan on buying anything roller coaster tycoon related stick to the first 3 do not waste your money on this garbage and spend your money on planet coaster  they make a quality theme park game

if you really dont need the 2000 price tag on this take a 20 and flush it down the toilet burn it give it to a homeless person or shred the bill because you will get more entertainment out of that than spending the money on this game

#####

ah the worst rollercoaster tycoon game

#####

so this is what years of development gets you eh if only there was a superior game out there at the moment that lives up to expectations oh yes there is planet coaster time

#####

please dont buy this game your money would be much better spent on planet coaster and some dlc as someone who loved rct3 and spent countless hours playing it i was thrilled to see the next version of the game however this dissapointed the mechanics that made rct3 so wonderful seemed to be gone and the game didnt feel fun to play additionally the bugs made the game annoying to play

#####

i would rather buy winrar its trash just stay away its been 4 years and it still isnt any better go paint your parents house it will be more fun

#####

been a long time fan of rct i was hoping the reviews about the game were somewhat wrrong and that maybe by now the game would have been better nopeim pretty easy going on games but everything about this one is fustrating espeacially path building  i seen that the old developers for rct3 made their own versionshould have bought planet coaster

#####

pros
more content than planet coaster
great coaster builder once you learn how to use it
flat rides are cool and more are going to be added as the game gets updated
cons
current staff system
path building needs more refinement
the more rides you add the more frames you loose

overall great early access game the problems i have with the game will most likely be fixed as the game gets updated hopefully they will add a gokart track creator

#####

this game is a complete waste of time and money i have never played the compain mode because it has never made it past the loading screen every time i play i get at least one hour of play time before the game stops running besides the glitches there is barely any content not much to decorate with and all the rides are the same as all the other rollercoaster tycoons plus the ai arent much better then the previous games and they are super needy i got this game when it first came out and i have yet to even finish a park because i get so annoyed that i just give up i do not recomend getting this game

#####

should have stuck with frontier they are the ones who made rct what we all know it can be rct world is not what i expected from the rct franchice but luckily frontier developed there own planet coaster wich is amazing basicly its what rct world should have been rct world needs a lot of work gameplay gui bugs ect it seems like it could have some great potential 

#####

i really really want to like this game  i just cant  its laggy buggy and frustrating the rides break down so quickly and the ai nags and nags and nags and nags when a mechanic doesnt respond almost immediately  in most of my zones i have assigned more than one mechanic and the ai thinks it is funny to let the mechanics stand around doing nothing while a ride in their assigned zone is broken i have to manually pick them up and drop them at the ride exit then they might walk away and go do something else  if i keep picking them up and placing them at the broken ride they eventually get the hint and fix it for a few minutes then it breaks again despite having just been fixed or inspected  i never have a problem with the medics or janitors but these mechanics are pathetic  another area of contention in this game is the pathway system its frustrating  i really want to enjoy this game but i just cant  i think rct should just roll over and assume room temperature because evidently their time has come even the rewashed and ironed rct 3 complete edition rereleased last year isnt enough to keep me around i suppose it is back to parkitect or planet coaster though those games require so much micromanagement i just cant get into it

#####

awful this is the only word i can use the game in whole is terrible i even struggle to find one thing which might give it some shimmer of hope sadly i can not find anything i have tryed playing recent to the hope of finding something different but still nothing the is a let down anyone who bought it regrets it or thats the case for 99 of people i know i will never install it again it will never be played and will now collect dust at the bottom of my steam library its a shame really a real shame

#####

i realized that ordering this game was a mistake after the first couple of hours of gameplay grid snapping system has issues there are limited options for customization etc its nothing like the old games get planet coaster instead its a much better game

#####

biggest waste of money i got this pre release hoping for a finished game at the end of last summer last year and one year later and still no where near it still like everyone else says still filled with bugs atari has ripped me off with false promises stay away from this game im looking forward to planet coaster the one everyone should buy

#####

developers have forgotten about what rct is meant to be 

#####

frustrating to play

#####

shame just a shame

a lovely put together time machine from a fantastic game from my childhood

how ever  simple things like reloading your park after spending countless hours playing function not working game freezes at 100 when loading in

no fix for this at all just a another bad review and a waste of money

#####

its just terrible get planet coaster instead this game puts shame to the rollercoaster tycoon name

#####

terrible performance

#####

this game is stwas able to load the game up a few patches ago not anymore i give up bought early access into planet coaster and i have no regrets so far  do not buy rctw or you will have a bad time

#####

i purchased this game for less than  800 when it went on a special sale at the price i paid it is a pretty decent deal the game is buggy crashes not infrequently placing objects irritatingly disrupts pathways the mechanics of of balancing roller coaster intensity and excitement seems arbitrary at times etc on the bright side the graphics are very good in my opinion the challenges keep me sufficiently engaged and it is overall fun to play

#####

cant say i am enjoying this i recently downloaded the game after having it sit in my library for about a year i was expecting something equal or better than rtc3 which i loved and have hundreds of hours invested in iti got neither after nearly two hours i had enough this game was released 3 years ago and its still buggy as hell the ui isnt obvious some basic features are turned off by default which is mind boggling most of all there is very little offered in each category when playing sandbox with unlimited on for everything i cannot recommend this game at all im just glad i only paid 6 for it i pity the ones that paid full price for such a disgrace entry to an amazing ip

#####

almost every map you play crashes sometimes you even lose all progress ive gotten to the point where the game crashes before even creating a new map i cant believe they havent put any effort into fixing any of these bugs worthless game and worthless company

#####

i really love rollercoaster tycoon franchise especially 1  2

are you fucking kidding me atari  nvizzio creations
now youre ruining rct franchise its tons of buiisht

there are lots of problems in the game
coaster builder physics optimization and so on
coaster builder is very hard to use physics and optimizations are terrible

hard to watch firstperson coastercamit doesnt work well
trains derail just because of its own supports
cant devide track pieces after complete the course

below is my video from beta watch first 1 minute 1625 and 1820 to check above issues
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4k_tyskdqxe

my pc spec is
i52500  gtx 770 4gb  12gb ram
but average frame rates is around 1020fps with a single wooden rollercoaster

i know now its in first beta right now but its only 1 month away from its release date
seems developers dont have enough time to fix these too many issues until the release date

please cancel the preorder now to save your money

i requested a refund goodbye rct and atari you fucked up rct fans

#####

it really bums me out to write this review

let me start by telling you the blame for this fiasco is squarely on atari they hired a studio that had no reputation to build the game originally they wasted a lot of time and money and didnt have anything to show for it

since atari brought nvizzio on to finish the game huge improvements were made in short amount of time i have a lot of respect for the hard work nvizzio is doing

still atari set horrible expectation during the whole process and theyve not done a great job of communicating with people following the progress of this game 

im fairly against preordering games but after the progress i saw nvizzio making i decided to preorder to show my support they didnt deliver on any of the preorder perks and went silent again for months until today

now the game is releasing in early access which im typically a fan of but i didnt preorder an unfinished game obviously being early access the performance is pretty horrible even on high end hardware 

so yeah dont buy this game not yet i think it will be great in a year or two but right now its just a mess and atari doesnt deserve your money for how theyve treated this game

#####

update game uninstalled
almost every try to play the game resolves in back to desktop or app has hung up
i will now buy and play planet coaster
this game here is a fully desaster
if this is possible i want to have my money back

too buggy for release
system optimization needed too
so many back to desktop crashes
the devs have lot of work to do here

no recommended
only the same name like the earlier games

#####

i was a huge fan of the rct series including the late rct3 i made custon content for rct3 back in the day and loved it that being said this game is an absolute joke the developers and atari should be ashamed of themselves then they pull a fast one and release the full game on the same day as another theme park and much better game really i wish i could get my money back

#####

full disclosure i will keep playing this game even after writing this horrible review i promise to update it if i change my  mind on anything

im not looking for major innovation in this series addition i liked these games a lot so i bought it despite the poor reviews also was hoping the bugs had been fixed this is hardly playable there are early access games i have that have way less issues frequent crashing issues and no autosave options that i can find speaking of that the ui is horrible and not intuitive at all for an experience player of the original and an experienced player of current simliar style of game 

the settings dont even appear to work changing camera rotation speed didnt seem to adjust anything i tried turning down graphics settings to hopefully avoid the major graphic freakouts that kept happening didnt help 

forcing the tutorial is a mistake three missions in and im still on tutorial if its this long let me skip it ill come back if i get frustrated or confused or use google

also important to note i bought the deluxe edition say what

#####

ok i have waited a long time to write a review i purchased rctw at the very start way way back and got let down lots of times but i stuck with it then they released it still broken but i stuck with it after watching and reading reviews i decided to give planet coaster a try what a great game planet coaster is but i see the updates for this game the other day so think ok i will give it another go how stupid of me it will not load past the opening logo then black screen i have re downloaded but still broken i wish i had not wasted my money on this pile of rubbish in the first place #learnfrommistakes

#####

i really really want to enjoy this game but there are so many things about it that frustrate me to no end let me say first that as far as the campaigns go ive gotten pretty far so its not a lack of progress that frustrates me its the controls the build setup the mechanics the glitches the constant shutting itself off or freezing until my computer thinks im not playing it anymore and goes into sleep mode i was very disappointed in this game my recommendation to everyone else is if you get it free then enjoy it if youre boredseriously bored if you have to pay for it dont waste your money sorry guys 

#####

worse rct ever dont buy it go to the adversary planet coaster

#####

the game is too buggy the staff doesnt do their job when assigned just goes back to their buildings beginning game is so poor its too easy to get into negative a note for atari no one likes this read the reviews bring back rct platinum instead of this scam it needs to go there have been no maintenance or updates about the countless bugs afflicted with this game since it launched its a literal scam it has been abandoned and should have been taken off steam before others like myself were looking for a rct platinum alternate which is the far superior game in every way

#####

why would you buy this game even though rct3 is offsale you can get parckitecht for a couple more dollars and for way more 4499 you can get planet coaster made by frontier aka the same people that made rct3

#####

awful broken game the original rollercoaster tycoon games are far far better in every way the game feels like an unpolished early access title at best and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone

#####

i personally feel like this game will cause the forever death of the rollercoaster tycoon series 
too bad really as i loved rct3 it is too late for a refund for me but it is getting uninstalled

#####

i love this game very fun and addictive but being early access it just isnt ready i was fine with the game occasionally freezing up until it froze during the middle of my save i lost all of my game play because it didnt save properly now i have to completely start over which is beyond frustrating wait until the glitches are fixed to buy this

update
i tried to start another game and it froze again while i was in the middle of saving i lost yet another park that i built and my park was worth over 30000 at this point im doing playing until this is fixed

#####

the refund button works well

#####

waited years for the fourth one but its a disappointment i also see the price when down would like money back

#####

this constantly crashes

#####

dont buy this they have hyped it so much buy planet coaster instead
