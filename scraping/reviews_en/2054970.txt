was putting together a compatibility guide for playing the game under linuxsteam deck which required me to use various proton versions apparently each of these counted as an individual pc and triggered the denuvo tamper protection now i cant play at all on any of my systems for the crime of trying to help more users enjoy the game

edit ive since resolved my issue via a refund to find that performance is playable but very poor on windows with a rtx 3090 backed by a ryzen 5600 mid 30s to 40s when human npcs are nearby in numbers greater than 3 absolutely do not bother if your specs are even a step worse than mine

good game underneath the rot for what it matters

hey capcom

you can purchase a good review dlc for 199


edit

well this blew up for a single line comment over dumb mtx practices
discussion has run its course so ive disabled comments at last you need no longer defend capcom in comments 

after 30 hours i can confidently state the following

 game play is good though combat is a big janky
 story is not really a strong point this is personal preference
 performance is terrible in big cities i get 144 in wilderness and 20  50 in vermund
 you are forced to something akin to baldurs gate 3 honor mode just a single save file you can go to your last inn visit but waste a ton of hours potentially to fix an issue or mistake
 there is no excuse for mtx in a full priced single player rpg
 no i dont care if they have done it forever its not ok in past games its not ok now
 i also dont care if you can get it easily in game
 i got my moneys worth out of the game though lesson learned i wont be buying another capcom game at launch ill wait for a sale dd1 nostalgia got the best of me

im not going to change your mind and youre not going to change mine this comment wont change anything in the long run and capcom will be fine

have fun be nice to each other

#####

the game itself is fantastic but i cannot recommend it given the huge performance issues
wait and see if they fix it before buying

#####

edit  after some testing i found that i was able to improve performance outside cities to around 5356 fps by going to task manager going to details right clicking the dd2exe and setting priority to high then disabling dlss and fsr3 as these put strain on the cpu and thus any gains youd get are negligible this does not change the recommendation as this is the only time ive ever had to do this to improve a games performance but if you already own the game cannot refund it and are trying to push through try it i hope it helps

edit 2  performance still tanks in large cities even with setting priority to high but that was t be expected also i feel a need to say that if your getting great performance thats fantastic im glad you are one of the lucky ones who either have a really powerful pc that can play at max settings without any issues and i hope you enjoy the game to its fullest sincerely but please be aware that there are people who have hardware that does exceed the recommend specs provided by capcom and are not that fortunate when a game is poorly optimized every persons experience is going to be different even with good hardware if your having a good time with this game thats great nobody especially not me wants to ruin that for you but just because your game runs fine doesnt mean you need to lord it over others 

be kind to each other we all want the same thing nobody that bought this game wants to give it a bad review 



i really want to like this game i played the original on the ps3 i bought dark arisen on ps3 when it came out i got it again on pc and i was hyped when it was finally announced i expected jank i expected some performance issues but nothing that couldnt be handled with some tweaking of the settings i was willing to play the game at minimum settings despite my computer in theory being more than capable of running this at high settings and solid 60fps i thought it would be minor and only effect me if i did try those high settings 

i did not expect the game to barely push 40fps in the wilderness at minimum settings with dlss on ultra performance 
this was bad i did not want to write a negative review but when the first cutscene is so out of sync that the dragon starts talking to me before the knight has finished his speech i should have known something was wrong 

i dont need to talk about why micro transactions in a game like this are worthless plenty of other reviews here mention them i dont feel a need im just sad

i still have some faith that the dev team will work hard to patch the game and optimize it so that these performance problems will someday be a thing of the past only mentioned in passing in regards to this games launch just a bad memory but until then this review will stay as is i dont believe the micro transactions are going anywhere as much as we want them to go its almost certainly a mandate by capcom executives and if itsuno had a say he wouldnt want them either
you can blame developers for bad performance and optimization but the only people who deserve your ire for the micro transactions are the businessmen not the hard working men and women who tried their best to get this game to where it is currently even if it is a performance nightmare

#####

i know crafting games isnt a breeze
but no refund will make my life a squeeze
apologies capcom

我知道製作一個遊戲是不容易的
但如果我不先退個款
那就換我的人生不容易了
抱歉了卡普空

youll never wonder where a ladder is again

#####

gonna keep it short

denuvo bad optimisation micro transactions

do not buy

#####

i post this only as a forewarning 
i am a massive fan of dragons dogma 1 and i know im going to love this game 

as a short summary even though this game seems amazing if it runs well dont even buy it on sale 

i am not having half the problems others are with this game it is running extremely smooth except for when im in the biggest city in the entire game fortunately i paid out for a top of the line rig so this is probably why im not personally struggling 

no game should be designed around people who can afford the best hardware and no game should have frame drops at all on the best hardware at the time its simply sloppy that coupled with the asinine micro transaction schemes have left a horrible taste in my mouth despite the fact that i am going to milk this game for all its worth in terms of playtime 

capcom you released a 70 single player experience and then you asked 2 for some farmable materials in the game for what reason to make a quick buck its honestly pathetic you should be ashamed of yourself 

now your game that honestly deserves the recognition and hype surrounding it along with the efforts of the developers who obviously put a lot of passion behind this project will forever be squandered due to your greedy mismanagement 

i hope one day i get to change this review but i do wonder if this game will ever truly recover from this polarizing release how dare you attempt to milk this game and this community for all were worth we are not your personal bank

edit as of 128 hours of gameplay in dragons dogma 2 having beaten the game about 4 times now i would like to add this further context to my review 

 the game gets incredibly repetitive and extremely easy unless you actively go out your way to start fresh every time you play again 

 the set up of every plot point is at least serviceable and interesting but its always dropped dramatically after its introduction with no closure for the next plot point until the very end of the game which tries to point things out as if you cared about any of the characters dragons dogma 1 also kinda did this in the base game but at least it did a much better job by the end 

 you can only buy the microtransactions once a piece but the game is already 70 incomplete and feels extremely unfinished by the end 

 the game was obviously rushed out to meet its deadline with no delays the end game in concept is fantastic and interesting until you realize the idea is half baked and you dont have anything else to look forward to besides a boring cinematic boss fight that actually gives no closure as the climactic end to the game 

 gameplay still feels great so long as you can run the game vocations are a joy to play around with its a massive shame there arent more but one can always be hopeful 

i cant recommend the game to others when it doesnt run well in some areas and has a poorly designed and rushed endgame i dont even blame the developers themselves i doubt they wanted the game to release this way but letting every game get away with a slap on the wrist because i personally enjoyed what i could and being unable to share that experience with my peers doesnt sit well with me

#####

microtransactions in a single player game

cant delete save data start a new game if you mess up your character during creation either

#####

199 to edit your character appearance in a singleplayer game after spending 8000 your character appearance is on their  servers so deleting your save files from steamuserdatanumber2054970remotewin64_save and making edits within the character creator even with cloud saves off does not apply to your ingame character

#####

played for about 4 hours in albeit at a really slow pace because i wanted to test the limits of the game and fool around a bit 

the good
its a good rpg at its core with good combat mechanics gameplay elements and in general just solid gameplay design outside of a few things well get to that

the bad
lets get it out the way first the game is very very very badly optimised in not just the performance optimisation but also the graphical aspect of it its not a bad looking game but its not exactly a super good looking one and definitely not one that should be so graphically intensive not to mention the cpu intensiveness in town the graphics texture themselves are rather dated and in the grand scheme of things look like something out of the age of monster hunter world while having about a 2 to 4 times graphics processing requirement  for context cpu 7800x3d gpu amd 7800xt frame rate at 1440p without frame gen tech below 60 in the main screen around 6080fps around normal play thats atrociously bad graphic optimisation not to mention city issues
many design elements makes sense in the first dragons dogma and no longer do these days why is the riftstone mechanics making a reversal compared to what was implemented in dragons dogmas dark arisen why is the game design taking a step backwards
bad game qol in first game being propagated back to the second even after so many years issues with single save file issue with how the save is being done issue with how romance works with the game the list goes on 
story wise tbh i feel like its higher production value worse execution but this is just personal preference ymmv
the mtx thing leaves a sour taste in my mouth because it gives the vibes that the qol features arent properly implemented so that they mtx at least makes some sense 

if you are reading this review and want to have 1 takeaway it is that although the game is fun i will highly recommend to at the minimum delay the purchasing of the game until its on sale its not 70 dollar good even on a pc like mine which can run it without issues with some help ie frame genfsr tuning down some configs and running it at 1440p instead of 4k moreover its very evident that its an incomplete game that is released at this timing because capcom is looking for the last inflow of revenue before the end of the financial year if you still want to play the game badly and is willing to pay full price but feel guilty about buying the game in its current statesituation delay until after 1st april and then buy it it will at least have an impact and send the message to capcom via the yearly financial results

edit i am adding on to this review after about 50 hours into the game about a week later i am not editing anything above but looking back at my own early review it really foreshadows the deeper issues i find with the game that most people will find and for those who are looking for a takeaway from the revisit it is that to get any value out of this purchase this game will need to be purchased a year or two from now during a saleafter confirmation that the deeprooted issues has been fixed 

as it is right now the greatest accomplishment this game has done is convinced me to not buy monster hunter wilds on release despite all the friends i have within the community

additional pros and cons with the game after 50 hours
pros
core gameplay loops especially with larger sized monsters is really fun
exploration within the game can be fun with high peaks discovery of new areas new monsters and low lows ie walking simulator with a repetitive wolfgoblinsaurian encounter every 30 seconds that is just stunstagger galore in either direction

cons
the story was subjectively worse in terms of vibe in the first 5 hours of play its objectively worse as the story goes along as the buildup for the first portion of the game ended in a grand pile of nothing and results in just oh just go to the next city to talk to this guy main storyline is pretty lacklustre and the side quests have close to zero impact to the world at large and it really showcases capcoms weakness in storywriting within a narrativedriven rpg context which admitedly i should have saw this a mile coming considering i played both dmc and monster hunter and the storyline is memeworthy when at its best
incompleteness in so so so many aspects
   monsters scaling is super off even before end game i have not yet reached there yet but encounters within towns typically take a few seconds each for the typical mob and big monsters like golemsgriffins etc barely takes a minute thats with a build that isnt even end game equipment augments etc yet with a vocation that generally is classified on the lower end of the brokeness spectrum archer
   monster variety is strictly worse than dark arisen and in terms of repetitive nation of most portion of the gameplay gives off early generation assassins creed open world vibes aka around ac3
   good action rpgs tend of introduce depth nuances and complexity or at least the neccesity of understanding those as the game progresses and this game has very little of that advanced classes are not straight up upgrades of the basic classes but are complete different classes that often have a different power scale which can be worse or better than a basic class

all in all the game feels very incomplete and reminiscent of dragons dogma 1 before dark arisen which is in all accounts an incomplete game even  in the eyes of the dd1 game directory with that in mind the fact that dragons dogma 2 came out at full price at the exact same state with improvement in some areas while also worse off in others is a straight up disgrace while the foundation for a great game is there the potential is never fulfilled and even though there will be folks that bring up the potential of a dlc like dark arisen was to dd1 to bring it up to par why should anyone accept an incomplete product at a complete price point and release

for those who are thinking to buy this please just buy it on sale one year or two later after release and after being sure that there has been a fix for all these issue either via patches or  dlc because honestly capcom has done a masterful job of convincing me to never buy anything at full price at launch from them going forward considering the terrible experience that got worse with each release from monster hunter world to monster hunter rise to now dragons dogma 2 third time is not the charm for capcom but at least its for me to learn the lesson of not buying any of the hype they put out and that game day reviews tends to not be able to coverreach the point in the game where the incompleteness of the game becomes evident

#####

i was fully intent on refunding the game if it ran like  but as it turns im one of the lucky ones who can say it runs good enough on my machine 60 fps in wilderness shaky 30 fps in the city  but the game itself is phenomenal and it hooked me instantly despite the glaring performance issues  its a phenomenal adventure its dragons dogma its great combat where youre climbing around on big monsters the pawns are so much cooler this time around

but i absolutely cannot recommend this game at the moment with the state that its in pc players didnt build pcs to play games at console quality theres no reason why i shouldnt be getting 120 fps across the board with my graphics settings it is not a great looking game its just fine  rdr2 runs better and looks better  walk through novagrad in the witcher 3 and look at the bustling city streets and the crowd of npcs going about their day  dragons dogma 2 struggles from cpu overload because of npcs in the world especially in the city and it isnt even that crowded  its a step up from dd1s gran soren but its mind boggling that you need a quantum cpu to run this game at a comfortable fps

70 is atrocious for this messy of a release  once its fixed i would love to recommend this game

#####

if i set the graphics to look worse than the first game i can achieve framerate worse than the first game

#####

exploration 1010
combat 910
quests 110
writing 010
performance 410

there is not a single fun or engaging quest in this game and even the main quests consist of walking somewhere and reporting back sometimes with unexplained game mechanics such as stealth which isnt really a thing in the game some quests just break if you dont do what the game expected you to do and either magically disappear from your quest log without warning or stick around basically forever despite you not being able to complete the quest at all

performance while exploring was fine for my gaming laptop with an rtx 3070 and intel i7 getting 59  60 fps but inside cities i was getting 15  30 fps

the dialogue and story are incredibly bad rarely making sense at all and entirely unintriguing

thankfully however the story and quests are maybe 10 of the game if that i remember 3 or 4 story quests that were actually necessary so you can technically beat the game in a few hours i explored pretty much every corner after 78 hours of playing

but the exploring and atmosphere during your travels is some of the best ive ever experienced the limitations can be taxing if youre too used to the comfort of fast travelling anywhere and having a character that can carry the world in their item pouch but if youre willing to work with the limitations this game sets on you it will be an incredible experience having to decide how far you can go before having to return to a city or whether its worth to set up camp to recuperate helps the player feel like a real part of this beautiful but dangerous world
the enemy variety isnt huge but varied enough that it never bothered me

tldr if you like me dont care about story or quests but do love exploring an intricate beautiful and atmospheric world with great combat that is hugely varied depending on your vocation class i highly recommend dragons dogma 2
if you prefer storydriven games or put high value on quests then stay far far away seriously the worst quests ive ever experienced in a video game with writing youd expect from a 15 students game project after which youd feel robbed of said 15

quick little edit regarding quests after being halfway through ng where i put more effort into trying to experience everything that isnt just exploration

on my original playthrough i seem to have missed pretty much all the decent quests due to not talking to the right people or not checking back enough with specific npcs in far away towns so i pretty much only got the worst quests in the game this essentially changes my opinion about quests from worst quests ive ever experienced in a video game to the quests are fine but some of them are plain terrible

also because there seem to be some people who question my recommendation of the game when im so overly negative in the review and steam doesnt allow me to answer comments directly read the tldr it sums up my reasons for recommending the game overall and not recommending it to specific people

#####

i was prepared for some early on port optimization issues my rig was for the most part able to compensate never dropping below 60fps it shouldnt take a 4090 and top tier cpu to do that however the next issue however is unconscionable i played the hell out of the original game on console later did the same on pc and then the iterations on top of that i have really enjoyed the series and its quirky but refreshingly different play style the save system has always been an odd choice poorly designed but mostly functional with dd2 however not only did they bring forward with them all of the bad about the old save system they created a instant gameplay losing cliff you can fall off of at just about any point i spent hours in the game many hours i had saved the game manually many times along the way i had camped many times along the way i did not use the 2000g inn due to it being expensive the game alternative is the camping gear which is heavy and somewhat expensive but a good choice or so i thought so i survived many battles developed my vocation to almost maximum had a great pawn and team and  end up dying to a seemingly random saurian spawn it was fine though i had saved right at least i had that one beautiful save point that nothing could screw with right i had camped thats the alternative to the inn so worst case that has my back too right well not right i mistakenly chose after my first wipeout in the game to reload at my last inn rest i figured that would load me at my last camp but if not i still had my save game in my back pocket well it did not take me back to my last camp it took me to the first time i ever was at an inn level 2 and it proceeded to save over my one save game in the process automatically let me be clear about this it saved over it automatically and before anyone says it didnt and that i let it save on exit no i did not i very deliberately chose the exit back to main menu without saving option specifically for this reason when i did that and then loaded from what should have been a recent save game i save every hour or few hours so things like this dont happen and guess where it loaded me back to the same inn and back at level 2 where it took me previously

if you are going to choose to try and be hard core but only allowing for one save you had better be sure that it works and that it works well as  that is the only lifeline a user has to their progress hours and hours of careful play and exploration rewarded with a complete wipe back to level 2 because the game decided to save over my save this all could have been avoided by simply separating the auto save mechanism and the manual save like so many games have done and continue to do i did not think much about the cash shop items on release day but its becoming clear that this is in part a cash grab leveraging a lot of old mechanics slapping some visual upgrades on them and putting something out that obviously was not well thought through this kind of thing should never happen im still a little in disbelief that what happened actually happened despite extremely careful effort to avoid it also my play time is skewed as i left the game running on my game pc while working on another but actual playing game time i would still say was about 6 hours or more reduced to level 2  as for the saving over my save game i cant believe that is intentional and if the developer is reading any of these reviews at all i highly suggest that you put this issue up at the top of your list along with the spirit crushing performance problems because performance problems or not if you then let them fall into an even more spirit crushing loss of progression like this you are not just pissing someone off who didnt want to pay for a bad optimization and have them turn away you are then pissing off the people that stayed with you despite that and adding insult to injury seemingly confirming that capcom may have fallen so far from grace they no longer know what it means to have a user experience path during development or worse that they do know and dont care better to focus the devs on building out those cash shop items to maximize those  than to work on user experience i doubt they are reading and doubt even more responding if there is a heart beating still in there and someone tells me at least that they acknowledge and are fixing the problem i may update my review as it stands now however i simply cannot give this the thumbs up i really wanted to give it at least for those who were fans of the previous for now i stand flabbergasted and saddened to see another franchise have the deliberate care that made them special be ripped out of them and milked for whatever profit can still be gained from the dwindling spirit left behind i hope to be proved wrong however likely i will not be

#####

look how they massacred my boy turned him into a cash grab and murdered his soul should have let him rest but instead you dug him up and waved his corpse around with makeup on like the rats you are

#####

it seems like most people have forgotten what dragons dogma was before the dark arisen release

edits marked with 

first of all i got to say im not defending micro transaction or the devs choice to add them if you want to give this game a bad review because of that then its totally understandable but some reviews are very misleading and paints the devs as more of evil mustachio twirling villains than they are this is by no way close to blizzard or other companies in level of disgusting 

1 fast travel with portcrystals are locked behind a mt paywall 
this is false in my playthrough i gained 45 portcrystals just from exploring and doing quests it was enough to space them out for easy travel most of the times i actually used the oxen service because i was out of ferry stones 

2 character edit is locked behind a mt paywall 
this is also false right now you only have 2 full recreation tickets per playthrough the devs have now uped it to 99 these cost 500 rc which is really easy to get and you will have enough of them by mid game to basically never worry about them

3 no multiple characters option to start over 
some has stated that this is a lack of freedom to try out different vocations this is just wrong since you can change vocations when ever you want and you no longer have to level different vocations for your end build like in the previous games 

they have now added a start a new game that overwrites your current file

4 performance issues 
yes this game has some horrendous performance in major cities the devs are aware of this as well and are working on a solution but i have seen people with hardware waaaay below the recommended specs complain about this no shit it will stutter if you have a i5 gen 8 when the game is depending so much on a strong cpu  
i had a constant of 7060 fps whilst outside of towns inside the towns i had 3050 with major drops when a town was attacked every thing on max dlls on quality 2560x1440 specs at bottom

 performance is better but still wobbly in cities 

5 final
ok so everyone please lay down your torches and pickforks for a second and look at the mt content they offer its all in the game already you dont have to pay anything extra to enjoy the game as the game was intended exploration time consuming as it is but none the less 

if you only have 10 hours in the game you havent even played it 
even if the above statement is ridiculous its true this game will take time 
a review talking about ingame content or lacking of content that is under 10 hours has not even left the first area of the map and have not explored that area to 100 

the big but
every fix is still just a promise they will add they will fix in coming patches dont worry the dragons are coming 

 right now its only performance that is still an issue 

hrhr
ok now to the game 
 after almost doing a 100 on this game story is decent but
i just finished the main story and i have to say it felt short 

now i see you looking at my almost 100 hours at the time of this review and hold up wait a minute
i did a lot of stuff side quests almost all vocations and their ultimate skills romances you name it 
but i didnt do it all and that says a lot about the content thats in the game but the main quest felt like you where following a breadcrumb trail while enjoying the scenery which can be really nice specially when the areas looks great and have a lot of details 

this game is a adhd nightmare im not diagnosed but every chance i got i said fuck you to the pawn guiding me to a quest to see what this other path lead and oh boy there are some awesome areas you miss out on if you just blaze through the game 

some argue its the same game again well yes like the darksouls game are technically the same game again 

but wait there is more
the modding community has already been working like crazy and you can already find mods like unlimited stamina outside of battle and real fov slider and surly more is to come 

the world and its inhabitants 
i would summarize the game to be on the level of dragons dogma 1 when it comes to variations of enemies you have your standards of goblins skeletons lizardos bandidos draginos ogrerrendae cyclopos dadeiahfgeslf 
the list goes on but they also have dark variants for the bigger monsters and a couple of new ones 
these enemies walk around their respective areas but can be seen fighting from time to time
i have seen some reviews saying theres a lack of variations but there are like 45 different variations of saurians that is not just a dark variant they are made from different elements and live in different climates and look pretty cool 

thats basically the feeling of the world everything is pretty cool untill a gryphin wrecks my desert crank lift and wipes my whole party

there are random quests that pop up here and there with people to save monsters to cull or escort missions they are ok but it would be nice if the escort person would actually say where they want to go before you accept it i might be wanting to hunt down a dragon in the area walked from the capital and camped to get here and they just want to be escorted to the capital no way peasant you are now on the dragon hunter squad 

vocations 
i was really sad to see that the assasain was removed as it was my go to vocation in dd1 so we got theif and archer no daggers and bow just daggers or bow
i felt my breathing going faster and my typing fingers loading up to rant about why i hated this but i calmed down and gave the theif and archer a chance and now i like it 

with all the vocations and special vocations from dd1 and specially with the new spear hand which is totally op and broken af but more of that later most of the regular vocations would be well obsolete they would only be an annoying hurdle to pass to get to the vocation you wanted with this new system all vocations are unique and dare i say fun buff archer ult pls its so baby tier rn m reowshrsji brdb

ok 
imagine being a jedi that can tank any attack in the game even the dragoins meteor showers and lightning attacks 
imagine being fus ro da yeeted off high hrhorghharhhf just to stand up and dust yourself off 
imagine being able to teleport around the fight like narutos daddy throwing shit on the enemy and just appearing on them 
now imagine being able to spear the heart of a dragon with a powerful magic projectile that will make the dragon backflip into the sky right through the moon 
this is the spear hand vocation  

ok that might be too much but you get my meaning 
the vocation actually have a bubble spell it makes you immune to all dmg for a short while ok how short are we talking like 5 secs so you have to time it perfectly 
no its like 4 seconds it outlasts most channel attacks and it costs so little stamina so you can keep it up an entire boss fight and it bubbles your pawns as well 

i no joke didnt take a single point of dmg from the end boss when i challanged him with this class and none of my pawns died there was tools in the boss arena that could be used on the boss but i didnt even have to use them just bubble away
 
hrhr
it takes a lot of time to get any where and it can be confusing to figure out what the game wants from you or what you can expect from the game but then the areas are so nice so some people wont mind the time taken some people like to figure everything out even if it might be cryptic and non nonsensical at times 

its not a game where you can get a feel of it within the refund time 
this is not dark arisen its going to lack some quality of life things 
only buy at full price if you are sure you are going to enjoy it 
im off to ng 
have a nice one

crapcom is back
taking the crown from jedi survivor dragons cpu 2

#####

see you guys at 50 sale

#####

12 years have passed since dragons dogma 1 released it was genre defining leaps and bounds ahead of its time

if theres anything capcom has learned its how to become predatory how to leach people for their worth 

70 game i could support to ensure fair pay for a good game however when you also attach bloatware buy more crystals and pay to win gifts to a singleplayer game i cannot in good faith support that 

the game is also linked to their cloud servers 199 to change what you look like let that set in two dollars to change your appearance something that should be free and has zero impact on capcom two dollars sure you may be able to get a lot of this in game but it treats you like a child candy crush monetization i wont spend my money to be treated like that even if its available in game too 

stay away from this game with a 30 foot pole do not support this in the industry this is predatory and horrific to see how far from grace you capitalist pigs have fallen 

and by gods green earth i hope you fail and crumple like you deserve

#####

and they had to add denuvo as mentioned the performance is very bad and while testing different proton versions got locked out of my account because that crap cant identify when you are changing compatibility layers versions vs having many computers

the performance as mentioned is terrible it is not even capable of using my resources correctly cpu didnt go further than 40 gpu was lower than 60 capacity

this i believe will be addressed in future patches but denuvo for a single player game thats just stupid bad choices
even the first title ran better on xbox 360 at launch

#####

dragons dogma 2 isnt an easy game to review it asks you to overlook unnecessary microtransactions aimed solely at the most vulnerable and misinformed and a dogshit story told in an almost comically bad way all in favor of real tight gameplay and some nice graphics and im not sure im entirely sold on the whole affair

hailed as game director hideaki itsunos vision of what the original game should have been dragons dogma 2 is plagued not just with the same problems as the first game be it underwhelming andor unnecessary systems such as the romance system or the much maligned dragon plague but its also a far more stripped back and in some ways smaller game than the first even excluding the dark arisen dlc which did much to fix dragons dogma 1 dragons dogma 2 restricts each vocation class to a single weapon and a bafflingly strict armorsystem rogues can sometimes wear the pants of an archer but not their shirt sometimes their shirt but not their pants some chainmail is for shieldusers only while twohanded swordsmen wear the bulkiest armor in the game it doesnt make any sense and without the ability to layer armor results in every pawn looking the same as the nextwhich is all the more strange when considering how good the actual character creator is stranger still is the loot and how it ties into exploration all the best gear is found in shops youll never find anything in the wild that isnt bested by a vendor in some town and it really serves to hurt exploration but more on that in a bit

story isnt anything to write home about in fact i dare say the game would have been better without it first half pretends at being some kind of athome game of thronesfeaturing the intrigue of a false arisen it features halfbaked sneaking missions and documentreading before suddenly remembering the games about killing monsters and just gives up on the plot im not kidding the halfway point of the story isand i shit you notyou walking up to a door before deciding it aint worth it and turning around to go gather some more clues said clues are walking halfway across the map to a halfbaked desert region thats only there to house one actual mission before thrusting youwithout warninginto the endgame wherein key characters just cease to exist it is emblematic of the worst aspects of dragons dogma 2 missions can sometimes be timegated but only a few of them are marked as such it is possible to miss one of the biggest boss fights in the game a fight heavily advertised in trailers if the players simply decides to continue the quest at another time why because it isnt marked as timesensitive elsewhere quests have the dumbest descriptors one sidequest has you searching for a book said to be in the wrong town then said to be in a queer little bookshop only it isnt in a bookshop in fact its located at a dudes house completely bereft of a single book hell the whole endgame is a timegated battle royaleinspired affair that isnt timemarked either quests are by far dragons dogma 2s worst aspect theyre not fun mosttimes confusing and arent ever wellwritten or interesting in the slightest

combat is where the game shines its the games bread and butter and it is satisfying from staggering a large foe with a powerful charged attack to beyblading down the spine of a dragon as a rogue when it hits it hits good climbing a cyclops to plant a bomb in his eye before leaping into the air and blowing his ass up in slomo never got old i loved being a rogue leaping from foe to foe with electrified daggers carried me through 32 hours of uninteresting quests and halfdecent exploration which makes it all the more baffling how stripped back the actual vocations are in the first game rogues were called striders they had access to both daggers and a bow in this game daggers and bows are separate vocationsnever to cross you max out a vocation at like level 10 and by the end of the game youll at least be level 40 meaning if you dont like switching vocations constantly youll have seen all your class has to offer in the first 510 hours of gameplay and therein lies another problem for a game intent on the switching of vocations unlocking most of them are downright dumb only two vocations that are questrelated are fighters and mages rest are up to you to find but they arent marked or hinted toward trickster youll unlock that if you follow the story at which point youre close to endgame and probably shouldnt switch magic archer i unlocked that one in the last hour of the game wayfarer unlocked that by accidentally talking to the right npc and being told by him to fuck off bam vocation unlocked nowyou can unlock them fairly early but it requires you to hike across the map and into areas youre not leveled for at that point but wait too long and youll wont wanna switch due to the higher requirements placed on you at that point im all for secrets but its a stupid system that only serves to potentially rob players of their favourite class

finally lets talk exploration its one of the most talked about aspects of the game with director hideaki itsuno even hoping the world is interesting enough that players wont wanna fast travel thats a bold claim and made all the more baffling by the limited amount of enemies wandering the world youll face these four groups of enemies regardless of area goblins harpies humans and lizards perhaps a troll or a cyclops theres only two of them big boys so its one or the other on occasion youll face a griffin or a dragon and for a game with the word dragon in the title im surprised how few there are and how samey they are theres legit two three if you count the titular dragon theres a black dragon and a black dragon with aids on it thats it really titular dragons red but youll only face him at the end so those two are all you get but fear not as sometimes the game lets loose and youll face a camouflaged goblin a poison lizard orand get thisa harpy with poofy feathers crazy stuff man i know but dont worry about mssing and of this stunningly varied lineup of enemies as youll encounter them roughly every ten meters or so really run down a road and theres a fight every few seconds at most youll go a minute or two without combat and for a game carried by its combat i never thought id grow so tired of it and therein lies the problem with exploration youll be so bogged down with combat that you long for the quiet moments only in those moments there isnt anything to find best loots in shops and aside from a few beautiful landscapes youll run around listening to your pawns spout the same five lines over and over again none of its bad but it just isnt interesting in the long run aside from a couple of hidden bosses and some actual cool shit most caves are the same most dungeons hold little of value and most paths yet taken are bogged down by the same four enemies youve faced over and over and over it all becomes monotonousness at a point and when you dont even wanna stray from the path because youre exhausted of using the same four skills youve used for the past 30 hours because none of the other vocations appeal to you thats when exploration fails and thats when this template of a gamethis gem of systemsneeded something else something more if this is game director hideaki itsunos vision of a true dragons dogma then i think someone else deserves a crack at it because there is a good game buried beneath the monotony of this one and with a proper story proper characters proper sidequests and proper gear and loot this could have been a worthy sequel one that expanded on the original instead of shrinking it down into its weakest of parts but as it stands just play the original

#####

i was really excited to play this game but even excluding the drama of micro transactions the current state of the game is unacceptable i have a very beefy system and the game will run anywhere between 100fps at 4k to a crippling 30fps in towns with horrific frame times

this results in a stutery mess and makes every town visit its a central hub so its frequent and required to go to to save safely a jarring unfun experience that quite frankly ruins the game

ive seen benchmarks where using the most powerful cpu on the market this is still the case how can you release a game where you couldnt even get it to run properly in a test lab prior to release with the most powerful cpu on the market

do yourself a favour wait 6 months for a sale and for them to actually finish the game

modern gaming

#####

i find it extremely ironic and timely how we just heard swen vincke for larian studios talk about how corporate greed is killing our industry and developers this game is the complete epitome of what happens when publishers need to shove their quarterly fists down developers throats this is a great game completely marred by greed and heres a short list of my personal issues

1 you cant start a new game

i hope you spent over 10 hours in that character creator to perfect the look of youre pawn and arisen and also dont want to make a new character if you already beat the game because once you start your journey youre locked into that save wtf is this every rpg over the last decade including the first game had the ability to start a new game dont worry though im sure this will be a dlc to purchase to give us multiple character slots thatll be 50 for a new character dummyyyyy

2 performance is completely unacceptable

i have a pretty beefy pc and id never talk about performance if a game is running well cause no shit i got a 4080 it should run well i cannot imagine how this game is running on lower end systems especially in towns the fact that there isnt frame gen and fsr3 to potentially bypass a lot of the cpu load in towns is a little baffling either way this is completely destroying the game due to how bad it can get for me personally

3 dlcdlc and chicken tendies

the fact no preview or reviewer mentioned this while they had extensive time and coverage leads me to assume this was completely hidden until launch which if your gonna be an asshole at least be an honest asshole i mean seriously 2 for a jail key that breaks after one use yes you can earn this stuff in game but cmonnnn no way were gonna defend this right just go buy some chicken tenders instead of this garbage mtx  

4 dont buy this yet

look at the end of the day even with the little time ive had of the game i can tell its great and the countless reviews of outlets and content creators have said as much some even saying its one of the best rpgs they have ever played i believe they will fix these issues but like i was talking about at the beginning of this unnecessarily long review is there has been a deeper rooted issue that is effecting the consumer but more importantly the developers they have to watch as something they make with utter passion gets completely destroyed at launch due to a publishers incompetence and then get laid off for that same publishers mistakes swens right though it doesnt have to be this way the industry can be better than this i cannot recommend dragons dogma 2 yet            



#####

the explorers camping kit is probably the most egregious of the dlc

so to explain as you and your pawns battle you take damage take enough damage and there is a portion of your hp you cant recover with magic or items so youll either have to go rest at an inn or find a bonfire to set up camp to make camp youll need the camping supplies item the ones i have found so far are very heavy in weight which means your party wont have much space for loot

the explorers camping kit dlc will give you 1 camping supply and make the explorers camping kit available to purchase within the ingame shops and it will be much lighter in weight than the normal camping supplies capcom have purposely made the experience far more tedious than it need be in their fully priced aaa game so we would spend the extra money on their quality of life dlc

for those of you in the know most of the dlc items are stuff youll find within the game anyway but for the vast majority of new players not yet caught on to capcoms schemes they may just buy these items out of ignorance that is a pure scumbag move

also im running this on a 7800x3d and a 7900xtx at 1080 resolution travelling around the city shouldnt feel like a slideshow

#####

will buy again when game doesnt run at 3040 fps at medium on 1440p

rtx 3070
i711700k
32gb ram

made some launch argument tweaks and nvidia control panel tweaks didnt try the frame gen mod but shouldnt have to

#####

its a 7080singleplayer rpg that only allows for one save file and no means to delete it ingame to start a new one what the fudge packing frick forget the bs selling ingame currency for a singleplayer game forget the unusable pc port that is pretty much an expectation of a japanese game at this point you thought it was a good idea to make it so a singleplayer game has farmable currency that you can buy and you expect people not to see that you will reduce the ingame drop rates later on to force people to buy we arent stupid you can make those drop rates so rare with a tiny micropatch and never say a word then to nail the coffin shut you slap on denuvo a cpucrunching chitchow on top of a game that already has a completely unusable cpu bottleneck you did that after all of the other capcom games that used denuvo havent worked and the pirated versions were the best versions of the game its scummy and the last time i ever buy from capcom insanely disappointed and disgusted

#####

you dont need anything from the online store at all 

the game is fun chaotic and makes you feel like a badass

#####

combat good
story ok
performance bad
capcom bad microtransaction company
wait for sale

#####

microtransactions in a 95cad game

#####

the game is amazing but barely playable absolutely unrecommendable at this point
i expected better from capcom

#####

i should had listened  dont preordered they say  it wont have good performance at launch they say  only one save if you messed up your play through  you are finished  you cannot start a new character  play through  oh it has microtransactions in a 70 dollar single player game  but wait it also has denuvo antitamper  isnt that great

i requested a refund  4 hours in and i hope steam support understands how i feel about this dogma water game  ill just mod skyrim special edition and slap dragons dogma 2 on that instead

update
it seems steam gave me an l  declined my refund  i am such an idiot i let the hype get to me now here i am laying in my bed at 5 in the morning on friday march 22nd 2024 sad and alone in the darkness  only thinking about my regrets  dont be me  dont let the over hyped game get into your head  it will only make you suffer

now i must let this game collect dust in my steam library and hope capcom can patch the horrible performance issues  please dont buy this game right now  i beg of you  dont suffer as i suffer

i gave this game another try  ive been making lots of progress here and there  ignoring the performance issues was sorta hard but i gotten used it  you may think oh thats great  it was until a pawn i had with me spoiler was infected and nuked an entire village  important npcs dead spoiler i am not buying the stupid wakestone dlc  just to fix what a pawn did  grinding for these stones suck  i feel completely helpless here

#####

the game is actually pretty fun and what i expect from dragon dogma series that being said the performance issues may hinder your enjoyment and having bunch of microtransactions in addition of us70 pricetag does leave bitter impression despite most of the items are obtainable ingame

theres however some tips to improve your fps
option 1 for nvdia user nvidia control panel  manage 3d settings  global settings  shader cache size  change to unlimited or if you cant find it on global setting just go to program setting and add dragon dogma 2

option 2 for nvdia rtx40 series use dlss3 enabler  httpswwwnexusmodscomdragonsdogma2mods39

option 3 for psychopaths massacre bunch of random npcs so the amount of npcs and the fps balanced as all things should be

option 4 save yourself and dont buy the game at least until devs fix this problem because you dont deserve being treated like this after paying 70


#####

 page of microtransactions 

2 character edit voucher 

forced cpu eating and anticonsumer denuvo 

only one save file unable to create multiple characters 

awful performance cannot maintain a steady 60fps regardless of settingsspec ryzen 5 3600x 3070ti

this could have easily been one of the greatest games capcoms ever launched but greed always wins

#####

i just finished removing this game from my account
there is one thing that everyone needs to know about this game currently
you are only allowed one character
ever
no new playthroughs no trying new things
no new anything
it is simply the stupidest thing ive seen in a aaa game
and ive got almost 2500 hours into fallout 76

prereview mtx rant the microtransactions are very unwelcome in this game however two things are true about them and i refuse to sugar coat the reality of the situation about them

1 they were the exact same in original dragons dogma game if you dont believe me go check the dragons dogma dark arisen store page and they were a huge success for capcom back then they didnt sneak the mtx into this title they were always going to be part of it i fully expected it to happen and everyone else should have as well capcom has never been innocent in the mtx market theyve been a big proponent of them for a long long time

2 you have the power to send the message to capcom that the mtx are unwelcome by not buying them

seriously its not that hard unless youre some pathetic illeducated and prepubescent child with no sense of self control over how irresponsibly you spend your parents money because they were stupid enough to link their credit card to your account dont buy them

down voting the game because you hate the fact that there are mtx present does not send the message you think it does 

when you mass downvote the game all it tells capcom is that we as a consumer base dont like the game and if they think the consumer base doesnt like the game theyll never make another dragons dogma title why because reviews affect sales numbers sales numbers influence whether or not another entry to the series will ever happen

capcoms only love language is money if the game itself sells well and gets rave reviews then theyll make another one if the mtx never sells theyll be less likely to include them in future entries or at the very least theyll include fewer of them to see if they can get away with just a handful and if those also dont sell theyll eventually give up on them for the title in question

use your heads and speak with your wallets people

buy the game and review it on its own merits and dont buy the mtx

that is how we send the message to capcom about how to continue with the development of their future titles down voting an otherwise great game because there are mtx only tells them that the game itself is nonviable for their profit margins and theyll stop trying to make future entries for it

thanks to the mass negative reviews i fully expect this to be the second and final entry in the ip

thanks for that everyone youve killed an otherwise great ips chance for a future because you couldnt help but use the review system to btch at capcom in a destructive way

mtx rant over 

as a game dragons dogma 2 is beautiful engaging and challenging

yes it has some performance issues and needs to be better optimized but thats well within capcoms ability to fix with some patches and updates im not worried about that

the games single save file is the only thing i truly dont like about it its long been standard for multiple save files to be present in the video game landscape and while i can understand they wanted to challenge the player and give them a reason to replay the game and do the quests they missed out on in their first play through i as a player want to have control over that aspect of my own gaming experience the time of a single save file has long since past and its time for capcom to let go of that antiquated line of thinking

empower the player capcom the more you restrict or intrude upon our experience the more well turn against you and youre already seeing the evidence of that in the review bombing because you had the gall to include mtx in a singleplayer title which has no business implementing them in the first place

this game is far more challenging than its predecessor the abundance of enemies and creatures in the world keeps you on your toes and can very quickly lead to your death if youre not careful more than once i was fighting a goblin group before stumbling into a cyclops and getting utterly decimated by the tagteam

the pawns are just as talkative as ever but at least this time they have a bit more variety in their chatter than last time its still a tad annoying at times but another element that helps offset it is the interactivity between them they never spoke with each other before now they do and its refreshing and somewhat entertaining at times

the equipment and weapons system is basically identical to the original game and as a player of the original title from its initial launch i feel right at home from the getgo the addition of so many ingredient items and the ease with which you can attain them is a welcome change as well the original game was a bit less forgiving with the foraging and drop rates than this title is or at least thats been my experience so far

since ive only played about 105 hours i know theres a lot left to experience but im greatly looking forward to it despite the slight performance drops in the big city areas which honestly hasnt been that bad for me the overall game itself has been a treat to play and makes me feel like im playing a natural continuation of the original title i have to applaud capcom for the consistency in the aesthetics the atmosphere and vibe of the game in general and the way theyve managed to maintain all the most important and useful elements of the original while giving subtle but nonetheless important updatesupgrades

i do hope capcom gets the message about the mtx and doesnt include them in future titles theyre unwelcome and unnecessary but because people keep buying them they keep including them

the player base has the power to shape the mtx landscape by not buying let the few whales out there waste their money on that garbage save your money buy the game dont buy the mtx send the message with your wallet that the game is welcome and necessary but the mtx arent

be smart

dont be a vocal but unhelpful review bomber doing that kills the ip faster than it reshapes the mtx landscape

thanks

#####

tldr dragons dogma 2 is a great game thats tied down by poor performance and undermined by a lot of the monetization thats haphazardly tacked on thanks to capcoms greed


i want to give a positive review for this game so badly but i cannot in good faith do that given the current state of the game specifically relating to performance issues on the pc port and the really weird monetization capcom included with the game  the game runs very inconsistently and i struggle to break 60fps in the open world and struggle even more to break 40 when in populated areas this is with the help of dlss and general graphics menu tweaking as for the microtransactionsid say its true that they are entirely unnecessary and you can earn everything ingame with ease in order to avoid them that does not however excuse their existence for two simple reasons it remains predatory for those with impulses to spend money on the games they play and that it runs counter to a lot of the unique gameplay aspects of dragons dogma 2 as well ie fast travel being a limited commodity but you can just bypass that with ingame purchases if you really wanted to despite it not being that expensive in game anyways

at its core dragons dogma 2 is a game i really enjoy and ill probably continue to play it because of that but as it stands given the games launch and capcoms halfassed tacking on of a whole laundry list of microtransactions right at the games launch i simply dont feel right in recommending it for the time being this certainly isnt the first time capcom has done this but for me it feels like the straw that broke the oxs back and im tired of constantly overlooking it or just saying that its the norm for capcom now  its insulting to their community and especially to their own devs who probably work their asses off to make unique games like this only to be overlooked by executives when it comes to widening their quarterly reports by any means possible even at the cost of their fans goodwill and the creative vision behind their games

#####

im not leaving a negative review for the poor debut performance or the micro transactions but the replayability the original dragons dogma is easily one of my top five favorite games of all time but this one doesnt really make the cut due to how bland ng is and how it ultimately kills the replayability of the game in fact the lack of any ng mode thats any more than an afterthought is exactly what i think will make this game quietly die out in the next 3 or 4 months and that really disappoints me

when you start a new game after beating it thats all it is a new game there is no added difficulty there are no enhanced or additional mobs there is no urdragon with competitive damage rankings and rewards for defeating it as a community you simply go about a new playthrough with your old gear and level sure you might get the most mileage doing one more run to complete some sidequests you might have missed or pick up some secret chest items you didnt find that will be useless because youre already juiced up but ultimately ng is currently pointless and really disappointing theres no hardcore or time trial runs either

the games ending in general really screams we didnt meet deadlines and had to cut stuff again and its really unfortunate because the first dd suffered a similar fate

#####

horrible release optimization is beyond shit 2540 fps max with mid hardware glitching textures audio stutters this game needs alot of patches for it to run smoothly on pc not worth it atm for this price im sure its a great game but wait for patches

extremely minor spoilers for story and post game

dragons dogma 2 can ultimately be summed up as a disappointment the short and sweet of it is that what people wanted was a fixed and expanded version of ddda and instead what we got was the first game with all of its problems released again it still has great combat but it doesnt have better combat and in every other regard it is a sidegrade at best or a downgrade

story they tried to make it better but in doing so they just made it more complicated and it ended up being worse dddas story is bad but it was a story this one is really not a story it is a beginning and an end 

characters again ddda did not have great characters by any stretch of the imagination but they were characters they were all stereotypes and predictable but a stereotype is more of a character than nothing and they each had quest lines that you could follow throughout the game so they felt more part of your journey where as in dd2 you speed through their quests if they even have any and then drop them for the rest of the playthrough 

the dragon going to separate this from characters because this is a particularly important one grigori in the first game was amazing his introduction managed to show both that he was a terrifying force of nature but also that he was a very intelligent being that seemed to have more intention than destruction for destructions sake he was intriguing and you felt his presence throughout the game everything you did was either in order to get to him or because of his workings in dd2 we dont even know the dragons name and you honestly forget it even exists until he randomly pops out at the end of the game grigori was an iconic character in ddda dd2s dragon is just another monster you fight

exploration it is not bad but it only a sidegrade dddas exploration was poor because there just wasnt much to explore dd2s exploration is bad because the stuff that you explore is all very generic you dont have the cool and unique dungeons you had in the first game it is all just a series of caves that look exactly the same

endgame the one saving grace this game could have had is its combat but in order to do so you would need something to use that combat on the normal world is simply too easy pretty quickly and what you really want is an everfallbitterblack isle similar to ddda we dont have that in dd2 instead there is a timed post game that acts similarly but essentially means that you are limited in your fun because it will run out and then you will have to slog through the entire game again just to get the point where the combat isnt completely braindead because of how easy the regular world enemies are

ultimately  the only reason to get this game is if you cannot stand the graphics of the first because otherwise there is no reason to pick this game up over the 12 year old original because frankly that one is just more fun with less flaws

good game lots to do optimisation leaves alot to be desired possibly wait for a patch or 2


#####

cpu optimization issues and aaa game companies a lesson well never learn from its made doubly bad with all the artificial difficulty of the save system and how often the game will freeze when doing something the devs never expected like walking away from a conversation with an npc and then a pawn speaks wait for the game to get some updates or some mods to fix it cause exploring do be fun

#####

how dare you hide 21 microtransactions until you have released the game

it is unacceptable to have this many microtransactions in a single player game regardless of how good it is

you should be ashamed of yourself

#####

the performance issues aside i have a 3090 ti and only manage around 40 fps this game is a mess thus far imagine my surprise when it was not a random bandit encounter that filtered me out as it did in dragons dogma 1 years ago a game i to this day enjoy but the absolutely disingenuous cash shop paying 80 for the deluxe edition seemed a small price i figure id get my moneys worth and then some however to my surprise i found out i could not only create one save file but to alter a characters appearance i would have to pay 2 each time in a single player game paired with the push towards a core system pawns being purchasable with said cash shop currency was the final nail in the coffin for me ive uninstalled the game and refunded and will continue to keep it on the back burner until capcom pulls their head out of the mud people coping and trying to use the excuse of well you can just earn the currency in game clearly do not see the writing on the wall here you are going to get to a point in which rates for the ingame currency are not going to be feasible for casually playing this exponential growth happens in all games with cash shop convenience systems dragons dogma 2 is no different

all the initial hype and expectations i had for the game died with this launch but well see in the coming months how things change hopefully for the better

#####

a great game that chose not to evolve

lets see the pattern
1 we have mystic spearhand and trickster but we lost mystic knight
2 we have medusa minotaur etc but we lost hydra cockatrice etc
3 we have better lantern and item usage qol but we lost inventory management qol
the list goes on 

graphics and physics are a straight upgrade from the first game but who thought it was a good idea to keep 1 character save after all the feedbacks from the first game not to mention a new game option was not there during launch period 
dragons dogma 2 enhanced everything from the first game including its negative perks if you never played the first game chances are you will like it more than us older fans especially dark arisen

make no mistake the game was fun and it was worth my money i enjoy it i adore it but every time i play the game the thought always comes into mind dragons dogma 2 could have been better but they choose not to

#####

they hid microtransactions from the public until launch

#####

5 minutes of shader compiling thats a good sign finally see the opening cutscene and go to make my character only to find i cant import the character data from the demo probably to make people buy the character editor token microtransaction real classy move capcom and putting that garbage in a single player game no less but whatever some minor optimizations are excusable and you can just ignore the microtransactions right if only that was it

the biggest nail in the coffin for me is the performance i cant get the framerate to stabilize on toaster settings in the tutorial area granted my pc is pretty middle of the road but even so i can run cyberpunk on decent settings and as a final cherry on top of this unfinished cake you apparently can only have one character per game and it saves data in the cloud meaning you cant reroll your character so better enjoy the one playthrough you get i guess  maybe theres a new game plus like the first game but i certainly didnt get far enough to see that 

edit you can in fact delete your character but it has to be done manually as in going to your steam game folder and deleting certain files and turning off cloud saves the fact that they chose to make it this way instead of simply making slots for new characters or letting you have an options to delete characters in menus it is an utterly baffling design decision 

and ya gotta love seeing denuvo the best optimized anticheat software on the market  which is only one of two anti cheats in place apparently nevermind how dumb having an anti cheat is in a single player game but the real scum comes from this in relation to the microtransaction store you can buy rift coins rc which is what you use to hire pawns the other members of your party  the higher level the pawn relative to yours the more rc it costs to recruit them normally you have to grindearn rc from playing the game but not if yo have a credit card so its not so much that they want to stop cheaters they just want people to pay them for the privilege to cheat or otherwise trivialize the experience and sure thats a really stupid way to use your money and most sane people arent going to do it  but its the intent that matters you know some slimy suit was salivating at the idea of some brainless whale throwing hundreds of dollars to hire an endgame pawn to coast through the game

and all this unpolished unoptimized scummily monetized mess for 70 usd modern aaa gaming baybee

shame cuz i was really looking forward to this game ever since its announcement and ive been hoping for a sequel for years  but i went in half expecting something like this to happen so i guess im technically not disappointed

seriously do not buy at least not until they optimize it andor it goes on sale  if they even bother to fix it at all looking at you wild hearts

this kind of developer behavior needs to stop  both shoveling out unfinished unoptimized games for full price and putting microtransaction anticonsumer garbage into every single facet of a game especially single player ones shame on you capcom refunded and unless things drastically change i wont be repurchasing and on top of that im gonna steer clear of capcom for the foreseeable future

#####

quite possibly one of the worst optimised games ive played i dont care about the microtransactions but the fps in capital is actually unplayable

#####

as a preface if you have not played ddda you might be better off getting it for 4 and waiting for dd2 to get optimized andor on sale

lots of fun exactly what ive been missing for years played the shit out of ddda on ps3 for sure will play the shit out of this one they delivered on the front of keeping it dragons dogma

performance is rightly criticised especially in the city playing on linux working day one on is it considered budget build now 3700x and 6700xt 2045 fps in the city but 60 with some dips to 50 in open world perfectly playable but not something to be settled withaccepted sincerely hope they give it their all in optimization otherwise it doesnt bode well for mh wilds and future of re engine in general

the amount of shit if gets for other things is quite baffling took a peek at some popular streamers and found it ridiculous 
some kept saying you can only use fast travel or make a new character by paying one even claimed to his 10k viewers you cant manually save and somehow people believed it if they dont make it up on the fly to ride the deserved performance issues related hate train then i feel bad for their regular viewers
might be controversial but people are blowing microtransactions out of proportions they are a complete waste of money since you can get all actually useful items ingame yet somehow it clearly works since capcom keeps adding this kind of mtx in their games i dont buy mtx find them bad in general but if you get milked buying this quite frankly you deserve it

#####

let me just preface this by saying that this game is fun i am about halfway thorough the main story explored a lot of the map and still looking forward to playing every day even with the extremely lacklustre enemy variety

however i cannot recommend the game for its current price just wait until you can get it at least 50 off by that time they might even optimise it and maybe add some new content although i doubt it

if you dont care about the price and have a good pc buy it and you will have fun playing it simple as that

#####

it was definitely possible if not outright likely this sequel would not be dragons dogma the game design could have died a death by a thousand antithetical cuts at the hands of suits and contemporary standards but for better or worse heres dragons dogma 2 they didnt mess with it

you will jump and climb on giant monsters and stab them in the eye while stuffing potatoes into your face you will hear your pawn remark about the same ladder in vernworth more times than youve heard hello in your lifetime the story is anemic and arbitrary forgetting its own beats the characters are plentiful but cardboard there are two saves you will lose pawns to terrain despite your best micromanaging your pawn will pick up all your worst combat habits and embarrass you in front of strangers online progression scaling is lackluster you will feel hopelessly desperate at the beginning only to wake up one level and feel like god fast travel is artificially limited but similarly scaled where suddenly you are awash in ferrystones big mob hunting is made more tedious by the large map and minotaurs are the griffins of this title it feels like quests are still easy to bungle due to time progress or simply missing them and most importantly all of this is gift wrapped in the meta of the dragons literal dogma so of course everything i just mentioned is thematically deliberate and why theres no 2 in the main menu title

frankly it was everything i wanted and once again my complaint is give me more

but thats obviously not my only complaint i actually didnt have many crashes in 100 hours but the game still runs like molten molasses framerates are mostly fine in the wilderness but low in cities which is mildly problematic later on normally this would be least concern easiest fixed but the fact the game shipped like this that they thought even the poor performance on the ps5 was acceptable hints that maybe thats not the case beaucoup hardware wont save you here something is fundamentally wrong and its currently setting your cpu on fire while the frames hitch

if you like dragons dogma warts and all and circumstances have prevented you from buying it at release try it anyway i found it playable on my potato rig once i acclimated to the framerate dips if you think you could like dragons dogma play dark arisen instead as the price point for curiosity is lower 5 bucks on sale usually and it wont melt your rig if you didnt like dragons dogma 1 this isnt going to change your mind and youd just be engaging the definition of insanity

#####

this game is being hold back from greatness by 2 things in my opinion first is optimization the game runs well in the wild with a few exceptions of stuttering the moment you reach a city it just feels awful the cities are very good looking but because of the bad city optimization i just buy my items and leave asap the second thing holding this game back is skill slots the gameplay for the first 2030 hours is fun but since you are stuck with only 4 skill slots it can get repetitive after a while i thought unlocking the warfarer would make the game more fun but it sucks in general it went from jack of all trades to jack of some trades being limited to only 3 skills across the board  so at the end of the day even if you are a fan of dragons dogma i would wait a couple of weeks for bugs and optimization to be fixed before buying

ps my most fun classes would be either thief or mystic spearhand
pss rip strider class i thought warfarer would have been able to do you justice but i was wrong

#####

for fans of the original 2012 release

this game is a firm sidegrade in terms of combat repeatability and storytelling  even the thing that i shall not spoil is a sidegrade to what we had in dragons dogma 1  it follows in line with the resident evil remakes in terms of having slightly less janky fair systems that limit some of the wildly broken movesets from the first game while also reducing your skill roster to 4 skills instead of 6 and leaving out a lot of the high magicks and holy enchantments holy enchants are now baked into certain weapons iirc while slightly retelling the story of gransys into that of vermunds and battahls  at its current state performance qol and enemy varieties are lacking compared to dd1  i wouldnt buy it for at least two months as we wait for a sale  patches to address these issues

for new players

its a fairly standard action fantasy rpg that puts a large emphasis on actionbased combat rather than the usual turnbased numberticking that you see from other jrpgs  to that end you are given several classes with diverse fighting styles botcontrolled allies called pawns that can adapt to your fighting style over the course of several hours and a sprawling world full of winding roads deep dungeons and scattering of towns and settlements to help

its not revolutionary its not wowing it just does the action part really well  climbing larger enemies grappling small ones to set them up for finishers tossing especially small enemies into explosive barrels and off cliffsides etc are all fair game  it definitely doesnt have baldurs gate level of complexity and creativity in terms of questlines and character interactions but the voice acting and localization is solid

for all its pluses it does carry mechanics that put it in line with the older rpgs that it takes inspiration from
 single save files to avoid savescumming
 multiple quest endings that allow for failures to persist in the players world
 a severe lack of fast travel points to emphasize the journey and timeliness
 essential npc deaths you can accumulate revive stones and visit the mortuary to revive important quest npcs but the fact that they can still die in things like random monster attacks on towns means youll be on edge even in town

its not necessarily a bad thing these features do make things feel more urgent and grave just like older crpgs 

there are a few dealbreakers

 dragonsplague which essentially exists to destroy your save file if you ignore your pawn becoming disobedient and then holds that very same save file hostage by offering you an easy way out by selling you microtransaction revive stones to you  so you can you know revive the entire town that was nuked because you didnt know what dragonsplague would do as a terminal effect  its a bit scummy imo since the eternal wakestone isnt omnipotent
 lack of new game button on release forces people to stay locked in save files the only way to manually remove old save files is to dig into the userdata folder on steam and find the right folder with which to delete those bin files  especially bad for players who tinkered with the character creator and found out the character creator is not 11 with the actual games lighting environs
 abysmal cpubound performance  rumor has it that a certain resizable bar setting is what clogs performance but essentially even the best consumer cpus cannot run this game above 90 fpsin desolate empty areas  cities and towns are always going to be a sub 60 fps experience with plenty of stuttering

verdict again wait for a month or two to let the patches roll in and fix the game before giving this game a try  as of 3252024 i do not recommend this game to most people except those who are willing to put up with the dealbreakers

#####

 no fov slider
 constant dips below 60fps
 microtransactions in a 70 sp game

will give this one a month or two and try again

#####

game runs terribly with a better than average rig wait for a sale i couldnt refund the game so if i can save some one here then it will be worth it

#####

refunded my preorder with disappointment was excited for this release but as these publishers continue to push money grabbing tactics i will no longer be participating in their business model the microtransactions and the fact they hid them until launch makes me appreciative of steams refund policy and willing to go against my better judgement and preorder

as for the optimization issues i cant speak on as i only made it 40 minutes in with only issue long initial launch of the game

maybe on a steam sale in a few yearsbut honestly ill probably have forgotten about the game by then

#####

secretly launching a plethora of micro transactions right after the game officially launches
horrible pc performance regardless of hardware
no way to delete your save game and start again

capcom has fallen real hard since the original dragons dogma stay away

update after 30 hours

still negative all the best weapons and armours in the game are store bought finally found a sweet new bow in a chest congrats its only 75 of the damage of the bow you bought off a vendor

story is hilarious 12 of the games main story consists of you sneaking around a castle you can just run everywhere in there with whatever gear you have on and complete it 

the world itself is essentially long corridors stretching into a small hub then more corridors the world is dead npcs have 12 things theyll do all day and night

the only saving grace is the combat its fun

#####

single player game microtransactions yes i know you can earn the ability to edit your character ingame and i know capcom has done this before it doesnt mean its acceptable and the amount of people i see trying to defend singleplayer microtransactions just makes me sad it crosses a line im not comfortable with and its only going to get worse from here friends c

gameplay seemed okay from the little i saw it does not have optimization that would be expected of a 70 game

#####

the original was charming because it was a rushed and obviously flawed rpg with some good ideas that the cult fanbase wanted to see a sequel expand upon pawns night being dangerous vocations that you can swap as needed

the sequel fails to grow with those ideas in any meaningful way and most offensively introduces new problems that are the result of bad design choices that could not have been made with fun or engagement in mind

vocations 
 the most egregious thing here some vocations have been removed entirely mystic knight assassin many vocations that made it into the game have been gutted  you have 4 skills instead of 6 and the vocations in this game are locked to a weapon type no more daggers for magick archer trickster in particular has no place in this game and pisses me off every time i think about the fact they spent time developing that instead of adding classes anyone might actually want to play

enemy variety
 thinking about this prompted me to write this negative review i dont even know why they released a sequel im 20 hours in and ive fought maybe 7 enemy types the majority of those are reskins from the first game you will be fighting wolves and goblins for 70 of the combat when you arent doing that youll be running around watching your arisen gasp for air every 20 feet

pawns
 pretty much the same as the first game considering the first game came out 12 years ago this isnt a good look the system has not been expanded upon in any way im currently level 32 and the voice lines are already repeating so much that its becoming obnoxious itsuno couldnt think of anything else the pawns might say in the last 12 years the dragonplague stuff hasnt impacted me personally but i find it to be a strange idea that goes against the spirit of what made the pawn system such a hit in the first place

story
 terrible not improved in any way barely makes sense and not in a good way like your typical jrpg in a bad way like you backtrack for 30 minutes to go talk to a guy whose name you cant remember who tells you to pick up rocks for him

music
 barely noticing it and music is one of those things that can make or break a game for me a real shame that 2024s flagship fantasy rpg release might as well not have a soundtrack

mtx 
 i really dont give a shit about mtx companies want to make money developers need funding to develop games id buy them if i liked the game whats most disappointing about this launch is the real issues with the core game are barely getting discussed in favor of what will get the most likesclicksgamer cloutwowie kazowiesreddit upvotes

performance
 im sure its abysmal for others im unaffected because i am fortunate to have a topoftheline pc but i would be unable to even play this on my previous pc i dont hit 144 fps on max settings 1920x1080 even in the darkest smallest cave i can find unacceptable for a game that also looks inferior to the witcher 3 9 years ago or elden ring 2 years ago

just play the original i am likely to finish this one but i cant recommend it to anyone unless you are a huge rpg fan with an empty backlog i wish i liked it more i hope they can fix dd2 with a dark arisen equivalent but we paid 70 for a game at launch that is inferior to its predecessor and im getting to the point as a timeconscious consumer that being told to hope for a fix later just isnt enough


#####

good games dont need fast travel proceeds to sell port crystals for additional money

#####

its just dd1  but better also protip dont buy any of the microtransactions all of those items are readily available ingame

about performance dd2 is a very cpuheavy game it seems try going to task manager  details  find dd2 and set priority to high anecdotal reports say you can gain anywhere from 10 fps to double or triple fps in the city areas

#####

me
butchered all the npcs to boost fps

my pawn 
twas sound judgment arisen this was the only way

#####

ok initially i was going to give this a thumbs up but seeing just how many microtransactions there are for a singleplayer game that i bought the highend edition for  i dont think i can honestly support the game  there are plenty of singleplayer games that offer microtransactions i realize but this one is a total cash cow  from my understanding you cant even make a second character which i wanted to do to try each class  i will not spend the money on microtransactions just because a singleplayer game is trying to milk me repeatedly  im not too fond of it because the first game was one of my alltime mostplayed console games

#####

i fell in love with this weird clunky nonoptimised adventure

#####

game is amazing but its supposed to be a singleplayer game noone should care what you do with your copy of the game and these anti tampering tools dont make any sense hiring other peoples pawns doesnt justify this game having antitampering tools and microtransactions

#####

i didnt play the first dragons dogma so i wasnt really following dd2s development until i heard about it a few weeks before release that said it didnt take me long to pour over all the early access previews from reviewers and the likes and i was stoked to try it out

then after prepurchasing the deluxe edition i went to install it today and saw a whole page dedicated to its micro transactions in the store how do you even have the nerve to put any kind of micro transactions in an already fully priced single player game its so wild to me 

this shameless money grubbing capitalist investor direction that big studios are going now will be the death of them i only booted the game up once so that i could leave this review anything that the game couldve been is soured by the wholly unnecessary disgusting micro transactions 

sad really i was stoked to play it guess ill just play stardew valley while i wait for better studios games like no rest for the wicked and elden rings expac 

pitiful dont be a sheep dont support this type of monetization especially given the context of it being a fully priced single player game do not support monetization like this

#####

dragons dogma 2 is off to a horrible startrelease below i will write a small pointbypoint reasoning to this usually i write an in depth review but i need to get this out there before people waste their money

h1b consissues right now bh1
 optimisation is beyond abysmal i am getting 100 fps after i kill the npcs and i have top end pc parts what before i kill the npcs i get roughly 3070 fps with severe drops when i run or enter a settlement with people
 glitching textures
audio stutters
you cannot reedit your character if you make a mistake or decide you want to change what you look like 
b edit b apparently you need to progress pretty decently into the game to be able to reedit your character why why not just let us do it at the main menu like every other game
 it costs 2 to edit your character appearance on a singleplayer game after i spent 60 on it what
 your character appearance is on their servers so deleting your save files from your pc files  wherever they are  steamuserdatanumber2054970remotewin64_save and making edits within the character creator even with cloud saves off does not apply to your ingame character
no fov slider 
b edit bgot a comment in my review section saying that it has a camera slider a camera slider is not an fov slider and it does not act like an actual fov slider you can put it up but it is not good at all
 constant dips below 60fps
 no option to restart your game once you start it below i will show you a screenshot of the main menu
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3195293169

h1b my verdict bh1
as of right now release day 220324  avoid the game for a few months or even a few years

it appears the the majority of people that are positively reviewing the game are either writing dumb funny little things to do with lore or are people that say stuff like idiot traps when you are supposed to know everything about the game

i will come back to dragons dogma 2 when they let you delete your saves and restart the game fix performance and add in an fov slider camera sliders do not count as some idiot mentioned

#####

dragons dogma 2 embraces the quirks that made the first game one of my favorites and i highly recommend picking this one up its feels awesome picking up small foes and chucking them off cliffs the pawns congratulating you on well done kills climbing gigantic ogres and planting charges on their face to detonate and clinging on the backs of griffons to make the trip to nests to loot 

some notes
1 if you didnt like the first game i dont think youll like this one its everything that game was 
2 performance issues the frame rates in town can vary quite significantly theyre not as terrible as folks online whine about but its not great either there are ways to reduce this like limiting your frame rate from the 120fps you dont really need to 7560 so the drops dont drop as much ive had no crashes or any weird bugs yet the randomly spawning villagers laughable they should probably work on that
3 you should use a controller keyboard and mouse are passable barely just use a controller sit back relax a little
4 the microtransactions are eyerolling none of them are necessary all of them can be earned in game should you want and modders have already created a way to spawn any of them you want to get super quickly dont buy them if youre thinking about buying them please dont rewarding this sort of microtransaction just means we shall continue to get more its definitely a publisher call over a developer one

#####

im a reviewer who got an early copy of this game i was extremely impressed with it and it was reflected in my written review however putting microtransactions into a 70 game after launch and after the reviews have come out is an extremely anticonsumer move so i just leave this negative review here to show how disappointed im in you capcom not to mention your horrendous optimization

#####

do not buy this atm

absolute dogh1t performance because engine wasnt made for open world and bottlenecks itself
 visuals are mid at best really disappointing considering how good re games look
forgot to add dlss looks like an massive blurry mess really poorly implemented
 youll have to pay to edit your characters and pawns capcom literally makes you pay for qol stuff in a single player game disgusting 
 you can only have one character new game is impossible atm

do not buy until they fix all of this

#####

i have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game for years fucking years i finally get to play today and went into it with a meme character that i made in discord with buddies an hour later i decide i want to start over with a real character 

this is not possible i have to disable steam cloud saves and manually delete my save file to get the game to register a new game which not only starts over but discards all graphical settings and first start configurations what the fuck capcom then i check the fucking store and see that these grubby mother fuckers are selling a 2 dollar change your appearance book 

actual fucking filth im sure the game is good im sure i would have a blast with a character i actually like to use but just on principle fuck you im not playing your steaming pile of dogshit

#####

h1 short version joke review h1
we have a sphinx mommy in the game if i could give eternal bond for her i would fr 
whoever was behind her is a true champ she gets aggroed if you grab the big milkers she flees if you hit her face aka  ruins her skincare best boss in the game hands down
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3200423643

h1 honest review spoiler free h1
so this game followed the footstep of the first game in some aspects this game is an improvement in other aspects this game is a let down at least for me the good traits of the game are bigger than the downsides

h3 the positive traits h3 
exploration of the game was solid one of the best i had since ive played skyrim for the first time it was genuinely fun exploring the biomas fighting the ambushes and getting to random places with nice loots i changed pawns very often and the improvement in the ai of the pawns and the enemies was really nice

the story itself isnt linked for the first game and in fact is better explained in this game theres a lot of dialogues which explains from the beginning to the end of the why are you doing this in the first place you may in fact dislike the end of the game for example but the writing itself was an improvement of the first game dragons dogma 

combat wise you have some hidden mechanics such as medusa head being a hitkill weapon accessory to any enemy in the game its forsaken normal enemies loots but faster xp farming go brrrrrrr ok you want that sweet loot use mystic archer maister skill it one shot most enemies in the game  yet what i had the most fun was the jedi spearhand you literally fight like a jedi in dragons dogma with that haahaha and my fav class was warfarer drip check with any weapon

psa hire a pawn mage with celestial peon its the best support skill in the game i think its legit the best skill any team pawn could have 

h3  negative traits h3
 denuvo enough said about that

 mtx are totally optional doesnt impact the gameplay its for lazy gamer cheat feature capcom is doing this since dmc5 doesnt warrant a negative review in my opinion as everything they sold as dlc you get in the game i had literally 7 fast travel portcrystal and 40 ferrystone in my run so dont waste your money in rubbish

 i got the deluxe edition due to the ost dd2 ost is fine ending song was beatiful but the general ost of the game i found worse than the first game i switched bgm to the original game and i had a blast playing the game feel a bit sad due to only liking 2 bgm of dd2 it is what it is 

 in dragons dogma 1 we had around 68 skills avaible to use in dragons 2 every class only has 4 slots this was a downgrade a massive one at that luckily the mod saints of nexus made a mod which unlocks 8 skills slots for the arisen i genuinely wish this game gets an update for that and devs change to 8 skill slots cause gameplay became repetitive if you use big dps skills theres some skills which doesnt do a lot of damage  but like you could run with a greatsword and impale at the wall a big fatass lizard and that was dope af

 i have a strong issue about the fashion in the game ive beaten the game with warrior gear the best armors i could find without spending wc crystals are legit underwear as armors i literally beat the game with two skimp outfits cause they had better stats than fullplate armor mind ya it was somewhat funny seeing my 6 feet tall arisen with a leather underpants smashing a dragoni felt like conan in some sense i was legit like  kek  not to speak about my pawn being useful af as a warrior or an archer  but im planning to change her to archer cause the clothes arent so skimpy endgame gear 

h1 the 12y of waiting for a sequel was worth it h1

#####

performance is pretty bad and they are somehow shocked people are mad about microtransactions even though theres been a known distaste for them for over 10 years now get that shit out how many times do we have to say it

#####

you do not have to spend 199 to change the look of your character
you spend 500 rc which you get from killing monsters or pawnrelated things at the pawn guild vendor to get an item that you bring to the barber who gives you the option to change your appearance with it yes change anything about your character
i dont agree with the mtx i hate the performance issues and its scummy for them to just drop all this mtx without mentioning it before but reviewers are wrong about the 199 appearance change

 i am editing this to add more context now that ive played more of the game and have seen that the comments on this absolutely blew up and i never apologized for anything people calling me an apologist after i said i dont agree with the mtx these are the people you dont need to be listening to critical thought and nuance is not in their capabilities

came back like 24 hours later and saw this blow up jesus christ people let me clear some things and because this got nearly 300 comments in under a day idk if ill read any responses cause i got horizon fw this game south park snow day and helldivers 2 to play

1 i still enjoy the game i have not and will not spend a dime on the microtransactions if it wasnt for steam listing it on the library page when you go to launch the game you would not know mtx were even in this game there are 0 indicators in the entire game that there are any microtransactions i can support the game without supporting mtx by simple not buying the mtx this is an extremely basic level of nuance that any sensible person can understand if you cant understand it then youre not being sensible

2 the performance is probably the thing that pisses me off the most i played jedi survivor and was heart broken at its performance however this is better than jedi survivor if you get into a town youll get drops but youll rarely ever get into a fight in a town and if you do you can just run away

3 this game is likely founded on the same principle that dd1 was they want you to run new game plus that might be why they thought you didnt need several saves because you would just keep running the game over and over animal crossing did the same thing with only one save on the entire switch and yet didnt receive a fraction of this outrage im not excusing it but this one doesnt affect me at all so im not going to sit here and say im outraged by it because id be lying it just doesnt affect me or my experience

4 since people are really confused as to why i still put positive review ill mention the things i like im loving the combat obviously im a ddda fan and ive already maxed out mystic spearhand along with getting its master vocational skill ive also played a lot of the other vocations and each one plays differently and uses different strategies i absolutely love that you can grab the legs of monsters and push them off balance and your pawns will come up to help you push theres a bunch of cool added features like that in the combat quite simply if you enjoyed dddas combat youre gonna love this ones combat the performance issues really arent a problem outside of townsnpc heavy locations but im running a 3080ti and 5800x so while i dont have top hardware the game still runs perfectly fine at mostly maxed out settings with dlss on quality and rt on outside of npcheavy locations even when im fighting a dragon and an ogre at the same time the frames are flawless

last note i agree capcom needs to do better but i had all of this rage that you all are showing last year when hogwarts legacy and jedi survivor launched to absolute dog shit performance issues but none of you cared enough to make the scene youre making now and they didnt care to fix them that was the time to make this an issue out of the industry but you all slept so im not riding the ragewagon anymore im just enjoying the gameplay

oh also i didnt say that it doesnt have a 199 appearance change dlc i just said you dont have to buy it to change your appearance but some people having reading problems i guess

#####

if you enjoyed the first game you will love this one they have taken everything the first game did well and improved upon it that being said there are still some issues with the game when you enters large cities such as vernworth you will lose frames i consistently drop from 60fps to 30fps within vernworth i have seen many creators say this is a memory leak issue that can easily be patched later but i am unsure of the truth of that claim 

in regards to the microtransactions it is unfortunate that they exist however every item apart from the character edit item is extremely easy to obtain in game by simply walking around with pawns you will receive wakestones you can find portcrystals throughout the game and they respawn in new game allowing you to place one at every location you could ever want to travel to 

the gameplay is topnotch just like the first game it has exciting combat fun to fight monsters and the pawn system is extremely fun to use if the fps issues are a dealbreaker for you i would wait a while before buying the game to see if they fix it but the items you can buy through microtransactions are entirely unnecessary and you are wasting your money if you buy them if you are worried about messing up how your character looks download the free character creation tool and spend as much time as you want perfecting it the character and pawn you make there carry over to the game if you are worried about choosing the wrong class dont be because you are meant to try out every class and you can swap at vocation guilds 

tldr gameplay is great there are some fps issues that need to be fixed the microtransactions suck but all the items you can buy with them are unnecessary to the game

edit i have now beaten this game twice and achieved both endings here are my final and updated thoughts on dragons dogma 2 i still think the gameplay is great i still think the microtransactions are annoying but a nonissue what i mainly want to talk about are where dd2 fails to live up to its predecessor 

ddda dd1 was one of my favorite games of all time because of its amazing combat difficulty and replayability while dd2 keeps this great gameplay it has lost both the difficulty and the replayability that made the first game so near and dear to my heart 

first i would like to talk about difficulty plainly put this game is incredibly easy if you played the first game when you get the true ending it shows you some statistics from your playthrough times died is one of them i died a grand total of one time in my current 35 hours of gameplay this death also was not while fighting but it came from fall damage when i was running around at night without paying attention all bosses including the final boss fight with the dragon are disappointingly easy even before i went into new game i got to the dragon for the first time and my sorcerer pawn cast a single spell to kill her the second time i killed him in two thief skills it was a major letdown 

the poor replayability ties in with the difficulty there is no bonus content to do upon new game the monsters do not get harder nor are there new monsters to fight which would be my preferred fix you just replay the game a second time now this is how a lot of games new game work so whats the problem here the terrible story 

i was never expecting a marvel of writing when it came to the story telling of this game the first games story was told poorly too the difference is that beneath the bad portrayal of it the first dragons dogma had a super interesting story you just had to do some digging to uncover it sort of like how there are hundreds if not thousands of lore videos on the souls series there is nothing extra really going on in dd2 the story is what it is and its bad my first playthrough took me twenty hours to complete but i could have done it much faster if i had not grinded to get every vocation and get several to max rank i think i could have finished the game in as little as fifteen hours that is incredibly short the worst part is how much the story falls off the story in the beginning of the game in vernworth is not great but its trying once you are told to leave for battahl the story is essentially over you only do one quest for the city of battahl and then you fuck off to go do random shit in the world 

overall i still like this game i dont regret spending my money on it but know that this game is worse than the first game and is therefore a disappointment considering itsuno hyped this as what the first game was supposed to be

#####

the state of this game in general and especially on pc is atrocious
heres a list of every issue with the game so far

list
 microtransactions that were shoved into the game after reviews dropped this is scummy in of itself

 piss poor optimization on top of denuvo capcoms own antidebugging drm the thing that was causing stuttering in re8 enigma antimodding drm and anticheat on a singleplayer game because capcom hates modders doing their job for them

 much like how capcom locked resident evils vr modes behind a playstation exclusivity paywall and never bringing devil may cry 5 se to pc literal pawns in this game are locked behind a playstation 5 exclusivity paywall so you cant throw the annoying capcom shill sphere hunter off a cliff in this game if youre playing on pc or xbox 

 for those wondering the poor optimization is just made worse on proton and the steam deck where it runs at a small fraction of what it should be running at with 30 cpugpu utilization compared to windows

 dlss 3 and fsr 3 frame generation are disabled despite being available in the games code theres already a modified dll from puredark that enables dlss 3 back into the game even then the game has some crashing problems with it and attempting to use it in conjunction with lukefzs fsr2fsr3 mod will result in the game autodeleting the files and if you set those as readonly to prevent the game from deleting them the game will just outright crash why the hell the game didnt ship with fsr 3 and dlss 3 frame generation support out of the box when it runs like liquid ass is beyond me

 crashing problems the game froze my entire system once on the desktop setup which i have holoiso installed on and it made my laptop lose video signal and become unresponsive on windows the game also has a tendency of freezing and becoming completely unresponsive during the shader compilation process in the beginning of the game its not just a operating system issue something is inherently wrong with how the game is coded and thats causing problems

 height slider cannot go below a certain height because of terminally online twitter slacktivists either tradcaths that also cry about violent video games or marxists upset that they have to result to astroturfing and localization to control a culture without their rot influencing it crying about fictional characters and they desperately want to keep their esgsocial responsibility corporate social credit score from blackrockvanguard score up much like the changes they made to re4 remake and street fighter 6 solely for this

 zoomer haircuts and eceleb pawns in a fantasy rpg nobody wants to look like faze jarvis and nobody wants asmongold or shills like sphere hunter and maxmillian dood in their fantasy rpg

 hdr display support is bugged out on pc at least for some users

 hardcoded key bindings and mouse acceleration always on

 no automatic prompts option that detects if you have a playstation controller connected you have to manually change an ingame option tucked away in the settings menu for this

 deleting your gamesave will literally cause it to brick your steam account and prevent you from playing dragons dogma 2 further because some bonehead at capcom decided to tie denuvo certificates to save files for some reason
list

this game is literally the epitome of everything wrong with modern gaming the gameplay itself is fun albeit not as much as the first game but the initial first impressions are completely marred from everything else involving the game they should have just delayed the game wait for a sale and for the devs to patch all of the problems or to at least reverse their stance on modding because modders are the unsung heroes of modern gaming at this point before buying this im glad family sharing exists

i guess third time was indeed the charm for gurrella games regarding the horizon games and how they end up constantly releasing something horizon related when more anticipated games are releasing the twist we never saw coming just go and buy forbidden west and save 10 instead of buying this straight away if youre insistent on playing aaa slop

edit since submitting this review my game has crashed on three separate occasions
and im willing to bet that the dlss to fsr 3 framegen mod attempts i did counted as machine activations to denuvo so i cant actually try to play the game again until tomorrow

why do you guys insist on milking your audience dry of their money  did you guys really think its not going to come back and bite you in the end  look at all the people refunding  if you dont fix this and fix it fast i will be doing the same thing  you guys have till the end of this weekend  i cant even restart a new character  you charged full price and then threw micro transactions in the day it came out because you knew you werent going to get buyers if you did it any earlier  words cant even explain how angry i am with the gaming industry

h1 a review about actual gameplay and why dd2 is not worth your  h1

performance and microtransaction issues put aside dd2 will eventually disappoint you why despite the first 10 hours feeling magical you will realize you have experienced the majority of what the game has to offer at this point details below
list
monsters do not scale the game gets linearly easier the longer you play with no cap you can tell why this will become an issue over time

a massive lack of enemy types to fight renders the very good foundation of gameplay mechanics useless you will fight wolves goblins or harpies for 95 of your travels traveling will be 90 of your gameplay time due to the directors decision to not include reliable fast travel or movement enhancers of any sort fighting goblins at the start is fine but when you have end game gear and skills and all thats avalilable to fight is still goblins and wolves eventually you will ignore them and not want to fight anymore because there is no reward its repetitive and just not fun anymore

okay so every game has annoying small fry what about the cool bosses or other times the game challenges you the game fails to deliver here as well offering a total of 5 large mobs that will randomly appear in the world they are cool at first but also do not scale and eventually become just as repetitive for a game that mandates you to enjoy long travels you will realize all of the above makes traveling nothing more than a chore 

fine so the long hyped traveling in this game turned out to suck but the game must have highlights between your travels with quests and such right well initially it will feel that way but you will realize eventually that there arent enough quests or side quests to keep you engaged enough for the 70 price tag the story spends time developing characters and ends in the worst most abrupt obviously rushed way possible without major spoilers all i can say is that one of the characters on the front box art of the game gets no more than 30 seconds of screen time absurd the second you make it to the second major city it feels like capcom told the developers we ran out of money end all your work on this game in the next week its especially bad because all the enemies in the second area are just reskins of the enemies in the first area absurd for a 70 game 
list

tldr the enormous lack of content wild lack of enemy variety absurd repetitiveness of travel no real endgame and a comically rushed rpg story make this game absolutely not worth your 70usd factor in the abysmal performance on pc and the decision to include microtransactions in a full price single player game and the verdict is obvious

h2 rating 3510 do not buy h2

the game is just a bait and switch and as soon as you stop enjoying it it will be too late to refund it



#####

this games microtransactions are just insulting i cant make a 2nd character for a 70 game are you kidding me i was really looking forward to this game but i must have some principles so i just returned it capcom can buy a good review for 199

#####

for those of you who feel like microtransactions are fine because it doesnt affect them then how did we get to this point well here we are look at this mess we deserve what we tolerate ignoring them will only make things worse take a look at where we are now and then 10 years ago where do you think well be in 10 years if we continue to tolerate this behavior

i took a gamble on buying this game from a key site for 50 knowing i wouldnt be able return it because i had played and beat dd1 on 3 separate platforms as i loved it that much my bad i guess 

this will be the last aaa game from a publicly traded company i buy at launch or at all for that matter trust should be earned not given theres no reason for loyalty anymore with how they treat us my backlog will last several lifetimes anyway and the current state of gaming disgusts me 

shame on you capcom you took advantage of your fan base you rushed the game out to get people to test for you to cut costs then stomped on their good graces for 399 for shame

#####

pro you can refund it

cons
 microtransactions in singleplayer game
 gameplay designed to support mtx purchases
 denuvo
 poor optimization crashes lag  rtx 4090  i9 13900k  32gb ram
 one save file 
 open world gameplay restricted linear paths no water crossing and redundant npc ambushes from the same handful of enemies
 dull story quests and interactions that make you want to run through the game to conclude the experience
 not even mods make this enjoyable

i have ihighi tolerance for bad performance ive played gotham knights before the patches hogwarts legacy at launch wild hearts forspoken bg3s act 3 before the patches monster hunter world ib which is still a terrible port to this day believe me when i say iive seen it alli dragons dogma 2s technical performance is such a miserable trainwreck that even my resilience to these problems couldnt withstand it i will not rescind my review at any point in the future because individuals who publish products in this state are swindlers 

addendum game still has 4 combat skills only dragons dogma had a great proof of concept for a combat system that could be expanded into something truly great yet here is a sequel with no improvement whatsoever im about 4 hours into the game and im struggling to name a single upgrade over the original that isnt the new graphics

#####

just started the game and saw the micro transaction real money shop pure greed and evil 

microtransactions in a 70 single player gamecant delete save data start a new game you have to pay 2 dollars to try again because you dont like how your character looks or want to try a new class heard about paytowin items in the store for money  hire pawns or purchase special items are for money now pay real money for quick travel  this is so evil  

also heard about really bad performance but i did not get to gameplay because after seeing the shop and all the disgusting microtransations  i closed the game and now im writting this review and then im refunding this predatory horrible disappointment of a game 

the leadership  that choose and pushed this kind of evil in the game deserve to be firedout of a cannon into the sun 

i guess 70 wasnt enough for capcom now i will refund this game and never look at it again  so there you go capcom because of your greed and evil nature now you have 0 from me instead of 70  and you not just lost a fan with this you gained a enemy

#####

a really amazing game bogged down by poor performance 4k dlss high preset rtx on on an rtx4080 rig with lots of stutters in cities scummy day 1 micro transactions released to avoid negative reviews from the gaming press will rebuy once they fix all the issues and do away with these greedy practices

#####

im liking the game a lot honestly but there are a couple outrageous things that stop me for giving it a thumbs up

the extremely silly microtransactions cheat codes all of those items can be get fairly easy in the game so please dont buy any i really rather for them to remove them because is scaring a lot of people away from trying the game

the game performance is really iffy no matter if i maxed out or put my graphics at bare minumum the frames stay the exact same as a note i have an rtx3060 which never given me any issues with current gen games

denuvo if you reinstall the game in too many devices say goodbye to play this thing likely part of the reason of the poor performance basically maleware

#####



#####

poor optimization 
scummy microtransactions added postlaunch 
no way to restart game 
gamebreaking bugs 
only one character can be created which is permanent



refund requested

#####

great rpg fantasy experience with heavily focused on journey and exploration role play and consequences also magically chaos and brutal combat

dragon dogma 2 offers countless hours of playtime and replayability that eliminating any sense of repetitiveness with some refined good aspect of unusual ideas uniquenes and eccentricities from previous game but this also become as doubleedged sword that possible to alienate some players however if you loves the the first game you shouldnt even begin to hesitate this is everything that dragons dogma wanted to be back in 2012 massive open world with little of poi indicators smart ai pawns and great boss battle combat 

there are a lot technical and monetization problems that became concern to some people 
 my rig r5 5700x  rtx 4070 ti 4050 fps in capital and 8090 fps in overworld 2k high dlss quality full slider upscaling
 no paywall in microtransaction you can farm rc to buy art of metamorphosis book to change character appearance and farm gold to buy makeshift gaol key if you are arrested
 no game breaking bug and no single crash in 16 hours playtime maybe im lucky

its not a perfect game but somehow those technical performance didnt stop me from having a blast and truly immerse myself in massive uncertain open world as arisen with unforgettable moment and exciting adventure

theyre masterworks all you cantt go wrong

#####

will update this as i go

pros

combat mechanics and animations related to combat are flawless everything flows into each strike and bash  the fact that there is multiple ways to get a cyclops to fall over rather then just powershotting its feet is great

enemies have a good vareity goblins in groups have diffrent purposes they arent all the same

the world is large and feels alive

stort so far is good and im itching to go back in

cons

edit 1 as much as i love the combat and the world of dragons dogma the game is a tad bit short in terms of actual content end fight with grigori was sadly my biggest let down of the entire game the main dragons of the game the mascot is flat and bland and gets no real buildup itsuno what the actual fck you made him worse than in the original unmoored world was fun tho

performance is lacking in bigger citys even on fsr or dlss its playable but its a tad bit annyoing dippin below 25fps on a highend rig

thoughts

i see alot of review that are negative for no real reason other than performance 
the microtransactions are laughable took my pawn 5h of gametime to get over 10k you can bearly buy 10k rc in the store dogma 1 had it to and you could completely ignore it

growth curve is subjective first 3h you could easily feel overwhelmed by something a straw stronger than a normal goblin 5h in goblins are mince meat its a power fantasy not dark souls

#####

my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

#####

cant create a new game after making your first character nothing more to say

edit now that capcom has promised an update to fix this really stupid and confusing issue ill give a bit more effort into a review 

personally i think the game is very fun and rewarding to play my only issue now would be how terrible the performance is me with an i513600k and a 2080 ti for reference i experience the same issues everyone else seems to low fps in cities etc weirdly neither my gpu or cpu seem to be running at 100 so maybe its only using a small amount of cores or who knows who knows 

anyway provided they keep their word and add the option for a new game and fix the performance problems we got a very good and fun game here

#####

i wanna start by saying that hiding microtransactions till release then acting like were the ones with the problem in their reply to the community is a real crappy way to build pr i also had a crash on checking my map in the first main city that said there is a great game here which took all i loved about dd1 and just improved it i really wished there was a maybe reccommend option on steam i reccommend it on the caveat that capcom get their sht together fix the game and maybe not liehide stuff from their community

#####

dragons dogma 2 positive review 199



greedy bastards

#####

incredible game brought low by absolutely terrible performance capcom really dropped the ball on this one 

#####

i was about to dodge this game due to all the reviews
limited fast travel unless i buy more for real life money in a 70 single player game thats outrageous
i felt like a pawn when i bought it how can i spend money on such practices do i lack a spine
long story short it turns out you cant fking fast travel for reallife money this might actually be the least impactfull microtransactions i have ever seen you cant fast travel for  
i hate myself for believing all these people 
with that out of the way the performance is really bad i am playing on a 1080 and i have to run it in 1280 solution which i dont mind to much but keep that in mind when you dont have a nasa rig 
but the game itself is glorious the combat feels meaty your enemies fly all over the place when you hit them your pawns who talk waaay to much interact in unique ways for example catching you when an ogre attempts to throw you etc truely one of the games where you cant play a session without something memorable happening 
i dont regret paying for it and i recommend you to play it if you liked the first title it has the exact same spirit but way better

#####

15 hours in midrange pc mid settings first crash 30 fps in town solid 60 outside of town could be higher if i lowered some settings having a blast micro transactions r completely redundant since u can get it ingame easy dont let people dissuade u from trying this game if u like the combat etc

#####

performance isnt good
there is no way to start a new game or delete your save afaik

would recommend holding off on getting the game until its been patched or in sale

some of the mtx seems really questionable as well like having to pay to change yours or your pawns appearance

#####

the microtransactions can honestly be completely ignored except the one for character customization because 99 of them wont really benefit you much due to the items being earnable ingame but one thing that cant be ignored is the optimization for pc pushing my pc to squeeze out a measly 40 fps is just unacceptable

tldr
 bad optimization
 microtransactions can be ignored but why does a single player game have them
 limited to only one arisen


#####

the game is good and i will keep playing it but microtransactions and anticheat dont belong in a single player game also give us more save files its 2024

#####

the pure game play of this game is amazing the life of the open world shows the love the development team has for this ip unfortunately due to publicly traded company it has released in a unoptimized with cash grabs that make no sense since 98 of all items can be achieved within the first 3 hours of game play taking advantage of the players who have never played dragons dark arisen that dont understand what is in the game to begin with i am fortunate to have a high end pc that can brute force this game to hit 60fps 

do not buy until capcom fixes the poor launch of this game

#####

a ladder arisen

#####

it feels like im back in 2005 when i was afraid to move my camera up and look at the environment because the framedrops take me out of the experience

#####

 steam keeps asking me to update my review  as of yet there hasnt been a single patch for the game so performance in cities is still bad the game crashes on the vocation skill window due to the way it fails to cycle out memory properly along side memory related crashes there are driver timeout crashes on occasion 

the game is also fairly buggy with quest bugs characters getting stuck in the world npcs becoming hostile because you helped them fight off monsters they dont like when you have drawn weapon 

its clear this was pushed out before it was ready on both consoles and pc and i would still not recommend paying anything close to the full asking price of this currently broken product 



technical issues are bad enough at the moment that i would advise against a purchase in its current state will update if this changes

#####

gameplay has been very enjoyable i am going to assume performance issues will be eventually fixed not a huge fan of the limited save files like quest npcs dying by falling into the water on their own and then having to reload last inn save file due to autosave happening after the death

i do not care for the microtransactions as it will not change how i play my singleplayer game however adding mtx to alleviate the restrictive game designs shows us your true intent i do not support predatory practices

update
after 50 hours mtx is a negligible issue compared to the lack of variety in enemies and the storyline was not that engaging for a single player game

#####

you really have to know what youre buying with this 

relevant cons
1 you can make only 1 character 
2 you only really have one save on that one character which might be fucked up there is a secondary save at inns backup save but its rare youre able to use it could be 12 hours of game play between backups 
3 this game feels like its straight out of 2013 its wonky janky and feels dated in some ways 
4 the game struggles to run at 30 fps in large cities runs at about 4050 fps in the world 
5 storyline and all characters are trash very bad 
6 not a particularly detailed game not comparable to skyrim etc in terms of little stories to stumble upon real sidequests 

pros why i recommend this 
1 excellent combat 
2 sense of risk and adventure quests feel like a never ending battle just to make it from one place to the next 
3 sense of progression the world changes and adapts based on your interactions 
4 the pawns  you get a posse of slaves that do your bidding
4b the pawns create dynamic combat experiences and play off one another 
5 there arent other new rpgs at this level so its this or drag your knuckles playing starfield 

all of this assumes that 70 doesnt mean much to you if you view this as an investment then no its probably not worth it at this price point

#####

refunded

ill rather take my 70 bucks and support a couple of indie devs than hand money to another greedy aaa publisher who pushes for microtransactions after the release of the title a freaking singleplayer title 

#####

the game itself is fantastic but i absolutely cannot recommend it due to the awful performance on even high end pcs not to mention the fact capcom decided to include optional microtransactions in a 70 aaa release is laughable and insulting 

im not refunding as i got the game as a gift but i would wait for the performance issues to be addressed before recommending it to anyone disappointing such a great game had to borderline ruined by issues this pathetic

#####

performance issues need to be resolved asap

#####

really good game so far combat is fun and engaging story is good so far played around 10 hours and felt like 10 minutes never got bored interested to see how it feel 100 hours in the one thing that did piss me off was having to delete game files to play a new character after i made my first one look goofy

#####

i like the game

#####

from what i have played so far its great but the crashing and bullshit microtransactions are super dissapointing this game is 70 and charging you more money to edit your character is actually despicable

#####

1200w seasonic gold psu

trash performance in vernworth dips to 40 fps with horrible frame times no way they could have released this game without knowing the full scope of the performance issues

#####

back in the 90s this was one of my favorite video game developers you just knew when you saw those capcom or konami logos you were in for a treat but like all companies that go public the game changes its no longer about making a great game its about making money and appeasing shareholders nickel and dime your customer bleed em dry for those eps gains we all saw it happen with ea and blizzard over the last two decades

anyways lets skip the nostalgiajerking and cut right to the chase i cannot import the character i spent 5 hours making with the character creator unless steam cloud saves are enabled tried to restart the game with it enabled but the game keeps downloading my prior save with no way to delete the saves from the cloud i also cannot delete a save from the actual game because apparently its only 1 save per game in a single player game it just sucked out all the hype i had for the game earlier in the week because the character creator is truly amazing such a shame negative stars and zero excuses for this bullsht

#####

unacceptable performance even with highend hardware embarrassing

#####

shocking optimisationperformance running at 90 fps with 1 npc near me but as soon as i enter the first encampment with 10 npcs my fps drops down to 30 theres barely any buildings and a low number of npcs cant imagine what it performs like in actual towns later on

shoutout to the 21 microtransaction options they stealth launched on day 1 as well without any mention of them prior while most  all of them are acquirable ingame they are ridiculous and micro transactions in a full priced single player game can piss off

refunded may buy again on a deep deep sale for 10 when theyve fixed it

#####

dont try to pretend that 120 worth of dlc for a full experience in a singleplayer game is acceptable if youre fine with that youre enabling developers to make future games even more burdensome so they can extract more money from you this is a lousy practice period
the game refunded

edit countering these are all optional its okay argument its not normalize this and you will see even more shit like this in the future

#####

limiting you to one save slot and paying actual money to edit your character in a single player game is the most baffling decision ive ever seen i hope the 199 was worth the mostly negative reviews

#####

performance  bad  granted ive been playing max settings with rt enabled locked to 60fps with vysnc not a typical style for me but makes the frame pacing and game feel stable im also very fortunate to have a pc thats as powerful as it is compared to most in which your average person will have terrible performance

game  kind of fun the game has yet to really hook me some design choices feel just bad targeting for instance is just random nothing like destroying a pointless box instead of the enemy next to you 

dd2 also feels unfinished outside of performance i feel like i solved the depth of the game after around 8 hours not sure but this one is not for me it has some cool stuff going for it pawn system is interesting and unique 

combat at times really can come together but typically feels like a bit of a mess maybe i dont like sorc as much as i thought i would but starting a new game is also a pointless challenge currently and not worth the fuss 

i plan on checking out updates but i dont really feel it at all with dd2 so far enemy variety is low powerful creatures are pretty awesome though but the game play loop is lackluster and i dont feel like theres much for me to learn i dont hate it or love it its just an rpg thats therefor now 

its a hard sell for 70 i put 70ish hours into hell divers 2 and that was 40 i dont think im going to hit 20 in dd2 at this time

#####

 heavy dlss graphic issues
 heavy performance problems
 0 optimized
 110fps in avg outside and in villages 
 31 fps in avg in the main city 

dlss is blurry as hell and does 0 perf boost too so its simply not working at all and even nvidia itself turns fsr on instead

ryzen 7 7800x3d
128gb ddr5 5600

sry capcom but ur release is the shitiest of the last 10 years

#####

this is not a good look for the gaming industry again 

positives nice open world standard graphics nothing special fighting good skyrim feel 

negatives the pay to win the micro transactions only can create one character want more pay want fast travel pay want to customisation pay want revives pay none of this was shown in reviews done recently 

i will continue to play but i feel the gaming industry is ripping gamers off 

as for performance i get over 60fps on 3440p ultra wide screen using a rtx 3090 ryzen 5800x3d with rt on as well

#####

shitty optimization on top of denuvo capcoms own antidebugging drm the thing that was causing stuttering in re8 enigma antimodding drm and anticheat on a singleplayer game  this will never be fixed doesnt matter how strong your pc is regardless of your opinion on the mtx companies shouldnt be releasing games in a state like this nor should people be okay with this

#####

sigh 12 year wait for this

cons
  no easy way to start a new gamestart over if you decide you dont like your characters looks
  single save file on a single player only game in 2024
  absolute dogwater keyboardmouse controls on a pc version  why are skills default to crap like ctrlspace
  2 for a character edit voucher in a single player only game
  insanely bad mouse acceleration that you cant disable
  optimization isnt great but playable for me at 8090 fps
  denuvo that did absolutely nothing to stop the game from being cracked even before official release

pros
  its dragons dogma
  new vocations are fun


not refunding but this is disgraceful for a game ive been wanting for so long  aaa devs really have to get their shit together

i feel like i need to edit this review
yes the mtx for the game is all shit you can obtain fairly easily in game but its a fucking single player game this crap shouldnt exist  this is one of the reasons why people want to mod the shit out of your games capcom

despite the other issues the game is really fun as a dd fan   if they were to fix the optimization issues and the devs were to understand that people use keyboardmouse for things other than typing and browsing the web id probably change this to a recommended review

h2dragons dogma 2 is a phenomenal openworld rpg that manages to improve upon most of its predecessors mechanics excelling at character progression and providing a sense of adventure though people should be aware that it also kept the same design decisions that had already made dragons dogma 1 a fairly niche rpg experienceh2

tr
th prosth
th consth
tr
tr
td  incredible attention to detail in world design makes exploring on your own accord a consistently rewarding experience much of the games best content is hidden away without the player ever being directly pointed in their direction valuing player agencytd
td the pace of the game can be quite slow frequent backtracking across vast stretches of the map and very consistent refighting of enemies that used to be more sparse in the previous title can be jarring on occasiontd
tr
tr
td  character and pawn progression have been vastly improved through inclusions such as pawn specializations as well as overall greater skill diversity especially when considering the newly added vocationstd
td  many sidequests can be overly cryptic either in what you are supposed to do or in the very mechanics of the game for example the acquisition of maister skill tomes is not only tied to their respective quests but also to their affinity with involved characterstd
tr
tr
td  absolutely amazing presentation both due to the gorgeous graphics and also the superb framing of many of the encounters such as fighting a medusa in a hiddenaway temple and finding ways to manipulate her gaze attack or the wingbeat of a griffin breezing across the grasstd
td there are some noticeable balancing issues both between vocations but more so with the player outscaling enemies towards the latter half of the game leading to an overall pretty easy game with a distinct lack of a hard mode or an equivalent to the bitterblack isle megadungeontd

h3technical issues and performanceh3
contrary to many other reviews i have not experienced any noticeable issues with the above system i have not crashed throughout the entirety of my playtime nor did i encounter any broken quests or other miscellaneous glitches performance has been very consistent as well with the single exception in the city of vernworth causing me to drop between 5 and 10 frames on occasion

h3graphics and soundh3
dragons dogma 2 looks absolutely phenomenal apart from sheer graphical fidelity there is an obscene amount of detail in the environment and how creatures interact with it a lot of this is also somewhat needed as arguably the games best moments are hidden outside of the main quest and are therefore reliant on the player picking out clues from the environment to find them a tower in the distance a statue pointing towards a shrine hidden somewhere in the mountains and more 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3202345904

the sound is a bit of a mixed bag overall i find dd1s ost to be a bit more memorable though here it is still perfectly fitting weapons feel and sound impactful and i have found the voice acting to be quite good in both english and japanese one thing to note is that regardless of the quality of the music it can be a bit jarring to dip in and out of the same combat tracks since especially large enemy encounters have become a lot more common

h3story and settingh3
dd2 shares the same setting as its predecessor in which the player controls an arisen once a regular human who stood against a dragon and for their efforts had its heart taken by the same dragon thus becoming effectively immortal but also bound to eventually confront it again this is all linked to a political intrigue surrounding the sovereignship of one of the two major kingdoms 

there is a significant focus on making dragons dogma 2 a bit more of a narrative experience many sidequests will cross over one another in ways that may not be apparent at first there are no quest indicators either forcing the player to go out of their way and intuit how a story may progress like the many optional encounters hidden away from the main story the questing experience relies heavily on the player making an effort to seek many of them out on their own 

a point of criticism should be that there are both timesensitive quests and multiple points of no return during the story which are not always properly communicated while i found the main story to be serviceable and the sidequests actively quite good sometimes the game is a bit too ambiguous for its own good such as during the notorious sphinx riddles or albeit this not being strictly speaking a proper quest the completely unreasonable task of finding seeker tokens 220 medals hidden all across the obscenely huge map

h3gameplayh3
as an action rpg dragons dogma features a selection of class kits the player can freely switch between these range from fairly standard archetypes such as archers fighters and mages to more eccentric additions such as the new mystic spearhanda battlemage archetype each of these vocations levels up separately from the player offering both skills that are unique to itself and augmentations that can be freely used on any other vocation as well heavily incentivizing experimentation 

aside from the arisen players also create a pawn who acts as a permanent party member and that doubles as a soft multiplayer feature this is due to pawns being shared online allowing any player to hire up to two additional pawns next to their own pawns learn during gameplay as well as such if your pawns has witnessed you completing a quest objective it will offer guidance to another player hiring it into their party 

i do genuinely love this concept as it is very appealing to try and develop your pawn to be more useful to other group compositions as well i do kind of wish that the quest guide functionality would be a bit more indepth than just the pawns generally guiding you to the location in question however

in combat aside from the skills you set yourself according to your vocation an integral part of dd is the ability to grab and climb on monsters in dragons dogma 1 it was vital to be able to deal significant damage which this game is a little less strict about due to simply higher damage potential but is still a vital part of gameplay some enemies require it for certain objectives such as being able to behead a medusaas such few skills or mechanics feel meaningless in combat rather it is up to the player how deeply they want to engage in their party building due to the difficulty of the game generally becoming easier and easier however people may miss the sheer depth character building could reach during a dungeon like bitterblack isle

this would also constitute my greatest criticism as currently dragons dogma 2 becomes quite grindy due to the timelimited postgame requiring a vast amount of raw resources to max out your equipment whereas there is no true content that actually requires it and thus rewards carrying on the gameplay loop past the initial playthrough 

h3final thoughtsh3
dragons dogma 2 is a fantastic sequel it is very close to being the best openworld game that i have played too with most of my criticism stemming from the fairly niche design decisions that however also make up its appeal limited fast travel may be obnoxious but it undoubtedly adds to the immersion and supports the exploration that the game so heavily relies upon for example it is dd1 but more of itbe that for better or for worse

deeply disappointing  لاتضيع وقتك  

 tedious quest design  dull mechanics 

as an eager player anticipating the release of dragons dogma 2 i was excited to delve into the world and uncover the mysteries it held however my enthusiasm quickly turned to frustration especially when i encountered the caged magistrate quest this quest supposed to be a pivotal moment in the game turned out to be a major letdown

the steps required to complete the quest were not only dull but downright nonsensical it felt like the developers had run out of creative ideas early in the game and decided to throw together a haphazard series of steps and tasks that added nothing to the overall gameplay the lack of depth and meaningful engagement left me feeling disappointed and disconnected from the storyline

furthermore the lackluster execution of the quest highlighted a broader issue with dragons dogma 2  a lack of attention to detail and a failure to deliver on the promises of an immersive gaming experience instead of being drawn into the world and invested in the characters i found myself bored and uninspired by the lack of thoughtful game design

i had hoped for a captivating and immersive experience but instead i found myself stuck in a mundane and unexciting quests that tarnished my overall impression of the game

#####

no polish language and microtransactions bad optimization dont buy

tldr its not much different from the first game its better looking and it feels very good to play however it runs like garbage and there are pointless microtransactions

ive only played for about an hour
my first thoughts were negative because for whatever reason every game since 2020 needs to compile shaders before you even play it which is wild to me

after i got past that i loaded up the character i made using their character creator
i can totally see how poor the optimization is despite the fact that im running the game on the highest possible graphics and the games buttery smooth due to a pretty damn beefy pc though the processor and ram is last gen you can tell because when i dropped certain things like the shadows or even the textures down to low my frames go haywire for 10 minutes until the fsr levels it all out

the gameplay itself is so damn good though its almost witcher 3 level combat but it feels more fluid 
the boss fight had so much going on made it hard to see what the heck was even going on but i think thats just due to the setting and location

the graphics are actually really good i do believe that this industry has officially hit a roadblock in terms of graphical innovation games will only be able to go one of two ways now more hyper realistic which means uncanny valley and really noticeable flaws in facial animations and character visual fidelity or more stylistic using modern graphical breakthroughs to compliment current graphical abilities to provide more interesting and unique visual representations of every day things

the sound is good its a capcom game so they usually have this down

microtransactions they exist and its embarrassing its a 70dollar game dlc it a capcom staple but adding dumb gems shards or other stupid currencies is a certified shareholders moment

overall its a solid game as long as your computer is up to snuff as the tldr said just wait for an update that fixes optimization as ridiculous as that is once again mainstream publishers drop the ball on optimizing their damn games before releasing it

this was a dumb comment its more akin to the true directional combat mod for skyrim take that how you wish

update ive played this game way too much and i havent even beaten it never have i had this much fun playing a game since monster hunter worlds or even skyrim i will 100 admit that the game is terribly optimized but if your computer runs it fine then youll have fun

h1 pitiable arisen hast thou come to read mine review h1

dragons dogma 2 is a great game that lives upto its predecessor in terms of combat and drastically improved visuals environment but not so much in the story department

bmasterworks all alright but they did go wrong b 

h3 pros h3

breathing vibrant and fully explorable open world
engaging combat and bossfights that are absolutely cinematic and a treat for eyes
new vocations that are really good and sometimes makes you the boss 
improved pawn systeminteraction which makes the game a bit more interesting though the dialogs can get repetitive at times which didnt bother me but can annoy others
a masterwork in character customisation and one of the best that ive seen till now
the only game where i didnot feel walking from point a to point b boring or frustrating as there were threat and surprises lurking at every corner that made exploration really engaging

h3 cons h3

performance can sometime tank in crowded places like cities which has reduced a lot after the recent patch and can improve more in further patches
the exploration though fun isnt rewarding at all i have found equipments with way better stats from the shops than the cavesdungeons
apart from few new variety of enemies theres no new addition and its always the same lot of goblins and saurians in the caves
no enemy scaling in ng
what really bothered me is the story it just ends abruptly and feels incomplete

for the returning players like me who have high expectations from this i would just say that this is the same game more like dragons dogma remake

overall its a great game and would always recommend this to those who look for adventures and love fighting huge mythical creatures climbing them and stabby stabby their face its unique in its own way and one must definitely play this once in their life

#####

game is basically a redo of the first dragons dogma  what this means for dd1 enjoyers

 new story that plays off the old story
 some references to the first game small
 same combat and travelling
 same progression system and other auxiliary systems

what has changed since dd1

 game is unoptimised as heck for a majority of systems baffling
 dd2 has microtransactions dd1 has fun
 in dd1 the pawns are annoying but i didnt hear copies of the same line for sometimes hours in dd2 i get the same dialogue lines repeated over and over about the pawns journeys in other worlds like thats what i wanna hear every 5 minutes
 dd2 jumping feels worse than dd1 jumping dont know how you mess that up
 dd2 there is less surfaces to climb than in dd1 what this means is your illusion of freedom is shattered much sooner
 framerate in dd2 on a 5000 pc i built 4 years ago is absolutely atrocious in some areas i have what is probably considered 6575 of what my computer specs could be at max and youre telling me i drop frames at a village of 3040 people moving around wtf
 denuvo anticheat why add this the only reason i can come up with is that capcom didnt want players making broken pawns like that was ever fixed in dd1 it didnt impact your story at all if you didnt indulge in it dd2 throws all that away for an anticheat that most people are saying hurts the games stability isnt that a bit fky wucky
 one save file alright comrade maybe take the players save files off your servers and thered be no issue with this but you have to host each persons save and check it against your system for tampering in a singleplayer game

closing statement you had 12 years twelve 3 presidential elections worth of time to make a sequel that couldve been the game of the year easily instead capcom you chose to try and line your pockets you took a shady anticheat deal and injected it into your game and you added bloatware in the form of microtransactions that were so unneeded id rather go around trying to pickup ants and ask if they believe in the flying spaghetti monster

fking lunacy

#####

ill wait for a sale when its 20 or under

#####

tldr the game itself is great like ddda but better the only problem for me are the performance issues i will happily update my review if they get fixed because i love the game in and of itself

updated 1st day impressions i have to say that the performance issues really are noticeable especially for someone who meets the recommended specs i wouldnt mind lower fps overall if it was stable unfortunately its quite frequent for me to get fps drops in towns and the city i just kind of got used to it by now because otherwise i am enjoying the game immensely

the game itself is incredibly good it really feels like a dragons dogma game to me the vibes are here ddda is so incredibly important to me and this game really matches that feeling of nostalgia its like i know this game you know it feels like home to me i love that the pawns never shut up i love that the merchants repeat the same line over and over again i love the gathering system being the same i love how the setting feels so familiar i love the combat and how more intuitive it feels now i love this game because i loved the first one and this is more of the same thing it feels like coming home if you love ddda you will love this one too

as for the microtransactions i am definitely not a fan i honestly hate them i do but i wish people would factcheck before posting negative reviews as you can get those items i think except the music dlc ingame for free with minimal effort

#####

game is fun but

i have an i9 3080 and 32gbs of ram this game chugs at low to medium settings 

microtransactions



#####

first ill get the obvious out of the way the game currently has performance issues in big towns caused by a cpu bottleneck at least in my system i get above 60fps on the open world segments so far on a 5600x 32gb 3070 system at 1440p with dlss balanced and graphics set to high but rt off so its far from unplayable but big towns are a different story
still if the combat areas continue to perform at 60fps or above im mostly ok with that its not something truly horrible like jedi survivor which was a stuttering mess and crashed whenever it wanted

with that stuff out of the way this is pretty much the perfect game for anyone who loved the first since its that but with more stuff the pawns feel quite similar but with more varied voicelines and the combat is as engaging as ever systemic interactions abound and the usual dragons dogma weird stuff is out there for all to see

do i recommend it if you can get over towns not performing adequately 100 ive had a blast in these few hours and i fully intend to keep going for a few weeks because this stuff is my jam

#####

dragons dogma 2 is an excellent often thrilling arpg with something to do or discover around every corner it has some of the best combat mechanics in a video game bar none and has one of if not the best implementation of a day night cycle i have experienced night time genuinely feels dangerous and the risk versus reward goes through the roof enemies are varied and always fun to fight providing a decent amount of challenge but not frustratingly so story is there and is suitably engaging but not overly memorable the gameplay is really the star of the show here 

so all is perfect right well not exactly some voice acting is a bit questionable lip syncing is laughably bad at times and the strange omission of not being able to start a new game from scratch feels like a massive oversight at best or an ominous attempt at some form of monetisation at worst having said that capcom have pledged to fix these issues for pc players at least 

i feel i have to also address the other boogie men of performance and micro transactions micro transactions are in the game in the form of dlc that can be purchased to make life in the game easier however purchasing these items is totally optional and everything is available in game at no extra cost the micro transactions are not intrusive or necessary to progress they are simply there if you cant be bothered to find or grind for the item the choice is yours the hysteria surrounding these micro transactions is a little silly as they are completely optional not all micro transactions are created equally these are simply here as a convenience not a necessity the other issue i am seeing a lot of is performance and this seems to be a bit of an odd one there are people reporting that their 4090 is getting 12 fps while others on much older cards are reporting much better performance so whats going on here the fact is the game is cpu bound so the best graphics cards in the world arent going to make a difference if they are being run by an ancient cpu personally i am running a rtx 4070ti and performance has been in the 6090 fps range perfectly acceptable capcom have admitted there is a performance issue and again have pledged to fix it 

the game is great if you like the look of it and enjoyed the first game go get it

#####

the game is incredibly good and entertaining

nobody is asking you to pay for microtransactions this is only for individuals that are lazy and do not want to farm anything as all of this currency can be obtained in the game without difficulty

the only complaint i have with this game is that it is poorly optimized thumbs down till this is resolved

#####

fix your game please also hiding basic functions of the game behind a paywall is a very very bad customer practice

#####

 the game could be great but for me its not really playable fps drop to 1015 anytime you near a settlement of any kind also crashed during character creation yikes i also think its kind of insane that they have microtransactions in a 70 game i will try back a 6 months and see what theyve done with it

#####

nope

the save system can make you lose 510 hours at a time or your entire character  they need to fix this garbage

   this is ridiculous  got a save bug where i loaded from an autosave and instadied repeatedly clicked the inn option and lost 3 hours

new zone no inns for 3 hours   this is bullsht capcom



launch day

yikes   only 1 save file and you cant restart the game to make a new character  plus microtransactions

capcom what the hell have you done   the game plays like ss on my pc as well so jittery with framerate issues its giving me motion sickness  i sincerely hope they patch the game so it doesnt run like it was made in the 1990s  and they better fix changing your character and multiple saves  this is ridiculous

#####

the actual game oh i love it
everything else  i fucking hate it

cash shop purchases on a 70 game  capcom is batshit retarded with this nonsense  

ive got a fucking 4070 ti and a fuckin 11k series i7  my game is fucking pixalated sometimes what the fuck

update  looks like the item to remake your character is at the pawn shop lol in gran soren  kind of wack that its that deep into the game which isnt deep at all if youre rushing story i was exploring and you can get the currency from just playing the game and having a good pawn  

additionally looks like the denuvo anti piracy nonsense theyve got going on can brick your account if you try and delete your save in an attempt to start over again so i dont recommend doing that  speaking of theres no new game function and that irks me and i like trying stuff again and again and dont mind going through the beginning of the game to test different stuff out  they plan on adding it though

still not a recommend for me  well i mean yes it is i like the game and enjoy it a lot but i still dont want to see this shit on the next monster hunter because you know those greedy fuckers will do this there too

#####

great game

#####

baffling decisions really hard to understand japanese developers standpoint 

 disgusting performance
 only 1 save file and not allowing for a new game with different character you cannot even delete the file since it is stored on the server end
 mtx and dlcs are implemented in the first minute in a single player game you need to pay to change your characters appearance or need to play the game to accumulate some sort of currrency which will take time
 archaic technicality dlss looks incredibly blurry dlss3 got delayed dldsr options are not supported

game seems very promising but could not focus to play due to performance problems mind you this is coming from a user with rtx4090 and i913900k 

will change when they have fixed the game but not worth the first day hype if you are stamping that 70 tag to your game you need to honor it

#####

30 fps in cities hasnt ruined my experience in the slightest  combat is the most fun ive had in an rpg in a long time  vocation system is great different classesvocations feel very unique and fun to play  still in the middle of playing it just wanted to get a quick review out here to say the performance is just fine unless youre hyper sensitive to 30 fps in noncombat city centers for whatever reason

#####

edit

combat and exploration is absolutely fantastic and if thats the kind of thing you like like i do this game is for you and thats frankly the bulk of content in this game

most other things though have a noticeable lack of polish mostly relating to story events and triggers escort ai pathing and journal ambiguity especially later on that i hope they fix over time

if youre used to playing jank games that wont bother you too much

but generally speaking i wouldnt flat out recommend this game it has a strong start but a middling end the core gameplay loop of combatexploration needs to be your draw which unfortunately becomes less of a challenge later on

edit

seems that they are working towards fixing issues and addressed the initial pain point i describe below

on release started the game made a character once i actually started the game and saw how the characters moved i didnt like the character wanted to restartdelete that save to try again turns out you cant restart your save file turns out you cant actually edit your characters appearance

if such basic qa pain points were missed at the very start of the game i do not have high hopes for the rest of it

#####

f to all my arisen brothers and sisters who didnt make it to see a new dragons dogma game

#####

predatory microtransactions snuck in after reviews came out so they wouldnt negatively affect review scores is some of the scummiest shit ive seen any publisher ever do go fuck yourself capcom especially for a game priced this high 

this is a good game marred by poor choices made by out of touch old men who despise pc as a platform why is there no eternal ferry stone how did you manage to make the ui even more clunky than it was 12 years ago who thought it would be a good idea to have the worst mouse acceleration ive ever experienced in any game present the mouse acceleration literally makes me nauseous if your kbm controls are so bad that they literally make people physically ill then you have failed as a game developer also why is the no walk bind for kbm im so tired of developers not giving the superior control option the attention it deserves 

on top of this we have performance that just isnt good enough relative to how the game looks is the game pretty yes does that justify the frame rate falling to 40 fps in a populated city on a high end pc no compare the visual fidelity of dragons dogma 2 to red dead redemption 2 and a game that is 6 years older both looks better and runs faster

#####

edit i just swallowed my pride a couple days later and restarted after the lost progress this time with steam cloud sync turned off over 20 hours in and i am addicted to this game in spite of the performance issues my cooling situation was so bad i took my side panel off for my pc tower and i still do not recommend it on the sole principal that capcom needs to understand exactly why the reviews have come to this even a lifelong fan knows right from wrong and its wrong to release a game in this state and then also ask for more money on top of that

i have been waiting for this game for years i was so obsessed with the first game that i played dragons dogma online with google translate it was jp only just to play more of it 
when this finally dropped i immediately dumped 5 hours into it in a single session but at the end of the session my autosave corrupted and would no longer properly save the game i tried manually saving after that and it also didnt work then my pc froze up and it was utterly unusable i had to hard shutdown and when i booted the game back up my biggest fear came true and my progress was completely gone more than anyone i want to give this game a good review but capcom absolutely played us for fools and even snuck in microtransactions on the day 1 patch do not buy this until they figure their shit out

#####

this game is amazing

microtransactions are not
booooo capcom booooo you have joined the ea blizzard bethesda club boooo

#####

micro transaction bullsht going on again free games fine thats fair but not full priced games

#####

ignore the mtx speel its the same kind of mtx stuff in monster hunter world there4 remake and devil may cry 5 which is to say almost completely irrelevant you can earn the premium currency at a faster rate than helldivers 2s premium currency anyways if you didnt care about these instances of mtx youre barely going to notice this games mtx you can purchase everything being offered on the store by late game in decent quantities if you didnt mindlessly waste the currency on pawns you will have 10s of thousands of premium currency by endgame if you do not spend it

the lack of a new save file function is intentional the servers wouldve died the minute the game launched if it were enabled because i for one wouldve remade my character 40 times itll get patched in soon so dont worry about that

there are several problems with the game mostly performance related there are no words to that can describe how utterly dogshit this games performance is it appears to be bottlenecked by the cpu and not gpu apparently which is somehow amazing in its own way until this gets fixed the average gamers pc will very regularly drop below 20 frames if you have the shekels for an expensive pc itll still drop below 60 and will often drop below 30 regardless of settings i have not experienced crashes so i can not speak for those that have i was stuck at the titlescreens compiling shaders loading menu before realizing it was bugged and needed a single restart

the last real problem i have is mostly a personal issue the games combat and equipment system is dumbed down from the previous installment in the prequel game dark arisen you had quite a significantly higher number of equipment slots like gauntlets boots underpants and undershirts which have now been removed entirely in addition the number of equippable active combat skills has been decreased from 6 to 4 dragons dogma 2 attempts to compensate for this decrease by adding more core skills which are always active as a class but this is still a major nerf to spellcasting classes specifically in addition the game is piss easy and there is no hard mode there are also item progression issues related to enhancement materials dropping monsters that dont respawn until postgame in addition the seeker token fetch quest fucking sucks

denuvo sucks i hate it you dont need to tell me
 
other than these issues the combat is great the setting and lore are very enjoyable the scenes which are meant to feel cinematic feel cinematic when they arent a fucking slideshow the presentation and graphical fidelity are also great perhaps too great considering how fucking terrible the optimization is i will emphasize this until i stop breathing

#####

i payed 100 for the game played for a few hours one of the first side quests looked like it wanted me to collect plants just like the first dragons dogma so i decided to mess around and attack every npc i could find and throw them off a cliff then i found that the option to start a new character has been removed and one option was to pay 139 for each npc i would like to restore i chose to refund the game

#####

hidden underneath the mountain of performance issues is a great game the microtransactions arent a surprise considering capcoms style of monetization nowadays but its still in poor taste

obviously this will get updated once they fix the performance issues but cmon this clearly needed more time in the oven

edit apparently theres a mechanic in the game that causes your pawn ai companion to kill everyone in a settlement if they catch something called dragonsplague this ruins your save file what the hell capcom remove this mechanic completely

edit 2 alright well this probably isnt going to get changed to a positive review after all after spending a lot of time with the game and getting to the epilogue i just cant say its an improvement over the first game in a lot of ways its just worse ill bulletpoint all of my criticisms

 enemy variety is lacking and the new things arent enough to replace the old for a game that treats itself almost like a spiritual remake instead of a sequel theres just less here

 enemy density it seems like you cant go 15 seconds without encountering yet another pack of goblins or your hundredth griphontrollogre or harpies or saurians exploring the overworld feels like a nonstop action sequence with zero time to breath additionally enemies will just respawn in the exact same spots when you come back combine this with the lack of variety and it just gets tedious so fast despite how good the combat mechanics feel

 the main storyline is horribly paced and clearly rushed i was shocked just how quickly things ended after getting to battahl several plotlines just end without any payoff and the second half of the game is almost nonsensical why am i working for the guys who are clearly not my allies what happened to the court intrigue plotline surrounding the false arisen why am i fighting this giant statue why is the dragon here now so many questions that amount to what the fuck is even going on and exactly zero answers

additionally the major plot surrounding the dragon is essentially just a redo of the first game but substantially worse due to the above issues

 i touched on this in my first edit with dragonsplague a mechanic that kills everyone including questgivers major and minor in a major area if you dont notice your npc followers displaying strange symptoms but turns out there are just several playerhostile game design choices that seem to exist only to make you frustrated no new game option and limited saves inconsistent labeling for timesensitive quests a nonsensical ingame economy 2000 gold for an inn visit 10000 gold for a haircut 20000 for a house poorly implemented limited fast travel etcetera

 outdated mechanics why on gods earth did they not change the romance system it was awful in the first game and its the exact same here if not worse

 lack of an endgame the secret epilogue is a temporary and time gated why thing apparently new game is the only path forward if you want to keep playing



i see the fingerprints of good game design here great combat mechanics art direction sound design all of it bogged down by idiotic decisions and rushed content a terrible repeat of dragons dogma 1s issues with new failures added in

i suspect the creative director was never challenged or told no its such a damned shame that it turned out like this even if they fix the performance issues there are fundamental problems with this game that would take ages to address if theyre addressed at all

so unless you have a cpu from 15 years in the future and this goes on sale for dirt cheap dont buy it just play the first game instead


#####

h1disclaimer do not buy any of the dlc all of them are part of the deluxe edition and most of them are items in game that can be earned easily through play except for the camping set which is pretty much only cosmetic the rift crystals are the same as red orbs in dmc5 and art of metamorphosis is in the game itselfh1

character creations really well done and the gameplay is about as youd expect fast and fluid a big improvement over the first game in every way however it runs like an old person with severe arthritis and crippling asthma problems are beyond just the fact that denuvo is on this and the cpu usage is ridiculous this crap engine already gave me issues with sf6 and they decided to use it for an open world game yippee game struggles to maintain 60 and dips to about 30 in towns in its current state its really badly optimised and will probably take some time to get patched or modded really stupid that this is yet another aaa game that came out terribly on pc 

note you cannot delete your saves a pc only issue and you have only 5 devices you can install this on 

would only recommend this game if you have a good system and are willing to compromise with console framrerates would love to give it a mixed option but for its current state on launch its a 610 solely carried by the gameplay  
i am not defending capcoms greed and their underhanded business tactics but this is a fantastic game and cant wait to see it get fixed if ever but judging by the fact that its tied to npcs and towns are populated with a lot of them i cant imagine it getting fixed anytime soon

this in all honesty should have been capcoms easiest win but they fumbled on what is essentially one of the greatest open world rpg experiences

#####

microtransactions in a singleplayer game

#####

microtransactions in a singleplayer game
1 save file

#####

full priced singleplayer roleplaying game in 2024 
 micro transactions 
 intrusive denuvo drm
 awkward keyboard  mouse controls
 poor framerates in major settlements
 single character use community developed savegame manager
 only one save use community developed savegame manager
 not even a restart option enhancement announced

#####

running a 4090 yet constant dips to 40fps
additionally this game is filled with microtransactions despite being 70 and single player

worst of all this game has the most atrocious saving mechanism ever in a game it was legitimately designed by brain dead children you have 2 options to save your game

1 select save from the menu
2 rest at an inn

but you dont have any save slots at all so you can only ever maintain one save instance and no multiple characters just one and just one save for the one character

want to reload because the game with its terrible pawn ai glitched out or screwed you over too bad only options is to use a third party mod save restorer tool from nexus

want to reload from an inn well hope you dont ever choose this by accident because if you do it will delete your latest manual save and replace it with this save which is probably much older unlike when you reload your manual save and it maintains your latest inn save

if all of that is not bad enough it also does autosave but only when you dont want it to never when you do

example kill 5 enemies and then die to one it did not autosave you have to do all of it again
example 2 an npc you wanted to save died somehow probably due to terrible ai well guess what the game autosaved and now your only options is to reload the inn rest save

100 of the difficulty in this game lies in fighting the terrible performance terrible pawn ai and terrible saving mechanism only capcom fanboys are defending this garbage they really need to justify their purchase by arguing online

buy elden ring or bg3 instead
stick to devil may cry itsuno that is all you are good at

#####

she dragons on my dogma til my dark is arisen then she breathes fire on my convictions until my shadows find the light

#####

ill consider changing my review from negative once they add in the ability to start a new game

#####

h1 dont buy the game yet  h1 

h3 2 big reasons h3 

b 1 a shit ton of microtransaction b 

its a singleplayer game with gameplay features beeing sold as dlc needing to pay 2 dolars to create a new character is really bad and selling stuff like fast travel is even worse i personally dont see as a deal breaker just stupid greedy capcom beeing greedy

b 2 horrible performance b 

this for me is really the worst part and i would not recommend the game to anyone at this state the game runs pretty bad at open world parts and even worse on big cities

the dlss options in the game does not include frame generating so they do nothig to help with performance on gpu heavy loads like in the open world

and the cities have a b big b  cpu bottleneck problem even really good cpus cant handle the cities i have a 5600x and it stays at 100 utilisation at all times and the frame rate does not go over 3545fps

if campcom fixes the performance issues i may still recommend it to people who dont care about the pay to win bullshit on a singleplayer game

#####

where is my fps

#####

game runs like trash and i have a 4090 and i9 13900k they have micro transactions 2 to change your character appearance in a 70 game can not create multiple characters in a single player game many other micro transactions as well

#####

21 dlc on release day boo
my positive review only 199 usd

edit after 20 hours 

the game was advertised like a aaaa game but is really not worth it i would have left a positive review if it was 30 usd without dlc that would be alright

 the gameplay is good there are some really cool mechanics and innovative things

 beyond the combats everything else in terms of immersion with this world feels extremely cheap

#####

fun gameplay havent interacted with micro transactions

#####

good game exploration and combat are excellent
it would be 1010 for me if the endgame was better or ng got some more love i hope that we are gonna see something like black isle form first game in future dlcupdate

and of course optimization got better after recent patch but its still pretty garbage

#####

i didnt like the voice i picked for my character and i just started my game so i went to start over and what do you know i cant there is literally no way in game to start a new save file in the game

edit they fixed this issue as of 3292024

h1prefaceh1
reviewed this game on launch after completion opinion has changed drastically

as an achievement hunter time is money until now there were 3 singleplayer games in recent years  that i have been willing to return to even long after 100 has been achieved monster hunter world nioh 2 and elden ring for better or for worse dragons dogma 2 has joined that list

the thing that bothered me most about this game was all the misinformation going around on the internet even to this day capcom sold out to mtx practices performance is terrible on launch fix your game this mechanic bricks your save none of these can be farther from the truth i am a witness and my testimony is to declare that capcom albeit with a griffinsized caveat is not in the wrong here compared to other game companies of the modern era esp the western politicsmoneydriven ones capcom only did what was necessary to gain a profit from its product which i wholeheartedly declare a masterpiece at the same time i also want to note that dragons dogma 2 is not for everyone it is a game that requires a bit of preplanning if you dont want to throw in the towel and give up on your progression midway with some amount of meticulous research i was able to complete a 9998 completion playthrough on the first run  while only missing one romance line because of the unforgiving quest progression design i blame myself for being naive enough to believe the internet on launch without giving the game a chance to make an impression on me personally nevertheless here i am now writing a second and more thorough review to drop some wisdom on you pawns

h1positivesh1
bvocations  pawn systemb
vocations remind me very much of the weapon system in the monster hunter series and thats what has me hooked even after 100 for me jack of all tradesmaxing all vocations is a given yet you also have the time spent to commit to different builds within each vocation thereafter surprisingly theres no achievement for maxing all vocation levels but they do have one related to gaining all maister skills so obviously the completionist has a reason and drive to be hungry to become a god of war by getting every vocation to max level  all maister skills  dragonforged weapongear right thats where the endgame lies and thats why games like dragons dogma 2 while being singleplayer are still such gems that rpg enthusiasts can still enjoy to our hearts content multiplayer games like lol and overwatch rely on seasonal rank and number of unlockedpurchased skins to display how much time blood sweat and tears youve invested into the games games like elden ring and dragons dogma your save file and progression are all the proof you need

the pawn system is unique and engaging in its own right theres not much else to be said other than the fact that it retains its functions from dark arisen and then some plus the ai seems to be relatively awesome considering you can have up to 3 pawns following you around with four simple commands they do what you need them to without making you have to micromanage them too frequently while out on the road and when they start trashtalking or being a negative nancy into the brine

bopen worldb
just like elden ring dragons dogma 2 deserves endless respect for the quality of the open world onetime 30second wait time after loading up your save file and boom the entire world is at your disposal no wait times when opening doors zero loading when hopping in and out of a riftstone and instant menus popping up and down when you need to depositwithdrawbuysellequip your gear this may be an individual experience and others spoke of fps dips and all that but overall it just comes down to your own experience sometimes we take these things for granted with all the ftier games that have been coming out lately but lets remember folks quality of life matters in rpgs

bquest designprogression  ngb
hear me out getting locked out of quest progression and npcs getting thanossnapped out of existence are not good at first glance but werent the true gamers at one point complaining about how ubisoft games spoonfeed us with ui mumbo jumbo werent we complaining that games were too easy and there was a need to go back to the golden era of true exploration dragons dogma 2 makes you think and the younger generation of gamers need to do more of that all they care about are hopping into games picking up a gun within 2 minutes and just shooting things imho dragons dogma 2 is a game wherein if you want to really get your moneys worth a bit of meticulous calculation planning and care could go a long way by all means play the way you want but personally i think this is the way the game was designed to be played in the longterm

ng is a different breed altogether but to avoid spoilers i wont go too deep into it just know that youre never really truly locked out of anything

pro tip #1 turning in crystals to ambrosius isnt the point of no return entering the tower at the end is the true point of no return for preng progression so feel free to take your time

h1negativesh1

at this rate im afraid capcom games will have longer lists of payable dlc and mtx than koei tecmo games and thats saying a lot the most ive seen on a doa or dw game in the recent years was about 90 items in one title my only two cents on this topic is that theyre not necessary i went around leveling vocations got gold from goblins and selling exploits and had 2mil gold to buy all  your travel resource needs and dont forget the oxcart has a doze off option to speed it up 

often times we hate on other games for even having mtx but dd2 unfortunately deserves to be forgiven in this case because of the quality of the game itself flame me for not knowing what im talking about but im biased af here and thats the stance i take as a consumer if the game is good let it do what other trash games do anyway id rather pay extra money to a game that i enjoy than pay for dlc in a game that doesnt deserve respect for any of its traits but as i said i didnt spend a dime outside of the base gameedition i purchased on day one

protip #2 use oxcarts when possible go to another town while micromanaging what you need to do aka dont just port around aimlessly without a plan use portcyrstals wisely and hoard ferrystones until you absolutely need them if youre smart when playing the game and be patient you wouldnt need to spend another dime either

hoping to hear some news about dlc soon but even then the story will probably be lackluster dont expect any subverting expectations here its your average savetheworld storyline with some subpar wow moments along the way gaming industry needs some better writers or just let ai take over altogether

oh and capcom can take some notes from witcher 3 for romance scenes these were godawful

bmissing features on launchb
they really knew what they were doing with the mtx when they gave us one single game file on launch few weeks later they add a start new game feature but still no multiple save data slots come on capcom dont test our patience

h1conclusionh1
bfinal verdict sb
dragons dogma 2 is arguably a masterpiece and capcom should really invest into the ip for the next 10 years hands down one of the most fun experiences ive had in an actionrpg the game has its flaws but the overall product did not disappoint whatsoever

#####

game is fun and immersive but at the time of writing this post i would not recommend purchasing due to cpu bottle necking the game chugs in towns and the pawns need to be fixed

#####

i didnt even know this game had microtransactions until i checked the review scores

#####

the gameplay is great but all the unnecessary mtx and the horrible performance dont let me recommend it right now

edit
 rtx 2080 asus rog strix

 amd ryzen 7 3700x

 32gb ram

 1 tb ssd

its a delicious potato 

#####

for the love of god please dont listen to the microtransaction reviews the game literally has all items available to purchase at in game shops with ingame money and these absolute sheep havent even bothered confirming that for themselves before writing a dumb review

#####

after the first 5 hours of gameplay i can say that dd2 is indeed what i expected a worthy successor of dd1
until now i had no bugs or crashes
the awesome graphics and effects though do come with a high hardware requirement
with a ryzen 5800x3d and a rtx 3080ti i had to turn raytracing off and set shadows to high for a good  90 fps experience outside of the main town

#####

i cant overlook the bad optimization with this game i exceed the recommendations for the hardware on this game and ive had to put everything to its lowest setting and it still lags horribly the microtransactions are terrible as well having to pay to make a new character complete joke until they fix these issues i will not be giving this game a good review

#####

ive been enjoying the game so far  i have played the first game  its more of what i loved about the original  

the microtransactions well i dont want to see these in any game but looking at what is in dragons dogma 2 its actually really minor and these things can be obtained ingame easily  i think dont give it a pass just because of the complaints about these otherwise youd be missing out on an excellent game  just dont buy the items because really the game doesnt require you to in order to progress  i play a lot of mmos and believe me the mtx in this game is so insignificant it can be ignored

performance issues i have a very fast pc so didnt have a problem with framerates but it definitely can use more optimization  i believe these optimization issues can  be fixed and it should improve the performance for others having more issues running their games

overall my recommendation is to buy and enjoy the game just like the first game this second installment promises many hours of awesome rpg fun

#####

after finishing the game i can finally say i recommend it

some of the problems are

 performance issues
 microtransactions for a single player game
 cant delete your save file through the game fixed
 very high cpu demand

edit i finished the game and even though i am displeased with the performance issues and unnecessary microtransactions i still gotta say i had a blast playing the game

the story is okayish but the world exploration and combat is just exquisite im aware that the game has flaws which are in most cases similar to the first game but at the same time it really delivers in everything else 

ps the game shouldnt have micro transactions but at least they are totally useless all of the items being sold are not only easily accessible ingame but also in most cases part of a system that require more than just one component to work so if you are thinking on just buying the port crystal and start fast travelling around the map think again the item is simply a beacon that you can place anywhere in the map that will allow you to teleport back there as long as you have ferrystonesanother item necessary for fast travels and both port crystal and ferrystones can be found or bought easily ingame after finishing my playthrough i had at least 20 ferrystones and 2 portcrystals in the storage

bottom line if you played the fist game and enjoyed it than youll definitely enjoy this one if you havent played the first but still likelove arpg with a living open world full of caves and corners well this is the right game for you for everyone else i would recommend watching some videos or streams to help you decide  

#####

the game so heavy that we need the best gaming pc humanity can achieve to even run this game on low

#####

really like the gameplay capcom just need to fix performance issue and its 1010 really all the reviews were talking about microtransaction you dont need it just play the fucking game for god sake

#####

holy micro transactions pay to edit your character is insane guess we are in the era of aaaa now where you have to charge 70 dollars and still nickle and dime your loyal player base i didnt even mention the performance i have a 3090 and it feels so sluggish come back in a couple months when they address the micro transactions and performance if they dont then it was a waste of such great potential

#####

big stinky

#####

character appearance can easily be changed in the capital town any resource sold by micro transactions is easily available just by playing game is running very well on my rtx 3060ti 

the game is gorgeous the quests are well constructed and the combat is very fun the paw systems is deep and can be extremely interesting to fiddle with

i have no regrets pre ordering the game

#####

more like dragons dogshit im sorry i might have been able to live with the bad optimization hoping patches would fix it but when its like a slideshow with 20 fps on a computer that is way beyond recommended specs its bad bad bad

then after buying and finding out theres microtransactions that have been turned on after reviews have gone online and them reviewers not having to have dealt with the things it brings new character because you made a mistake pay money change vocation to try out different classes pay money just want to start a second run with a fresh character not possible only one character in a single player game this is the most absurd way of introducing mtx into a single player game ever its already 65 for a single player game

#####

i got a 4070ti and i7 13700k and it barely runs constant hitching refunding ill come back when its on discount or fixed oh and the store page for a single player game is super scummy capcom

#####

poorly optimized i also made a mistake on my character and couldnt start a new game so i was stuck with that untill they fix it 

is the game good probably is it worth 70 usd no not in the slightest

i refunded

#####

the game itself iswas fine for what little i played it
however due to what i would consider unacceptable performance issues i did go for the refund
hopefully they will improve upon this over the next few months if they do ill probably pick it up again

#####

the game is absolutely fantastic and very addicting yet i cant forgive capcom for releasing a 70 usd title with such poor optimization and performance issues on top of the audacity of releasing day 1 paytowin dlc even though you can earn the stuff ingame

capcom released a statement that they will investigate performance so ill gladly change my review to positive once they fix it

____________________________________________


idragons dogma 2i is the game ive been waiting for over 10 years i absolutely loved the first and played it for countless hours the sequel expands everything the original title offered pumped to eleven its really hard to put the controller down once i start playing

that said this is a very punishing game you can fail quests npcs can die including questgivers and there is a certain mechanic within the game that can potentially kill all the npcs in a town there is absolutely no handholding in this title

____________________________________________


h1the goodh1
 this game probably has the best character customization ive ever seen its incredibly detailed and there are crazy stuff you can do just check reddit to see all kinds of characters people make

 combat is meaty and filled with depth it feels like something between monster hunter and dark souls a bit on the sluggish side as you have to commit to your attacks but there are a plenty of animation cancel through skills the whole mechanic of climbing monsters is huge appeal

 exploration is satisfying and despite the game being open world youll always stumble on something interesting every so often the pawns will always alert if there are any points of interest and mark them on the map

 this is arguably one of the best open worlds ive ever seen there is rarely empty space that plagues so many other open world games youll always find something to harvest a traveling pawn or merchant or a small group of enemies every few steps and the world design is so beautiful and varied it never feels stale

 you have a lot of freedom to do what you want when you want there are also multiple ways to solve quests

 the dungeons are incredibly claustrophobic in the best way possible the reliance on using light to navigate dark caverns is something i loved in the original game and its pumped to eleven here

 the revised vocations as well the brand new hybrid vocations feel incredibly good to control mystic spearhand is super fun and my favorite so far the power fantasy is much stronger in this game compared to the first one

 the game has plenty of graphics settings to tweak with

 nearly nonexisting loading times surprisingly


h1the badh1
 the story is somehow worse than the first dragons dogma which at least had a clear defined objective find grigori and kill him in this one the dragon doesnt even have a name and he doesnt feel impactful to the story in the slightest they also try to pull some game of thrones vibes with machinations and betrayals but it never pays off the whole plot points feel incredibly disconnected from each other lots of characters featured in the trailer cover and promotional material barely appear in the story there is no buildup and there is no pay off things happen at random without explanation its not some cryptic writing like dark souls just bad

 the camera is a bit janky sometimes especially inside dungeons such as caverns with tight walls

 while you can increase the fieldofview i wish you could increase it even more there are plenty of times where i get hit from stuff offscreen that i have no time to react

 despite the pawn system being refined the pawn ai still is a bit dumb sometimes they will often approach enemies head on even the likes of mages and sorcerers ive lost count how many times my pawns killed themselves by standing in front of enemies

 there is still a lot of platforming in this game but the it doesnt really work very well movement can feel janky and very unprecise

 while you do have a lot of freedom there are a couple of times where the game doesnt really explain what you need to do

 the game still uses a couple of outdated mechanics from the first title most notably limited uses of fast travel and poor inventory management

 no gear  skill loadout system this was an issue in the original game and it persists here swapping between vocations is still a massive chore

 there is a lot of backtracking this existed in the original but the world size was like a tenth of the sequel i understand this is part of itsunos vision and i actually enjoy the traveling but it can get annoying

 no unarmed monkstyled vocation sadly this is something i wanted since the original game

 i wish there were more races to choose from you can make humans and cat people but would be pretty cool if there were other races to choose from its a huge step for the series though


h1 the terribleh1
 its really painful to say this but i dont think this game was ready to release yet its incredibly poorly optimized even though its loaded with graphics settings my specs are above the minimum requirement but i was getting framerate drops all the time even outside of cities between 20 to 10 fps as well gpu temperatures reaching whopping 90c even with graphics on minimum ive been reading reports of players with rigs that match or exceed maximum requirement but are also getting performance issues and overheating
         apparently doing some tweaking on the nvidia control panel remedied some of the performance issues but my temperatures are still pretty high around 83c max

 also im pretty sure this game also has memory leak issues because i have 32gb ram but kept getting warning messages about bugs i have a feeling this is a problem of the re engine because i was getting issues like that with the demo of resident evil 4 remake

 ive been getting constant crashes during character recustomization when using art of metamorphosis ive legit lost over 30 minutes of customization three times because of that beditb i figured out its related to the background you set up for lightning reference if you use any other than the default one there is a chance itll crash the game

 another huge red flag is the fact this single player game launched with a bunch of microtransactions so incredibly scummy reminds me of itales of arisei capcom joining the practices of day 1 paytowin dlc is really disappointing fast travel camps items and even character recustomization sure none of them are actual paytowin because they can be found in the actual game but its still a very bad practice

 uses denuvo which definitely plays a role in the bad performance i heard some rumors that its also using enigma protector too i dont get why two drms in a single player game

____________________________________________


i feel really bad for itsunosan because hes an incredibly passionate game designer who worked hard to convince capcom to let him make the sequel and fulfill his vision for the original idragons dogmai but this game really needed more time in the oven to polish performance on pc not sure about consoles its clear the game was released in this state to meet deadlines set by capcom

and this whole situation sucks because the game is incredibly fun polishing the gameplay of the original game in a very satisfying way but the glaring performance issues make hard to fully enjoy it at least i didnt encounter any bugs so far aside from occasional pawn pathing which is surprising considering a game of this scope

however at the current state bi cannot recommend this gameb even though im having a huge blast unless youre a diehard fan with a very meaty rig and even so you might have problems with performance

#####

4 hours in and i feel like im underestimating but ive heard my main pawn repeat dialog lines at least 25 times already its actually worse than in dd1 i honestly cant believe it

#####

this game is so much fun even more enjoyable than the first one with a beautifully crafted world that never gets boring to explore despite the lengthy journey adventuring with your own character accompanied by a friends pawn adds to the fun with enjoyable roleplaying and smart ai pawns assisting in the adventure the gameplay is incredibly satisfying with challenging combat and boss battles in the 24 hours i played i didnt encounter any issues like bugs or crashes

regarding the microtransactions that many people are talking about i see them as optional choices you can obtain everything through gameplay you can farm gold and rc to acquire items available in microtransactions like the art of metamorphosis book used to change your characters appearance

however i must admit the game optimization is very poor my gpu isnt fully utilized and instead my cpu works excessively hard no matter what settings i use it doesnt improve the games performance

you should be wise in giving reviews as i believe people tend to exaggerate the issue of microtransactions capcom has already implemented microtransactions in previous games like the resident evil series and monster hunter which even offers a character edit voucher microtransactions are simply for those who are lazy to grind and farm youll enjoy the gameplay if you start from scratch

#####

hey capcom

you can purchase a good review dlc for 199

#####

wow microtransactions for basic functions of a game 2024 off to a rearing start save you money lads

#####

spoiler fun spoiler


really wish i could zoom the camera out further feels squashed in

#####

lets start with the obvious

are there micro transactions yes however aside from the tent cosmetics all the stuff can be earned in game yes its still scummy and shouldnt exist but there are some misconceptions surrounding it i dont fault anyone for giving a negative review i am giving it a positive because despite the mtx the game is a blast a rare open world rpg that trusts the player to think and make their own adventure and i havent been this sucked into a game since bg3

in terms of performance ive heard it varies dramatically depending on your rig for me im playing on a 4090 with a 13th gen i9 with rt on and no dlss needed im getting well above 100fps i am in the vast minority in terms of hardware however and ymmv

the game itself from my 5 hours is masterful an improvement over the first in pretty much every way from the way the story is delivered to the combat to the handcrafted open world and the enemy encounters 

hiring and switching out pawns is fun sending them back to their owners with gifts is a cool little touch that makes you feel attached to other players despite it being a single player game the pawns add a depth to the game and youre always looking for the ideal party set up to compliment your build as a sword and shield build having a caster on my team that heals me has been life saving 

i really like the music and voice acting as well the lip syncing is the stuff of nightmares howeververy stiff animations that never match up with the words

overall i highly recommend this game definitely consider your specs and do some research if youre playing on a mid or lower tier rig

#####

capcom destroyed a goty contender i was happy to even let them keep my money if i did not like this game between their previous high quality games and the news that they are raising staff salaries while the rest of the industry is laying off people in droves instead they sneak in denuvo sneak in microtransactions to a single player game that fundamentally clash with previous developer statements i have not seen a game company flush every ounce of good will they had this fast since bethesda and fallout 76

#####

disgusting slap in the face to every fan of dragons dogma wait until capcom back peddles on their disgusting business practices performs terribly such a shame how dare you not even allow a new game option im blown away

refunded and no longer hyped for monster hunter wilds capcom is dead to me

#####

bad optimization but very fun
the microtransactions are not nearly as bad as people are making them out to be everything you can buy on the microtransaction store can be earned in game 
people are starting to bandwagon hard and i feel it is unwarranted
not that i feel the game is flawless quite the opposite but i would like to hold such opinions till i have played more
please buy with caution but it is a very enjoyable game 
please think for yourself out there arisen good luck

#####

as of right now the performance is ass and i have mid decent specs so erm why does my game look like minecraft when i preordered this disappointing

edit tried everything ended up refunding literally so disappointed in this game
fyi for others i have rtx 3060 ryzen 5 5600g

#####

sad greed overshadows what seems to be a passionate game truly tragic

#####

never thought the day would come where dragons dogma would finally get a new game haha i was so excited i also never thought it would come the day where i would say fukk you capcom but it has come the performance is horrible and without justification cant believe i wont be able to refund this piece of crap capcom games were always well optimized what the hell happened here

edit the game is amazing the optimization is the only turnoff

#####

getting hard crashes on linux now denuvo blocks me from playing due to the activation limit since i dared to try to troubleshoot it
fun game though when it works

#####

remove the micro transactions its a full price game on top of that its a single player rpg where you want to immerse yourself 

fix the optimizationhorrible frames even with a rig higher than the recommended settings
in the cities its just unplayable fluctuates between 33 to 45 so fast feels like 20 frames

edit after 35 hours gameplay is great story is fine but i see mostly goblins everywhere need more mob variety  at least 2 more types of bosses to fights

#####

do not buy capcom dropped the ball hard on this one the microtransactions and the poor performance is insane
if they can pull off a complete 360 and remove and fix the game i might consider it but if not i will wait for the game to on sale for 10

#####

seems like a good enough game but id recommend waiting until this full price game made by a major developerpublisher which includes microtransactions is out of early access as it needs a lot of polish and optimisation

#####

if you are having issues with performance try disabling dynamic resolution and fidelityfx super resolution after i disabled these options the game not only ran a lot better but also looked a lot better wolves hunt in packs

#####

i made the mistake or preordering an anticipated game for once and what do we get 

baitandswitch microtransactions to ruin the experience yup a wonderful launch day surprise even the freakin fast travel is a microtransaction

dont let these predatory practices keep tainting brilliant games dont buy this game today

wait for the developers to either back out or just get the game a year later in a gotyedition after theyve listened to feedback and nerfed the microtransactions towards the tail end up their profit graph youll enjoy the experience more that way anyway and youre not encouraging predatory practices

#####


microtransactions in a single player game

rip

#####

i was pissed that this game lied about and added microtransactions right as it released but i had been waiting for it so long that i decided to give it a try anyway ten years was enough to ignore some stupid crystals so i thought this game ran so badly that it made me have to reinstall windows paid crystals ten years the world is a circus and we are all a bunch of goddamn clowns

#####

so ill try to keep this review kinda short a tldr is simply while the microtransactions shouldnt exist in a 70 game as long as they can be farmed ingame i dont care enough however my biggest big three complaints and the reason i wouldnt recommended this to anyone is you cant delete your save cannot make a new save and no new game plus also paying for character customization in a 70 single player game is mega cringe 

i had some other minor personal issues like the stamina system in the game was just bad like the worst i have ever seen and should honestly just not exist in general but we and the ui was just bad it was ugly and hard to navigate 

also performance issues i had the game on low and i still kinda struggled to play it and stream at the same time

edit ive beaten the game and forced into new game plus im leaving this as a thumbs down because after playing it i still believe this is an absolutely shiet tier game

combat is pretty mid quest design is probably some of the worst i have ever seen main story is shorter than a cod main story which is saying something most quests are either escort or do x  then wait in game day then repeat stamina system is down right horrible cc in this game is just the worst you cant do anything without your pawns needing to come and give you a pat on the back after a form of cc 

i truly dont understand how this slop made it out and how anyone can be hyped for it this is no where near worth 70 id dare say it isnt even worth 30

#####

whoa now capcom not so fast tell your shareholders to hold onto their butts because youre gonna be doin a lot of backtracking soon over all these microtransactions for simple quality of life alterations like changing your one characters appearance if not im sure nexus mods will fill in the blanks these types of predatory practices are what lead to class action law suits

edit ignore the shills and the fake accounts with zero games these are tools of corporate desperately trying to turn the review rank in their favor think for yourselves

#####

strikeso glad i need to pay two dollars every time i want to edit my character great feature 1010 classic crapcom finding new and exciting ways to just be aggressively greedystrike technically wrong you can also get them in game but theres a limit maybe sorta its unclear the mtx still feels bigrossib _ツ_

edit you cant start a new game without manually deleting the save files and triggering denuvo ahahahahahahahahha

#####

a typical aaaagame experience fix your fing game

#####

tragic release good game underneath if you dont want to put up with performance issues then dont pick it up right now

#####

dogma balls

#####

fun game but how the hell do you release a game without an option to restart the save mucked up character creation and had my guy walking all goofy i followed a guide and had to go into the game files to delete the save also turning off cloud saving did that and when he wasnt walking like vince mcmahon i continued on to play about 5 hours a very fun 5 hours to be honest saving and dying and loading saves the whole time nice and clean 
today i load up the game and am back to the starting area walking like vince once again 5 hours poof
imagine not having something as basic as save file management in a 70 aaa game good job capcom

#####

this is already one of the best games ive ever played and most likely my goty but it runs like my dead grandma also fuck taa anti aliasing wait for performance patches but this is game is amazing so get it when its performance is fixed also dont be fooled this games micro transactions arent in the way at all they are completely optional and all the important stuff can be earned in game  and its a capcom game they are whatever this game also has denuvo which is ass

#####

h1buyer beware performance is dismal it uses denuvo drm and they snuck in predatory microtransactions after launchh1

i have refunded the game not sure why steam doesnt show the product refunded information on my review so here you go

i have a pretty decent system ryzen5600 rtx3060 16gb ram and im struggling to maintain 60 fps on the lower end of high not max settings without raytracing or supersampling

edit i have also just now noticed the microtransactions that they snuck into the storefront after release not only are they highly predatory editing your characters looks cost 2 bucks but they are also outright pay2win as you can simply buy currency needed to hire overleveled and overgeared party members

edit 2 i am fully aware that the items obtainable by paying real money can also be obtained via ingame currency exclusivity was never the point of my initial statement

originally this was meant to be a strictly informative review about the performance but now its going to stay negative forever i am beyond disappointed and frustrated this was a game that i had high hopes in

#####

my experience
wait patiently for release see the mob of microtransactions hit the store front the minute game is available for download
super concerning but think that i wont likely need any of them as scummy as they are in a singleplayer title
load game it launches in a small window
thats fine dealt with that before ill change it in the settings
first sit through a worryingly long shader compile
change display settings and start game
audio is a full 17 seconds ahead of the cutscene
audio finishes and doesnt let the cutscene finish before moving to the next
at character creation my character data from the creator isnt appearing
give up

please dont buy this trainwreck until its fixed and microtransactions are removed better off being a cool pirate with a cool eyepatch

#####

the core game is fun but the amount of micro transactions theyre pushing on you for a game thats seventy god damned dollars is beyond greedy 
also shoddy optimization and a bewildering amount of decisions in the ui really i have to delete my save in the steam folder and turn off cloud sync to create a new character who thought of this nonsense

not recommended unless on sale for maybe 30 usd

#####

runs poorly mk support is dreadful microtransactions in this game are horrible greedy and disgusting

#####

very unplayable with the fps drops

#####

i love the game so far it is fun the world feels alive it has just the right amount of guidance and the pawn system is just amazing but

i hate what capcom has become i hate the microtransactions and the extremely bad performance on release 

do not buy this game if you are just over the requirements it will run horribly in more populated areas
do not buy this game if you have problems with bad mtxpractices and want to avoid them even though you do not need to buy them and can get the stuff ingame



edit to original review

the game is amazing it builds on the first dragons dogma and makes every system better 
it seems like capcom is also taking steps in the right direction and made atleast one of their dlcs available to get ingame an unlimited number of times

if the game gets more stablebetter performance and capcom continues to make the game better this will be an amazing game with its dark arisentype dlc which hopefully comes

#####

tldr runs badly but if you can it is a fantastic game the terrible mtx can be earned easily ingame 

long form i am the first to criticize stupid publisher practices and give bad reviews on bad moves but these permanent review bombings paired with straight lies for the gullible are getting out of hand 

lets clear a few things up

1 yes the game needs optimization its a common problem but since its mostly playable it depends on the individual person to decide if it is enough it was known multiple days from launch i dont understand the surprise btw monster hunter world ran mid too at launch where was the shitstorm there 

2 the microtransactions are ridiculous but they are the easiest to ignore mtx there can be the currencies character change item and fast travel item can be bought ingame from vendors for low prices nothing here is mandatory so stop lying for karma on reddit oder clown points on steam you arent forced to buy one to change your characters appearance theres an ingame way of obtaining that

now let me ask my fellow review bombers one thing where were you in the past 810 years of capcom games these mtx arent new a few examples 

monster hunter world has these it even ran badly on launch on console for example you are truly forced to buy the character change coupon for an existing character where was the review bomb everyone praises that game and ate that s up like hotcakes 

monster hunter rise has these too where is the review bomb

resident evil 4 praised to high heavens guess what has these microtransactions too where bomb

look at all hose highly praised modern capcom games where people even went as far to say they are the best modern pc publisher all these mtx are in those games why are people mad now especially when dragons dogma 2 makes it easiest of them all to ignore those

lets look at something else that is regarded as best game ever baldurs gate 3 had near unplayable performance and bug issues in the latter half of the game where review bombing

stuff like this is the reason publishers dont take us seriously anymore and with good right look at the steam discussions clown farmers and trolls on mass steam reviews begin to be worthless too you did well guys you made it harder to actually distinguish good from bad for everyone well done

#####

bmasterworks all you cant go wrongb

#####

im absolutely loving it so far it feels so cosy like ive come home after so many years i missed dragons dogma so much and the vibe in the sequel is exactly on point it feels right it feels warm i know this game the new vocation and combat stuff is so nice they really smoothed out the system from ddda and its great idk i could honestly gush about this game for ages highly recommend it at this point of time

performance wise i get some fps drops in the city particularly around the tavern but thats it no crashes or other issues 

will update when i finish the game

#####

so i am writing this review as someone who hasnt played dd1 but played skyrim bg3 acvalhalla etc and this is absolutely my favourite genre however i have played for 12 hours now to get a good feel of the game and i know i will probably get all the dd ogs probably commenting etc however a overhyped game is a overhyped game

i am not going to mention the microtransactions as dlcs or the frame drops we all know this is shoddy work for a triple a game and the company is trash for releasing it like that

however after buying this game for 6500 i really dont see the worth in it i reached the point of getting bored at 9pm on a saturday evening after only 12 hours ready to just go to bed and watch a film not being able to climb the cliffs is frustrating the amount of deadends from the rivers and cliffs when all you have to do is simply  swim  or even if a small travel boat could be used so you could at least go up stream would be another nice feature to avoid having to go back after battling the same monsters to go all the way around the said cliff before you have even got to the quest it takes absolutely ages to get to each quest from the sheer amount of monsters it gets very repetitive and boring starting a quest to then see on the map its at another townvillage and you have to go through the same route avoid the same cliffs and rivers to end up fighting the same monsters mostly goblins harpies and lizards every 5 minutes of walkingrunning to each destination teleportation wouldve been ideal so at least the option to get stuck into the storyline if you are more of an immersive player to get into the characters and quests rather than repetitive battles every 5mins and only have limited travel stones wouldve been a great option for people who prefer thislike waypoints discovered as you explore when you work full time spending a whole hour  2 hours just to get to the destination really grinds down afterwhile here we go againone evening one meaningless quest 

the characters and the voice acting is really peculiar the characters are hard to stick with and some of the voices were just interesting  to say the least

i honestly feel like the map is gorgeous and the towns look fabulous but if the monsters were more less approachable how on earth are humans alive with the sheer amount of monsters everywhere one step out of the walls and bam goblins harpies griffin make your choice first 5 minutes they are all there  just makes me think they done this to make it feel more full and to drag the quests out longer when in reality the quests are really not much at all
put on a guards outfit and you can run around the castle and no one will say a thing about it and considering the queen is on a witch hunt for you i could literally just walk around the castle grounds and nothing would happen take away the monsters every 2 minutes and honestly what is left the quests and characters were so so disappointing

the things i really praise is the fighting styles it is great and the animations and being able to climb the beasts was a great addition and the pawns really had some funny dialogues and it really felt like they were being controlled by someone and not just npcs you really can just leave them to it and they will do it and again their dialogues are great

coming from someone who hasnt played dd1 and who cares  people who havent played the first of a game still know a good game when they play one and for people who are more story driven rather than just repetitive fighting after a ton of battles you kinda get the jist of things and what to expect i just wouldnt recommend this game if you prefer this

one quest for example a chief said can you get rid of the lizards that are by the village walls ofc i acceptedoh there is some explosives over there just chuck them and destroy there nests ok done that and went backoh there is a jar of poison chuck that too so they wont come back done that and sorted he is a chief guard with men are they not capable but there is a big ass griffon on the other side those 2x lizards and a few eggs aint your biggest problem here and of course dropped the letter off and back to the city i go to confirm i dropped the letter off from a courier who already is riding ox carts every day but shock 2 minutes to let the courier know in the city the griffin attacks 5x goblin group attacks wolves harpies and more lizards 2 hours just to get back i mean how can this not be dried bread after awhile and thats the evening done after a full day of work one lame quest and battled nearly 50 of the monster species in one adventure in the wilderness 

another thing would be able to camp as you please where you would like after clearing the monsters in that area wouldve been great when you have just had nasty battles and need to camp it out and avoid the night time drawing in it would be nice to set up camp where you want rather than having to find a fire to camp at especially with the sheer amount of monsters about its veeery easy to just fall into another battle when all you wanna do is sleep and eat after an already big boss battle

the constant travelling of just walking and running is so slow and really takes foreeever an option for a mount wouldve been ideal a horse with your pawns wouldve been a great feature to get the ball rolling and maybe avoid so many monsters gathering on the main roads wouldve been better too and being able to store items in your horses saddle instead of having to go to the tavern to sort your kit out every time wouldve been great and more immersive the ox carts are a needed addition for the bare minimum for a somewhat convenience travel

also being able to make an elf character was great but in the game you can bump into an elf in the city and eventually visit the secret elf village however because you can only be a human or beast you can have the pointy ears etc but they dont react or treat you any different it wouldve been a nice feature to maybe add a half elf to make it make sense the fact the character customisation is so immerse more races shouldve been given rather than just human or cat person to all the races available in the game as there is more races within the world that you meet that wouldve been cool

all in all i have just got the gamers block now and feel like i have just simply had enough of it i am not sure when i will play this again as it cost me 6500 i will persevere with it and update my review when it is completed but at this rate i just really cannot be bothered to travel to each quest to fight the same old battles and walk miles on miles and get stuck between a river or cliff to just walk down the same pathways all over again and complete lifeless quests for lifeless characters i really dont give a toss about

on a serious note who saved simon or raghnall because i literally just google searched the best outcome because i really couldnt care less who to save the characters and voices are soooooo bad triple a game what

#####

game is terribly in poor performance and optimization even by playing around the graphic settings it eats up all 8gb vram and still manage to perform poorly 
rainbow six siege at ultra settings could run better up to 120fps or somehow ffxv can run a stable 60fps but not here in dragons dogma 2 you cant get a stable 60fps let alone even a solid consistent 30fps and that tell you that there lies a fault with the game and developers

youre better off waiting the next sale or a month for them to address and improve the game itself before purchasing but of you wanna brute force to play the game go ahead

my current specs
os windows 10 pro
resolution 3440 x 1440
gpu msi rtx 2070 super gaming x trio 8gb
cpu amd ryzan 5 3600
ram trident z neo ddr43600mhz 64gb

#####

dragons dogma 2 is a textbook example of everything wrong with modern gaming from its shameless cashgrabbing mechanics to its abysmal performance and technical issues its clear what the developers cared more about

in this singleplayer game i am required to pay money in order to change my characters appearance clever 

hopefully it will be fixed and the store removed otherwise refund

another l

#####

i roughly played for 2 hours or so in offline mode

tldr a potential good game with one major disgusting flaw

the good
 combat
 character creator yes you read it right but wait until the end
 graphics generally

neutral
 story so far seems linear but its too early to say i will keep it as neutral
 ui could be better 
 most npcs dont have anything that makes them stand out again too early to say
 riftstore aka the microtransaction shop that peeps are enraged about you can hire official pawns and other players pawns you pay riftstone to recruit pawns strike those upto level 8 are free beyond that their cost increases as you level up strike your main pawn is free and levels with you so you only have to pay for support pawns  you can also set your pawn to travel with other players and they earn riftstone each time they are used i am neutral since i dont really care about it that much

the bad
 optimisation is bad in populated settlements and your fps gets choppy but its something almost every game these days come with on launch not really a good thing but i hope it will be fixed eventually

the horribledisgusting
 the 2 character customisation item one time use now this would be normally acceptable in mmos but has always been something that was present in single player games on launch or added later in a free patch trying to monetise on one of the games attractive elements and the popular selling point is basically pulling another bethesdas paid mods

anyways i will play the game until the end for sure and i am very satisfied with my present character but hopefully capcom rethinks their stance on this ta

edit 1 few more hours in and i would like to update some of the stuff
 along with the rift in a certain major settlement there is a vendor representing the pawn guild i did not notice him despite walking past that area several times i am blind this fella sells some cosmetics and some ultility items such as the dreadful character customisation item which is 500 rc in this shop 
  i correct my earlier statement that you only get 0 rc pawns until level 8 since i keep running into level 15 ones with 0 rc in the open world i usually favourite interesting ones for later

#####

only allows one gamecant have multiple saves wtfruns like a bag of sh1t

#####

this is more of what i love i love dragons dogma and i love this game 

dont buy it the performance is really bad right now i can tank it with my build but i do not recommend it until its fixed

#####

great gameplay horrible optimization mtx is obviously horrible for a game like this but its the performance that really turned me off sad

#####

did ea make this game



after completing the game i must admit it was quite the journey while it served as a worthy sequel the presence of microtransactions still irks me nonetheless overall it was a satisfying experience


still im just a blind girl

#####

refunded poorly optimised drm paid dlc in a 70 title everything wrong with aaa

#####

atrocious performance unacceptable for any modern game especially at this price
very very disappointing because the game seems fun

#####

loved dragons dogma with 3 walk throughs on console

waited years for this game

now on day one game has micro transactions for a singleplayer game that costs 95 cad
they are charging 6 cad to fast travel to fast travel in the game 
another 4 to change your characters appearance  and this is a one time use 
list goes on

capcom is charging real money for basic qol mechanics 

i wont buy any of that and will continue to play the game it just doesnt deserve any good merit based on that alone

will update if anything changes

#####

hello i dont tend to review many games and i certainly dont do them early but i feel like this one needs a review due to the recent review bombs i have seen

pros

 the pawn system is interesting fun and unique
 build variety  being able to change class at will and experiment is great fun
 exploration  you are really encouraged to explore to uncover secrets which has you playing the game at a more methodical pace
 combat  this is fun and refreshing action based combat 
 consequencesside quests  i enjoy the fact that there are consequences to actions and the side quests are decent 
 it doesnt hold your hand which encourages rpg elements such as figuring out some quests not all as many do still have markers and making you live with the consequences of your actions which i feel like will add replayability it does have ng 

cons

 performance in the capital does drop a bit it is still very much playable for me and doesnt bother me but it is there the most annoying bit is npcs popping in the game is cpu heavy so dont expect graphics to fix it you will need a higher end pc to play it currently 
 movement is a bit slow it would have been nice to maybe have a mount or have it where stamina doesnt drain out of combat
 encounters can get repetitive the game throws enemies at you a lot and since you have to walk everywhere and are slow you end up fighting the same enemies a lot 
 microtransactions arent great and i will never condone them but at least you can get all of the paid for items in this game early on i dont feel a need to buy anything and they havent unnecessarily slowed down your experience to make you want to buy them like ubisoft does 

verdict

is this game for you it is hard to say 

dragons dogma was always a polarising game it is not like many other rpgs and you shouldnt go into it expecting it to be  if you  want to play it safe you can get the first one in a heavy sale and very cheap to try out the style of game before buying this one this game doesnt really feel too much like a sequel in all honesty and the developers have even sort of confirmed that it wasnt meant to be this is more like dragons dogma 15  it is what they envisioned the first one to be but didnt have the technology at the time to make so the first one will give you a very good idea 

if you are on the fence i would highly recommend just waiting for a sale before buying and do plenty of research maybe watch some lets playsreviewscritiques but try not to spoil it too much in case you go for it 

im not entirely sure myself if it is worth the current price tag but i do think it is a good and fun game and is worth playing so long as you understand what you are getting you can always wait for a price drop and some patches to fix some of the current issues 

edit

i have now played the game for a lot longer than i had with my first review i am still enjoying it massively and think it is worth the price if this is your style of game i see personally see myself playing this for a very long time

#####

micro transactions to change your characters appearance in a single player game fuck everyone involved in this

#####

very buggy and not optimized for pc hopefully its better for console

#####

as someone who enjoyed ddda for what it was a cult classic that was made with two sticks and a wad of bubblegum i genuinely want to recommend dragons dogma 2 to my friends who didnt play the first one sadly i cannot do so at this 70 price point and this review is going to rate this game based on the price capcom thinks it deserves

im not going to waste anyones time complaining about performance issues or worse mtx performance issues can be fixed and mtx can be completely ignored and do not matter in the slightest what youre actually here for is a review about the game itself because the dna of the game itself cant be fixed from performance patches

so lets just say it plainly dragons dogma 2 is not what dragons dogma 1 was meant to be and if it is it is sadly extremely short sighted 

or worse it is not what we wanted dragons dogma to become after playing through dragons dogma dark arisen but it is what itsuno originally intended

it took maybe 3040 hrs to accidentally reach the end game lets just say i thought i was maybe 14 to halfway through before i realized it was basically over i stopped my completion of the end game to check if this was even real because i was that incredulous and disappointed by it 

it slides you down that slope faster than your pawn can say ive just had a thought curious thing one of my former masters chose to hire only women i wonder why

dragons dogma was never a game known for a masterclass in story writing most would find it and the game itself obtuse to navigate but that was part of its charm this game 90 of the characters could be yeeted out of the window and it wouldnt matter the entire second area of the game bakbbatahl could be completely cut and you wouldnt miss anything

the city supposedly discriminates against pawns but the only thing thats different is you have to pay like 10000 gold at one inn vs 2000 at another one

everyone is a side character there isnt really any grand mystery going on or an overarching goal youre inexorably marching to its one big side quest and nobody reacts to it or remembers anything after each end is tied up if you could even say the ends tie up at all and none of it connects together in a way that makes sense

most of them barely do a single dance on the stage before theyre carted off to the backroom and put to sleep with chloroform sometimes this happens while theyre still supposed to be on stage

dd2 isnt a sequel its a remake of ddda and somehow it does worse in the story department despite having way more resources

but thats just the story what about the gameplay

dragons dogma 2 does improve upon the combat of the first game the vocation system and pawn ai and inclinations the system in dd1 is extremely obtuse and youd have to do things like do 100 levels of sorcerer then swap to blah blah blah to make a mystic knight or magick archer that wasnt completely garbage from stat growths that needed an excel spreadsheet now every class auto switches the proper stats so you can play what you want as you want when you want

pawn inclinations followed a similarly convoluted process of which there were like 9 and you had to feed them elixirs or theyd get them from you doing things like picking up items in combat or using the go command etc problem is you couldnt easily tell what inclination your pawn had which could make them easily suboptimal

a scather mage would keep climbing monsters instead of casting like it was supposed to while a mendicant mage would cast healing spells etc more often than not so scather was great on strider pawns and so on

in dd2 what your pawn will do is much easier to grasp and change on the fly if it isnt working for you if you have difficulty with this just get a mod to easily buy the art of metamorphosis books problem solved

where it falters is enemy variety and also giving you only ten vocations in a game that should be giving you far more at this price point not less

hope you like fighting reskins of goblins and saurians because those chucklefucks are everywhere theres no thief or archer advanced vocations either and every class uses one weapon set and they only switched it up with warfarer 

warfarer allows you to use three weapons of any vocation but you must make sure to get the rearmament maister skill from the guy who gives you the vocation and assign the rearmament skill or you cannot make use of that function it is not baked into the vocation wow

strider in the first one mixed what thief and archer are in this one and it made your pawns extremely versatile ranger was an advanced vocation that went in on the marksman skills assassin was a hybrid vocation that could use swords daggers shields and bows

mage and sorcerer are a bit worse in this game because sorc in dd2 doesnt even have support spells compared to mage now were missing most of the great spells from the 1st game

trickster barely works all that well because the enemy ai cant handle it

oh whats worse is that magick archer and warfarer arent able to be unlocked until you reach the spot that will send you to end game and you can completely miss unlocking them like anything else in this game it will not automatically unlock for you if you miss it and go into new game  meaning youll need to replay the whole ass game again to experience it you can unlock mystic spearhand early on in the game but you can easily miss it i will not spoil how to do so

that leads me to the next point

what about the end game is it anything like the first game 

no

1 when you do enter the actual end game youre on a skill diff timer im not gonna spoil it or explain further on what that means that isnt the purpose of a review

2 unconscionable sin there is no scaling in new game 

in the first game its not like everfall and hard mode is an improvement situation nah there was a lot of stupid copy and pasting decisions and cheap one shot difficulty that was trivialized as soon as you could stat check it bitterblack isle improved on things quite a bit in dark arisen in my opinion

but if youre hoping dd2 has something similar to dd1s free roam and fighting scaled up monsters you wont find that here theres zero scaling and thus no point to playing it over unless you want to chase achievements while falling asleep in your chair because everything dies in one hit

oh did i mention its still super easy to bug quests and lock yourself out of rewards and quest chains for reasons you cannot comprehend side quest amount isnt the issue though many could do with some serious quality control

last but not least the soundtrack does not slap or evoke emotion make me feel again

if you made it to the end of the review thanks for reading while my playtime hours probably dont show it i very much enjoyed dragons dogma dark arisen for what it was and was very hopeful for this one 

i must confess major disappointment with this game if it supposedly was finally the game the director wanted to make maybe capcom didnt let him get off the hamster wheel and he was stuck in a fever dream because thats what playing through the story actually feels like

verdict wait for sale because theyll probably give this game the dark arisen treatment but this time will ask you to spend 30 on dlc in november to fix a 70 game that shouldnt be like this


tldr dragons dogma 2 does not fix any core issues of the original and doesnt expand on the original as much as it should do not buy it for 70 i got it for like 50 so i dont feel as bad heh

dark arisen was directed by kento kinoshita not istuno btw

edit grammar brief pawn section

#####

given the current state of affairs ill keep this review negative until capcom returns to a more reasonable approach as someone who purchased dragons dogma 2 out of nostalgia and holds a deep fondness for the game its particularly disappointing to see the implementation of such restrictive measures while dragons dogma 2 undoubtedly shines in its improved combat mechanics and intricate details there are aspects where it could learn from its predecessor
it is disheartening to observe capcoms decision to integrate denuvo and other protective measures into dragons dogma 2 a choice that has unfortunately led to notable performance drawbacks and restricted the communitys ability to mod and implement fixes these actions not only detract from the overall gaming experience but also curtail the creative potential of the community hindering their ability to personalize and optimize their gameplay
the implementation of such restrictive measures raises questions about their necessity especially when considering the vibrant modding community that often enhances games and extends their longevity by limiting these possibilities capcom risks alienating a dedicated segment of their player base who enjoy the freedom to tailor their gaming experience
furthermore the impact on performance is a significant concern pc gamers invest in their hardware to enjoy the best possible experience and measures that compromise this investment are understandably met with disappointment a balance must be struck between protecting intellectual property and ensuring that gamers can enjoy their games to the fullest extent
in conclusion the decision to implement these measures in dragons dogma 2 appears to lack a clear justification particularly when considering the negative impact on performance and the restriction of creative expression within the gaming community a more balanced approach that respects the desires of the community while protecting the interests of the developers would likely be more beneficial in the long run

#####

capcom you can buy a good review dlc from me

only 199

#####

man this game is really cool but there is so much that still feels like its stuck in 2010 it does a lot right but more wrong

spoilers below
the new vocations are dope as hell the pawnarisen interactions are really good i honestly dont mind the change to the armor system it makes things more streamlined without making it just one piece of armor combat feels way smoother and really nice 

i cant comment on performance issues as i get a steady 60 throughout but i have an amd 7800x3d and a 3080ti

there was a comment before the game came out that fast travel was only for boring games well play long enough and that same pack of wolves those same lizardmen that same cyclops becomes boring af

there is no option to create a new game once you made your character i hope youre happy the one save isnt that big of a deal but i should be able to delete that save and make a new one from within the game how this shipped without that is astonishing

spoiler below
there is a mechanic in the game which causes your pawn to get sick this sick pawn will murder the entire town you rest in quest givers friends vendors doesnt matter oh and its a cutscene not even something you can do while it happens there are signs and ways around it but the signs are subtle and the method for making sure it doesnt happen is a chore also although i have no proof of this part apparently its caused by recruiting sick pawns and fighting dragons  its a terrible mechanic that is not well implemented 

overall the game is cool but as far as the vision goes this dude needs glasses 


#####

h2 the good h2
if you loved dragons dogma youll be pleased to know this game is practically that with a new map and new story mechanically speaking i havent noticed any change from the first game so thats kind of cool it isnt often a sequel gives me just more of the thing i like beastrin or whatever and all the cut concept stuff youve likely seen are nice additions and the map is massive

h2 the bad h2
runs like ass denuvo crashed on me twice so far and the microtransaction shit that being said nothing that ive noticed exists that you cant personally get in a good 5 minutes or so well maybe that extra port crystal but besides that so assume that is the lazy mans approach similar to ea and battlefield spending money to shortcut your single player game

h2 the verdict h2
it was worth 70 usd to me because i wanted more dragons dogma that being said id wager it isnt worth that value to most unless you are really really into the first game and just want more dlc and buggy games are pretty par for this industry now unfortunately so while id love to thumbs it down i see no reason to on that accord play it if you are still itching badly after reading this  if not wait for them to do their job and optimize it a bit better  remove denuvo after it gets cracked hopefully i genuinely enjoy this game and hope capcom realizes everyones gripes lean on the accessory functions they bogged the game with micro denuvo shit qa testing and the game itself is awesome

#####

edit about 42 hours in

update 6 beat the game and not the fake ending ultimately still a 5 out of 10 mixed reviews are what this game should have at the time of postingagain after beating the gametheres still no option to start new games saves are tied to the cloud and easily corruptible or even able to be totally lost performance is dogwater and there is much to be desired on all fronts that said thief is a fun class definitely very strong but also fun to play that said all the fights sort of devolve into the same old thing i honestly cant believe i was fighting goblins and harpies most of the game even at endgame final result get the game for 10 bucks sink a weekend or two into it and call it good i wouldnt bother with the side quests but maybe there are a few worth doingi never found those and itd be too intentionally inconvenient to look for them

update 5 after maxing out the caster classes and switching to thief i realized something pretty much everyone must not be playing casters because the thief is actually fun to play it doesnt make the dogwater quests or exploration if you can call always being in some sort of a canyon exploration more immersive but it does play in a fun way ive also been told the spearhand also is fun to play anyway if youre going to play this game on a very steep sale i recommend going thief so that you dont end up hating every moment if i had known id have gone thief from the beginning

update 4 this quest design is inexcusable a full set of stealth quests with no stealth mechanic ask around town for vague clues to find a boy attacked by wolves who is a days march away fetch quests abound leading to more fetch quests stay in my house for a week the only redeeming quality this game has is that you can occasionally see big monsters appear while you travel though oftentimes those monsters flee

update 3 pretty bland i urge you not to play a spellcaster and to play literally anything else you will spend about 60 of your time fighting your camera as a spellcaster which seems inclined to make sure you never look up or at your enemies if you ever use your nonspell projectile attack prepare to be stuck not seeing what your enemy is doing

ill probably beat the game but i still dont recommend it assuming all the issues below get fixed itll still be about a 510 if you pick it up saddle up for fetch quests the cinematic large creature fights are the only allurei dont recommend sidequesting at all unless you have a specific hatred of goblins

wait until its 10 bucks on sale or just skip it dont use the mtx for the reasons below unless something crazy happens this review will stay as is

update 2 at native 2560x1440 on high it could hold to about 60fps in most spots until i got to the major city then it tanked into the 20s the lack of optimization is no joke

the camera is cancer again on par with the last game

scavenger hunting throughout town to find chests with lamp oil and beast meat in them is pretty on par with the last game seems most of the loot hunting is pretty optional your pawns will never stop pointing out ladders and chests that you cant see though

just about everything about the game is a bit lackluster i bought on humble bundle so refunding isnt an option but i probably should have waited until a nice 75 sale alas the hype was real

the graphics a huge letdown those screengrabs you see in the store are from cinematics it has no right being this unoptimized for how bad the graphics are

update 1 a couple hours in now will add some more details

animations are awful facial animations look like a cat chattering at a squirrel from the window cutscenes are clearly where the effort went and nowhere else

the pawn banter is neat but i can see it growing tiresome already

if you play a mage get ready for a world of absolute garbage controls not too unlike dd1 in that regard but real bad your camera will look in random directions while youre stuck firing straight forward relative to your character

the graphics would be on par with a game five years ago possibly older no idea how poorly they optimized it to run anywhere under 60fps genuinely unmodded skyrimtier graphics



microtransactions in a 70 dollar game
no solid support for mousekeyboard
denuvo drm
starts in a tiny window that betrays how bad the graphical performance is going to be which ive already heard about and am anticipating

i will change this review after 300 hours if i manage to get that far for dealing with the above thats how much good content i expect in the meantime wait for them to optimize the release and then probably catch it on sale for 15 bucks a year or less from now

#####

a great game that will be permanently held back by capcoms pointless microtransactions and greed 

the dlc items are so incredibly worthless that they arent even worth 5 minutes of effort ingame 

wakestones can be farmed by hiring pawns and keeping them for 1 day cycle 
the campsite and key are literally something every npc sells for the price of a couple potions
character appearance change items are sold by npcs 
you can get rc by killing ghosts at night and generally just playing the game
the fast travel rock is an ingame item you can find you can only place 10 at a time so it is truly pointless

#####

dragons dogma is my favorite rpg game series

dd2 is the best game of the series easily

#####

4070ti super  5800x3d getting less than 60 fps on 1440p with dlss in towns and 30 in more populated towns

i know the game goes hard on cpu but this a joke the game sometimes just dont use the gpu at all

the game is awesome but i cant recommend a 70 game with this optimization hopefully it gets fixed in future patchs

#####

amazing game
horrible optimisation that is just not good dont buy it til fixed
the microtransactions are aimed at people who dont know you can literally walk 2ft and get most of those things in nanoseconds
im hoping it was more of a capcom thing than a dev thing at least

#####

if you like dragons dogma 1 you will like this one just skip all the extra money grabbing stuff you get items trough just playing the game anyhow have an adventure you will take performance hits on towns and villages so hopefully that gets fixed i get steady frame rates on my adventures i78700k 32gb ram 1080ti running full hd 144hz monitor mid graphics

#####

games better now just hope to see more optimization all across the board


#####

 like the game so far but i sincerely hope a plane flies into your copmany capcom maybe youll wish you could buy it away too then in your single player experience

#####

enjoyed the hell out of dragons dogma one
i cant get this game to run at all 010
i could get the free character creator to run so i figured the game would actualy run boy was i wrong
also sneaking in day one dlc on a 70 game is a big no no
i have refunded the game just gonna go back to playing 1

#####

this review isnt about microtransactions i dont care about them

i dont recommend it because performance is ridiculously bad
its not about fps you can get 90 fps but the game will still feel sluggishchoppy it has terrible frametimes frametime is all over the place

this is the worst performing game ive seen on my pc with 4090
i absolutely dont recommend it  refunded it myself

#####

its like skyrim with good gameplay

#####

new edit had to underclock my gpu and also adjust the voltage game is stable now but its insane that i have to go into my gpu settings to to have a stable game also game is a damn blast in general

this has to be one of the most poorly optimized pc ports of all time i have a rx 7900 xtx ryzen 9 7900x and 64 gb of ddr5 ram and not only is the frame rate awful but the game crashes all of the time it is unplayable this is absolutely unacceptable especially coming from capcom i do not recommend this game right now in its current state to all of my other amd brothers and sisters that are having this issue just ask for a refund

edit oh and lets not forget about their scummy mtx tactics they kept them hidden from the store page until the game was released because they knew that people would hate them they claim that everything in the store can be found ingame but then why put them out for purchase if thats the case mtx in singleplayer games baffle me they shouldnt exist

#####

gonna be honest read a bunch of reviews dooming about performance decided to try it myself made a character and crashed during a 5 second walk it was running fine ish and then just crash i really dont want to spend 70 on a game that might be fixed one day so ill just refund and sit it out waiting for fixes ill definitely change my review if or when that happens so far so bad yikes

#####

capcom pay me 199 for a good review 

#####

the positive review for this game is in save slot 2 but i cannot seem to find it

you can only have one save slot maybe it will be added later as a microtransaction

#####

game keeps freezing in character creatoer

#####

besides the fps dropwhich is horrendous the microtransactions which can be ignored because you can acquire them in game although it isnt really an excuse to have microtransactions the game overall is amazing i really love it it seems harder than the first game but maybe its a learning curve and i am still very early in the game the good thing is you can take your time playing the game and there is no rush this is coming from someone who doesnt have a lot of time if you are hesitant for the game get it on a sale or when they fix the fps drop

#####

shoehorning microtransactions in at the last minute and making no mention of it in a 94 single player game performance issues i can understand but that i cannot abide save your money people dont give it to these tone deaf morons

update yep hot trash avoid

#####

mouse acceleration and smoothing are enabled by default with no option available to turn them off i understand the game is designed around controllers but this is borderline malicious towards players that prefer keyboardmouse

#####

i love the game play and combat a lot but cant help giving a bad review for this one
the base game is already expensive enough so there are no reasons to put in micro transactions also the frame rates are pretty bad

#####

game itself is great its immersive and a breath of fresh air so far this year cant give it a thumbs up however due to capcoms crappy hidden microtransactions in a singleplayer game and yes you can obtain everything ingame but this is another instance of setting a dangerous precedence for gaming moving forward

#####

cannot delete your characterstart over within game microtransactions in a single player game for 2 you can change your characters appearance and poor performance deserves the negative reviews thank you for the awards 

#####

i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

the game is good

i have an rtx 4080 and i5 12600k plus 48gb ram and the game is unplayable due to cpu usage and i had about 15 crashes in 8 hours because the cpu couldnt handle it even on low graphics rt off obvsly if you havent at least a i9 13900k you wont be able to walk trough a city  and the peaks of cpu usages could cause your game to crash i have never seen a game this poorly optimized on pc in my life so even if the game is good it doesn t matter if you can t play it i strongly recommend to wait

#####

70 and the game barely runs with specs well above the recommended dozens of microtransactions and limitations to induce fomo such as the item used to change your appearance art of metamorphosis being limited at the rc shop but purchasable for real money on steam

everything regarding the gameplay itself is comparable to its predecessor therefore its good but id recommend waiting for a sale or multiple performance patches and bugfixes



#####

the game might be good enough to play in a year assuming therell be improvements right now the flaws dampen the best parts of the experience to such an extent that its hard to recommend at full price even when you disregard the atrocious level of microtransactions in a single player rpg

#####

in my professional opinion i find it challenging to endorse this game due to several notable deficiencies the graphical presentation performance and narrative lack the desired level of quality the repetitive nature of the enemies and the unengaging exploration where finding anything of substance seems like a futile endeavor further detract from the overall experience the quest design and voice acting are also lacking in finesse and the lipsyncing appears outdated in comparison a game like witcher 3 surpasses this one in every aspect additionally the absence of a voiced protagonist and the lack of compelling character development make it difficult to invest in the narrative

#####

appart from the aggressive microtransactions in a single player game not gonna even bother at this point ffs put some kind of restrictment on mission items ive sold them and now i cannot progress what kind of crappy game design is that

#####

the game has been fun so far but the performance is absolutely terrible in many places mostly in settlements but a aaa game that is only optimized to barely make 30 fps at demanding locationsmoments is unacceptable also denuvo is ridiculous malware that should not be in any games and the true reason its in this game is so modders cannot trivialize capcoms microtransaction store

#####

dragons dogma ii feels as though they werent content with dragons dogma and instead of creating a new game thats appropriate for 2024 they just improved upon dragons dogma this results in a fully priced game released in 2024 which feels like it was made in 2012

unfortunately for them 2012 was 12 years ago and standards within gaming have risen dramatically since leading the game towards committing the greatest sin of all blandness nothing in this game feels stellar combat is quickly repetitive and uninviting the general atmosphere feels lacklustre and empty dialogue and voice acting tacked on and often riddled with superfluous chatter which adds nothing to the conversation beyond sounding more fantasy

this game simply cannot compete with games in the same genre such as baldurs gate 3 the witcher 3 and elden ring each have their own personality and flavour each do fantasy in their own similar way to dragons dogma ii but each are successful in their own ways and consistently provide the player with reason to continue playing dragons dogma ii fails entirely by being neither captivating creative interesting or exciting

if youre on the fence about buying it make sure to wait until its 50 off at the very least

#####

there is an amazing game buried below a terrible pc port and tons of useless micro transactions 

recommended specs are just a lie the game fps drops to 30fps on much better pcs than recommended and the mx are usual capcom bs they will try to sell you anything they can despite the fact everything can be easily obtained in the game

game may be 910 in a few months if they fix the performance issues but as it is now i cannot recommend it at all

#####

i did play more but not enough to write complete review i just hit point first big city where game framerate is so bad i do not want to play anymore have to write some things as a warning for people who thinking buying this

 horrible optimization even when on fast computer framerate is usually maxed or close to that it sometimes just drops down to 25 fps sometimes and first big city it goes even worse
 you can only make 1 character and you can not even delete your saverestart game from begining you are stuck with one savecharacter why what the hll is this bullsht
 there is horrible denovo drm to make sure you dont use mods or avoid those microtransactions in single player game you paid 65 also if you play on linux you can get banned from game you paid just because denovo decide so greed and really bad
 dropping this to last because seems you can get some or maybe all things in game without paying real money but there is expensive microtransactions in this expensive game 2 even for changing your characters appearance greed and not even giving anything for money really this is worst way to do this in game that is not free to play

i can not recommend this before they fix these things if they fix framerate issue and allow us restart game and have multiple saves then could maybe recommend this if getting cheaper price if they also get rid of denovo drm then this game would be worth current price

#####

very bad optimisation 4090 with 7800x3d ran at 1080p the fps dropped to 4753 in vernworth turned on dlss the fps went to 5865 but everything looked blurry

on top of that are heavy microtransactions in single player game you can farm currency ingame but very slow they also selling advantage and convenient dlc like less weight camping kit fast travel stone and so on

other than those above i like the gameplay but there are afew glitches npc path finding pawns tried to climbed on invisible walletc story is okayish

if they are dare asking 70 with microtransactions up front then i as customer will expecting a lot more from capcom

h3 gameplay  exploration h3  

dragons dogma is an actionadventure openworld game focused on combat monster hunting tactical planning and intensive overthetop difficult combat its system focuses on the pawn system a system used before in the first game where you control to a certain degree up to 3 additional pawns that serve as different classes to aid you in combat

the difference this time around is the change in the class system where we see separations between archer and dualwielding warriors into two separate classes its a nice change in my opinion as it doesnt force you to mainly use blades despite preferring an archer class and vice versa

the combat is intense a lot more difficult but feels more realistic pawns work together much better this time around prompting for combo skills and evolving in experience the further you progress in the world and face different monsters

physics play a nice role here and can be utilized better in your advantage its a lot harder to dodge incoming attacks from large beasts as the hitbox does feel change and the combos not so predictable

exploration is improved this time around greatly the world is expansive rich full of life with impressive visuals and places to explore each carrying interesting places to visit

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3199455498

h3 fun h3

this game is truly something else its so much fun and impressive for what it is

h3 visuals  presentation h3  

gorgeouslooking game with stunning visuals overthetop visual effects and elements that left me surprised at every step the world is filled with points of interest and attention to detail

this time around were introduced with some incredible visuals in cinematics that blend excellently with the game and make things fairly seamless 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3197721473

h3 sound  voiceacting h3  

the sound effects are great and give a good sense of impact when striking voice acting is fairly good but not impressive in all regards i feel theres somewhat a mismatch between exhausting breaths and the voice of my character

main characters from the story are wellperformed i must remark that the loose language is very well covered by old english expressions and foul language is wellcensored by different expressions that i personally appreciate the use of old english is interesting in this regard and its something i dont remember being part of the first game

h3 story  writing h3  

a step in the right direction despite not being heavily focused on the story and more on the experience this game is a step forward in that area although ive not beaten the story im wellinvested in knowing more characters and the world and i might update this section with my final conclusion on the story

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3197875205

h3 length  difficulty h3  

its a very lengthy game to complete and so was the first game since the developers have said this game is 4x larger you can expect a good 100 hours to complete it difficultywise it is fairly more balanced in a way considering the fact that theres no difficulty picking and in dark arisen hard mode getting hit once is fatal here youre still challenged but with careful positioning and patience you can pull it off better

h3verdict h3  
dragons dogma 2 is an impressive game and by far one of the best games ive played in 2024 im excited to explore and complete this game and share more if ever i change my views on the game i only wish it would get the fixes in performance it deserves other than that id avoid taking peoples complaints on the matters they dont understand because except for denuvo and microtransactions the game is a gem

#####

denuvo

#####

i was enjoying the game up until a point where i decided to climb up a hill which apparently i was not supposed to climb i hit an invisible wall so i turned around to go back but the way i came from was impossible to get to so i was stuck on this hill the only way to get down was to fall to my death i then had the option to reload from my last save or to reload at the last inn when i reloaded my save i was back on the hill still in the position i was in before i threw myself off so i tried reloading from the inn thinking it would take me to the last campsite i slept at

nope

i got sent back by about 2 hours worth of progress because i just wanted to get down from a hill which shouldnt have been climbable in the first place and the game autosaves so my only option was to lose all that progress because i decided i wanted to explore not cool

#####

works on my machine


#####

dragons dogma 2 is interesting and different from any other game its much closer to immersive sims than traditional rpgs 

you are a part of the world which react to all of your actions  you can see it from the start i tried the first game a few times and never actually stayed to play the second one grabbed me right away and i cant wait to continue my journey

dd2 is like adventure the video game  you are going on a journey with three npcs and every step of the way is something magical happens you just really invested in this world i didnt feel this way in many years in video games its a breath of fresh air in aaa games which 100 focus gropped and try to hold your hand every step of the way

#####

wrongfully accused of tampering by denuvo and locked out presumably because i verified the integrity of the game files too much pretty unacceptable oversight

#####

dragons dogma 2

starting with the actual issue here  performance it has issues cities and towns have their drops
some tweaking can help openworld is mostly fine so lets hope for a patch

the issues mtx you can edit your character in game by doing a quest you can aquire it as much as you like takes 5  10min you dont need to buy a single item with real money it is all in game

im not defending the option for people to buy these items it is stupid but dont spread lies about this being the only option it is not

i never review like this where i actually call out other reviews but its becoming more rediculous each year



now for the game itself
fantastic combat system awesome world and a well designed quest system
dragons dogma 2 is a improved dragons dogma 1 and it shows

the pawn system is still awesome to use and the world is huge
story right now is interesting and im excited to see where its heading

dd2 looks to be a phenominal hardcore rpg experience no hand holding exploration 
a fantastic sequel and a must play for fans of the game and genre

enjoy the game 

#####

will say the game play is fun but dont buy this game for full price wait for a massive sale or until the performance is fixed it would be nice if they removed the microtransactions but i wouldnt hold my breath i was looking forward to this game but thanks to the executives at capcom the game has been ruined good job capcom

#####

game crashes so often youd think i was playing a bethesda game

#####

dragons dogma 2 is literally the most fun ive had with a single player experience since elden ring came out

performance is fine just struggles a bit when in densely populated areas such as the cities which will be patched sooner rather than later outside of that though its pretty much always smooth

the presence of microtransactions in this game is scummy for sure but you absolutely dont need to pay a single penny to get the full experience microtransaction items can be acquired by simply playing the game and exploring people are making it a bigger deal than it is theyve had mtxs like this in every other capcom game blame the higher ups at capcom

this game is absolutely fantastic and its release is being marred by a bunch of ragebaiting negative nancies i guarantee if you check this game out you wont be dissapointed

#####

why is there microtransactions in a 65 euro singleplayer only game

#####

fun game unacceptable microtransaction practices bad performance gamebreaking bugs strange unintuitive save system
capcoms response we are aware of the bugsperformance issues and are investigating there is nothing to investigate you knowingly made the choice to release the game in this state buyer beware

#####

edit they addressed the issues i was concerned with all thats left is for game performance to be at a good level then ill change this to a thumbs up as for the game its itself story  610 810 if you go for and complete the true ending you also get a different cutscene if you finish it when your main pawn has high affinity gameplay  1010 the games has the bones to be something truly great but falls short in some areas the fact that new game plus doesnt scale with you is a damn shame however if you are a completionist theres a lot to keep you busy overall rating 7510 needs endgame dlc original review below

the game itself is fantastic it has everything you could ever want if youve enjoyed the original dragons dogma

so why a thumbs down

 it runs like ass and its single save 
you need a good pc to run it well consistently

people are absolutely overreacting with the microtransactions they are tame and inconsequential as almost everything can be earned ingame and easily too so buying them makes you an idiot it gives me headaches to see other games with similar mtx tame easily ignorable get praised to the high moon like monster hunter world resident evil 4 devil may cry 5 yet this game gets shat on for it if youre gonna push back on the mtx which is absolutely okay at least be consistent with the movement with every game past present or future otherwise youre being a hypocrite with double standards and doing absolute fuck all to get companies to understand what is unacceptable or not

the only microtransaction that is seriously questionable is the 2 character editor if you dont like the way your character looks youre out of luck because you cant make another save file or make another character the 2 character editor itself is inconsequential you can get it in game however the 2 editor in combination with only having one save file is an absolute scumbag move not being allowed a quick redo or make another character via another new game save file is depressing

that said if you have a good pc or dont mind fps drops dont mind having a single save or dont even care about mtx then by all means go ahead and enjoy underneath all the scummy business decisions and shit optimization is a genuinely good game 

i have long past the refund window but i have a decent enough pc so i might as well just enjoy this absolute gem covered in mud however those on the fence should just wait a bit until capcom fixes the optimization and single save bs then this game would be an 100 easy recommend without a shadow of a doubt

it is situations like this where i wish there was a sideways thumb or conditional recommendation option why hasnt steam added something like this is a mystery to me

#####

no option to hide helmet i bought the ugliest one on accident because i thought i could hide it i guess im going without armor up top p

ive played over 5 hours so far but it feels like 5 minutes fun exploration and the battle mechanics feel great too although some of the graphics have that feathery look i used to have with my 1050 ti and havent seen in a good while since i got the 4090 im excited to play more because i havent even seen the story get started but when i checked the reviews i was dismayed i hadnt looked at the changing character stuff yet but now that i have its a shame to see that there are microtransactions in a single player game i wish you could unlock content through skill you know an award for actually playing the game companies are so greedy even ones with good ips i hope they dont do the new fable so dirty when it releases they will

#####

the game itself is pretty good the pawn being the core point of the whole game their interaction and versatility make a lot of interesting potential adventure

there are several problems tho that could stop more than one to buy the game


ih3 purchase the full review of deirowtag for 299h3i





#####

capcom in recent years is a company that does not disappoint and increasingly gives us better games and adventures to enjoy and in this case we have dragons dogma 2

11 hours of adventures missions farming new items equipment

incredible things about dragons dogma 2

 the story our protagonist is arisen and as soon as we start the game everyone will recognize us for our past and our deeds
 the world an incredible place to explore as much as we want and it is full of enemies allies vegetation and everything you can imagine without leaving empty areas with nothing
 the combat is super satisfying and sometimes you will notice that you need new equipment because there are enemies so strong that just touching you will send you flying
 the pawn system to hire up to 2 there is you your partner and 2 others that you can change whenever you want at a price depending on the level of course
 all the variety of enemies and bosses


problematic things about dragons dogma 2

 the saving system you go to settings and click save and continue it does not have slots to make manual saves and if you miss a mission it is difficult to go back to restart it or choose a manual save
 performance fps drops in all parts of the game and stuttering patch 1  29032024  they fixed many issues 


and about the dlcs the truth is that no one forces you to buy them and you can get them by playing buying in the stores in the cities and doing missions

#####

barely played it but ill leave this positive review to clarify a lot of misconceptions some people who have never played dragons dogma dark arisen have about this title they are unfairly review bombing it without even understanding how it works

in my ps3 i have played dark arisen for at least 300 hours this is why a lot of the complaints are annoying me especially the dlc related ones

1 all the items you can buy through microtransactions are obtainable in pretty fair ways through the game most of them are quite easy to obtain

2 this is not the first capcom game to do that capcom does this since resident evil 2 remake and devil may cry v the game isnt even balanced with these dlcs in mind they usually make the game too easy if you are not the audience who wants to make the game laughably easy these dlcs are not for you

3 most of this dlc controversy comes from the fact casual gamers cant fathom the fact that someone made a game that tries to make fast travel situational in 2024 they noticed you could buy portcrystals one of the items required for a sucessiful fast travel and freaked out they assumed capcom was basically selling fast travel as a dlc this is just wrong

4 ill clarify how portcrystals work they are positionable items that create fast travel points however to actually use them you need ferrystones ferrystones are not cheap in the early game and you wont be using them when you have more feasible options like using carriages or simply walking when its not that far the game is structured like stalker and a lot of organic situations happen during the trip and the game wants you to engage with them while travelling this is why fast travel isnt something the game gives to you like skyrim or some shit

5 dragons dogma dark arisen gave you a lot of portcrystals and apparently 2 is not being unfair on that department too the dlcs are an early boost akin to dmcv or re2 remakes dlcs you really dont need them

6 the other items like playerpawn customization are obtainable rather early in the game you shouldnt even worry about these complaints

if you enjoy games like monster hunter elden ring and morrowind youll like this one the mechanics are really unique and the whole idea behind the game is being a travel simulator bring the correct resources and plan your trip properly dragons dogma 2 also brought some stalker elements to the mix and the world is organic which means theres a degree of unpredictability to your trips if you play dragons dogma for what it truly is instead of expecting fucking skyrim 2 or the witcher 4 youll come around and enjoy it

shit its frustrating how you cant release unique games anymore in the aaa sphere without the risk of triggering a mass of casuals who do not understand your gameplay loop truly disappointing for me as someone who waited since my teenage years for this sequel

#####

no thank u for 100 dollars u can buy a pistoi to end my iife before i have to play aigan

#####

not with denuvo and this performance

#####

its a shame the game is getting review bombed from people hastily jumping to conclusions as to take advantage of steams refund window 

if you have played dragons dogma 1 this feels like a very faithful sequel almost every mechanic has been carried over fast travel pawns combat all with a massive boost to the level of polish the mtx everyone is complaining about is nothing but a shortcut everything you can buy on the steam shop is freely available in game without much effort only a handful of hours in and i have enough rc to edit my character or anything else if this is the one thing holding you back from purchasing the game disregard the criticisms and give it a try its an amazing game so far 

dragons dogma as a franchise is not an rpg that will hold your hand theres a lot of things you will need to research look at wikis etc the gameplay is deep and there is a ton of discover you will walk into areas you are very much not ready for and get destroyed its a learning experience and an amazing world to explore with a massive map the second time around 

performance wise you will definitely need a beefy pc personally running a 4070ti and a ryzen 9 7900 and the only place im dipping below 60 fps is in the city its likely playable on mid range machines but you will definitely need to lower settings but in my opinion this is a good thing we need games to push hardware so we can have advancement without games like cyberpunk crysis etc every game would look like a nintendo title thats 2 generations behind 



#####

ours is a party of women by and large  and yet no two of us are the same


dragons dogma ii aside from the issues that have been discussed and debated to death here postlaunch is absolutely phenomenal i didnt expect to like it near as much as i do it truly is something special i cant wait to sink so much more time into this game

#####

keep mtx out of full priced games and single player games

#####

70 for this unstable money grab i have never seen a game without start new game ever in my life capcom should be ashamed of this bs tactics of selling a expensive game locking you out of basic features with microtransactions and doesnt run properly hahaha i want some of what theyre smoking 

edit
that said the game is really good and fun though ok they added the ability to start a new game still plenty to fix but im changing my opinion to recommended now having way too much fun with this game

#####

i cant believe i waited years for this so many quality of life aspects are absent in this game things that were in the first game are absent here cant even change my gear in one go gotta take the stuff out exit go into the menu oops wrong shield gotta start the process all over again having 4 skill slots at any given moment kills me you have so many cool skills to use and they all gotta fight for a spot you couldnt give us 8 skill slots this game aint worth it for those who have played the first game if youve started with the second game its probably okay rip dragons maw rip lightning whip

id give this game 610 wait for a sale or wait for dragons dogma 2 attack of the dark arisens
