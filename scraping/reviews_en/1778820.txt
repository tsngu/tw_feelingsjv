its not mortal kombat 1 its an actual complete game

#####

super ghost battle  where you can play against an ai that adopts the style and tendencies of yourself or another player  is a gamechanger for beginner players like myself

you learn a good new move and have a lot of success with it so you you use it a lot then your ghost starts using it a lot too so youre forced to learn to defend against it and that teaches you its not as good as it seemed and more importantly  when its good and when its not

got bodied by another player online download their ghost and you can have as many practice matches against it as you like it to learn how to handle their moves without having to set up a study session in practice mode which is also greatly improved btw

theres a lot to like about this game but ai ghosts are the most important for me amazing feature

game has genuine concerns that need addressing such as plugging and general game balance but bamco instead prioritizes taking down mods because itll hurt their revenue from their cash shop actually laughable decisions

bandai namco went full greedmode

as of march 29 approximately 2 months after launch bandai decided to add an item shop with purchases being made with real cash and a premium battle pass all purchased seperately from the already expensive 30 season pass in a 60 game without any prelaunch roadmap warning players about the ways in which the games going to be monetised
all of this is being included in a game thats plagued with many other issues that need urgent fixing like wonky netcode terrible balance and no real penalties for cheatersrage quitters

scummy doesnt even begin to describe it i cant recommend a product thats leaning so heavily towards such shady practices its a shame because the core game itself is a lot of fun

#####

you know this is gonna be one of the good ones when you see the arcade mode having full cgi endings for every character

#####

arguably the best tekken game to ever release
i felt like with tekken 7 a lot of the aesthetic and identity was lost 
tekken 4 5 6 and tt2 had amazing identity graphics and style that made tekken what it was
8 brings back its style identity and flow that weve all been missing in t7

the roster consists of 32 characters each with their own unique fighting style moves and combos it holds a rich story mode a variety of online and offline modes and stunning graphics and sound

story mode picks up where tekken 7 left off with the final showdown between kazuya mishima and his father heihachi mishima we explore the origins of the mishima family feud the secrets of the devil gene and its orgins as well as the fate of jin kazama who is missing after the events of tekken 7 the story is presented in a cinematic style with fully voiced cutscenes and dynamic battles 

gameplay is fastpaced fluid and responsive with a balance of offense and defense there are new mechanics such as the heat mechanic which allows the player to unleash powerful attacks as well as recovering health chip damage and power crush which allows the player to absorb some damage and continue their attack the game also has a variety of stages each with their own environmental hazards and transitions

online mode is robust and smooth with a ranking system a replay and a spectator mode we also have crossplay between different platforms allowing players to challenge each other regardless of their device sounds are impressive and immersive with realistic character models detailed animations and expressive facial expressions there are diverse and dynamic soundtrack featuring rock techno and orchestral music  the voice cast is of talented actors who deliver their lines with emotion and personality


to sum this overall great package
positives
 amazing gameplay
 phenomenal design and graphics
 stages characters and moves are perfect
 tekken ball
 online lounge and online modes in general are smooth except day 1 release
 we can use all tekken soundtracks in the game from t1 all the way to t7 and 8
 the story is awesome really well done
 easy to get into arcade quest and the tutorial really help out bringing the best in you its easy to practice easy to learn and very hard to master
 the ghosts ai is actually capable and useful what a great design choice and implementation

on the negative side
 not enough customisation options t6 is still the goat in that regard
 no tekken force
 the sound of punches isnt as satisfying as t7 but its good enough still

tekken 8 is a mustplay for fans of the series and newcomers alike as it offers a satisfying and thrilling fighting game experience the game has a lot of content and replay value as well as a deep and engaging story the game is a masterpiece of the genre and a fitting conclusion to the saga of the mishima family

yet another fresh fighting game honeymoon review

as someone who played mainly 2d fgs it feels like a breath of fresh air there was so much new stuff at first sometimes it felt counterintuitive controlling characters continuously without mindless button mashing was like controlling a plane for the first time but after getting used to it for a time period and applying some similar concepts in genre like framedata and frametraps in particular abusing save moves etc ive noticed amusing urlhttpsglossaryinfilnettfootsiesfootsiesurl sidesteps and ducking make it so good with one of the most satisfying movement options in genre without airdashes mind you legacy stuff and tons of knowledge checks may feel overwhelming sometimes but actually it turned out very interesting to get used to it as well

i am concerned about heat system because it feels too oppressive sometimes with heat smash and burst being safe on block for most of the characters but i hope to be wrong at least it is not a comeback mechanic and there are counter plays to it i guess

netcode seems significantly better than t7 it was fine on 100110 ms ping but it is not consistent and may have random lags thankfully it can be fixed via restarting the set in lobby 

also i adore the ost it is so diverse and has energy of several previous games in the series at the same time while also bringing something new to the table great customizable jukebox included 

havent tried that many casualsingle player modes except tekken ball its fun and arcade quest but the latter seems really disappointing and probably one of the worst tutorial modes ive played i expected that this mode would give me some fundamental tutorial on how to play tekken but instead i was demolishing braindead ai with the same options over and over thanks for explaining how urlhttpsglossaryinfilnettfootsiesukemiurl works here i guess on the other hand if you want to improve your game there are great qol features training mode while being not convenient at first has a lot of settings to try out various potential situations in game the possibility to choose the necessary move for dummy instead of recording it is such a time saver replay feature with built tips system to recommend how to punish and duck specific moves helps a lot

overall a really great game by far 2023 and 2024 are the most amazing years to learn and play fgs for a long time for me alongside urlhttpssteamcommunitycomidkranteauxrecommended1364780sf6url

tekken 8s story mode makes street fighter 6s world tour look like disco elysium

this is by far the best battle shonen anime i saw in years 

and i have zero ideas about whats even going on lol this is my first tekken game

#####

update feb 29 2024

still recommend the game but have to chime in on the fact that the tekken shop and the way it was implemented is the worst possible approach they could have taken minimum purchase of 500 coins for 499 with each costume costing 400 coins is outrageous 11 item purchase would have been forgivable but they just had to piss people off and add fortnite coins didnt they tekken 8 would have been easy goty contender for its quality and its release would have been 100 flawless if not for the shop sad times


h1prefaceh1
by no means am i tekken master nor am i a fighting game maniac but as a gamer who is familiar with almost every genre i try to play every fighting game i can get my hands on its safe to say that i at least know the basics of fighting game mechanics and what it takes to get better in the recent years with the help of my best friend from high school ive had a chance to learn the ins and outs of games like sf6 dragon ball fighterz mk and even some anime fighting games as a result the more i invested the more i learned the more i learned the more i enjoyed the games i grew up with the og playstation and tekken 3 now 20 years later what a great time it is to be alive to witness the eighth installment of the tekken series

h1positivesh1
bgameplayb
in the fighting game genre i think we can all agree that if the game is fun the game is already great to a certain extent back in the day thats all that mattered now weve got other categories to consider like amount of content cosmetics replayability updates etc but lets face it when it comes to tekken no one can deny that its the legend among legends when it comes to the bare bones they solidified the game and introduced the new heat drive system they went the same route as street fighter 6 in that they brought the special style for newcomers  akin to modern controls in sf6  to just press buttons and enjoy the game for what it is of course we all know that this will only get you so far and to really delve deep into tekken one needs to get the kids gloves off and play like the tekken legends of old lol to learn combos w manual inputs and understand what youre actually doing regardless there are many ways to enjoy the game by whatever means necessary the game perfected the tekken recipe and it is indeed the best tekken to play in 2024

bcontentb
two things that were noticeable companies know that a lot of players are not as hardcore and excited to play onlineranked so it feels like they implemented a strong ghost system for players to enjoy in the longterm especially those who deem themselves less competitive like myself when it comes to replayability i think this is a good way to enjoy the game further past the storyarcade modes without stressing out about playing online second the special style allows players to see what certain characters can do without lifting a finger really well maybe using your thumb to chain simple combos but it definitely makes the character bust out the flashy stuff on the fly

h1negativesh1
bstoryb
tekkens story is beyond disappointing and this has been the case since t4 its your average hero beats villain angel vs demon routine that every tekken has brought so far no real character development no real stakes just a jinkazuya fest as usual i have this lowkey feeling that the writers have this hardon for making the japanese characters look cool and have the characters that represent the rest of the world be their side pieces but this might be just minor politics at play and wouldnt really bother me if the writing wasnt so subpar 20 says ai technology can do better for tekken 9 then again every anime series post2010 has had similar subpar storylines all over the place so i guess they just lack creativity and prefer to take the safe way when it comes to stories just like ubisoft

bcustomizationb

update feb 15 2024
upon further analysis the customization in tekken 8 is the best in the fgc beats the likes of mk1 and sf6 out of the water still would like to see more accessories as we had in the t6 days but from what weve seen people around the world come up with these past few weeks since launch the potential of creating various characters from different franchises is astounding

strikethis ones a bit disappointingstrike do they plan to release more accessories and outfits in the future if so are they gonna be paid dlc case in point the customization options that are available at launch are underwhelming to say the least i dont know why i was expecting to feel more excited to see the likes of t6 and ttt revived but i might have gotten my hopes up a bit too high at least we can make leon from re4 cyberpunk for jin a bootleg kenshi from mk for victor goku for lars

h1conclusionh1
bfinal verdict sb
arguably the best tekken game of all time for veterans and newcomers alike the biggest compliment i would like to throw is that in a game industry where were used to companies releasing unfinished games to rake in the  harada and his team really took their time and sweat blood and tears to bring tekken 8 to a nearperfect state before unleashing it upon the world also really looking forward to how knee dominates the tournament scene once again

yeah i think ill be sticking with this one for a while

#####

side effects as a tekken player you will be described as many things a scrub a bitch a cheap ass mofo a youre not playing tekken bruh a youre playing a character that carries you a go kill yourself if you play this character a bruh let me help you do this instead a you press too many buttons a you dont press enough buttons a why you keep throwing bro a go fuck yourself you suck a bro let me teach you bcs you didnt really beat me and more imagination can be very creative so dont listen to punks  there are tons of guides and modes for t8 to learn and practice get a clear head on what you want to focus on and get it done one move one step one combo at a time you will get better and this is where your satisfaction will come from accomplish through perfect execution and leave the pinheads behind and if you are a pinhead do us a favor and go play street fighter 6 or better yet mk1 cheers

#####

im here now
doing the best i can
where are you now
did your dreams come true
here we go

#####

i believe this and street fighter have set a new standard for fighting games but i prefer tekken because the flow of the fight feels so much better and launching with 32 characters is also a good sign its also probably the best fighting game story ive ever played you can tell they put a lot of heart and hard work into it the only negative is that the achievements are too easy taking around 10 hours but i dont think fighting games are important for those

#####

ive been suffering from depression and an anxiety disorder for several years now recently even been diagnosed with it and just as i was having an utterly terrible day i managed to land my first rolling death cradle in ranked and won the match that made me feel actually so good that the day turned out pretty alright

thank you harada and all the hardworking devs for this gift to the world

#####

anyone remember back when in tag 2 harada said it was wrong to release characters as paid dlc in a fighting game
then he backtracked on tekken 7 where the total dlcs cost more than the base game
then he went even further beyond in tekken 8 and nerf the customization items so you have to pay to get more clothing options
what is going to get nerfed in tekken 9 next paying for song choices

i paid for the ultimate edition just to support this franchise despite the shtty golden clothing no one ever wears but had i known this inapp purchases would become a thing for tekken 8 i honestly wouldnt have bothered

guess i will learn my lesson for the next tekken

edit the nibbarinos at bamco added battle pass ayo wtf

h3please bring back tekken x street fighterh3

h1 welcome to the king of iron first tournament 8 h1
tekken has existed in my peripheral vision for most of the time ive been playing video games my mum was quite strict back in the day so my 12rated copy of tekken tag 1 for the ps2 could only be played in secrecy and as a result of its frenetic combat wacky character roster considerable mode variety and banging soundtrack this is something me and my brother did many times to see how the series has evolved since then is a truly glorious sight to behold tekken 8s vision of a nextgen fighting experience is polished to a brilliant shine offering a level of satisfaction variety and value that few games in the genre have ever delivered laying an incredible foundation for the next era of the worlds most popular 3d fighting series

tekkens combat fundamentals are largely unchanged matches are typically played in a bestof5 format with each round lasting 60 seconds but few rounds ever reaching that limit as every combo grab and heavy hit can take away most of your health before the 15second mark is reached the beauty of this brisk pace comes from all fighters having over 100 moves to execute each with unique properties and existing as part of distinct stances thereby giving you abundant options to become an unpredictable opponent in every brief encounter 

tekken 8 greatly turns up the aggression with the heat system which can be used to deliver a devastating burst attack though it also provides access to exclusive moves and a longrange dash all of which can completely change the tides of battle heat combines well with the new recoverable health gauge where certain heatenabling moves can restore a significant chunk of your health at a moments notice if all else fails rage arts return from tekken 7 allowing you to shut down your opponent if they put themselves in a punishable state at the last moment

this really only scratches the surface of tekkens complex fighting mechanics and learning all of its elements will take many hours of practice i am therefore beyond ecstatic to report that the training tools offered by tekken 8 are second to none this begins with arcade quest a minicampaign ultimately acting as an extended tutorial that slowly introduces you to its mechanics and core character moves using the goal of becoming the world tour champion as a motivating backdrop 

if you want to take your play further the practice mode is packed to the brim with useful features including punishment training programming the ai dummy to perform specific moves a record feature which can help you learn tricky combos and so much more beyond this the game automatically creates ghost data from online opponents and allows you to fight them at your leisure essentially giving you a limitless number of uniquely behaving characters to learn from if you have ever felt anxious about taking fighting games online tekken 8s training options will give you the experience and confidence to feel truly ready to hold your own against other players

h1 take a stab at it h1
in terms of the fighters tekken 8 has a healthy base roster of 32 characters old favourites like kazuya xiaoyu kuma and king are back all greatly benefitting from the improved visuals and audio design making every hit feel and look more satisfying than ever before three newcomers fill out the roster and while this is unusually low their playstyles feel unique and have all become personal favourites of mine azucenas tricksy mixedmartial arts style is the baseline for plenty of powerful moves and hilarious animations victor has many lightningfast combos dominated by knife attacks and his devastating katana moves exude serious raiden energy which is only ever a good thing 

reina functions as the spiritual successor to heihachi and ended up being my main as she allows for some incredibly aggressive play with options to bait opponents out of a defensive stance and greatly punish them alongside a few iconic electrics to boot crucially while im by no means an expert on tekkens meta no character stood out to me as completely unviable or overpowered each loss could only be attributed to poor decisionmaking and while the default skins are excellent theres an extensive character customization tool offering dozens of unique cosmetics for every fighter all obtainable ingame for no extra cost

where tekken 8 slightly disappoints is within its relatively small arena roster granted theres a lot of visual variety here and many have multiple floors which may be dynamically accessed via specific moves however i wish there were a few more environments to cycle through though frankly theres no bad arenas here and i never once groaned at the appearance of a particular stage one great feature to add a bit of variety comes via the jukebox mode allowing you to customize the music for each stage using songs from every game in the series its hard to feel disappointed at tekken 8s humble song selection when there are literally hundreds of songs to fight to 

h1 the complete package h1
regarding singleplayer offerings theres an excellent cinematic story mode depicting the events surrounding the final confrontation of jin and kazuya while brief there are plenty of jawdropping setpieces and a few surprises to ensure that its runtime is all killer character episodes exist for the entire roster each rewarding you with mostly humorous cgi cutscenes tekken ball makes its grand return with its wild ball physics offering a hilarious change of pace from the many intense battles youll be experiencing finally there are numerous builtin ghosts which reward unique cosmetics

for online youve got your standard ranked modes quick play private matches and the tekken fight lounge which essentially ties together all of these options into a social environment offering a convenient space to either banter or detox between fights netcode was pretty excellent in my experience though your mileage is likely to vary i have a 150mbps wifi connection and 90 of my matches were as smooth as they were when playing offline however those 10 of fights where my opponents connection became unreliable resulted in near unplayable levels of input delay so i would highly recommend that your internet is up to the task before hopping online

and in terms of performance the game ran at a nearperfect 60fps on maxed settings 99 of the time loading times were superfast and i only experienced a handful of crashes as a recent 120fps convert it should be noted that there is a hard 60fps cap but if this is the tradeoff needed to enable crossplay id take that choice every time

h1 verdict h1
when deciding upon the final score i kept asking myself two questions 1  does tekken 8 push the genre forward and 2  are its issues large enough to hurt the overall package the more i kept playing the more i believed the answers to these questions to be a resounding yes and no respectively if tekken 8 only delivered improvements to combat this brilliant roster of characters and its slew of varied customization options it would still rank as an excellent fighting game however its the genreleading training options that push tekken 8 into bestofalltime territory for me i can just as easily recommend it to someone completely new to the genre as i could to series veterans and this is undoubtedly its finest achievement i can see myself playing for many years and look forward to seeing how they can expand beyond this already stellar offering now if you dont mind ill be getting back to getting good

h1btekken 8  a fairytale gone wrongbh1
h3once upon a time well barely two months agoh3
ill give it to bandai namco they came out strong with a nice modern take on classic fighting games created a good looking and fun product and it was a very positive experience at first which is why the game is currently sitting at just that rating

everything could have been nice and wholesome the publisher could have kept releasing new paid characters introduced the tekken store after a few weeks where people can throw additional money on top of the box price of 70110 and with the millions of players who purchased the game as well as hundreds of thousands who keep playing the game across all platforms that would have been enough to cover the development costs of a tripple a game cover the server costs for running online services for the next 8 years and still make a nice chunk of profit on top

h3how the evil witch kept reaching for your walleth3
but alas corporate greed set in once more and i am sorry to tell everyone the dream of for a change getting a fair aaa game is over barely two months after release we get battlepasses and to everyone who does not have a problem with battlepasses i say you absolutely should have they are what became of loot boxes since those are too restricted and rightfully stigmatised greedy suit wearing ceos had to come up with a new psychological exploitation for helpless victims time limit pressure and fear of missing out combined into one nice package called battle pass where the true battle is you fighting your inner demons not to sit infront of the stupid game for hours on end despite not wanting to

h3is it unreasonable to demand not to be cooked for wanting sweetsh3
anyway rant and moral lesson is kind of over i know making aaa games costs a lot of money most people are aware that buying a 70 game is not enough incentive for companies to keep producing the reasonable folks amongst us know this big permanent online game needs microtransactions to be viable but there is a limit to what is acceptable and what is not 
selling new characters over time cool
selling expensive costumes in the tekken ingame shop cool
selling all sorts of tiny things to customize your game more in the ingame shop cool
introducing a manipulative and widely hated system of time limited progression bar not cool

h3and next time i tell you about how the evil witch disguised herself to fool the hunterh3
you know what else is not cool releasing the game without all these things to harvest all the positive reviews and then once two months have passed show your true intentions this is the lowest most cowardly form of backstabbing you can resort too so obviously im leaving a negative review despite the game being actually good and no valve this is not review bombing you insert colorful words of choice here this is called tipping the scales back to balance


spoilerif this review helped or entertained you please consider giving it a thumbsupspoiler

#####

they waited a month after release to add in game purchases presumably to avoid the negative press at launch

tired of getting fleeced by game companies

if you needed a more legit reason all of online battling is garbage since theres absolutely no downside to just altf4ing out of a match if youre losing online


and now theres a battle pass

i wish i could leave two negative reviews

#####

pros
its a fighting game with decent netcode

cons 
there is no punishment for rage quitting
the are no rewards for ranked
they are taking items which were in the previous game and asking you to pay for them
the customization is not up to standard for what fans expected
the story ends for an obvious dlc tie in
they waited until all reviews were out to announce tekken shop
the character episode endings are not up to standard to previous titles


#####

b since the game was announced im a married man and have two kids now im going to neglect all of that to play tekken 8 lolb

b my training starts today i will reach evo finals and beat arslan ash b

spoiler weapon of choice xbox series controller spoiler

#####

get ready for the next microtransaction

#####

i love tekken but tekken 8 has gone a terrible direction everything bad that was creeping into tekken 7 with the pay to win characters is now the main gameplay for tekken 8 endless strings that are plus on block cheap lows and push to win heat buttons 
tekken 7 had movement and poking ive played high ranks in t8 that cant even punish basic strings but you can be sure they can heat smash all the way to fujin 
i still play but the game is frustrating because every game is about forcing 5050s every match feels the same and unrewarding win or lose i made them guess wrong or i guessed wrong 
really hope they can turn down the brainless unga bunga but i doubt they will its the core gameplay and its awful i dont think t8 will have the depth or longevity of t7

#####

win game  feel absolutely nothing
lose game  the voices are back again

#####

its fun but just lol at adding unannounced paid battle pass on 110 game

as someone who has essentially never played a fighting game before tekken 8 is outstanding its only been out for a few weeks and ive already managed to sink over 80 hours into it  and i have a fulltime job tons of cool characters extremely satisfying gameplay the game itself looks great and runs buttery smooth the netcode could definitely be better but that doesnt prevent me from enjoying the hell out of tekken if youre a competitive person like myself the game will provide you with tools to get better like frame data a replay viewer with the ability to assume control at any time a practice mode etc so even though the move list may look intimidating its definitely possible to learn even if youre new to the genre and if you just want to play casually youve got two main story modes with smaller side stories for every single character and ghost ai that will adapt to your playstyle on the fly so if you dont care for the online competitive aspect of the game you never even have to touch that stuff oh and you dont even have to have a controller to play it its perfectly playable on a keyboard and its arguably the easier input method if anything
i fell in love with the game almost instantly theres something in here for anyone even marginally interested in fighting games and im sure ill be playing it for many hundreds of hours to come thoroughly recommended

#####

a month after the game launched ibandaii introduced an ingame mtx shop that was never discussed prior to the games release none who paid 70 for the amazing game that itekken 8i is knew about this before the feature was mentioned in a patch note truly disgusting behavior and something many people seemed okay with which wasnt surprising given how soft the gaming community has become regarding this type of stuff i asked valve to refund my purchase because this was not something i wanted to support and i was denied due to imore than 2 hours played and 14 days passed since purchasei lets just ignore the publisher knowingly misleading their players and changing the iesrbi rating later to include those succulent words we all crave to hear iingame purchasesi

but ibandaii is a double gbgreedyb and bglutenousb it wasnt enough that they were selling stupid skins for 5 anymore they also want to exploit the players ifomoi with a bbattle passb now so here we are 2 months after the game released and the game is now infested with all the hip predatory moneygrabbing microtransactions without this being discussed prior to the games release like before i again sent ivalvei a refund request in hopes that they accept it this time but you know imore than 2 hours and 14 days passedi and all that jazz cant give consumers a way to fight back against these sleazy practices big publishers are resorting to nowadays by introducing predatory microtransactions in their game sometime after launch to get around negative pr no no no that would be bad because of reasons

what a time to be alive when my 29yearold slavass can say biback in my day games didnt try to bend me over and fuck me for all my moneys worthib i wonder if my grandkids will believe the tales this old slav will tell them or will it just be iok grandpa time to take the yummy pills youre leaking againi we truly live in a society

so while everything i said below in my original review still stands when looking at itekken 8i as just a game my stupid ass is again reminded of how ridiculous this way of perceiving aaa games from 90 of publishers nowadays is this isnt bijustib a gamebits a productb meant to extract as much money from my pocket as possible

fool me once shame on me ibandaii

h1bthank you itekken 8ibh1
for the past few years ive genuinely struggled to get excited to play any game i own or could buy my passion for gaming reached an alltime low near the end of 2023 and 2024 brought more of the sameba new year same old burnout plagued meb things werent looking good bruv

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3147207996
i was legit thinking of calling it quits but only after publishing my cute little flipbook project i worked on for the past 6 months plus i was once again still am tormented by i assume ram issues despite already getting a brand new kit from gskill on the 3rd of january after going through their rma process

but thats a story for another day
back to itekken 8i

on iorthodoxi christmas eve i was scrolling through my youtube feed and itekken 8si teaser popped up i already watched it back when it was first shownbi did not careb yet now i did after that i watched the story trailer for the first time my tummy felt weirdbtwas butterfliesb i was giddy with excitement i was looking forward to a game for the first time in forever and it was a game from a franchise i did not care for and from a genre i dont even like it was an iorthodoxi christmas miracle then and there i decidedbi must play it day 1b as fate would have it i had just enough tf2 keys sitting in my inventory to fund this desire of mine so i did

to pass the time until it fully came bi played the demo loving every second of my 23 hours spent with itb sure its content offering was small only 4 out of 32 playable characters the first battle of the story mode the intro section of the arcade quest mode and a few super ghosts fights that let me reach only the iwarriori rank but its the motion of the ocean that counts and oh boy bdid it rock my boatb the 26th just couldnt come soon enough

the gameplay shocked me by how easily i jelled with it fast flashy and furious yet it was welcoming to a complete noob like myself i was loving the learning process and it didnt feel overwhelming i even managed to get gud at doing some simple combos and air juggling so thats nice and i love the new gameplay additionthe bheatb system being able to stop my opponents attack flow by using the bheat burstb attack which is uninterruptible is music to my ears sure you can easily block it but this is where the fun beginsbtrying to time it ijust rightib plus the bheat engagerb and bheat smashb ii do be engaging in smashingi attacks can be used to extend combos and deal even more damage in the process simply majestic the tradeoff is that bheatb only lasts 15 seconds but do you really need more than that sometimes less is more you know

speaking of cool attacks brage artb is present once again this is essentially a super funky highdamage special move you can only do when your health is low i cant count the number of times using it saved my noob behind from dying and i gotta say they are always a treat to watch bthis superbly animated sequence combined with the games insane visuals sparks joy each and every time i watch one play outb

and all the fighting is iextrai spiced up by the crazy amount of special effects on the screen each punch kick grab or flying leg kick thrown produces i cant explain why but i love the sight of them bit makes watching the punch land that much more ohsosatisfyingb the animations are also fantastic further adding to the amazing feel of the combat

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3147260998
the visuals are simply insane ibunreal engine 5bi shines and so do daddy kazuyas massive ipecsi everything from the arenas some with multiple rooms you can blast your opponent into to the character design is superb and extremely rich in detail just amazing stuff but theres one complaint from mebpaul lost his iconic hair and looks like a karenb why ibamcoi 

also if you enjoy character customization as much as i do a lot then the arcade quest mode will be your wet dream here all bets are off and well get free reign over how our fighters look will they look wacky yes creepy also yes lewd bhopefullyb giving players more customization options and freedom is always a plus in my book

lastly the overthetopness of the story seems to be intact

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3147260668
i cant wait to see what one of gamings most dysfunctional families the mishimas is up to likely a lot of halfnaked men fighting each other preferably near a cliff volcano or maybe a cliff overlooking a volcano we shall see

simply put bits all gonna be perfectb

and after having written 99 reviews my 100th review will be the first and last iimproperi one but itekken 8i deserved this sacrifice as it reignited my passion for gaming when no other game could

so thank you itekken 8i
thank you to all the developers who poured their hearts and souls into this game
lastly thanks to all of you top bananas for coming to my btekbtalk
i hope you all enjoy itekken 8i as much as i am

had the honor to try it on closed beta test cbt

tekken 8 improved on tekken 7 by improving the models loading times and matchmaking still not the best but it surely is better the input lag is probably the lowest ever of a fighting game so it makes pretty much instant the moment you press a button

and hey finally we have frame data for free not only that but soundtrack is a banger 100x times better than tekken 7 i always vibe to ortiz farm on my shower lmao

new characters such as jun reina azucena are really fun definitely will put a lot of hours into it

recommend this game as your entry to the series or to play with friends

#####

mk1 almost killed the fgc scene but tekken 8 came to save the day

#####

chesto

#####

if you win and your character is op it doesnt count if you win and my current character is not top tier i lost only because my character sucks if you throw me even though throws have been in this game forever the loss does not count if you dont play the game frame by frame the exact way i play tekken you are not playing real tekken if you do not have an honest character like kaz lee or raven in your character arsenal you are not a real tekken play and just use broken characters like king azu dj jun xiao drag feng get off the game yo are not allowed to have fun and use who you want to use you must play real tekken also if you get the highest rank with a character that is op it doesnt count and has nothing to do with the pilot at all  i would get the highest rank really easy with those and easy and fun for some  boring and not my real tekken but yea great game i love being apart of the great fgc epic

#####

good ass tekken

#####

mishima players out there wavedashing across the entire screen and hitting electrics but still cant talk to a woman

#####

removed remote play together silently last minute

#####

the game is amazing and incredibly enjoyable to play while my main characters were nina and hwoarang in the previous games i made the decision to switch to jin and he is undeniably cool especially with the wing effect in his design im playing on my trusty 6yearold laptop equipped with a gtx 1070 not only does it run smoothly at 60 fps on medium settings but the graphics also look absolutely awesome

the online experience is flawless i cant recall encountering any laggy games and there are a lot of offline modes for you to enjoy with ghost battle being a personal favorite

i absolutely recommend this game it promises an abundance of entertainment

#####

no one will read this review but jack8s screams make me feel ways ive never felt before

#####

mtx added sneakily after release in a 70 game with paid character dlcs and season passes
if they tried to do this to avoid negative reviews congrats they converted a no review to negative one and stopped my urge to buy content gg bandai namco

update 20240401 and now they add a battlepass this is going downhill no its not an april fools joke

#####

tekken 5 was my childhood and its was great 
but this  this is awesome  

#####

despite being an arguably good game tekken 8 fails as software on multiple fronts the netcode is questionable the performance and optimisation are very lacklustre in a lot of ways prone to crashing and causing frame drops and chugging on even high tier machines 

for context i have a 6750xt and sometimes the game stutters and even decides to randomly crash while stating i have run out of vram i have 12gb furthermore there is a specific stage where you have to make a small prayer whether it will crash to desktop or not during the whole match

additionally there is no anticheat behaviour in the game disconnecting to deny an opponents win cheating and probably soon we will have people using scripts to auto low parry and macros for difficult inputs if you plug someone there is no repercussion for these actions leading to a very unpleasant online experience even if youre just trying to casually run a few sets after a hard days work

but wait theres more the community has alerted the developers to all these issues on social media in online chatrooms and even with game clips as hard evidence what was their response

adding microtransactions to the game without fixing the previously stated problems and they added this one month after the game released without previous notice of such practices before the game launched thus being purposefully misleading to bolster the games review scores and fan reception

at the time of writing despite liking this game and playing it almost daily i cant recommend it to new and returning players alike it pains me but with the current climate this product fails at honesty performance and transparency stay away

tekken 8 is an aaa priced game with freetoplay games monetization

you wont be able to practice against paid dlc characters without buying the character

#####

you will gaslight yourself into thinking the game will be fun once you get good

any other fighting game with a launch like this would already be dead pretty much all the criticism directed towards mk1 rightfully applies to this too

broken servers sometimes they work well sometimes its unplayable some random players have terrible laggy connection even if you set the matchmaking settings to 5 bars only game launched without monetization to get good reviews for the customization but later introduced monetization the balance is absolutely terrible and pretty much everyone knows this besides this people are essentially telling newcomers who enjoy honest mid or bottom tier characters to become top 1 at the game to just enjoy it and perform as well as someone who has 50h on an easy top tier character or otherwise leave lets not forget about the zero penalization ragequitters get and that allows them to essentially trick the ranked ladder into never losing its only normal at this point this game has less players than sf6

besides its launch in my personal opinion the game is fundamentally flawed the difficulty is extremely artificial its not a skill based game its a knowledge based game and some would say this is fine but this just makes it so that you have to play for hundreds or thousands of hours to grind through the artificial difficulty gimmicky matchups scummy players arbitrary stuff like sidesteps and sidewalks and all of this is nontransferable nothing follows some kind of logic where you can extrapolate information so that way every game youre learning something about the game you only learn about your matchup learning here is just boring memorization it almost never has a visual indicator just memorize numbers of frame data some attacks look positive but theyre negative some look negative but theyre positive some highs in some strings cant be ducked some mids look like highs some lows look like mids etc just endless grind of information that becomes useless the second you get matched with a player that plays a different character so when you quit this game you have nothing to show for it in other fighting games the only thing you can learn is footsies but the neutral is so overloaded with the new mechanics that you wont even learn that much this creates this monopoly where most tekken players only know how to play tekken and since the learning process was so tedious they wont play any other fighting games cause they cant be bothered with learning them
and this aspect of the game depends so much on the character you pick up if youre lucky and you happen to like a character that is easy or top tier your experience will be so different to other players it will be almost like youre playing a different game you wont have to learn stuff like frame data frame traps 5050s proper sidestepping etc until later on the game creating a very easy and smooth skill curve and this is because the character has so many tools panic buttons knowledge checks or their attacks are so conservative yet rewarding that the player is never put in a risky situation meanwhile other players have to learn about tedious and overwhelming mechanics since the start because otherwise the game is unplayable and after all that grind they will still lose against players who are noticeable worse than them if you think this is just scrub cope theres countless examples of players whove played this franchise for years that lose 03 against some terrible player abusing a character
this system penalizes new or even ongoing players who really like the game by forcing them to grind twice as hard for the triple amount of time boring grind too its just like reading a spreadsheet and watching replays just to play on loop on training mode vs a specific character and it rewards players who dont really care about the game and just want some cheap wins cause they want the dopamine hit eventually both players quit the game the first example out of frustration and the second because they never even cared that much about the game to begin with the only ones who stay either really love the game and are willing to overlook the frustrating aspects which shows dedication props to them or they are wayy too invested into this to quit even when they arent really enjoying the game most of the time sunk cost fallacy

also as a last point this game breeds toxic behavior not only in game with ragequits or friend requests just to be salty any conversation about criticism is instantly shut down theres no back and forth if you dont say this is the best fighting game ever you need to get good or leave funny thing is most people who say this arent particularly good at the game themselves either

#####

tekken 8  sf 6

#####

tekken 8 is a real treat for any fan of the franchise with little nods and homages to its previous instalations and a true celebration of how good can fighting games still be not only it respects its audience its also an improvement over its predecessor in every single way and stands alongside 3 as the best game in the series 

not enough people praising how a game that looks this good is running this well as well i dont think ive seen many games look as stylish and as beautiful as this game does the movements and combos are meaty the sounds are punchy and give feedback a real technical marvel

i only wished there were more unlockables like the old school entries it would feel much better unlocking the characters as you finish stuff as it also would give you an incentive to play more on the down times and to give more meaning to complete other modes the online functionality is working perfectly had absolutely no problems playing against strangers and friends alike except for getting my butt kicked but thats a granted 

if youre still not convinced remember it still has kuma in it and if that doesnt convince you i dont know what will

#####

the quality of the game itself is great the visuals are great overall and the actual performance of the game is great on my pc its very entertaining and i enjoyed my time playing ranked even though im a washed up tekken 5 gamer theres probably unbalanced cheesy stuff but as an inexperienced player it literally doesnt matter there is a decent amount of singleplayer as well to ease in newer players which is great

however this game has a huge flaw and its the low level fatal error bug that causes a crash that has been extensively documented on the steam forums for whatever reason the game will experience a driverrelated crash if you use certain gpus for no real rhyme or reason at any given moment some maps appear to crash more than others and this can happen during inopportune moments that can cause your save data to become corrupted or cause you to disconnect from a ranked match this crash happens every time i play i have not once closed the game from the options menu relying instead on the inevitable crash to end my session with

like i said this happens to a wide variety of systems using various gpus amd and nvidia my system which has a 1080ti and is well above the recommended specs for the game can run the game on ultra with a constant 60 fps but will crash within 5 minutes on one specific stage and 30 minutes to 2 hours otherwise people with 4090s have also experienced this same crash so people saying its a hardware issue are downplaying the problem for some reason as it can happen on brand new top of the line hardware for comparison my friend has a 2060 which can hardly play the game at a constant 60 fps on low and he has never crashed meanwhile for me the game is actually unplayable

bandai has not even acknowledged that this error exists beyond a useless help article on their website that doesnt fix the issue theyve even replied to support tickets saying that you should hire a technician if youre affected by this problem what a joke this leads me to believe this error may never get fixed since its a relatively small number of players affected

if you have a 1000 series nvidia card do not buy this game im basically out 70 dollars so that i can have the word tekken 8 in my steam library

#####

longtime fans of tekken like myself have always valued the series for its rich and freely available customization options this tradition was a hallmark of the tekken experience offering players the freedom to personalize their fighters in numerous ways without extra costs until tekken 7 this approach was consistent and greatly appreciated

however with tekken 8 there was a noticeable shift the game launched with a surprisingly limited set of customization options leaving many of us wondering about the change the recent announcement from bandai namco about introducing microtransactions and an ingame currency for additional customization pieces has shed light on this issue it seems the initial limitations were by design aimed at moving towards a paytocustomize model

the essence of tekken for many of us wasnt just in the combat but also in the creative freedom it offered moving to a model where players are expected to pay for that creativity marks a departure from what made the series so beloved while the need for developers to explore new revenue streams is understood the way its been introduced in tekken 8 could have been handled better to maintain the franchises integrity and its relationship with the community tekken stood out in the gaming world for its commitment to value and player respect introducing these paid elements without clear communication beforehand feels misleading and undermines the trust and loyalty of the fanbase

after careful consideration ive decided to keep the game even though my first impulse was to request a refund despite feeling cheated i still find enjoyment in itbut i believe its important to inform others about these changes and let them decide for themselves

#####

whether the problem is the greed of namco or the dev team is not important ultimately the results are the same for the player

a 70 dollar game with free2play monetization 

the game launches with no microtransactions other than the character season pass then they wait until all reviews are out they wait until refunds are no longer a threat then they release the tekken shop 

they wait until the rage dies down from the tekken shop and now we have a battle pass how much is the battle pass tekken devs will tell you 6 its only 600 tekken coins after all however they only sell packs of 500 but at that point its cheaper to buy the 1050 so youll do that you buy the battle pass but oh no now you have 450 coins left just enough for a skin nice then you buy a skin and not only have you been tricked forced to buy two things but you also now have 50 coins left which will bother you for the rest of time

not only are they doing dishonest business practices but the game does not even function properly your enemies will disconnect on you constantly because they dont get a loss when they do when you do land a hit they spam the screenshot button to stutter the game until you drop your combo and the devs do nothing about it

speaking of online play the game director made fun of people on twitter when they were worried about the netcode of course it will have rollback lol i have not played a netcode this bad since i bought smash bros in 2018 delay based mixed with rollback even on wired slow motion matches long freezes and stuttering is not uncommon how is this possible in 2024 the director said in an interview he prefers visual fidelity over gameplay seriously id rather have a 2frame teleport which still happens btw than to struggle with slow motion gameplay and freezes they even allow players who run the game at 20fps to play online and guess what that means your game will also run at 20fps and you play in slow motion

we are quick to accept microtransactions in games these days but frankly they do not belong in a 70 dollar game even if you are willing to accept that are you okay with microtransactions in a 70 dollar game when theyve been dishonest about it when the game doesnt run properly 

i think we would all be singing a disappointed but much different tune if the game was in a good state when they made these updates but namco and the dev team does not have enough good will banked up to pull these moves they have shown nothing but greed and toxic behavior solving approx zero of the issues people are having with the game even 2 months after release

tekken 7  budget  this game

#####

mtx in 110 game

#####

longtime tekken fan 4000 hours of tekken 7 after knowingly releasing tekken 8 in a state thats hostile to online tournaments with memory leak issues that require frequent restarts with recommended specs were getting a patch this patch will fix the issue where ranked mode ragequitters penalize the other player and go unpunished themselves im just kidding the patch is actually to add predatory monetization this was never mentioned until the game was already rated and purchased you know i gotta leave a bad review for that have a good day constant reader

#####

its unreal that a game that is this good to play but the fact that every online match that ive attempted to play has resulted in a fatal scar error its 2024 and this is the why i cannot justify games being sold at 70 dollars when the game just refuses to work and crash on launch day

#####

h1 one of the best tekken games yet 100010 h1

#####

this was absolutely the last aaa game i will ever purchase in my life i paid for a product i paid upfront for season 1 dlc and months after release they have the audacity to divert our funds towards the development of products that are only obtainable through additional purchases ive been playing tekken since t2 it was one of my favorite game series it deserves to die

h1 bring back gon h1

#####

id like this review to be a bit more in depth than just battlepass bad for 70 game this point is extremely valid and i cannot comprehend the level of greed needed for this to be implemented but its more than that

the development team for tekken 8 listens to the community however they actively act against the community theyll see their twitters and subreddits spammed with people complaining about pluggers cheaters etc then a lead developer will tweet saying erm actually i have seen two pluggers its not that big of a deal

they have the exact same thought process in regards to balance throwback to one of the best quotes from a lead developer on tekken 7 saying why would you want to sidewalk when you could just block lol

the community has complained about dragonuv azucena and king ever since the game was released what happened they nerfed devil jin twice 
twice btw

they changed the properties of azucenas wr32 and ended up buffing the move you cannot whiff punish it

the recent patch as of 4824 broke wall tornados eddy has hitbox issues 

you cannot lab eddy paid dlc character without buying eddy you cannot replay takeover an eddy game unless you paid for eddy you cannot practice eddy offline 

hey new shirts and avatar models in the tekken shop for 5 each though 

namco is beyond stupid i wouldnt be surprised if they go bankrupt in a few years at this rate

#####

one line review tekken8 is amazing

slightly expanded review probably the biggest leap in quality since tekken23 8 refines the mechanics from t7 adds modern controls a la sf6 hugely improves the graphics and sound adds cross play and pvp rematches and makes the game much more accessible to boot it also adds a real money shop which well is not popular but is also entirely ignorable

the sound in particular is great  a blocked quick jab might sound a bit mid but most hits sound like a damn gunshot and add a heck of a lot to the atmosphere

the cast of characters is also diverse and fascinating from giant hugely hard hitting war robots to a hyperfast peruvean coffeesaleswoman who likes nothing more than doging your attacks to hit you from the back literal devils and demons a chavvy kind of boxer a hotheaded taekwando expert happy shopper bruce lee a giant championship wrestler who think hes a cat two kinds of bear knockoff magic blade a guntoting cyrofrozen irish assassin a french spymaster who thinks karambit knives are somehow acceptable in a fist fight a space alien octopus robin hood ninja thing an egyptian lady who has the literal god of war stuck in her hand somehow and a good two dozen more more will come with dlc ofc but there are plenty to choose from and lots to experiment with

the really great thing about tekken is that it has an almost abyssal level of depth with so many mechanics both new and old now this might seem like it would make the game hard to learn especially if youre new to the series but its also really intuitive you have four buttons left and right kicks and left and right punches thats it if you want to do a quick right left combo you press right punch then left punch easy

if you have good timing are patient and understand distancing even a little bit you really dont even need a tutorial its that welcoming

now all the above is really only about the pvp modes sp has always been a bit thin in tekken games but fwiw i think its probably at its best here theres the campaign which to its credit has tried to mix things up a bit character episodes which also focus on the nonmainstream characters a bit more arcade and arcade quest mode and also ghost battles i guess its alright tekken ball makes a return from 3 which is great but you cant play it online for no good reason i can think of e you can im just a big dummy see comments but the sp definitely takes a backseat to the pvp modes

theres also a bunch of nice touches like how you can play as tekken3 jin how the characters have rivalries and neat fight intros with their nemeses replays which have advice when you watch them kazuyas tits are finally splashed all over the main menu there is the customary tekken silliness weirdness and ott anime moves and also heihachi mishima possibly literally the most terrible person in the world and easily the worst parent ever has died and then reincarnated as his own illegitimate daughter who is if anything even more horrifying to fight against and she also has the devil gene that is basically the reason for everyone fighting in the first place because of course she does

if you want an example of how silly it can get heres panda winning the tournament and then failing to deal with a chair httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_dop9yuj_ow

i like it i think its great and im going to play some more right now but im still terrible at it

tekken 8 a fiery new chapter in the iconic franchise ฅωฅ

h1b2 game experience  bh1

tekken 8 isnt just about fierce battles it also introduces the arcade quest mode allowing players to create their avatars and embark on a personalized tekken journey this mode is a refreshing change of pace providing a more individualized experience in the tekken universe the games storyline continues the tragic saga of the mishima and kazama bloodlines picking up six months after the previous installment this continuation of the longestrunning video game storyline adds depth and context to the battles making them more than just random matchups for longtime fans of the series this narrative progression offers a satisfying dose of nostalgia mixed with new twists

however tekken 8 hasnt been without its share of criticism user reviews reflect a mix of admiration and frustration the games online playability a critical aspect for modern fighting games has faced scrutiny players have reported issues with server stability and online matches which are crucial elements for a game that relies heavily on its multiplayer experience additionally the trend of offering early access to content for more expensive versions of the game has been a point of contention this business model raises concerns about fairness and accessibility for all players while these issues dont detract from the games core appeal they are significant enough to warrant attention from the developers

h2b3 final thoughts  bh2

in conclusion tekken 8 is a bold step forward for the franchise offering stunning visuals an engaging story and innovative gameplay mechanics while it captivates with its highoctane battles and character customization the games online issues and business model practices have left some players feeling shortchanged despite these drawbacks tekken 8 remains a compelling addition to the fighting game genre promising hours of exhilarating entertainment for both new and veteran players

#####

i felt the same feeling i had when i first played tekken 5

#####

the best one

#####

finally a good battleanime game amazing

#####

when fist meets fatal error

#####

greedy ass devs more concerned with nickle and diming people that paid 70120 by adding a battle pass and tekken shop post launch with reused  low quality assets  dark pattern coin system than punishing cheaters or pluggers



#####

honestly really like this game but all the goddamn microtransactions and battle passes added quite sneakily in two months after release have soured my goodwill

nothing against the devs very much against the upper management that definitely pushed for this bs
oink oink you moneyhungry bamco executive fcking pigs

#####

why did you put dmc and ff into my tekken soup
swallowed it all and felt like a kid once again

#####

mcdonalds type game looks good tastes fine feel like shit after  all the mtx bs

#####

fix the fucking game ue polaris crash game is broken cannot recommend at its current state until they fix this shitty issue other than that its tekken

#####

crashing is fixed yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

#####

1 taking down mods
2 introducing mtx a month after release 
3 introducing a battle pass a month after they introduced a tekken shop
4 cant lab the dlc character 
5 cant nerf one character without nerfing the entire cast 
6 no anticheat
7 no built in solution for plugging
8 barebones customization compared to past games
9 forced 5050 casino simulator 
10 benchmark does nothing allowing people with potato pcs to play the game
11 no wifi filter

dont ask me for shit

#####

great game if you dont wanna play tekken

horrible game if you want to play tekken

netcode got worse somehow balancing decisions are pretty horrible at best i paid for deluxe edition thinking i was gonna invest another 5 years into this title as i have in tekken 7 but instead i only reluctantly boot it up once every 3 days for 30 minutes before getting annoyed at the loss of my favorite franchise

also what is with this f2p game monetization stuff i paid full money for this fuck you bamco 

#####

nina has dual beretta wow 

#####

the only other experience i have with tekken is tekken 4 from the ps2 era and that game had a much darker tone than tekken 8 i still enjoyed this a lot more than i thought i would though its actually finished unlike mk1 so thats a good plus

#####

its bad basically f tier

#####

deleting peoples channels off youtube just for showing off mods they like but didnt make all so they can shill their skins and fortnite battle pass on top of the characters gets a no from me still a fun game but dropping this review here for good measure no communication with or respect for their passionate longtime fans only thing theyll talk to us about is how the constant string of cheaters and pluggers arent the problem we all know it is and the solutions other games use to combat these issues make them uncomfortable bans people dodge in a couple hours are the solution to them i at the very least absolutely regret buying the deluxe edition id say play another fighting game but theyre all going down this path wait for a sale or something

edit  at least these other fighting games didnt wait months after release to announce this new scummy monetization after leaving a bare bones customization mode in the game to give people hope that theyd expand the paltry selection in future cashing in on the good reviews and getting players excited for eventual decent customization options just to pull the rug later after people already spent money the battle pass is cringe no matter who uses it but at least capcom was up front about it

#####

developing insomnia to make my brain remember every char bnb combos again

send help

#####

full price free to play model but after people bought it sneaky

mind you i do play other games with micros its the fomo of the battle pass that basically ruined it all

im sick of fomo if you want me to buy something put it in the fucking store permanently

#####

bandai namco is adding in game purchases after launch

#####

i love tekken loved tekken since i played 1  2 when i was a child

buttwo monetisation updates adding monetisation systems after release that werent known about
first a premium shop with obfuscating premium currencynow fomo battle passes

none of this was known when consumers made their economic decision to purchase the product beforewhen it came out
as a consumer i feel scammed betrayed and exploited if this was known beforehand i would not have purchased the game

it is a major red flag to release a game wait a month and then add monetisation system waiting out the reviews weathering the initial storm cashing in on release money and then when the good reviews have been established add monetisation features to drain wallets longterm

i regret buying tekken 8 this should be illegal

#####

fix fatal error please thank you

#####

i am sad about the mtxs and the lazy absolutely disgusting reused assets from tekken 7 filling their introductory battle pass these items were held back from launch on purpose just to be dumped in this battle pass if they are not from tekken 7 take a look at tekken tag 2 again reused assets

these scummy mtxs and battle pass were purposefully not discussed before launch and was added 2 months after launch to sidestep reviews and negative reports dont let namco ignore us or move on from this

this is not tekken

this is an example of creating a problem purposefully and selling the solution 

dlc characters if not purchased cannot be labbed against in 10 second dropin battle replays a  feature advertised and promoted before launch and in the basegame before mtxs and dlc  were announced or released why 


why is an unreal and blender ball asset you cant even defend this namco being an item on the battle pass this has got to be one of the scummiest and laziest battle passes i have ever seen in a game period and it was  70 on top of that namco should be ashamed to put it in perspective this ball can be added into ue by making 46 clicks

i know why

greed

very disappointed with the state of this game and the lack of truthfulness from this company 

0 doryas out of 10

#####

do not spend your money on this game and especially on any ingame cosmetics

bandai namco or harada and murray or all of them together decided to show the middle finger to their player base they didnt just introduce ingame cosmetics for real life money some of which are clearly unfinished hwoarangs shirt in the area near armpits for example they started striking youtube channel that feature videos of the game with cosmetic mods obviously as a way to coerce players to spend their money on skins

and all this petty charade is going on while they cant fix simple problems such as rqers not being penalized by having their points taken away not having an option for continuous rematches in casual battles and having tekken ball hidden somewhere in the depths of the game to name a few

if you really want to play this game get it for free if have to have the paid version of it then just stay away from those cosmetics amd dont buy dlcs that you dont absolutely need

#####

patched in a fomo battle pass with timelimited unlocks after the game had been purchased  fomo mechanics are predatory unethical and anticonsumer and should be boycotted without exception

#####

i love this game with all my heart and soul started in 7 and i fell in love with the game got 8 and fell in love even more this game is great dont get me wrong but the reason i put this review is because of eddy and any future dlc character that will come out now not hate on the character at all hes pretty cool but if i cant look back on my replays and see if i can counter certain hits against eddy because i dont have the dlc is pretty crazy and yes i made sure that i pressing the button to take control of my character and it still wont let me play as my character until they change this or there is a work around this review will stay because its crazy that i cant control my character because of a dlc i dont own

#####

tekken 7 but finished also bring john yakuza as a dlc 

#####

the devs intentionally hid their desire to monetize just about every system in the game and after a few weeks of being out are now revealing a premium currency shop which will effectively render ingame currency totally useless while charging players for even more than the prior tekken did 

the devs knew people wouldnt like it and they waited so they could sneak it past ratings boards so they could get the goodwill of the players before revealing their intentions 

all characters will of course continue to be monetized all character cosmetics will be monetized including costumes and various pieces of clothing all player avatar cosmetics will be monetized and no word on how egregious premium currency bundles will be so even if prices end up theoretically being low there still may be a high buyin cost having to buy more currency than you need

all of this in a 70 game  since you know increasing the price by 10 for just the basic version wasnt enough

the devs knew people would be upset and they wanted the glowing reviews and good pr as well as not having this practice put on their game by ratings boards they knowingly kept this from players and lied by omission to ensure that more people would get into this and to keep review scores high as well as ensuring that physical releases of the game would have no mention of their ingame spending by ratings boards

haradas a conman lol

still no rollback netcode btw it would be cool if their antics at least went toward making a better game but instead its just gonna end up in someones pockets

as far as gameplay goes this game is a lot of fun and from a gameplay feel is without a doubt the best tekken thats been made in a very long time 

the story feels like it needed way more time and budget its boss fights are its lowest points and i wouldnt recommend approaching it from anything even resembling a critical perspective xd 

customization is pretty good a big step up from tekken 7 but its all going to be monetized going forward so enjoy having everything that comes next locked behind a paywall lol

gameplay is fun games monetization is bad the devs just want to fleece you and take advantage of your passion 

i wouldnt recommend unless you want to enable the unethical exploitative practices a corpo pretending to be part of the fgc

updating to say i told you so

#####

you can play attractive women with bare feet

#####













#####

game is tight
packed with content
great presentation and soundtrack  jukebox with the whole series soundtrack to be used in game
amazing performance with lots of scalability options tsr is so good screw fsr
60fps on the steam deck you hear that netherrealm studios
nice roster bring back bruce and zombie heihachi or something lol
eddy is a dlc lmao

online is a mixed bag not even close to sf6 netcode for example
no heihachi 

#####

constant crashes ue5 fatal error unplayable based on personal experience though many others it seems have similar issues

#####

harada once said tekken would never individually sell characters in a fighting game because characters and their moves were like chess pieces

now harada and bamco are sneaking in their scrummy micro transactions after their game release so they can get good reviews and more sales 

if you are going to monetize your game as if it were a free to play title and still charge 77 dollars for the standard edition at lease have the balls to be up front about it

#####

incredible game that is now being run into the ground with greed and gamebreaking updates

#####

get ready for the next crash

edit get ready for the next match ps no more crashing

#####

i like this game so far i have been enjoying it a lot but ive got to say the fun aspect lasts until a technical issue pops out of nowhere at any given time

the game kept crashingfreezing whenever i would play arcade quest the game crashes in the middle of the match wasting my time and progress and i have to start all over again there are also huge frame drops and frame spikes in the opening intros of chracters for no reason

update the game hasnt crashed in while although there are still some frame spikes here and there especially during character intros so keep that in mind its a fun game overall i keep bouncing back and forth between street fighter 6 and tekken 8 both are my favorite

also this soundtrack is bomb httpsyoutubernquog15pgosijci0i_4eqdkrthwc

#####

im asking for a refund i know will be rejected but not touching it any more either way i have no problem with in game purchases on free games as part of their business model on full price games i dont like it but i can accept it if the game is feature complete and has enough content to justify its price

tekken was just that i would have gladly paid 70 for what i got even if it had a cash shop or even if they said it was coming later but to drop it after reviews so they can manipulate the perception is a bridge too far for me in this case i cant vote with my wallet because i was tricked

i hope others do the same and just stop playing this is a new low and if we keep playing into it itll just get worse i was even planning on buying all the extra characters in whatever pass or bundle they came out in because i wanted to support what i thought was a well done game

back to dbfz strive and sf6 for me respect yourselves and dont give them your business or online traffic if you agree with me if not enjoy what comes next cause it wont get better

#####

good game ruined by greedy developers

#####

added mtx store with items clearly pulled from launch cosmetics without telling anyone theyd do it 2 weeks in

#####

i cant believe they added a battle pass to a 70 game already riddled with microtransactions and a scummy premium currency model

#####

please fix the nvidia crashing issue and optimize the game is great but this kills it honestlyalso add shader compilation that would make the game run smoother for a lot of people sf6 had it from jump i can run that maxed out but not this game because of the heavy load if you optimize it i guarantee you your community will be satisfied

#####

my kazuya addict friend said if i post a review on tekken 8 and it gets 250 likes and 250 awards that he will buy me a keg of fireball whiskey and a bottle of vodka cranberry so im just gonna leave this here help a brother out

#####

ive been a tekken fan for a while played a lot of t7 over 4k hours and enjoyed earlier tekken games as a kid
there are many things to like about this game very good looking graphics with a lot of attention to details awesome soundtrack from every tekken game brilliant character roster which has something for everyone

however there are more things that will ruin your experience rather than give you a fun time 
new meta around agression is forcing a lot of guess or die situations which is not fun at all tekken was known for its complex defence system which offered you multiple options to play around your opponents offence now its very limited because youre often forced into situations where you can either block low or block mid basically 5050 guess with risk reward favoring the attacker
heat system overall is very interesting but developers dont care much about balancing it out each balancebug fix patch is making the game even worse somehow by removing whole systems breaking old ones and adding new exceptions to the established rules even going as far as making the already borderline broken characters stronger ie giving king the ability to cancel jaguar sprint into block nerfing azucenas runing 32 etc 

aside from horrible balance decisions a lot of people have problems just running the game and it wasnt addressed in any way by the developers one tweet about adding some prefix in executable was all there ever been from devs about that problem

i also dont understand why they cant implement already working solutions for pluggers mk did it in a nice way by adding quitality tekken still doing nothing about it showing the discconection rate which could be reset with your save data in t7 when it could just straight up giving you points if your opponent quits ranked system itself is a mess just as much as the rest of the game is community had to figure out on its own how the new system works with extra points for win streaks and lose streaks its also just laughable that its more profitable to get demoted rather than defending your rank
also its a huge waste of time when youre always being matched with 1 or 2 rank below yours no matter what setting you are using youre forced to play for 250300 points and when you meet someone the same rank then you better not lose because all those 56 wins can be discarded with one loss since it takes away more points against the same rank

instead of focusing on balancing the game properly fixing bugs which are very frequent in this installment of tekken and adjusting bad systems we see that most of the resources go into creating disasterous microtransactions and payed content in a game that already costs 70 euros they added a completely predatory system where you have to buy specific currency for unlocking content average costume is 400 coins but you cant buy this amount you can only buy more  they also added tekken fightpass which is basically reused assets from tekken 7 bunch of useless stuff and a default ball from unreal engine this is just so pathetic 

on top of that we have the same dlc situation as it was in tekken 7  pay to play i wouldnt mind supporting the devs and getting new interesting content however the history just repeats itself and becomes even worse somehow
if you dont own the dlc then youre not allowed to use new tekken replay feature where you take control of youropponents character to see what you can do in situations from the match 
youre also not allowed to take dlc character in practice mode to lab what to do against him which was the same in t7 so basically theyre forcing you to buy the character even if you wont play it just because you want to know what to do against it and yeah this is 70 euro game 

in current state of things i wouldnt recommend buying this game at a full price better get it on discounts if there ever will be any for 70 euros its just a spit in the face from bandai namco i really hope they will make the game better but only time will tell

#####

good fighting game but the devs got scummy and hid the fact they were adding a mtx costume store till after release in a game that had always allowed you to customize your fighters for free

#####

instead of fixing connection errors that occur in some countries and balancing patches they are focusing on banning tekken mod videos on youtubeit was free advertising for your game but you are not smart enough to understand it and you think its gonna hurt tekken shop lol 
what is next banning players who use costume mods

#####

i paid a hundred bucks for this and you add an item shop and battle pass two months after launch

#####

game crashes constantly 2 betas and a demo that worked perfectly and now the game is broken how is that even possible

#####

balance patch whats that did you mean battle pass
its actually very funny because base customization is very weak even compared to tekken 7 but battle pass adds an unreal engine sphere as an accessory
what a joke

#####

amazing game extremely fun to play i cant speak about balancing as i am new to learning fighting games i cannot recommend this game though because of the despicable mtx practices they have decided to implement after reviews were in i believe buying costumes is an ok way to try to have fans continue to support the developers as long as base game customization is great except when you cannot buy them directly and instead need to buy a premium ingame currency as it can and does lead to overpayingoverspending and now they have decided to introduce a battlepass which i believe is completely unnecessary and another way to try to squeeze money out of players through fomo overall this game is crazy fun and if you can ignore the mtx then please go ahead and buy it if thats what you want to do but if youre on the fence and unsure whether youd like it even after trying the demo i would suggest not buying it to not support these greedy and anticonsumer practices

#####

its tekken if u dont like tekken then u wont like the game

#####

if youre a casual player who wants to play the single player and maybe a bit of online button mashing then i definitely recommend this game its very clearly built with you in mind unfortunately the development team either dont understand or actively dislike what makes tekken interesting at a high level theyve taken a game which is interesting due to its wide variety of options and made it focused on simple 5050 mixups as much as possible even turning previously interesting defensive characters into generic mixup characters like everyone else theres a lot of great character design but its impossible to appreciate it when i feel like every character i pick up plays in such a similar way ive been obsessed with playing competetive tekken for 5 years now but i think its time to go and find another obsession unless the developers kind are willing to effectively do a 180 on the direction of the game

#####

the game is 70 for its base edition there will be characters dlc that you have to buy theres a 10 and 20 battle pass and on top of that you can buy old tekken costumes for real money but they couldnt even add an option to change the main menu background from eddy to kazuya honestly dissapointed in this game

can credit the devs for the amazing rework they done to tekken and they seem quite reactive to feedback gameplaywise but everything else feels terrible because of a blatant over monetization

also why the hell can you only do bo3 at most in ranked matches how is anyone happy about this tekken8 instant rematch is so good but you cant even use it bunch of reasons that makes this game feel terrible to just boot up even though its core gameplay feels amazing im just sad tbh

#####

this is a great game but without official acknowledgment of the crash issue dxgi_error_device_hung i cannot recommend it i have spent hours researching and trying fixes the crash was happening only on one stage but is now happening in any stage including training mode when nothing is happening it is very random when it happens i can sometimes play for hours without issue and then crash several times in short succession

it is a ue5 driver or combination of both problem

my specs

ryzen 7 7700x

#####

bandai just invented the best fighting game

#####

i cannot in good conscience recommend a competitive game with such glaring issues in its ranked system starting from blue ranks people will constantly plug you you will run into smurfs who arent a big deal they are better than me it is what it is but you will also run into cheaters and pluggers until the devs do something to curb the ragequit issue this game is not one i can easily recommend wait a few months to buy or buy on a high discount the game itself is great though

edit 
02042024 patch 103
i wish to amend this review and take pretty much all the good stuff i said back long story short dont buy this game even if it is 99 off bamco does not deserve to make a dime off this dumpsterfire they have time and time again shown bad faith ever since the release of the game they have been attacking the livelihoods of well known content  creators by striking their youtube channels not copyright claiming striking one youtubers channel is getting terminated this month apparently their cashgrabby practices are ridiculous they first hid the tekken store from the playerbase on release they then attacked the community and content creators for making mods that competed with their horrid store they released eddy gordo and not only have they not allowed the players to look at his kit on practice tool so they can lab eddy they made it so you cannot look at any replays that have eddy in it unless you own the character they have been constantly refusing to fix the issues plaguing the ranked mode and since the latest patch patch 103 there have been multiple game breaking new bugs a reminder that this is supposed to be the patch that evo is played on the devs have time and time again shown they do not care about the game or the community i would recommend playing other fighting games like brawlhalla street fighter 6 or guilty gear strive this game has been beyond disappointing i consider this an insult bandai namco does not deserve your money and they wont ever be getting any of mine all of this being said i feel like clarifying if you dont care and just want to play the game there is no shame in that im mad at bamco not tekken players

edit 06042024 
ball

#####

game was good but they snuck in microtransactions with an update super scummy practice do not support this scumbag behavior

#####

scumbag move namco this predatory battle pass added postlaunch is utterly disgraceful it wouldnt be that bad if i didnt have to endure eddys face slammed in my face every time i open the game reminding me i can pay for him im literally witnessing one of my favorite games of all time die in realtime fu harada you are a poser
strike h1 tekken 8 a masterpiece of pugilistic excellence h1

bgreetings combatantsb

starscream here taking a brief respite from the chaos of war to share my thoughts on the latest installment of the tekken saga tekken 8 in one word this game is iamazingi

hrhr

bprosb

 the roster is like an army of decepticons each fighter unique and formidable

the fighting mechanics are smoother than a welloiled cybertronian joint
the visuals are as stunning as witnessing the awakening of trypticon
a plethora of moves and combos like the tactical brilliance of a seeker squadron in battle

bconsb

there are none for this game is a flawless victory unlike any conquest megatron ever dreamed of achieving

hrhr

in summary tekken 8 is a pugilistic masterpiece a symphony of strikes and counters that rivals the might of devastator its so good that it deserves not just a chefs kiss but a starscream salute id give it a starscreamapproved rating of b1010b because perfection deserves nothing less strike

#####

posting reviews will not save us from corporate greed but the new patch just broke the game and hopefully review bombing will at least alleviate some of the pain

this is one of the best fighting games of the generation and it is now showing its true colors of being a monetization riddled fiesta battle passes uneven currency practices to make you dump more money but the real reason i am writing a negative review

if you play against a dlc character you do not own you cannot use the replay takeover feature to learn the matchup even on your own character if you want to learn how the dlc characters work who will all be top tier if were learning anything from eddy you must buy them there is no other choice please bamco dont ruin the only good fighting game to come out in the last 3 years walk this one back

please nobody buy dlc or battle passes in this game do not feed this behavior

#####

yet another beloved franchise ruined by greed and mtx congrats bandai namco you made a shitty game like mk1 look better

#####

   

#####



im a longtime tekken fan and this was an incredible entry into the series the lorestory mode is the best theyve ever made with most of the beloved characters included and some nostalgic easter eggs from previous games whilst managing to incorporate some fresh faces the power of friendship narrative sounds corny but was written in such a way that was really enjoyable my only criticism is that the tournament preliminaries felt a little rushed i also really like where the reina storyline is going however im a little disappointed that spoilerthey recycled the idea of heihachi having another illegitimate child i think it would have been cooler if she was a product of a science experiment or somethingspoiler 

i think its very welcoming for beginners and has indepth training tools for new challengers and returning players bandai namco kept the blueprint of movement blocking punishing spacing etc but introduced 2 new significant mechanics heat system and health recovery this makes gameplay a lot more aggressive rather than defensive 

personally i dont have a problem with the devs introducing microtransactions its 3 for legacy cosmetics which i think is very fairly priced and theres still lots of free cosmetics to be unlocked through playing arcade mode arcade quest is a super fun single player option that helps you learn along the way sort of like a tutorial for what to expect when you play online

the ost is just as good as it ever was leaning into the usual trance and edm jukebox allows you to customise and replace the music as you want and access classic soundtracks from the past 

overall i think they really honoured the franchise by acknowledging the past and looking to the future

#####

excellent marvellous perfect

#####

bandai namcos priority is monetizing the game with reused assets rather than fixing the issues so i cannot recommend it in its current state

#####

remember when harada said if i was given the choice to include paid dlc or quit namco i would maybe quit or maybe i would just say get someone else to deal with this 

well why in the hell hasnt he resigned yet

this is well past tekken 7 doing the exact thing he criticized years prior then they amped it up even further with 8 patching in the shop battle pass and paid currency 2 months after release is conniving as all hell i wouldve expected this tactic from activision one of the greediest gaming companies in na instead of bamco of all companies i understand they want to keep a steady flow of revenue to support the game but the content they bring to justify it is of little value compared to other service titles call of duty of all games gives maps guns modes etc for free because of the pass and shop what does tekken 8 do they let you buy the characters buy the pass so you can grind nonstop until support ends on a loop and buy cosmetics in the store literally just spend money to spend more money there is 0 justification to the consumer side of this because everything still releases at a snails pace on top of costing 70 and then making you buy the characters on top of that if they gave the characters away then people could easily swallow the additional revenue sources and harada wouldnt be a flipflopping fraud on a technicality however whales in tekken 8 do not benefit you whatsoever like other service titles you cant even use the dlc characters to train against if you havent paid 

this is compounded with the software issues like the devs having 0 understanding of how to deal with rage quitters due to never bothering changing how they handled it over the years the vtriggugh heat system in general removing an entire mechanic to nerf one character instead of nerfing the character and adding more new bugs 

now if you want to know the reason they did this it has to do with the fact namco shoveled money into a big mmo project called blue protocol that released last year in jp that has massively bombed in every shape and form since release they also cancelled 5 other projects possibly due to this as well and now they are going full scorched earth on their major titles to recoup the amount they spent at the expense of the playerbase this is why you are paying to keep paying in tekken 8 why naruto storm connections is so low effort and overpriced my hero academia ultra rumble existing in general as a service title with assets ripped from ones justice and dbz the breakers also acting as a low effort service title you will most likely see this type of tactic being employed in other upcoming titles like dragon ball sparking zero and any popular series that can sell itself on brand i cant see this being done with any of fromsofts titles thankfully but thats only because fromsoft owns the er ip and you just know theyd love to make it into a low effort br service title if they could 

harada once wore a shirt that said dont ask me for sht 
well dont ask me for money

#####

microtransactions servers are broken plugging is still prevalent fortnite type beat battle pass system mash friendly more rewarding if youre aggressive and a lot more wrong with this game but i still enjoy it personally wouldnt give it a thumbs up though

#####

update 2 namco has final taken the very first step in dealing with pluggers not just pretending to ban people but actually implementing a disconnect  because the disconnect rate can no longer be reset client side like in tekken 7 we can now officially say that tekken 8 is better than the previous game at addressing the issue that being said plugging still does not result in a win and people still do it all the time they can plug play a few games and the  goes back down while this has curbed the problem it has not fixed it and so my review remains

update 1 the namcops have banned a few of the most egregious pluggers but still no global action has been taken to prevent people from doing it it still works you can still use it to protect your rank and the competitive integrity of the game is still shattered seems they dont want to fix it 

i grew up in arcades and tekken 8 is the best fighting game i have ever played it is everything i wanted and more it is feature rich addicting deep has amazing training tools excellent tools to bring in new comers everything 

and all of it is flushed immediately down the toilet because the developers refuse to address a nearly 10 year old problem plugging there is 0 penalty for rage quitting in ranked in fact you can break your opponents win streak just by closing the game the message from the developers is loud and clear you should cheat all you will lose is your dignity and people who plug obviously dont have any to begin with 

i just cannot recommend this game until this shit is addressed tekken 7 at least they told you how often your opponent disconnected this could be reset but it required some effort but there was still no penalty so people did it constantly it is even more rampant in 8 it isnt just a few people doing this i get plugged on every third match when i watch streams i always see a plug its pathetic 

i am not a developer or programmer but games with way way smaller budgets have implemented systems where dc  lose if you dont have a stable internet connection this game is not going to be enjoyable for you anyway there is just no excuse for this bullshit after so long 

fix your game harada

#####

the game is great it being so expensive and having a customization shop battle pass and microtransactions isnt

they lied by omission they didnt add the tekken shop or warn players about all these features until later they hid those features from the playerbase and the reviewers

go fuck yourself bamco go fuck yourself harada

#####

add the store in late to not take any salesreview hits  so fcking scummy

#####

h1dont buy ith1
this is a 70 game that is riddled with gameplay bugs daily disconnects cheatingintentionally disconnecting to avoid losses microtransactions and predatory monetization
bthey added an ingame store and battle passes shortly after release without saying anything about it beforehandb

the game has dlc characters that you cant use in practice mode without owning them meaning you cant try them out or experiment with them to learn how to fight against them
the game has an ingame store with paid currency that they manipulate to make people buy more of it than they have to
the game also has the classic fomo battle pass system one free and the other paid both give you cosmetics some are even outright ported over from tekken 7 items that were free in that game
this is on top of the base game having lackluster customization probably because they want the base game to have as little free 70 game customization as they can get away so they can sell them to you later
theyve also started going after people showcasing cosmetic mods online

all of this while the game has a big problem with people disconnecting before they lose which nullifies the whole match performance and netcode problems where the game is pretty much guaranteed to disconnect you to the main menu at least once per day and buggy gameplay behavior that takes far too long to address just to name a few
the game doesnt even have working disconnection rates in the games ui before you accept or decline a match

the game has potential but the clear focus on predatory and sneaky monetization over problems with the actual game make me not recommend it to anyone

#####

the gameplay itself is still tekken if you have friends to play this game with its a blast
a shame everything else fucking blows ass 
i will not talk about the balance because fighting game balance has always been and will always be a complete shitshow that being said
ill start with the ranked online play which is what most people are here for anyway it fucking sucks 
1 there is absolutely no penalty whatsoever for plugging or disconnecting if youre a normie so make sure youre not too good at the game or else youll have your time wasted
2 no benchmarking or standards enforced in terms of both connection and framerate no the connection preview doesnt do shit so have fun fighting your promotion match against a guy running this game on a smartphone at 10fps
3 genuinely stupid ranked point system which actively punishes you for playing the game you get a point malus for losing to someone of a higher rank and a point bonus for losing to someone of a lower rank
if youre new get used to fighting people with at least a few hundred hours over you while also deciphering all this games bullshit matchups
overall a good ranked match is pretty fucking rare not even sure why i bother to be honest
but i dont care about ranked well fuck you theres other problems
1 all the problems i listed about ranked play also apply to online casual or nonranked play this community is that petty
2 weakest customization in any tekken game by miles it is still tekken and thus the best in the business but thats an extremely low standard to surpass and the future is looking grim
2a to give you an example outfits are single piece this means that you cannot match say the top of outfit a and the shoes of outfit b this massively fucks over customization for certain characters yoshimitsu in particular is just depressing for no valid reason well no valid satisfying reason that is
2b outfits are sold for 4 a pop in the new epic tekken online store tm while the free customization is in freetoplay levels of shambles thanks
3 fucking fortnite battle pass coming tomorrow as of this reviews writing which nobody asked for makes no sense whatsoever in this game and will no doubt lead to a situation where you will be expected to fork over extra cash for actual variety in your customization
while i still do consider this a good game i expect disaster in the future and i have little hope i will be proven wrong
at least we have jukebox back

edit 02042023
you have to drop at least 10 euros for a premium battlepass with less than a dozen character customization items two of which are fucking eye colours what a joke

#####

the game is great but adding an mtx shop after you gathered up all the positive reviews purposely making customisation lacking and garbage in a 60 game which has a 90 ultimate edition btw is just a scummy tactic and scamco can go f u c k itself with this cringe monetisation not to mention this is the priority over countless cheaters and pluggers in a 2024 game with no anticheat

#####

i want reina to step on me

#####

i hate you murray

#####

greatest fighting game of this generation along with sf6

#####

good game that got all the cheers and praises it deserved for being the overall improvement over the previous one now ruined with some the worst kind of monetization practices we see in f2p games that were sneaked in months after everyone was done praising it and all the good reviews were in and all of this on top of being charged premium to even have access to it in the first place shameful absolutely shameful behavior

#####

update 70 full game quote with no ingame purchases and 2 months later already asking for over 90 more to access the actual full content

original
the game was intentionally falsely advertised and added product placement for real world brands and predatory microtransactions after the player base had lost their chance for a refund
this game was originally advertised with esrb rating without ingame purchases label check any of the advertisement trailers on bandainamcoamerica youtube channel the label was quietly added to the store page 2 weeks after release based on internet archive and was disclosed publicly almost 4 weeks after launch
the developers purposefully omitted this information to gain positive reviews and sell as many copies as possible before implementing the negatively perceived features they intentionally reduced the customers ability to vote with their wallets which is a core concept of free market
steam apparently doesnt care about false advertisement or protecting their customers against it so ill just leave this negative review here to help people make informed decisions on what kind of company theyre supporting

#####

god tier ost as always

#####

i was already displeased with a lot of the system mechanics that came with t8 i know a lot of people like them but to me it feels like theyre forcing this aggressive gameplay by rewarding button pressing a lot im of the idea that holding back and trying to block the opponents attacks is already putting yourself in a less favorable situation since you need to guess what the opponent is gonna do next so chip damage can fork right off in my opinion

oh and they seem to have a knack for introducing more ways to pay for content in this fully priced game that comes in at the 70 eurodollar price point copy pasting items from previous games and making us pay for it is interesting

not a fan

#####

battlepass for 70 game with dlc

im literally a clown for buying this product

#####

in the games current state i cant recommend it adding microtransactions to assets that were free in the previous game and the development team just lifted and shifted them from ue4 to ue5 is ridiculous and disrespectful the dev team did so little effort on the cosmetics that are in the battlepass and yet are expecting to rake millions off practically no dev time on the products youre supposed to earn in it 

not only that but prioritizing a microtransactions patch in a full priced game over balancing the game shows that this game is going to take a while until matchups feel decently fair across the board

namco battle passes were made to support freetoplay games that dont get a large amount of players in the first months of release you guys are selling a 70 game and treating it like a free to play game we already have to purchase season passes to access all of the new characters in the game which part of those funds go to support the ongoing development and maintenance of the game do better and stop treating your customers like cows ready to be milked great way to tarnish an ip


#####

this is the current state of games and its very disappointing so many active problems with the gameplay a broken patch where some mechanics dont even work anymorebut you know what does work the battlepass

let me break it all down for you 

 this video game costs 70 for the basic version

 there is the deluxe version which offers almost nothing of value for 20 more 

 there is the ultimate version which offers a bunch of pointless things one known character and the promise of 3 more but you dont get to know those yet   for 50 more this also means more character passes for a similar price will likely continue to come out

 the greedy micro transaction coin system is like any other the items you want to buy are just shy of the amount you can pay for so you buy a higher tier to buy it and have some coins left over these range from 599 to a whopping 4999 getting close to the price of the base game

 the battlepass costs about 6 bucks or 600 coins remember you cant just buy the 599 one so you must spend 999 or if you want the super duper special version itll cost you 20 the only things you get from this are customization items that really shouldnt be locked behind a pay wall and should have been in the game to begin with what is even the point of the tekken gold you get from playing the game anymore

i am seriously disappointed in the devs for stooping this low they started off great with the initial release the game is fun the heat system is cool it looks good customization is missing a bit but its still really goodthen they do this it hurts my heart that the word battlepass and tekken are now associated but hey if fortnite made it work they can too right

most tekken fans had accepted that their beloved characters would be used as dlc theyd have to keep paying for in tekken 7 the character passes being the only thing youd need to spend on was more acceptable than this garbage 

you have really outdone yourselves devs way to ruin something good you had going 



#####

104 aud
season pass characters
in game shop
battle pass

whats next loot boxes
customisation is purposely bare bones in order for them to sell 
in game money is useless
cant even implement plug  loss 
terrible localisation

scummy practice if i had known i wouldnt have purchased

#####

great game with awesome character roster

#####

releases a predatory store and then goes after tekken modders instead of fixing horrible balance issues and the ongoing cheaterplugger problem no real communication as well with staff insulting players over these comments instead of addressing the issues until these things are fixed i cannot recommend this game

#####

people say that tekkens release was always unbalanced and full of errors  so they should learn from their mistakes but im assessing not the alpha or beta but the final product after 2 months from the premiere
the game generally has good and cool ideas but the ease with which you can losewin is absurd implementation of the heat smash mechanics ok but who thought that low smash was a good idea or who thought that a blocked smash turning into a 5050 situation was a good idea when we are already at such a huge disadvantage
also smash from the other end of the screen where even if you ss on the first hit the second one still tracks
grabs  the fact that the dmg from grabs is too high is a subjective matter i understand that ch grabs are unbreakable but i do not agree to unbreakable grabs without ch but grabs with homing status rly
the rest of the bs is a matter of balance or changing statuses but imo the dmg that can be done only by using heat is absurd especially since its use requires only one button zero skill and its 100 safe
a secondary issue is the monetization of this game  i understand that namco wants to make money on the game and they deserve it but the way of monetizing a game that costs quite a lot is another absurdity and shows that this priority is absolute number 1 in this company regardless of game status  shop with shitty items premium battle pass where for spending money you will get an item in the form of a gray ball that will fly around your head rly the basic aset of every graphics program gray ball xd
early access of dlc characters  when i thought that it was impossible to go lower in the monetization of fighting games then the harada murray duo proudly announced that the dlc character would have a 3day early access  then i decided that i would not buy this dlc at full price but only when it was available in package after a big promotion despite shitty practices and they created a new eddy  a character that requires absolutely no skill i understand that they wanted to make the character easy but for gods sake a combo that takes more than 60 dmg is df 333333333333333333333333
and the last issue is dealing with cheaters  the problem of plugs rq has been known for almost a decade and namco behaves as if they were dealing with the disarmament of an atomic bomb they seem to want to but they dont want to punish them they are supposed to punish but these penalties are milder than the reward for gods sake whats the problem with introducing a mechanic that takes away points from the person doing rqplug and gives points to the other person what kind of problem is it to add to this that the time penalties for cheaters are first 1 hour then 23 hours and then 23 days i came up with it while using the toilet in the morning and a group of people there havent been able to come up with it for 2 months
to sum up  if it werent for this whole atmosphere the game is good but it requires more balance and as soon as possible but the fact that the priority is money for shitty content and neglecting cheaters is a negative assessment
ok but lets not say that the game is crap because it is not true and for an average person it may even seem excellent but if someone understands what the game is about knows how frames work etc they will know that the game requires balance
the replay system is brilliant  in addition to the standard hints we can also take control of a given character at any time to practice a specific combat situation
the option to watch each players replay is great
the ghost system is a good idea but it still requires some work because even though the ghosts reflect some of our behavior they are still bots and we feel that there is a lack of logical decisionmaking but as beginner content its great also when u learn new character you can practice with ghosts
tutorial  finally done at a decent level you can understand what each mechanic is about
minor comments include  tekken ball  but who cares
arcades lobby  but who cares
tournament system still missing
minor crashes
errors in displaying some animations eg ravens clones may disappear
overall its still a good tekken with huge potential its just a matter of whether it wont be wasted

if game will change for good i will change my review too bo so far its negative 

#####

the biggest jump in a tekken title since t3 likely the best fighting game of this generation aside from the ridiculous visual enhancement the amount of both offlineonline content is staggering

even as a casual experience this is so worth your money

#####

this game was great at release and it still is but the microtransactions battle pass and poor balancingsystem changes in the past month or so have soured my opinion on the gamepublishers 
questionable balancing decisions is my main concern and lack of punishment for pluggers

#####

 full priced game with season pass
 bare minimum customization options
 cut legacy content to sell it as mtx
 add microtransactions a month after release to first farm positive reviews and avoid backlash
 take down community modded content on social media to make sure people buy your paid  bs skins

what do you expect from the company who sold frame data as dlc and made every 2nd dlc character they released as broken as possible ala pay 2 win to promote sales

battlepass now on top with tekken 7 items that were free they really cant help themselves but go full on greed

you cant take over your character in replays vs eddy dlc p2w

#####

bｈａｄｏｋｅｎ b

#####

this is gonna be a big banger

#####

might be the best tekken game since tekken 5

#####

implementing an awful cash shop while ignoring some of the most basic issues other games have solved ages ago like dealing with disconnecters extra scummy for adding it a month after launch too so it doesnt impact sales or reviews

edit and now they added a paid battle pass which consists of tekken 7 stuff which used to be free and generic ue5 spheres absolute trainwreck

#####

ill be blunt if you can look past the companys behavior postrelease then tekken 8 is a great game and definitely worth a purchase it looks great it runs well it plays well good fun easy to get into customization is weak but up until a few weeks after release that was the only complaint i had

a few weeks after release they added the tekken shop which is a microtransaction cosmetics store i now know where to place the blame for the weak customization to take classic outfits and even frequently recurring costumes from previous games and put it behind a classic microsoft pointsesque premium store is scummy

now they also announced the tekken pass the games own battle pass which will get you items and potentially tekken coins for the tekken shop

this is a rather premium priced game as im sure you can see so to go and try to include every bit of f2p monetization scheme is just disgusting and disrespectful i genuinely would be willing to buy all this if they just instead released a single pack of customization dlc at a reasonable price or even a specific season pass for it again at a reasonable price

ultimately i cant recommend this game in good conscience its a great game that feels scummier and scummier postrelease and this should not be acceptable at a 70100110 pricetag this is just not acceptable

#####

adderall required

#####

announced battle pass and tekken shop month after launch  full of old t7 assets and costumes

#####

get ready for the next duolingo lesson

#####

dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

#####

its perfect all i ever wanted as someone who had to sit through tekken 7 loading screens

#####

never mentioned adding mtx into the game
customization mode is conveniently lacking
mtx added after the glowing reviews are out and many have bought the game 
game has a plethora of paid dlc on the way
netcode is still subpar and plugging is still not punished

bandai namco is more worried about money than the quality of the game

#####

okay so basically i just 3 12

#####

great game happy to change to positive review as soon as a bamco will find a way to sort out issue with pluggers its been a plague in t7 and nothing is done with it in t8

for those unaware  if in ranked game a losing party disconnects altf4 kill internet whatever they lose no points the winning player gains no points its as if the match never happened

there is no place for tolerating this behaviour in 2024

go fix that st harada then we wont ask you for it

#####

ive played tekken since t2 and i always felt that the fights were always a 5050 split of aggression and defence tekken 8 has shoehorned in new systems and changed the balance to openly favour aggression 

the heat system incentives and rewards highpressure and all outaggression play and actively punishes and disincentives defensive styles 

i feel that there is fundamentally something wrong with the core of tekken 8 which i dont feel can be fixed without a significant overhaul

the overall presentation and content of tekken 8 is great sound visuals single player content training mode wanted to mention the ghost and replays here specifically as being next level good are absolutely fantastic

#####

amazing game however i will not change my rating to positive until they stop their scummy microtransaction practices

edit since i wrote this review a few months ago things have only gotten worse the new patch seems to have introduced a slew of unintended behaviors the dlc character eddy cannot be trained against in practice mode unless you buy him more microtransactions have been introduced along with inane battle passes modders are being cracked down on whilst cheaters are allowed to prosper and much more

i stand by what i said the base game is really really good but everything sorrounding it is not

#####

yay a patch we have a new garbage battle pass some lazy balancing and still dont have infinite rematching in quick play it is such a pita to play this game if you like playing longer sets you can kind of do it in the fight lounge or player matches but both waste a ton of time the fight lounge is awful it takes forever to get into a match compared to quick play and thats if youre lucky you can sit at a 1v1 cabinet for a many minutes without anyone ever joining or have to spend a few minutes trying to find a server where someone is waiting

h3 what i would like to see h3
anna noctis elize
more outfits like more customization in general

#####

yep

#####

one of the most successful launches to a tekken
game is incredibly fun
only cons are a lack of customisation options and few balancing issues
time passes by not many fixes
instead of nerfing specific characters whole systems get removed
tekken shop is introduced to a fairly negative reception
game is still super fun
another update that removes a system instead of balancing characters
patch breaks the game and needs another patch
tekken battle pass is introduced with items that were already available in tekken 7 for free

game is still really fun to play casually but bandai namco have ruined almost all the potential this game had by treating the playerbase like a joke 41k rupees70 usd  character pass  battle pass for recycled stuff we had for free before what a shame

#####

tekken is so unbelievably back

#####

as a long time tekken player this is a slap in the face disaster
to attract casual new comers the super flashy spammy characters completely destroy lots of traditional tekken mechanism
many matches become rushing button mashing hit or miss luck fights
making many items real money purchase and banning punishing mods users are very disloyal of namco
the graphic only got slightly better over tekken 678 still staying in 60 fps rigid animations so laggy
eye hurting effects as a blue ranker i still find this game bs
hopefully they change their path with major patches in the future

#####

a full priced game with freetoplay game monetization
introduced two months after release to avoid bad pr 


#####

game direction seems trash right now
no variety in the gameplay just go rushdown all the ways 
too many 5050 situations

and last patch broke the game yay

#####

im from iran and this game online mod not working in my region i buy ultimate edition cus i love this game so much but no online if you are from my country dont buy and go for refund no points in this game

#####

a very fun and easy entry to the series
the only thing thats hard is me

#####

terrible necode from tekken 7
million exploits available such as spamming screenshot to drop frames making other player drop inputs when comboing you
known cheaters of 6 years still on leaderboard
literally no punishment for quitting mid match which has been an issue since tekken 6

i could mention how rage and heat are garbage same with homing throws but thats all technically subjective

#####

battlepass premium coin shop battle passes on top of 70 game

#####

 70 game
 season pass stuck in deluxe upgrade for 40
 cash shop
 battle pass with premium tiers

#####

there is a good game hidden beneath the unbelievable greed but what with a battlepass stuffed into an already 70e base game on top of season pass on top of not letting us practice against dlc characters without paying yeah just cant recommend this for now

#####

literally the default ue5 sphere is a premium battle pass item the devs are a fucking joke

#####

i cant break throws and drag is stupid

#####

battle pass and ingame shop with predatory points system introduced wayyy after release just to dodge the initial pushback sad to see well its been fun two decades but ill pass on following this mess any longer shame because the game is fantastic

#####

as a loyal tekken fan tekken 8 follows the same formula as its predecessors having an onlineoffline mode gallery jukebox arcade mode and character specific endings 

there are many things i love about tekken 8 but these are the major selling points

 multiple character specific intros  win poses
 good offline content shame no team battle
 a great base roster
 matchmaking and loading times significantly lower in comparison to tekken 7

but there are two features that need to be highlighted individually the first being the fight lounge the reason i love it is because you can play with friends and strangers alike but you have access to chat and the opportunity to meet so many great people i genuinely feel like im in an arcade and its a great place to hang out and play a few casual games

the second being the superb replay feature the fact you can watch your own replays and train against something you may have struggled with rewind to the exact moment to see what could have worked instead of what you did in real time its a fantastic feature which i hope is included in all future tekken games 

now for the not so good

 regular crashes occur particularly in lobbies
 the customisation  is lacklustre sure theres more options than tekken 7 but tekken 6 and tag 2 had far superior features in this regard
 whilst the story was great the story gameplay was nothing to write home about 
 they removed a great qol feature they introduced in tag 2 being online practice

overall veterans will enjoy this game and newcomers have lots of tools ingame to familiarise themselves with tekkens mechanics and improve their play a solid 810 from me

#####

garbage fight pass for 70 game

#####

the game is good play it if you enjoy tekken however i have to downvote it just because of the scammy microtransactions present in this game the gameplay is fantastic but customization is at an alltime low they released the game with a bare minimum of custom outfits and just one month later they introduced microtransactions priced at 399 per skin this is a pathetic moneygrabbing strategy and they need to take notice of reviews reflecting negatively on their actions

#####

i wrote a positive review around launch when the game had so much potential now everything has changed

list
tekken shopmtx was added a month after launch to dodge negative reviews none of this was revealed before
the shop uses a predatory model tekken coins which cannot be bought in the amount you want
lack of customization option in this game compared to previous iterations
mod videos with old costumes were taken down when they announced tekken shop
costumes that were available for free in previous games are cut and resold to you in this tekken shop
ragequitters are getting away with it there is no pentalty system implemented
you cannot control replays on dlc characters or your own character in the replay if you have not bought the dlc character so you cannot practice unless you pay
game balancing is trash
now a battle pass is also added to make it even worse with items that are a complete disappointment a blender sphereunreal engine 5 default sphere with default material really they did not even try
list

this game has poor balancing and no penalty for rage quitters on top of it it has a predatory monetization system that is all added after launch this is a 70 game with f2pmobile game monetization  30 season pass

tekken is amazing but tekken 8 has gone a terrible direction such a shame because this game had so much potential and the core itself is actually good



#####

sorry players we cant fix actual problems because all our devs are busy stealth adding 5 outfits and battlepass after release oh and if you are against that you are stupid and incompetent and you have to buy tekken shop shit or we will run out of money for servers boohooo

#####

h1 its becoming a paid service game h1
a lot has changed since the games release upon release it had barebones customisation for characters with a later emphasis on unlocking more by purchasing cosmetics with real money to then release a battle pass system in a fully priced triplea game to the consistent nerfing of leroy to balance changes that ruin creativity this game is worse than tekken 7 in its current form as of this review

iyou dont have to buy the cosmetics they exist to pay for the serversi need i remind you that tekken 8 sold millions per gaming platform it didnt need this

this isnt an early access game it has its issues which may or may not be ironed out however it is the price of a full triplea game which you have to remember before making any financial purchasing decisions bas this game is constantly changingb

h2 story side contenth2
the story picks off after tekken 7 during we only saw jin once at its end now we play as him for the majority of t8 the story is about 4 hours long has its spectacular moments but isnt groundbreaking either it ends on a cliffhanger and doesnt feel fulfilling the cutscenes animation voice lines good

bthe side storiesb see you playing as other characters which is a great way to encourage the player to use more than one character each character story has its own ending some are funny some are awkward

h2 the characters dlc h2
the roster is good having many returning characters from tekken 7 each and every character has changed in either good or bad ways it has been argued that ba lot of the cast has simply become too strongb and that is true for whats on offer the counter play to strong opponents now bounds down to a 5050 casino guessing game it gets boring fast regardless of how skilled you are as a player what im saying is yes characters like victor or dragonuv can be labbed practice mode but when youre up against 5050 mixup pressure all you can do is make reads and guess what your opponent is going to do at times it feels less like a fighting game and more like a guessing game however this isnt always the case

the first dlc character to come to tekken 8 is eddy whom previously came with the main game of tekken 7 he wasnt the most popular character in tekken 8 it appears he has a few simplified easy combos namely pressing 33333333 gives him a 61dmg combo

some characters from the previous game are now simply too strong dragonuv for example he went from a safe poking counterhit seeking character into a pressureintoch guessing game tool feng wei is another example he has every tool in the game evasiveness parries great throw game pressure into safe 5050 mixups and insanely strong low attacks

h2 heat system rage arts h2
the heat system is a unique take on tekken where it temporarily gives the player a very strong buff to where they can produce a strong 5050 mixup leaving your opponent to guess how youre going to attack it can lead your character dealing half health damage to your opponent if used correctly

heat burst activation gives your character the armor property meaning you can push through opponents attacks resulting in yours connecting on connection it deals a quarter if not more of the opponents health bar its a haha i win button the only difference between heat burst and rage art is that on block the heat burst is safe and gives you a 5050

rage art is a carryover from tekken 7 a move that becomes available when your character is around 15 health it turns your health bar red and you get access to two options you deal more damage and you have a onetime use attack which is punishable on block rage arts changed in tekken 8 where the punishment frames are now 15 meaning most 16 frame and above launchers dont connect it is a dumb change because the attack itself deals nearly half your health bar it can be used in combos as an ender but due to damage mitigation after each hit it doesnt do as much damage thankfully

h2 battle tekken pass mtx shop severe mental health implications h2
overall it takes me out of the experience of having preordered the most expensive version of tekken 8 it is the reason i made this negative review

one month after the games initial release namco released an update where players could purchase cosmetic items for 4 each some of these were httpsimgurcomv7gx5tk reused assets from previous tekken games pictured tekken 6 kazuya costume a game from 2007

bwhich kind of games have battle pass systems free to play gamesb two months after release namco unveiled the tekken pass another take on the popular battlepass which freemium games use to make money

the practice itself preys on fomo the fear of missing out overall bit holds negative implications on the players mental healthb as it requires them to contribute their time and money it also means that for the participating player to level up the pass they will play the game even when they dont want to bts essentially paying to workb as your payment does not guarantee you the items included in the pass as you are given an arbitrary time limit to complete the pass

another way battle pass systems encourage the damaging of mental health a player will see other players with cosmetics that they want they then become addicted to the system playing the game 247 draining their social and mental batteries this will not affect everyone bhowever it does have an impact amongst those with mental disorders such as adhdb it is important to avoid games with timeexclusive battle pass systems if you have these issues

in the past i myself have suffered at the hands of another game and succumbed to brain rot i couldnt not play this other game because i wanted to level up the bp each month i couldnt think for myself or do anything else it was difficult to recover from i could only think about this one game and its fancy shiny cosmetics it took my time money and mental stability away from me this was years ago im fine now

bthe tos implies you cannot purchase the battle pass after the free version of it reaches level 41b this will unfortunately encourage players to purchase it so they can reap the rewards of the paid tier up to that point

ion the surface the bp doesnt sound so badi buntil you realise the base game costs 70b not to mention the items included in the pass which costs 10 are from previous tekken games character profiles cosmetics 

bwhy this is negativeb the tekken pass could very well change the player community as a whole the gameplay itself between players was already very aggressive due to the inclusion of the heat system and now with the battle pass it will encourage players whom are addicted to fomo to play even more aggressively possibly increasing the frustration of the base players if not leading to other emotions

tekken is in noway under financial ruin with millions of copies sold per gaming platform it didnt need this now during gameplay of my paid game i will have to put up with iyou have unlocked a hat in the bp want it buy the bpi advertised to me in a paid game no thank you

h2 recent nerfs h2
every character in the game has been nerfed due to devil jins ability to floor break stages which had an issue with damage scaling wall and floor breaks no longer work during combos whether or not this is patched weve yet to see it was likely an unintentional change but it couldve been handled better
this recent change destroys creativity during combos as floor breaks etc were key to pulling off flashy moves

a common meme but true bthey keep nerfing leroyb
thank you for reading my review ran out of txt space

#####

added microtransactions with bullshit currency a month after release

#####

as a long time tekken enjoyer tekken 8 is a wonderful addition to the series however there are some glaring issues that  thoroughly overshadow the achievements of the development team ranked online can often be an extremely poor experience due to purposeful disconnecting going completely unpunished 

bandai namcos greed is also a black stain on this game they lied to the customer saying there would be no microtransactions and then implemented an ingame store with predatory premium currency a month after release most items cost 4 while the minimum amount of premium currency you can buy is 5 everything about this implementation is extremely scummy and sickening

theres an awesome game here but bandai namcos handling of it makes it hard to recommend

#####

they banned iran ip for no reason 
i paid for this game and i cant even play it without vpn and of course its gonna effect on my ping and im receiving lots of hate comments from the community cz my ping is 130 
thats not fair i played this franchise since tekken 2 released and now here i am i cant play without vpn
thank you so much btw  the characters are not balance anymore and the game is not technical as it was before you just need more luck


#####

bamco speed running the fall of their reputation

1 sell base game for 70 
2 optional 40 dlc on launch
3 wait until reviews are out and announce mtx predatory bundlesprices
4 less than a month later introduce a bp that was never announced or mentioned
5 bp sucks and is recycled content from previous games where they were free
6 most recent patch that was supposed to help balance actually fucked it even worse
7 lock the dlc character away from anyone who didnt buy them in offline practice in a game where knowledge checks are the difference between a win and a stomp


this game was better on launch every patch has made things worse this is slowly becoming a blizzardow12 situation the only saving grace for now is the game launched with a good amount of content off the rip but that doesnt last forever
there is still something to be enjoyed here but the way its going that wont be the case for long 

solid 8510 on launch not so solid 610 now and getting worse

#####

you can buy a positive review for just 699

#####

an improvement on tk7 in literally every conceivable way the only thing that hasnt directly improved is my skill

#####

get ready for the next transaction

the game itself is 70 100 if you bought the other editions
the season pass is 20
the tekken shop costs 5 for each outfit
and now the will implement a battle pass that costs more 
whats next each match costing 1 monthly subscription of 30

cant imagine tekken stooping this low
microtransactions ruined this game

#####

a 70 game that after a month of release and after all the reviews added an mtx store with fortnitelike vbucks with scummy pricing and later a battle pass and pay to win early access to dlc characters no thanks id rather not keep on playing 
all while plugging and scriptingmacro use is rampant and has only gotten worse since tekken 7 with no fix or solution in sight but i guess namco just wants that money and doesnt care about community goodwill and also factor in that modders and the mod community got copyright striked because its muh potential lost revenue when modders do a better job than the developers

#####

development costs are now 10 times higher than in the 90s and this is apparently why you should pay for something that was free10 times cheaper in the t7 that released in 2017 


#####

a highly competent frankly brilliant fighting game held back by a stubborn intentionally archaic handling of online features and a cash shop introduced soon after all press reviews of the game were finalized to add insult to injury

the netcode is okay and usually playable but its the only fighting game of the current generation to not have rock solid rollback netcode

no pc stress test or pc performance indicator before going online means youll regularly run into opponents who force you to play the game in slow motion thats not including those who deliberately throttle their framerate when losing

the games anticheat is a manually updated excel sheet of cheaters names that the director of the game is personally demoting to beginner ranks with no automated system to catch deliberate disconnects or cheaters  
you do not get a win if your opponent deliberately disconnects when losing and they receive no punishment 
the disconnect rate tracker in game is also not working so you have no way of knowing if youve been matched with a plugger until you waste 5 minutes playing them 

those manually demoted by the devs will cheatplug their way back to high ranks in a day or two 

the devs are proud enough of this being their anticheat system that they boast about it on twitter when asked about introducing the above features the devs have stated they are strictly against any kind of automated system for detecting or punishing foul play

i look forward to an update where i no longer have to wonder whether my opponent who seems weak for their rank is going to yoink their ethernet cable when they lose a couple of rounds

for now i sadly cant recommend this otherwise solid fighting game

#####

adding a shop after the reviews to get the great praise and pr going after seeing the failing of mk1 and street fighter 6 so it went from dont preorder to wait one month got it

#####

microtransactions and battle passes are a higher priority than people plugging on games

#####

this is a very solid tekken game but bamco added mtx post launch first were fighter coins with the classic you cant buy the costumecharacter you want without having to buy 2 of the first coin options or 1 second coin option now they added a freakin battle pass free with premium rewards if you upgrade in a 5499 game i guess you could say ignore it its just cosmetics and that is true but if it keeps being done without pushback theyll keep adding mtx in these games

#####

knowledge chekken

#####

1010 game of hot daddies like victor kazuya mishima and dragunov 
new golden age for fighting games but shitty netcode  
tekken 8 is an outstanding fighting game an extremely strong 3d fighter with lots of offline content strong core mechanics and all around a fun and stylish game tekken continues to show the world why its the winner of the iron fist tournament



#####

i like the game but introducing a cash shop after release to avoid initial backlash and appropriate ratings is a giga bitch move
also ragequitters get no penalties and the proposed changes for that are nonsensical

#####

the game doesnt punish rage quitters and it ruins the online experience no point in grinding ranked when anyone can plug after they know they will lose

#####

the saddest thing about betrayal is that it never comes from an enemy

#####

this game is pretty awesome but its completely ruined by a single flaw

in online ranked matches if you disconnect or even just altf4 it just cancels the game the person who disconnects gets no punishment and it doesnt even have a stat for how often that player disconnects this makes it so that any time youre losing a game you can just decide not to and theres absolutely no penalty so be ready for your opponent to just drop every time youre about to win

#####

most expensive f2p monetization game i own 

#####

really love this game it will remain to be seen how heat played out but right now during the honey moon phase the game is really fun the game continues to do what tekken does best offer a fighting game package in which there is enough depth that you can pour 1000s of hours into the game and still have things to explore but is also accessible enough that new players can hop in find a character that seems cool and mash away heat is definitely a powerful mechanic but i was surprised to find that there is quite a bit of strategy and decision making surrounding how to use it effectively the meta does fall into how well you can use heat so it is absolutely the defining factor in matches but how to use heat has some depth to it i think that in subsequent patches the strength of some heat moves will be tuned down as t7 slowly lowered the power of certain characters over time but i think were in a period now where the game feels explosive and fun which honestly is great for the first season of a game refinement can be the flavor of the game over a long lifespan but the first few monthsyear im okay with being a slugfest personally

to me the biggest drawbacks are qol and optimization currently there is no benchmark to play online so if another players pc cannot properly run the game the game will stutter they really need to add a benchmark  recommended for online setting type of system to 1 reduce stuttering 2 not alienate the players on lower power pcs but instead guide them to the correct settings to reduce stuttering there are many upscaling options but how they work are a blackbox 

the other issue is the complete lack of infinite matches and poorly optimized user experience ft2 in ranked is fine but having player matches and lounge matches also be ft2 makes no sense in a game as difficult as tekken it can be really difficult to learn match ups if new players are only encountering 1 character on a 32 roster every once in a while and then for only a 2 maybe 3 games at best also searching for lobbies needs to be implemented i am part of a discord community and when we are trying to play with players in other platforms and are unable to invite via stream it becomes a game of refreshing the available lobbies over and over until our lobby comes up 

overall i love tekken and i think this is a great game for newcomers and veterans a lot if you go into this game with the right mindset its just the best

#####

i loved the part in the story where bamco was taking mods down so they can release an incredibly underwhelming ingame store and battle pass greed is good

#####

its insane how much love went into this game the story music characters gameplay and attention to details are at the highest level they can be i recommend this to everyone even if you are not that much of an fgc person

#####

finally a good videogame

#####

amazing game we need more dlc support of this game also story dlc as well

#####

steamdeck users run with protonhotfix
runs flawless 60fps

the king of ironfist tournament 8 is here and its damn good


#####

to do something sooo pathetic and scummy as adding a cash shop a month after release is mind boggling
triple a company everybody
id prefer unlocking costumes by other means like maybe playing the game

#####

i hate hwoarang

#####

eddy gordo is pay to win

#####

negative review until they punish plugging just automatically mark the match as a loss for the disconnected player like in every other online game 

after recent tweets im not holding my breath theyre even bragging about having a excel sheet of people who are getting their rank reset its embarrassing

oh yeah and introducing a mtx store after the review embargo is a dick move but whatever

#####

barefoot reina

#####

this game looks and plays absolutely fantastic but ever since the release the devs and publishers shown nothing but disdain for the community that provides them with a job scummy predatory microtransactions implemented after the reviews were done its something right out of ea playbooks especially with the fact that there is no way to buy tekken coins so that you have nothing remaining after the purchase forcing you to buy more than you need if it was possible i would refund the game on principle for this alone add to that that the game is unbalanced as hell there are about 56 characters who are so far above the rest in power level it ruins the whole experience for me dragunov jun devil jin king xiaoyu and feng for this alone i would refund the game on principle if it was possible the ragequitters and cheaters ruin the whole experience when the op characters dont and the developers have 0 answer for this even though theres a few ways that work perfectly in other fighting games for this alone i would refund the game on principle i am not happy with my purchase and im ashamed and angry that i gave 70 euros to bandai namco one last point if they keep doing what they did during t7 with the dlcs the balance is not gonna get better its gonna get worse i would suggest everyone take a long break from this disgusting publisher and give their money to people who deserve it if you dont wanna hate yourself dont buy from these people

edit 2 months later
they added a battlepass there is no reason for this game costing 70 euros it plays like a free2play gatcha game at this point oh and eddie is as broken as expected you get a blank white ball for tekken ball as premium reward on the battlepass at this point im tempted to skip the elden ring dlc that i was very excited about just to spite bandai namco
edit 2 balance is still a fucking disgrace drag got a slap on the wrist jun was untouched devil jin was barely touched feng got buffed hes so evasive even the nerfs whiff i feel like an abused 50s housewife the only reason i still play is where the hell am i gonna go

#####

very fun and content filled game the definitive fighting game experience i wouldnt recommend buying it until they fix the plugging issue however its an easy fix just for some bizarre reason the devs like to reward cheaters

#####

good game trash monetization cant recommend

#####

pluggers run rampant in ranked honourable behaviour gets punished online give the staying player the points and derank the rage quitter  perma ban people who consistently show bad sportsmanship and ffs punish the ones who record themselves doing it and gloating about it on stream

introduced an mtx shop a month in to dodge bad reviews unbelievably scummy af deserves a severe reviewbombing for this alone

added a premium currency in said mtx shop you want a skin for 400 tekken coins sorry you gotta buy the minimum premium pack which is 500  double scum points and the battle pass  costs 600  triple scum points  the battle pass is also not included in the deluxeultimate editions quad scum points  didnt even call them tekkoins lazy uninspired naked profiteering  wtf are you doing haradamurraybn are you serious  you think were all just brain rotten or something

disconnection rate worked in the closed beta didnt work on release giving you zero control over playing matches you would otherwise reject because your opponent is a plugger with skyhigh disconnect rate  i gave written feedback at the end of the cbt none of which seemed to make it into the finished game

the battle pass includes copy  pasted stuff from t7 they are literally charging you for recycling old assets from the last game where it was free  alsothis is not a jokethey include a standard plain sphere shape asset from ue5 in the pass  it does not get lazier than this folks

victor had a legit broken grab first several weeks and azucenas wr 3 2 was way too strong after the leroy nerf document leak of tekken 7 im compelled to believe this was deliberate to pump new character popularity numbers in charts to brown nose bn execs or something

game is super fun in a casual setting looks beautiful and yoshimitsu is good now  the only time im really having fun in t8 is playing my brother offline

i wish i could refund this game because i feel absolutely betrayed and lied to every waking moment im reading updates about it waiting for it to get better

vote with your wallets your reviews and if you still have some fight left in you tweet at those who have influence over the games development  this behaviour should not be rewarded let alone praised  being okay with this is being complicit with anticonsumer tactics and making the industry worse for everyone  just because you have money to spare and dont care doesnt mean those who dont dont should suffer for it

dont buy tekken 8 and if you have already refund it if you cant dont buy the low effort mtx garbage theyre peddling  congrats to bandai namco on consistently being one of my least favourite publishers of all time your influence is a plague and your greedy decisions rust the experience of every game you touch

if you dont care about any of that have fun  ignorance truly is bliss

#####

they added a cash shop and a battle pass post launch just buy tekken 7 or emulate an older tekken

#####

who knows how massappealing this is going to be but i gave 8 an honest try and this cant be the best tekken there are too many flaws from unfinished mechanics to plain simple performance issues but step by step

net code is a disaster on its own it is the same simple direct connection with a few rollback frames in 2024 this is not good enough but it gets worse compared to 7 it is not performing as intended content creators called it out urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcqdcfxtfmokhereurl or known players urlhttpstwittercomholykneestatus1761772075390468539hereurl without any reaction from bamco by now and still it gets even worse if i ask 8 to give me the best possible connection i might get a 100 ms 3f rollback wireless connection how is that possible at all why has nobody at bamco figured out how to implement a switch to exclude wireless players why does the game think the best possible connection can be a 100ms delay why do i have to deal with 3f rollback 

cheating and plugging have been problems in 7 already this was ignored by bamco for most of the last decade and unfortunately this is still the state of the game we had a patch this week that should have targeted these players but the mostknown eu cheater still sits in the top ranks of the leaderboards while plugging is still happening the biggest plugging streamer ever is still happily plugging over and over simple solution a lifetime ban for cheaters and if you lose the connection for whatever reasonplugging or internet disconnectyou lose the opponent gets a win other games can do it which is too difficult for bamco

performance of the game is another thing 7 was known to be running fine on a modern toaster 8 is just awful and the consequences impact the online gameplay if your opponents pc cannot handle the game you will suffer from lags and spikes there are already guides out there to semi fix performance problems from driver settings to how to unlock taa 


arguably all of these 3 points could be fixed in the near future but until ltg and fariborz are removed from the game and i get max 60ms matches without spikes from my opponents pc i will keep this a negative review

my personal opinion i dislike the balance and the implementation of heat it feels like every character is now a 5050 archetype  the strongest and most damaging are the most competitive by now the balance of the characters is so off that one of tekkens strengths character variety is currently gone 

and while plenty of viable complaints are in the room bamco implements a shop without calling the in game currency tecoins by the way i am fine that the waifu players need for bikini customs will be paying the server fees but could we get our priorities straight and at least try to fix the game

#####

if youre an actual tekken fan do not buy  what tekken 8 makes up for in graphical fidelity it sorely lacks in fluidity and strategy  be prepared to be bombarded with animations that take you out of the fight and gameplay while the camera focuses on either you or your opponents face every 5 seconds  during every pvp online player or ranked match  tekken 8 is a hybrid of all the worst aspects of fighting games these days

just under 60 hours worth of gameplay unlocked everything completed all modes played online got my favorite character to mighty ruler and unfortunately ive lost interest  im no tekken pro however i can hold my own and enjoy a good online fighter

ive owned completed and enjoyed all of the tekken games that have come out  tekken 1 thru 8 and tekken tag tournament 1 and 2  while tekken 8 is a decent fighter and perhaps beginner friendly this particular tekken installment is much more of a button masher and rewards spamming far more than any tekken before it  its odd really  there is a fundamental layer of tekkengameplay underneath the nice new graphics but the technical aspects of tekken 8 seem to have taken a step backwards  

t8 does encourage a more aggressive playstyle but also slips up in its precision accuracy and execution   character hitboxes are all over the map and moves that should have whiffed end up landing both for and against you  its quite jarring considering the controls and gameplay felt much tighter in tekken 7 after numerous updates of course  i personally believe that tekken 5 dark resurrection was the height of the series and while ive always curbed my expectations with regards to sequels tekken 8 is a looker but lacks the precision and polish of the past three games in the series  the lack of precise attacking and hitting makes the overall gameplay more frustrating than fun  this is coming from someone who used to enjoy the learning curve of distancing dodging and counterattacking  unfortunately it seems as though every single character in the game is affected by this lack of precision this time around  i know its not just me who thinks this either because a few other regular tekken players ive played with have noticed this as well

anyway aside from all of that heres what tekken 8 has to offer

 a cringe worthy story mode  tekken fans know what theyre getting here
 an episodic mode where you get an intro and ending cutscene for each character better than story mode
 tekken ball actually an interesting if a little basic game of pong using characters and their movesets
 arcade mode its arcade mode does what it says
 arcade quest mode a mode with another story that seems to be geared toward 3rd grade children 
 super ghost battle mode probably the most interesting new addition of tekken 8
 online player and ranked matches connection quality seems to be better but the spammy gameplay and hits that land when indeed they shouldnt have seems to be worse
 online lounge where you can take your silly looking character avatar and  hang out
 a lot of missing characters  expect a plethora of future dlc
 last but not least a downgrade in character customization  not a big deal but people should know  update less than a month after release all kinds of pay for customizations are released  i have over 67 million gold in game now with nowhere left to spend it  bought all the customizations that dont cost real money in the game what now  good job namco

i get it this tekken was made mostly for newcomers to the series  i wouldnt say that the gameplay excludes longtime tekken fans but it certainly does feel like the series has forgotten its roots  its by no means a bad fighting game but as far as gameplay goes it just does not feel as tightly controlled or as rewarding as tekken 4 5 6 7 or even ttt2  thats my opinion though

normally id put a few hundred hours into any new tekken that i pick up  however at just over 50 hours and after completing everything the game has to offer with regards to story arcade ghost battle collectibles and achievements ive pretty much had my fill  the online play which is normally where id spend a few hundred hours has actually made me want to go back to tekken 7   i personally cant recommend tekken 8 based on the fact that it has lost some of the refinement that made all of its predecessors control and play so well  seriously those magical homing hits that reach an opponent when they actually should have whiffed ruin this game

#####

at first i really liked the game it has a hilariously over the top story 30 characters nice tutorial features character episodes tho a bit underwhelming fun extra modes with arcade quest and tekken ball and more but most importantly the game is fundamentally fun to play runs well and has contrary to what many might say an excellent netcode for a 3d fighter
yes as with every first version of every tekken game this feels like but a beta there is plenty of broken stuff in the game from characters having overpowered moves over things like broken throws or unbreakable throws while you hold a button to cameras glitching out or you randomly switching sides in the middle of doing a combo 

but then they saw many of those unintended behaviors for a few specific characters or situations and decided to just make systemwide changes that have now broken multiple mechanics and lead to most characters having some sort of issue now but i would be able to forgive that stuff if the game wouldnt constantly be like hey pay me pay me more

they purposefully waited until weeks after launch to add the tekken shop where you can buy useless stuff like avatar skins that you never see or firework emotes that are onetime use consumables they added skins from previous games intentionally priced in a way that you always have to buy more tekken coins than you actually need to coerce you into more spending but of course thats not enough so they added a fight pass and premium fight pass and a premium plus fight pass so now they prey on the whole fear of missing out thing you better play now and earn rewards after paying them for the premium pass cause in a few weeks its all gonna be gone but dont worry we give some daily challenges to make it more fun for you what are those challenges you ask well to play the game yes not a joke the challenges consist of playing x amount of matches and winning x amount of matches as well as doing x amount of damage which you will all do just by playing like normal and the rewards more stuff that was already in previous tekken games
not only is it by far the scummiest tekken has ever been but it also feels like this is the laziest implementation of said scams that they could think of

oh and of course you still have to pay separately for any additional character in the future cant earn currency or do challenges to earn those or really anything else you actually want
now every time i open the game the first things i see is 2 bubbles reminding me play more or pay more it simply turned into another fee to pay game if you had asked me what they could do to turn this great series into my biggest disappointment possible well i dont have to answer they already did

additionally their handling of plugging issues and banning of people is downright laughable doesnt help those already affected at all and goes against everything any other game including their own previous tekkens has done 

and of course they now go after modders too since they want to probably steal modders ideas of outfits and sell them in the store themselves later so they go around ruining the livelihood of fans by getting their yt channels deleted just so they can turn a small profit

so yes i think in terms of core mechanics this might turn into a pretty good game eventually once they iron out all the bugs and broken stuff
can i recommend it tho as it is and as what it clearly tries to become hell no
if i could i would refund it but since i cant i will try to get my moneys worth out of the game if i can even enjoy it any more and if it doesnt change then ill probably just forget it existed

#####

this is complicated for me as a product at launch tekken 8 was a much more full game than t7 ever was balancing aside its got a lot of great single player content however waiting a month to add micros and then a battle pass when they knew that was the plan from the jump is not something i think i or anyone else should overlook

i payed 70 dollars just to play a game with a f2p model and i find that to be unacceptable especially because of the deception add in the fact you cant even lab dlc characters as of this point and its not a stretch to say that its pay to win to say nothing of them just upscaling t7 assets and selling them back to us or the fact that they cant even deal with pluggers or cheaters effectively

ive poured countless hours into tekken as a franchise and i hope they do better in the future but as of now i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone at full price

#####

the game is amazing and probably the best fighting game out right now im leaving a negative review because the aggressive monetization is downright insulting holding back an in game cash shop and a battle pass until after the games release when the reviews are already out is such a scummy move they removed most of the customization options so they could sell them back to you for a premium and no i dont give a shit that its only cosmetic or not that bad just dont buy it this shit has been normalized so much that they know they can get away with it oh sure i wont buy anything from the cash shop but some guy with more money than sense will if you give these greedy companies an inch then they will take a mile and saying the battle pass is not that bad is just sending the message that its ok to do this shit its a shame that people have to chase the new shiny fomo carrot on a stick and cant vote with their wallets anymore

#####

tekken 7 is my most played steam game and i put over 200 hours into tekken 8 already i really enjoy the gameplay in tekken 8 even if the balance isnt perfect but everything else is unfinished at best nonfunctional on average and blatant lazy cash grabs at worst

to get the monetization out of the way i dont mind that the company has decided to sell skins and other content theyre allowed to charge for additional content the problem i have is that the aggressive monetization was introduced after the game launched and its existence has affected every part of the game ive long since accepted paid dlc but did we really need a separate ingame store with its own premium currency as well and a battle pass it would be one thing if the items being offered were quality products but almost everything in the battle pass and the tekken store is either incredibly generic something that used to come in the base game for free something incredibly underwhelming or a combination of the three there are multiple examples of popular old costumes that used to come with the base game and are now in the tekken store but are also now lower quality despite costing money

there are also plenty of issues with the game since launch this is somewhat to be expected for a new fighting game but some of the issues that are still in the game have been known about since tekken 7 and earlier the disconnect rate not displaying properly should not have taken over a month to fix and certainly should have been fixed before rolling out tons of additional paid content i still think their solution to pluggers and cheaters isnt very elegant im still getting an average of 2 pluggers per ranked session but theyre at least finally doing what theyve promised by banning some of them my biggest issue is with the most recent patch despite likely being the most profitable release for a fighting game to date one of the first patches comes out with multiple major bugs relating to core aspects of the game the wall stage hazards rage arts etc even if theyre all fixed quickly it shows that they did not test their patch properly despite having the resources to release an overwhelming amount of paid additional content

on top of all that the new dlc character is once again almost universally considered broken and you cant even use the replay takeover feature to learn how to fight against him unless you pay for the dlc character i really tried with tekken 8 but unlessuntil i see some major changes in the direction of the game i cant support it any longer i already regret buying the game as much fun as ive had with it i dont feel good supporting a company that thinks its okay to ask for as much money as they do for an unfinished product

#####

i love tekken but this sht aint it allmost half the cast are op as hell the range frames moves that hit behind their backs seriously wtf and even fng mid crushing moves of bs characters you know who you are is unbelievable no sense in playing ranked when there are only the same fng 5 characters  not really enjoyable at the moment hyi maybe after a year this game is fun again oh and i allmost forget they still havent fixed the issue of godsdamned pluggers beeing in every few matches how can it be so hard to make it so that they who leave get an l and the one that doesnt plug out gets an w
allthough im only in purple ranks at the moment im sure there are plenty of players better and worse than me who think the same  ofc if they didnt take the easy route with op bs monke brain characters

in short too unbalanced and i mean really unbalanced to be fun

#####

scummy predatory f2p monetization in a 70 game more likely than you think especially disappointing because i really enjoy the game

#####

70 game with shop future paid dlc characters and battlepass
such a waste namco

added microtransaction store a month after launch to avoid negative pressreviews and people being able to refund the game a 70 dollar game  in which you have no way to earn the premium currency by playing  where you have to pay for dlc characters season passes and now also skins i know free to play games where they let you gain the premium currency for free just as a daily login bonus or in events but in tekken 8 which is not free to play and costs a full price 70 dollars there is no way to get the premium currency other than by buying it  and the amount of coins you need to buy a skin is 400 4 dollars but the minimum amount of coins you can buy is 500 so you always have to pay 5 dollars so one dollar more than the item costs base game cosmetics are very ugly and underwhelming on purpose  to make you buy stuff from the store you essentially have to deal with all the scummyness of a free to play game in a full price 70 dollar game with 100 dollar special editions

base game roster is also extremely lackluster on purpose iconic characters were purposefully cut out to make you buy them as dlc and base game slots were wasted on many boring characters that the developers know no one would buy if they were dlc cuz no one likes them like shaheen or panda one of the biggest signs of this is armor king  armor king was like the #3 most played character in tekken 7 despite being a dlc so youd think due to such popularity he would be in the base game of tekken 8 instead of boring characters no one in the community likes like shaheen or panda or kuma but nope hes not here youll have to pay for him twice in a row cuz they know you would and they know youd never pay for shaheen or panda just disgusting dlc characters are also always designed to be completely overpowered in order to make you buy them was the case in tekken 7  you essentially only saw dlc characters used in tournaments  so im sure theyll do that in tekken 8 too essentially making the game paytowin

they also removed the ability to apply all colors to the clothing of female characters so that you cant make your clothes the same color as your characters skin to where youd appear nude but actually arent they didnt only remove the skin color pallete but also removed tons of other colors which dont look like skin at all such as all the shades of red and so on on these clothing pieces male characters can still change their clothes to whatever they want even if it would make them appear nude male characters who are all big muscled ripped with giant pecks and six packs and can walk around shirtless  whilst the females all look extremely basic with small tits small thighs and small asses but apparently its okay for a straight woman or a nonstraight man to be looking at these halfnaked muscled sixpack having guys but its wrong and evil if a straight man looks at these averagebodied females if they make their clothes the color of human skin  lilis panties in her default outfit have also been made longer to be less revealing essentially turned into shorts and the physics of her skirt are also made to be less revealing and unrealistic compared to tekken 7 the titty jiggle is good and you can still equip skirts that work as intended with the upskirts and have normal panties but apparently if you make a characters clothes color like their skin or want to see lili panty shots in her default outfit thats too much and youre a pervert but if a woman enjoys looking at dragunovs sixpack thats completely fine and thats also exactly what this game needs  for customization to be more limited they didnt even implement this censorship properly  since as i said you lose color shades that arent skin color too azucenas default outfit is red  and youre not able to use any other red on her clothes skin aint red but those colors still got removed limiting default customization patching the workaround and this patch also broke many peoples customizations on their outfits most of which didnt even use skin color and just had stuff like gold red orange creamy etc and this only happened to the female characters too so when are we going to force all the men to always have completely covered up bodies and make them all skinny and short since we dont want our games to be perverted surely such exciting halfnaked guys with such awesome bodies would excite the female players like how a justasmuch revealing female with giant tits and a giant ass so its equal to the guys being body builders would excite a male player so of course theyd get the same treatment  right right apparently not  because youre only evil if you are healthy and have a healthy sexuality that nature gave you if you are a man if youre a woman itll always be good and fine for you to feel anyway you want about anything and to enjoy looking at anything hence the game developers are misandric and prejudice and hatred is not to be supported

game also doesnt punish people cheating ragequitting etc so online is a mess but hey we got a microtransactions shop added a month after release to avoid backlash and the refund law we got iconic characters cut out to sell as dlc we removed the ability to use many shades on female characters clothing so they may not appear nude even though they actually arent even though theres people running around in online matches literally cosplaying as a certain german politician from world war 2 but nope we cant fix the gameplay issues cant fix the cheaters and ragequitters ruinning online experience  we have to limit what colors you can use on a female characters clothing so they dont appear nudebutnotactually

#####

the game itself is good but then they drop a microtransaction shop on top of their 70 game and their already existing season pass for 30 and items cost 400 points when you can only buy 500 coins at a time

then they decide to add a battle pass which costs 600 coins so now you need to buy 2x 500 coins to buy it

and they drop this postrelease so they wouldnt get negative reviews on steam or other platforms

this franchise is dead

#####

scummy post release monetization

#####

70 game  30 dlc character packages  trash season pass with stock assets zero effort moneygrabbing with lesser content than what a single modder does for free paywalled replay with dlc characters only t8 has plugging issues because its the only one with devs too braindead to award a loss to the dc so it becomes a plague upon their already shifty ranked online experience beyond all the issues with the game itself developers allowing players to throw tantrums to worsen the experience for everyone  go on and on about manually banning bad actors instead of fixing the root of the problem  dc  loss its so simple and these clowns talk about local laws for banning people its pathetic and out of touch why doesnt sf6 their real competitor have this issue theyre better why does a dogshit game like mk1 do it better than tekken 8

#####

this is some good ass tekken
i have to fight the wifi accusations

#####

devs didnt mention battle pass initially before the reviews and putting previously free tekken 7 customization items behind a paywall nicely done
and the most humiliating part is that transactions are coming before even 1st real balance patch

#####

i would really liked to have known before release that you were adding a piece of shit item shop 
at least make the currency attainable by playing
or let me use the gold currency


#####

70 base game
paid characters
paid cosmetics
paid battlepass
