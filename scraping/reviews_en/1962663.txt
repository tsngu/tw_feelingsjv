 new autehnication launcher needs restarting fuck
 finally launches opens battle pass menu 
 want to buy a battle pass no
 here are the rewards for battlepasses i cant find the x from the battlepasses
 finally opens the menu
 opens news it takes me a full minute to figure out i was supposed to scroll to get to the warzone menu
 but no it takes me to mw3 multiplayer 
 oh good here it is warzone 
 weird cant select anything but extraction at this point i dont care click
 launch call of duty mw2 what is this shit maybe baseline for warzone
 opens mw2 launcher needs updating game will restart aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 opens mw2 cant select anything because i didnt buy the game d fuc
 close everything back to the warzone launcher 
 it finally shows that i downloaded some dmz expansion need 10 more gb to load actual warzone
 writting this review while waiting for 10gb to download i sank about an hour into this so i want to atleast shot a gun once  but i know i will delete it after a match

stay away get the old mw and mw2 that was a simple and happy childhood no wonder highschoolders these days bring weapons to school they certainly cant shoot anything in videogames

#####

activision didnt finish the game so im not finishing this revi

#####

updated the game when urzikstan came out 15gb
opened it and restarted the game due to update requires restart
restarted it and then the game told me to download an update from the launcher
installed a 800mb update and reopened the game
game told me update requires restart one more time
restarted the game only to wait 10 minutes for an unskipable cutscene and an introduction to the battle pass while lagging because of a usual suspect called shaders optimization 
went to the warzone tab and then it prompted me a message that i need to install another 1015gb to play warzone
close the game and uninstalled it


#####

im a software developer im usually pretty good at figuring out ui i have no idea how to play a game in this i found warzone after 15 minutes of searching through locked things and upon clicking play it told me i have to download more things its not clear what i have to download and where i would have to download it

convenience is king this games ui alone is not welcoming to new players the gameplay is probably worse in terms of being welcoming to new players

#####

how do you screw up a menu so badly that to get back to cod hq the main menu the game literally has to shut down and reload itself

#####

cant wait for this game to slowly eat all my disk space

#####

downloads game
activision change username because it is inappropriate
me changes username
activision were sorry but you no longer have any rename tokens
me cant play without changing username

cool guess i didnt wanna play this lol

#####

took longer to set up my activision account then it did to download the game and when i did
your account has been flagged for a rename
enters a new name
insufficient name change tokens closes game
name change tokens mf i havent even seen your horribly designed main menu yet

#####

it made me install 98gb and it didnt even install warzone

#####

i could write a whole story full of the stupidity found in this game but let me give you just one that is the pinnacle of stupidity

there is a tutorial you need to click through to explain how to navigate the menus

let this sink in 
a
tutorial
to
explain
a
menu

there are people on this world who have actively been working on that have actively thought this over and then build it and implemented this in the game and there are people who said good job we need this

none have said w t f how did we overcomplicate a simple menu that much we now need a tutorial to explain how our menu works and how to navigate it

heres a simple setup activisioninfinity ward for a menu free of charge

play
settings
battle pass optional
quit to desktop

if you wanted an ai to produce a game and gave it the prompt soulless corporate money grab sequel to mw2019 this would be that game

#####

i will eat a spoon full of mayonnaise for every like this gets

#####

as of today activision has announced that theyre completely pulling the plug on warzone caldera aka the real warzone 1 removing all progressions and ingame purchases without any compensation effectively screwing both the players who supported the game and the developers who worked hard on their product all of this was done to push people to the inferior warzone 20 do not give this company any money go play another game preferably a single player title from a company that respect its consumers

#####

a complete waste of time and space
after some time i decided to give this game a try
almost 100gb download shheeeesh 
open the game and you need an activision account ok other games do need an external account so no big deal
 immediately after the game need an inside update and it ask you to restart hmmm ok i guess first time running the game
 game finally opens on the menu oh dear theres a lot of sections for all other cod games of course locked because you need to buy them so i go looking for the free one it took me some time to understand what the heck was going on
 want to buy a battle pass no i wanna play shoot some bullets kill some get killed you know
 finally get to the warzone section click on it and launches mw2 wtf
 after another loop of updating figuring out the heck menu everything is locked because you need to buy so i closed the game and launched again maybe i misclicked or something
 oh good here it is warzone lets goooo oh wait only dmzbeta wtf is this well no problem i just wanna play anything click matchmake
 wait for it wait for it waaaaait not quite yet
 geez been about 15 minutes and no match where is everybody 
 well time to write a review what a fun game to play

#####

theres a little bit of game in this bug

#####

game has more bugs than the amazon rainforest

#####

i feel scammed even though the game is free

#####

i was just banned from your game after never playing it i downloaded the game opened it changed my controls and closed the game to go play cs2 

i come back on sunday to a game ban no explanation given

i appeal the ban and it is upheld it says i used unauthorized software i never even played the game im not even sure what software would trigger this this is absolutely insane

i have been playing games since 2004 i even competed at wsvg in 2007 for cod2 i have played with the same people i competed in dozens of games for over 20 years now ii have a gamee ban from a game i have never played for an infraction that i am not even told that i have done you are a joke of a company

#####

i saw mostly negative and tought gamers were being whiners again and downloaded it

then i downloaded it and cant even get it to launch

hopefully the small budget indie dev team can fix this game

#####

bring back wz 1 we dont want this dogshit 

#####

they deleted all of the content from the original warzone when they did that they didnt just delete cosmetics that wed paid actual human money for

they also deleted years of hard work

i cant tell you how much time i spent researching different weapon configurations and testing them out to find the ones that worked for me

and thats on top of trying out different cosmetic looks for my characters

a lot of money and a heck of a lot of time

they deleted it all and replaced it with warzone 2022 which is a bad game that runs badly looks bad and is boring to play

and they did that after firing 90 of the qa team and then expecting the remaining 10 to just increase their workload by an order of magnitude

this is a bad game made by a bad company after killing a really good game

#####

get bloons tower defense instead

#####

tells me i cant use my previous name so input a new name then after inputting new name it tells me i dont have a change nickname token bruh yall need new developers somebody needa get fired

#####

asks me to buy call of duty every time i open the game
asks me to buy call of duty every time i get a party invite
asks me to buy call of duty after every match
asks me to buy call of duty when i open the weapons menu
asks me to buy call of duty when i close the weapons menu

asks me to buy the battle pass when i open the game
asks me to buy the battle pass every time i get a party invite
asks me to buy the battle pass after every match
asks me to buy the battle pass when i open the weapons menu
asks me to buy the battle pass when i close the weapons menu

after the game crashes and gets reopened it asks me to buy the game and the battle pass
after it has to forced update after every time you launch the game you guessed it asks you to but the battle pass if it doesnt crash


#####

constantly adding new 70 gb updates with huge bugs stop making stupid updates

#####

install game
try to launch game
your gpu driver version does not meet the minimum requirements
update gpu drivers
try to launch game
update requires restart
relaunch the game
finally get into the menu
try to get into a match
shader optimization 3
wait 15 minutes 
shader optimization 3
restart the game 3 times
finally shader optimization completes
try to get into lobby with friends
nothing happens
20 minutes of troubleshooting and game restarts later
finally get into lobby with friends and queue for warzone
we get into a warzone match and drop in the map
game runs at 50 fps on a decent system
try to move around but the servers are overloaded and everyone is lagging
finally the servers stabilize after 50 people remaining in the match
we get a glimpse of hope as the lag has stopped and we are in the final few map zones
die to a guy with lmg mounted on a roof 
decide to queue for dmz since warzone is hella laggy and walking simulator
we get into a match and everything looks good
20 minutes of looting and shooting hoards of ai
glimpse of hope returns
decide to do a stronghold
clear the stronghold enemies and go to loot a container
game crashes
launches the game once again
no reconnect button and loot is lost
be happy that i didnt give 70 euro to activision and go to sleep
next day and we decide to give dmz another try
all is good and we extract with a bunch of weapons other loot and money
only weapons and keys are kept and all other items and money gets converted into xp
mfw no hideout like tarkov no traders no market no ingame economy
lootinginventory system is as basic as it gets think apex legends
quests get boring and repetitive real fast
only one map and bots have the same generic appearance and weapons
also their programming is basically sit still spot and shoot the player when in range
no interesting quests or boss
no real replayability other than pvp which you can do in warzone
remember this game was supposedly in development for 3 years by aaa company btw
be glad i didnt spend my money for the base game
vault edition 100 buckaroos btw
supposedly they will release a dlc in the future for the same price as the base game 70 dollar
biggest screwup of a game launch by one of the richest gaming companies
spend my 70 euro on mongolian fishing boots better investment tbh

if we get 1000 crashes by the end of this year i will post a video of me oiled up twerking

fk you activision

#####

this game stutters more than i used to do in front of my crush back in high school

#####

the real pvp in this game is navigating a neverending series of menus that are both useless and unintuitive  paired with constant lag and desync issues and youve got a recipe for meh

#####

activision made some really cool changes in warzone 20 i really like the coralineinspired 15 fps claymation art style they were going for the 300ms servers work great to capture this effect  cant wait for the release of warzone 30 next year for even more improvements

#####

drop in kill two kids 5 minutes apart and instantly gets shadow banned for a week 1010 experience

#####

well where to start
first warzone started to get bad when they changed the game map leaving it worse than it was at the beginning of it but it still had fun gameplay and few bugs in addition to being optimized in a much more decent way than the original current
second the previous game started with skin trends which was cool because in the first game the skins were well done and fun for the most part the weapons chosen for the skins were weapons that were actually usable and didnt have as many pro team packages
third the weapons in the game really had correct damage compared to this one in the first warzone you created the class with that weapon and it killed today you create the class one hour it kills another time it seems that it only shoots beans  it doesnt even kill a chicken the weapon categories are unbalanced the players vests have become infinite unless you get one of the crappy weapons that are practically insta kill but not usable in practical terms for the game
fourth the previous game had problems with cheaters yes it did however there you saw the anticheat system working in this one in addition to the game being infested with cheaters if you report it you can end up being banned for false report  that is the developer itself does this so that no one else reports the suspects so as not to have the trouble to keep checking at least thats what it looks like
fifth many like me spent a lot of money on skins etc on the other game and what does the developer do throw everything in the trash if you want something buy it again in the current game so far so good its the market they have to make money etc so make decent skins same complaint as in the second topic
sixth are we playing cod or are we playing fortnite or something like that call of duty is a franchise that ive been playing since 2003 having paused only in the futuristic era of the game because in my opinion it was horrible and coming back in 2017 when they released cod wwii which was bad too but better than the futurists now in this cod even characters with superpowers have it if those weapons that kill you and turn you into pieces into lightning explode you etc now you have to deal with flying characters and the like im sorry to say but this game that in theory it was supposed to be for people over 18 this is becoming a game for people under 12 it just needs to cartoonize the scenario and you can now call it call of fortnite
finally the game has serious optimization problems it has many cheaters many grotesque bugs it is not fun like the previous one the store has practically nothing decent the devs in each update which in theory was to improve the game do the opposite and they shit on everything that worked the map is not bad but it is not good enough like the first warzone and the worst the devs do not decide which game mode to leave each week or even in the same week  the game has a different mode and for those who play in a duo they usually just get screwed play at your own risk i dont recommend

#####

bad things
servers
user interface
matchmaking
gameplay

free may be too expensive you have a life to live spend it asking for better than this

#####

never ask a man his salary a woman her age or a cod player why they play the game if they think its trash the response is a racial insult every time

this psa requires a restart

posting this here since activision is rebranding to shake off the bad pr

sbmm is creating some severe issues leading people to think there is skill based damage but it doesnt stop there the game is completely inconsistent on a technical level depending on the time of the day your shots will do a different amount of damage to ai and players theres plenty of proof if you look around online or simply play the game and experience the frustrations of these coop employee ran servers  every patch to fix bugs that i never had i then would get in the bug that the patch apparently fixed meanwhile serious bugs and hacking exists that the team closes their eyes to and they push you 20 skins

if you want to yuck it up and shoot some people play the free version and add it to your rotation of games i strongly suggest that you do not pay for this game  if you make even a reasonable wage at 20 dollars an hour youre still pissing away 3 hours of your 40 hour paycheck just to be disappointed and have another overmarketed failure replace this  not to mention any skins or battle passes are not worth the money due to the high level of issues bugs crashes and lack of transparency with the company etc 

they promised their community that they were going to break the annual cycle and let this run for two years  some folks bought the game due to the promise  turns out thats a lie and the next game will be out shortly  it was all just a ploy to get you to purchase a game that they will intentionally trash just to hype up another dumpster fire to bring in more money next year  

activision does not listen to their community nor do they care we are retention numbers a paycheck and good for their stock listing thats it  i have played cod since before many of you were alive  i have uninstalled mw2 and will not play any further cod releases in the future i was optimistic with their new approach to a cod game but once again i was let down by a company that panders to whatever makes them money

this company is in it only for your money not to create a quality game  welcome to microtransaction hell

really miss old warzone

#####

pros when this game works it can be incredibly fun and the combat can be heart pumping
the gun play feels as solid as ever and every firearm feels like it has its place

cons that being said this game is fun when it works 
this game is highly unstable crashes stutters and lag are extremely common on my otherwise capable pc

as well pay to win elements are present that being if you own the full game you get an extended 20 slots to store firearms found in raid compared to the base 10 whilst this may not seem like a very big issue it will quickly become an annoyance to have to destroy fully modded and highly capable firearms because the game simply said so this could easily be cushioned with a system in which destroying firearms and keys gives you experience but the developers clearly overlooked this as well some skins in the store are straight upgrades from base characters giving increased camouflage over freetoplay users

the developers also seen more concerned with adding new content and skins into the game rather than fixing the rampant bugs notably the bugs when loading in which characters will simply be in the floor holding your firearm or simply wont exist then there is the funny bugs in which ai enemies will simply be floating in the air like they got lessons from houdini

the ai is also very inconsistent some will notice you behind cover at 100 meters while some wont notice their friends being shot six feet behind them as well the accuracy of the ai seems to be completely random sometimes they put accurate automatic fire on you when your running in a zigzag pattern and sometimes those with shotguns manage to miss at point blank

another thing wrong here is sometimes quests are in locked rooms that require specific keys thus not allowing you to accept them this is such a basic issue that should have been caught in development once again developer complacency

this point isnt much of a critique as it is a petpeeve of mine but this series continues the trend of giving firearms a random name to avoid paying fees to licence them while this isnt a big issue it compiles on top of the other issues to show that this isnt the project of love it is claimed to be but instead another cod cash grab

in short this is a game i wish so desperately to love but clearly the developers wish otherwise

edit yeah they added literal pay to win skins which give free bonuses for nothing yeah fuck activision

#####

this game was amazing in 2020early 2021 since then buravensoftwareu has been ruiningchanging it and taking things awayb and here we are with them being involved in warzone 2

h11 bthey ruined the mapbh1
took away bverdanskb  brought bcalderab  which killed battleroyal  made rebirth island popular 2 years after release where majority only played resurgance resurgance had permanent full playlist isolos duos trios quadsi prior it was 2 per week

h12 bthey ruined ttkbh1
where smgs can kill you within 165250ms human blink is 400ms a bithrowing knifeib insta kill a fully armored enemy from chest up but a sniper thats heavier than lmg which ads slow bneeds 3 headshotsb
list
certain smgs did more damage per bullet than snipers neckshots
certain heavy 50cal snipers literally needed 79 bodyshots
smgs  ars can shoot further than snipers with higher bullet velocity iyes even smgsi ravensoftware gun balancelist

h13 bthey ruined basic game movementsbh1
you ran faster holding vg ar than you do with fists  yes picking up an assault rifle sometimes meant that you now run faster than the guy without a heavy weapon or any weapon at all

h14 bthey ruined attachmentsbh1
theyve created bugs that were never fixed for 3 years on their bitrelloibstrikei too many to lististrike 
all whilst giving us 0 comments 0 explanation 0 eta for a fix if any would ever come as plenty stayed broken to this day

h15 bthey ruined camosbh1
bfree camos used to look way betterb
theyve historically purposely changed free camos that we earned through grinding camo challenges to look worse as time goes uthe same camosu from 20202021 ugot changed to be worse in animation  sometimes 80 less gun coverageu in 2022  a cheap way to promote store bundles even more

h16 boverbuffed aimassistbh1
aa works like aimbot through smoke stun goes to the next opponent when you kill the first one reaction time faster than humanely possible can 100 accurately predict movements so no point trying to go left  right the player wont be thrown off unlike mouse  keyboard plenty of mk streamers switched to controller after this  see point #10 for more

h17 buextremely stubbornubh1 
there are tweets that have gotten 200k likes ton of #1 reddit trending threads esports articles polls videos etc bdemanding snipers headshots to be backb it gets ignored where some snipers sit at 003 pickrate  we see positive metrics  snipers are in a healthy usage

in 2021 there were celeberties tweeting nerf dmr which ravensoftware broke people held signs on the streets at intersection saying nerf dmr they were still defending it saying theyve seen positive metrics same words theyre using for snipers headshots nerf

its okay to be innovative try new things change stuff around but to be completely stubborn in denial  completely neglect your community is why this game got mostly negative reviews

bsteam reviews in a way exposed the yesmen pages  actually reflected the community overall feelingsb

h18 bcompletely disconnected from the communitygame  only focus on 1s streamersbh1
a small tweet from a random influencer can get something changed but an outrage on reddittwitter esports articles etc for 10 months is ignored

bgave streamers anticheat bypassb  easy lobby priorities although plenty of them were very suspicious with a known bad record of being ucheatbanned multiple times in multiple gamesu fortnite apex etc iinfact many of them came to warzone as they were banned on those gamesi b if theyre not cheating why do they need anticheat whitelistb

often limit gamemodes to quads only not everyone is a streamer with 4x squad party

h19 bhorrible gun balance  in warzone 1 weve had over 200 guns from 3 cod gamesbh1
yet 12 guns at most were whats used of each category ravensoftware are the worst when it comes to bgun balanceb

some snipers literally had 003 unused pickrate and they were nerfed further whilst ars that are on top gets heavy buffs for some reason theyre always antisnipers

bbreak a gun  sell bundles for it  nerf in 2 months  repeatb

please see bpoint #6b above
mwii codnext release was ustricly controller onlyu mk streamers had to use controller a month prior on their stream to get ready for the event as everyone was forced to use one
mwii camos bui menu originally could only be accessed through controller or keyboard arrow keysb yes even the menu the mouse cursor did nothing on a 70 game in 2023
bforced crossplayb
bincreased visual recoilnoise mk users might need attachments to reduce themb where controllers aimassist works through them effortlessly without any attachments to the gun

bthe only scenario pc mk users dont have a disadvantage over aimassist is sniping at long rangeiwhere aimassist isnt as opi where in wz1 that got aimassist range limited wz2 sniping headshot completely goneblist

thats why mwii is more balanced than warzone 2

thats why with ravensoftwares influence warzone 2 got the same changes  nerfs theyve done in warzone 1 is now here in warzone 2 ie snipers cant headshot but smgs can kill you faster than blink

bwarzone 2 wouldve been better if they kept it to infinity ward how it was in 2020b look what happened to warzone 1 look where the game was  how it became thanks to ravensoftware  the more they are in charge warzone pacific

ravensoftware own employees have boycotted  protested and went on strikes before as decisions are often made without qa and few execs call the shot for millions of players such as caldera

uif they hadnt updated warzone 1 for 3 years the game wouldve been 100x times better and warzone 2 wouldnt even be neededu
hrhr

h1factsh1
majority came to mwii  warzone 2 as they loved the old warzone 1 and hoped warzone 2 would bring that back as ravensoftware killed the first one

to go from the bbest selling numbers in cod history is very telling after vanguardb and to bthe lowest warzone numbersb is also telling when uyouve got all the hype sales support  numbersu but your studios are disconnected from the community

warzone 2 needs to copy everything warzone 1 had in late 2020  ravens influence to vanish men lie women lie numbers  stats dont

ithose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat iti

#####

tells me to purchase modern warfare ii even though i am only trying to play warzone and i was allowed to play one match before this happened

#####

imagine buying a dlc for mwii labeled as a mwiii which allegedly is a premium title _

an acquaintance of mine who worked at activision has shown me proof that activision had 0 plans of releasing a premium title until 2024 screenshots of a powerpoint presentation with their road map had a lot of details in it about what was going to be release and in what quarter of the year up until q4 of 2024 iirc none of the slides on it detailed a full premium title release in 2023 it did include a dlc for a zombies mode though hmmmm i cant share pictures in hopes to maintain this persons privacy but you can believe me when i tell you they were planning on releasing zombies and mw 2 original maps as dlcs but instead mashed it into one big dlc in 16 months wonder if they just used their base game to speed up this process hmmmmm and slapped premium title on it to pile up some more money into their profit margins

i dont know if you noticed but all the maps from the original mw 2 is all that is in this new premium title if you use your brain it is common sense that mw iii was supposed to be nothing but a dlc for mw ii which already is the game they intended in remaking that they released as a full game to suck money out of the fools who hang on to the strand of hope that cod will one day be great again like it once was in their memory 

keep your money and maybe it will make these sht publishers and whack developers listen to the consumer no one with a brain wants to buy your dlc for 70 you can suck my c0ck activision sht company with even shttier solicitude for their community greedy f#cks

#####

this game is prime example of a company experimenting with stupid people by pushing boundries of how much of an unfinished game they can release until people stop paying ridiculous amounts of money for overpriced skins and yet people are still paying 100 for some trashy skin and then they wonder why each year cod is worse this game is like rotten food it makes you sick avoid like plague

pros  racial slurs and bomb threats

cons  activition

makes me input my phone number in order to play why
makes me log into my activision account in order to play
tells me that i my old display name that was perfectly okay in warzone 1 is not aloud and forces me to change my display name
try changing my display name and it tells me that i dont have any tokens to change my display name
have to troubleshoot on the web and find out that you have to go to activisions website log into your account and change your display name there
finally jump through all these hoops try relaunching the game and it doesnt load up it just goes to black screen
troubleshoot to no avail tried reinstalling the game three times tried updating my drivers nothing works
said screw it and gave up

the game is trash and i didnt even get to play it yet

my name is walter hartwell white i live at 308 negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico 87104 this is my confession if youre watching this tape im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my 50th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didnt know where to turn
eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000 upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but im a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for 3 months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i cant take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is

the only winning move is not to play

nothing in life is free you either shell out the cost of a modest grocery haul for a mostly unfinished game with menus inspired by powerpoint slides or you settle for a free sliver of the whole experience little did you remember we live in a society so you still have a debt to pay not in the form of some useless fiat paper but in that most elusive currency that compounds in value with every day even as your cache grows smaller and smaller  time

watch as your most near and dear asset spews forth from the warzone wound hemorrhaging like a crimson red water fountain into the abyss of subpar video game development some might desperately try to reclaim that precious lifeblood  a foolhardy attempt after the game crashes my computer on boot for the 7th time i opt to let the good times flow and waste even more of that juicy temporal goodness by writing this crap

so heres to the eternal purge of good things and the subsequent foff ginormous conglomerates that make it happen we salute you

peace among worlds

initially i bought call of duty for 6v6 because i never liked warzone 10 but found myself bored of 6v6 relatively quickly not long after a few friends of mine convinced me to play quads with them and so i did and i loved it it is fun when it works which is almost never warzone 2 in the sense that it is played is a lot more fun for me than warzone 10 ever was and i think the map is genuinely better in a lot of ways though of course it could do with some improvement

however and this is why i am giving this a negative review the game is completely broken both warzone and 6v6 if i could go back in time i would not give activision blizzard a single  

some of the bugs present in warzone are as following 

 disconnected from steam happens at least 25 times in a few hours session  very annoying bug that almost always in my case anyways happens when you are doing well in the game and stand a chance of winning regardless super annoying and the fact that it has not been adressed yet is outrageous 

 dev error 657  no idea what this is but it pops up about as frequently as you get the aforementioned crashdisconnect it usually also happens to everyone in the party at the same time and you need to back out and try again another annoying bug

 the looting is completely broken and bugged out the wazoo impossible to grab loot and often times you find yourself having to position yourself in a very neat manner in order to get the f to pickup prompt annoying as hell and have been the cause of my death a few times at least 

 servers are horrible rubber banding lagging high ping all normal and frequent 

 hit registration is awful damage is clearly not tracked properly 

 pc performance is shte stutters on even high end hardware optimisation is sorely needed 

 recon drone is bugged sometimes if you use the drone once finished you are unable to leave the camera position and rendered stuck 

 npcs keep spawning in ridiculous numbers after completing the stronghold basically constantly ticking damage on you 

 hud disappears after using airstrikes 

honestly the list is endless if i really wanted it to be but tldr the game is fun when it works but really bad when it is bad the potential is without a doubt there and because of the fact that warzone is free i will hold my tongue but i highly highly recommend that you do not spend a single buck on this game be it in the form of battle pass operators or the full game the fact that a billion dollar company that allegedly worked on this game for 3 years with more than 3000 developers and then it releases like this is unfathomable for me the sheer audacity to release skins and bundles but not hotfixes for the game that is in dire need of it is just proof that they could not give a single toss about the state of the game so long as people keep buying cdl power ranger skins

my friend who i play call of duty warzone with said if i post a review on call of duty warzone and it gets 100 likes and 100 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here

#####

as much as i want to like the game and i was very generous by waiting until season 2 was released there are still some glaring flaws this game has unfortunately and it still has not been fixed properly

game crashing bugs not just for me but for friends i played with random crashes sometimes at that
there was an instance where i could not launch the game at all turns out it was because i overclocked by gpu and it would not run until i either
a set the timings and clock speeds back to stock or 
b underclockundervolt my gpu that was already trying to run this game at 1440p for more than 144 fps no i do not need more than that usually especially for another problem ill bring up but its one of those things i would like to utilized based on what i paid for both the gpu and the game i bought the actual title this review is just for warzone 20

lighting bugs
fixed for now had an issue where the lighting would either be too bright to look at certain objects to having an unwanted psychedelic effect or will darken the environment in a certain area with limited lighting to the point of going pitch black when going inside of a building
random shooting range bug where you cannot ads correctly it will appear a giant bullet will go into the optic
blueprint being saved bug this is known but hopefully it will be fixed soon whereas some blueprints were wiped from players profiles that were saved

and now some core gameplay mechanic issues unfortunately it is a lot

matchmaking experience can be harsh andor unfair can engage in a gunfight two players have the same gun player a initiates the gun fight inputting the same amount of bullets if not more than player b who is able to win said gunfight majority of the time feels as though player a has been either shadowbanned or ricochetd when that player has a positive score the previous games this is more apparent when both players have the same amount of armor on and hit around the same parts of the body somehow player b will come out on top despite them taking in 3 bullets already

footstep sounds not playing when someone is moving behind me moving including walking running andor tactile sprinting it is amazing how loud footsteps can be for the enemy to hear me or my teammates but not so loud when they run this also includes when another player parachutes before landing

launchers not performing consistent damageblast radius this is infuriating when someone is able to survive an rpg blast to the face one launcher that seems to be consistent is the jokr however the major and obvious drawback is that youll need to spend 10 second for it to lock onto an area or vehicle launch and hit the target

weapon balancing has gotten worse before the two meta guns in season one dominated which were the rpk and the fennec 45vector the rpk is an lmg that for some reason can outgun a sniper rifle weapons that excel in long range engagement in a game mode that can have you dealing with long range gunfights maybe 35 of the time and while the rpk is not as strong as it was in season one it still is being used and abused with its ttk
the vectorfennec on the other hand has received a nerf but not as much as it deserves it shoots way faster than the tick rate of their servers could even fathom to support but that will not stop players who will hose an unfortunate victim in a second like the ttk as others mentioned it is very short basically zero theres a video out there that analyzed how fast the fennec could kill someone within a third of a second it was ridiculously fast and it honest is still as fast compared to other guns
the game is not fun when you are using or fighting someone using two guns out of 59 weapons in the game more than half the time it dulls the experience leaving it up to rng if all of your shots hit based on what the server thinks there are 57 other weapons in the game i would like to use without me being shunned by the games weapon balance logic they barely touched those two guns but either buffed some other guns slightly or nerfed significantly i tend to use marksman rifles a lot if not some fast shooting guns 

i tried the m13b it is no where near the m13 in modern warfare 2019 while it can shoot fast it feels too weak and not as accurate or can have much recoil control as the m13 could have in mw2019

the lms which seems to be the fal in this game is not as good as it was season one it may have been the minimal damage added to armor but it does not feel as strong as it did in season one i cannot speak for the other two semiauto marksman rifles since they added minimum damage against armor but am not sure if that exists for the spr or sab from what i know and can imagein i dont believe both of those have minimum damage against armor

they buffed the lachmann 762 in terms of semiauto but nerfed it for full auto engagement in close range engagements this has taken a hit in terms of damage and frankly i feel as though it was an unnecessary change along with the lms 
the balancing has gotten so bad that i had a moment of acceptance whenever i would get turned into swiss cheese by a vector like how could i be mad about a gun that just shoots more faster than the game would allow

server reliabilityperformance is not as good as it could be i believe i saw somewhere the servers were 20 tick in a game where theres up to 150 players fighting in different parts of the map let alone if they were using a gun that was not the fennec that does not bode well if i have high hopes i hid behind cover as someone shot me three times at least on my screen it looks like in the recordings and i get downed and need to be revived because someone curved a bullet around a concrete wall

inconsistent map geometry hindering movement some areas of the map will have a strange or incomplete collision detection whereas my teammate may get stuck in a window and cannot move at all or on the resurgence island a pond in the village area will not allow someone to start walking back on surface despite the physical geometry portraying that one can stand up on land again

random timeoutslosing server connection as i mentioned before the server does not relay consistent connection which i may understand that it can happen to anyone at any time but for some strange reason i see a pattern where it happens when i start having fun going positive with kills and then the game decides to kick me or lose my connection

sniping is not apparent in this game as i mentioned above an lmg can outgun a sniper the only way to make snipers viable is to follow it up immediately with another weapon notably by a teammate since switching to a gun that can shoot that far if you are sniping long range could take longer than you have to survive taking 34 rpk bullets i started using the signal50 by the end of season one it seemed fun to use but of course the moment it starts to be recognized it receives a nerf the movement speed and sprint speed has been reduced which like another sniper change in another fps but they also reduced its range for a sniper rifle

the last but certain not least one more issue that doesnt seem like anyone is really trying to prevent or remove from the game are the cheaters this game is the easiest platform for cheaters to run rampant and there is little to absolutely zero punishment or action done against the actual cheaters of the game none at all that ive seen or for those i play this game with for every match that i played with friends at least one of us will run into a cheater and then following suit another one of us will may or may not run into the same cheater why are we put in lobbies with cheaters is it because weve gotten 10 kills in one match therefore we must be cheating

since this game still feels unfinished this review is not finishe

no optimization

no one is going to read this so i have a tiny cock and my wife is going to leave me

the warzone experience 
takes forever to load into match
driving around the map
accidentally go out of bounds
gives you two seconds to go back to the map
not fast enough to get back into the map
you die
have to wait again to get into new match
shoot a couple guys
get banned
thanks activision for wasting my storage space and my time

my friend went from 120fps to 6070fps

#####

you will spend 15 minutes installing updates and clicking through menus until you finally get to play the game once youre playing the game you quickly realize you have to grind for countless hours just to get the weapons to be competitive once you get those weapons it doesnt matter because the other players with aim bots will ruin the game for you ive never been so unimpressed by a game

very bad game to be honest warzonw 10 was great and verdansk was one of the best masp ever but warzone 20 is a terrible too much similar looking loot  sometimes it is hard to uderstand what you need to get too many cheaters desynchronizations and bugs

example from my latest game gulag fight we have same weapons i managet to get behind enemy and started to fire first at him suddenly he instantly turn to me shoots after i put half of the mag in him and kills me first from the ame weapon and on killkem he just shot me in the hand not even in the head seriously

do not play this game fine a better mmo game  there is a plenty of them and for the christ sake do not but anything from premium store  i had many bundles for warzone 10 and now all of it is gone forever so do not put any money here totally not worth it

#####

shaders lag a frustrating hitch

verse 2
into warzones tab a demand to hitch
more gigs required a storage switch

uninstalled it all my final twitch

loved the part where captain price says give my regards to your wallet really moved me to uninstall the game

#####

played for not even 2 hours got 10 kills in one plunder match got shadow banned complete trash

#####

if youve spent any money on this game you are an idiot

#####

i really like the game play for this game but i find some of the things the devs do incredibly annoying

the major thing is never having constant playlists of solos duos trios and quads for battle royale like i want to play duos or trios with my buddies on al mazra and then the option for the mapmode we want is gone we all have jobs and we cant play this all the time together and it just aggravates me when we all are available this happens

the map rotation thing is a start which helps make all the mapsmodes available and i appreciate it but it isnt enough especially when the option for the trio or duo playlist in battle royale is completely gone

i feel i have barely played warzone on al mazra compared to verdansk and caldera which is a major shame as i love al mazra this made me spend the vast majority of my time playing multiplayer in mw2

this is also a major reason why i plan to hold off on mw3

#####

very fun i really like dmz gamemode


#####

go fuck yourself activision

#####

got shadow banned after one good game on solos
was mass reported for sure 15 ppl watching
now i have to wait days to get unbanned
meanwhile true cheaters are roaming free

negative review until this dogshit system is fixed its only hurting good players

edit 
the ban got predictably lifted because ive never used cheats on any multiplayer game not even as a kid much less as an adult 

you need to treat your customers better ill change this to positive when we get a real anticheat  richochet clearly isnt working if you have to resort to these kind of dirty tactics

#####

expected it to be way worse considering the mostly negative reviews but the truth is gamers like to whine too much the game is fine not too bad not too great

#####

the positives
i enjoy the ai part of the game i think that ai should provide better loot and more money i like the gun attachments when building a class proximity chat is also a great feature finally i also like how the zone closes into small circles that conjoin at the end

the negatives
the looting system is horrendous a small portion of the loot gets stuck inside the wall or you have to put your screen in an awkward position to have the opportunity to pick up the weapon device or shield this could be a problem that i am just having but the crashing massive stuttering problems and server problems are pretty annoying  we have run into multiple hackers using aimbot the gulag system is terrible i get so many teammates that do not seem like real people the gulag should go back to the original state of a 1v1 if they decide to keep it a 2v2 they should make sure to prioritize people on the same team instead of putting us with a random person the last problem that i have with the game is the audio my footsteps are extremely loud i usually cannot hear the enemy players if im stomping around
 
my personal opinion
at the current state of the game i do not recommend it thanks for coming to my tedtalk

i would recommend this game only for dmz its some of the most fun ive had in cod since mw3 think of it as an arcadey escape from tarkov going solo is really rough but if you run duos or trios its a ton of fun out of my maybe 10 or so extractions since starting last week most players ive come across have been fairly friendly there have been a few times when trying to extract other squads have showed up but overall its been an extremely positive experience

as for warzone itself im not a fan of brs i know there can be fairly toxic players in them that are just looking to ruin other players fun now that im older i play games to enjoy myself not to frustrate others so i avoid it

overall i would only recommend this just for playing dmz i highly recommend giving it a go with some friends

#####

i understand my opinion is kind of contraditory to most peoples opinion but here it is
i really liked the way season 1 was going not that fenzy all the time for the slower players it was waaay better than it is now on season 2 now it feels everything is 2x faster than before i understand battle royale players like to kill 50 enemies players in one match and like to no quick 360 scope players and like to cancel slide and to be always faster than ever but dmz players just want to have fun killing ai e doing mission and contracts and sometimes having gunfights with real players so i think battle royale and dmz should not use the same speed mechanics and movement let slower players have fun on dmz and competitive players kill themselves in battle royale

this review is 2 days after the season 2 release date

if you are not a student living with your mom have some respect for yourself and dont spend your hard earned money or your ever decreasing spare time playing this unfinished repetitive glitched sheisse  i managed to play it for a good time just because i was playing it with my brother

#####

the game wont start

#####

i even cant enter the game

#####

i like screaming so people cant hear


#####

when warzone 20 came out i really had some fun with it it was a bit slower than the first warzone and that was good and the game feel overall was cool the game had some highsin the last year and i really liked the haunting 2023 event as it felt like a breath of fresh air to do some new things on those maps and those skins on the 6th season pass were pretty dope

that being said i dont really think i can recommend this game anymore almost everything it does theres another game that does better fortnite is a better br even if i dont like it that much dmz is just a bland tarkovhunt ripoff and so on theres always a new meta gun with broken damage that leaves anyone whos not using it with a clear disadvantage at the time i write this review that weapon is lockwood 300 theres always a new skin that gives you some kind of advantage for being harder to see at this momment is gaia which at least is on the season pass and it really shows that activision puts more effort on microtransaction and dumb skins than actually delivering new content and ballancing weaponsmechanics

i try to jump back in when they release a new season just to feel bored by the middle of it and it had been that way since cod vanguard even opening the game so i can complete my battle pass is a chore cause they open that horrid mw3 which i did not even bought so i can click on warzone to just then close mw3 and open wz i mean what the hell activision blizzard keep going with that crap over and over again always testing the patience for their players it was that way with overwatch 2 diablo 4 and even wow

funny enough i remember that fairly recently i had a great experience with call of duty when everyone was locked on their homes in 20202021 i had a blast with black ops cold war so i tried to play bocw again and im having a blast with it again the curation of the multiplayer maps is top notch outbreak made me have fun with zombies mode for the first time ever and the campaign although a bit on the short side was really well done and there was that dead ops arcade too which i never really played that much nowadays you buy cod and get a campaign with missions that seems like a dmz without pvp on recicled maps from warzone 1 and a multiplayer with neckbreaking movement speed on uninspired maps it is really hard to grind that battle pass when every option you have to do it is crap

go play something else
 if you want to scratch that multiplayer itch try to download an older cod that you liked back in the day i had no problems finding matches on bocw and i live in south america also titanfall 2 mp is back and you can play that from ea playgame pass or even buy it for a pretty low price
 if you like dmz premiss because of its extraction shooter elements although theres no other free option im aware of i would recommend you give a try to hunt showdown escape from tarkov or even dark and darker
 if your thing is battle royale well we all know that fortnite is the better one on the market right now and bloodhunt is not dead yet so it might be cool giving it a try while you can

thats all folks until the next glimmer of sanity at activision dev teams i would keep a safe distance from this franchise

#####

played for 20 miunutes then got shadowbanned for a week awesome game 010 will never play again

go fuck yourself activision

please dont buy this shit it sucks ass

big news i farted while playing

#####

the game is fun when it works i have to downloadinstalloptimize shaders every single time i start the game back up which is fairly often since the installation of said shaders stalls every other time i need to do anything with them on top of that the game also resets its volume in my volume mixer every time i restart meaning that i get flashbanged by the mw2 cutscene quite often optimization is also fairly terrible for a game that recommends only a 1060 i get 90 frames on low settings with a 3070 on 1440p between the random crashes bugs and horrible hulu ui just wait until they get their stuff together before wasting hours trying to get the game to work

#####

it would be nice to be allowed to play if you just have an old proven steam account

big men big guns no buns no fun 

#####

played on battlenet have like 23 hours in game
id like to applaud the developers for making one of the biggest disappointments of a game ive ever played
i went into it with an open mind and excitement given the og warzone was a fluid ridiculous joy to play the weapons managed to feel clean and useable the vehicles were goofy and enjoyable a bit floaty but they were easy to use and fit the theme of the game the ui was clean simple and extremely useable ironic that a game series notorious for reusing the same assets managed to break what clearly didnt need fixing
the servers could be generously described as held together with prayer duct tape and a spiderman toy my game crashed and i had to spend the next 25 minutes trying to rejoin to play with my friends the servers broke twice while playing with friends and we spent longer in queue for the brand new cod game than we did playing pubg squads last night
look for the firing range button then compare the size of that to everything else on the menu ive never seen a ui thats so cluttered and manages to hide nearly everything useful the game treats you like youre sincerely braindead with tips popping up everywhere i know the original half life 2 tunnels showed us that some players are capable of going down a looping path forever but my god this is a  menu i honestly cannot get over how much they managed to screw that up too its a menu not a 2004 strategy game i seriously cannot believe there isnt just a hard warzone screen which it automatically takes you tothis cod hq stuff is horrendous
so ive never had a more difficult time actually getting into a party in any game including the time i tried to play an obscure coop puzzle game with someone that had literally never played a video game before besides connectivity issues the game straight up wouldnt allow us to join each other or invite one another
start of game voice chat i have heard hell and it is the overwhelming cluster of 150 voices screeching incoherently and just making as much noise as possible i love start of game  as much as the next person but this was just the sound thatll greet you when you die military interrogators could replace white noise sirens and the sounds of women screaming and babies crying with an 8 second clip of pregame screeches and resistance to interrogation would crumble
i cant believe that pubg a game released almost 6 years ago is absolutely crushing the voip game by actually giving proximity chat meaning if youre in x range you may as well be talking to your mate on discord how is pubg corp beating actibliz here
also starting voice chat by default at 100 in a game series notorious for having screeching going back at least a decade to the original modern warfare is without a doubt one of the cruellest design decisions ive ever heard i havent heard noises like that outside of a mental hospital
vehicles
so compared to warzone 1 they are much heavier your average 4 seat car has the same weight as an uparmoured truck on any other game i blasted off a mountain and the car tyres blew out wow realism in cod who woulda seen that coming i honestly have no idea what will destroy a car and what wont or whats okay and what isnt its great that theyve innovated from the original lmao vehicles go brr but this is just a violent overcorrection
some of the new features are cool but they fly in the face of the realism given by having disparate unique functional parts of the car you can have a playershaped hood ornament but by  you better not go too high off a mountain
the game has an absurd ttk and in usual cod tradition some weapons are just objectively better all good but ive never seen a game feel so clunky yet so fast paced the weapons manage to feel impactful and feel like bb guns at the same time in combat i felt like i was being fed an iv drip of fentanyl and high grade amphetamine at random intervals
i could go on but fundamentally this game mode is broken with every design decision that could be made the servers are garbage the actual gameplay loop is about as unsatisfying as it gets in a battle royale and from the bottom of my heart go play pubg or apex legends

this game is an absolute disgrace

#####

terrible game enjoy getting traced thru walls everygame performance is horrid do you want to play restart simulator download warzone todayyyy

#####

call of duty welcome to warzone 20 the massive freetoplay combat arena

also call of duty warzone 20 is not available you need to buy call of duty modern warfare ii

#####

battle royals are poison for the gaming community

#####

dmz alone is worth it ignore all the haters

#####

i hate warzone but also dmz is super fun and you need to download this for that you should its like really fun
also wowzers most of the reviews here are sort of funny to read so i hope this one brings some g i g g l e s 

reasons why people have left a negative review
controller players have aim bot
this game is so poorly optimised
this is nothing like classic call of duty

first point
have any of those people played on controller clearly not because at least from my experience back on my xbox playing black ops 3 it really only benefited those who learning how it tracks youre playing on a mouse and keyboard you have a very clear advantage to the person whos fiddling away on their joystick

second point
this is a game that is primarily developed for ps5 and xbox series x im sorry to inform you but if you dont have more then 4gb of vram youre going to need to turn down some settings to make the game work for you i dont have like a rtx 3090 or anything just a 1660 super so with 6gb of vram game runs at 60 fps on medium settings it will be 60fps on high but do to how the water is rendered it takes quite a lot of processing power which will make you have frame drops to 40fps or so my friend and i were playing earlier and he has a 1050 ti with 4gb of vram most games ive seen him play he usually can manage a consistent fps on the lowest settings and once again according to him it was all good i believe him mainly cause we dropped quite a few kills 
tldr have 46gb or higher and the game will run fine for you

final point
the amount of these that i have seen baffles me people understand that the whole gaming market has shifted and become a lot more corporate youre playing a freetoplay call of duty battle royale i wonder why you cant seem to find that classic call of duty youre looking for team death match and other old modes are locked behind the actual game mw2 this version of the game is a battle royale and a game mode similar to escape from tarkov youre not going to get youre search and destroy memories or getting a nuclear in multiplayer will only happen if you actually buy the game yes the price is crazy im canadian so over here its 90 for the standard version which is a lot since aaa games are getting more expensive because of the demand 

i thought i hated call of duty i mean i still like to think that i do but honestly the gameplay in this game feels great and the gunplay feels even better just try it use this as a demo for what the full game is if you like the gameplay and want more of it or need your team deathmatch fix then scroll down because i bet mw2 will be at the bottom where it recommends games lol

#####

trash company with trash practices

#####

lagging servers and to many cheaters also they type freely in game chat their contact info for whoever wants to buy cheats infinity ward and activision are focusing on bundles skins and battle passes to put in shop for people to buy than actually focusing on the game stability

#####

im really enjoying the game  yes its a bit buggy yes the menu is horrible yes the game stutters randomly  but hey its free and at this price im having a lot of fun 

#####

i love playing stop motion warzone 3fps and lagging every 2 seconds is my favorite way to play why was this game made in 3 seconds i get out of a vehicle and my weapons are just gone great game

#####

you have been disconnected from steam this message popped up during the match very nice thanks game

#####

too much cheaters and bugs dont recommend this piece of

#####

the looting system is really bad more than half of the time ill end up picking up a completely different thing than what im looking at if you kill someone and they drop their backpack nearby gg to all the loot thats around because youll only be able to open the backpack

#####

got shadowbanned because i got 10 kills in warzone

#####

literally the worst warzonecod i have every played not balance aim assist is completely broken terrible ui just horrible

#####

i played long time ago i will download again too get cancer


#####

earlier i used to be a racist im still racist infact im a multilingual racist now

#####

the game says its free but it costs your dignity and will to live it also has a shit ton of micro transactions and it also forces mwii down your throat practically forcing you to buy it dont forget poor optimization

#####

wz1 was better

#####

the moment you leave a match in dmz all the valuables and cash youve looted immediately turn into generic call of duty experience points where in other extraction shooters youd amass cash and expreputation and improve your gear and weapon build in dmz your weapon build is your main modern warfare 2 multiplayer loadout from the base game

which means the best way to progress in dmz is to not play dmz
it blows it makes the looting pointless it makes extracting pointless in most cases hell it makes the entire mode almost completely pointless
its a shame because the pve options actually look interesting and diverse but theres no reason to do them cause theres no reason to even play the mode

#####

i like to play destiny 2 and apex

no one is going to read this review so i want to confess that i am gay 

#####

 servers are tr4h and unstable 20hz below
 easy to get spam reported then got shadowbanned loop by salty players even thou the ingame account level is high played since beta with this acc
 really tank the cpu hard and poor performance this does make me upgrading pc
 dmz is a mistake now got some p2w skins
 aimassist is strong af by people who can abuse it 
 not fun as warzone 1

the good thing about this warzone 2 only the map design and slightly better than bf2042


#####

why fucking bother

youre literally playing what was supposed to be a finished game released on to the main game as testing grounds for this garbage same formula same angry people and unfun experience ui matchmaking youre not gonna enjoy this game 6080 of the time

rather you play something more enjoyable and actually gives you the satisfaction for your gameplay

#####

13 files are missing my ass every time i try to play this game it literally crashes and says to verify file integrity
any help is appreciated

#####

not much fun poorly optimized

#####

010 oneshot sniper rifles
010 footstep sounds
010 frames per second
1010 autoaim gamepad players
99910 ms ping servers
i cant recommend this piece of shit

#####

eh its meh 

too many micro transactions get nickelndimed at every turn 
constant updates of multiple gigabytes worth seemingly of fluff
optimizations could be much better 

really miss the ole days of buying a video game getting a full product with cosmetics that were unlockable from skill and achieving things instead of skill of wallet

crashing simulator

#####

ive been shadowbanned in this game for getting too many kills i cannot queue with friends anymore since there arent enough cheaters playing the game rip me for buying the battlepass that i can no longer progress in you would think such a system wouldnt be in place after the new world fiasco

httpsyoutube9dmtjycsop8

edit aim assist too strong mouse and keyboard players suffer cant get anywhere past the initial drop due to basically aimbot

#####

play any other game in your library  i promise this game is worse even if your only other game is bf2042

#####

 horrible menu
 insanely low ttk
 footsteps are practically nonexistent
 horrible looting system
 some of the best random player interaction ive had in a game in years feels like vintage cod lobbies

could be a ton of fun but goddamn it is frustrating

feels like pubg mobile

#####

unplayable due to cheaters

horrible game and structure required phone number for a video game are you serious

not fun what so ever especially if youre a beginner all you can except is spawn get killed spawn again and get killed again

cod players will bitch about anything until we feel nostalgic after a year or two warzone 1 was just as shit

the devs of the game are probably kiddy diddlers and they sexually harass female employees and worst of all they censored the word ram ranch in the text chat

#####

i am extremely disappointed with this game ive been hyped ever since they basically destroyed warzone 1 with caldera and updates no one had ever asked for
ive played this game for like 2hours and it has a lot of serious problems  mainly
 terrible audio you cant hear anyone footsteps are awful
 bugged looting system especially when there are many weapons lying on the ground 
 bots are a terrbile addition because they can be easily mistaken for other players since visibility in this game is also way worse in comparison to warzone 1
 spotting enemies is really hard for some reason
 new gulag is a terrible idea
 in my opinion game looks worse than warzone 1 and is poorly optimialized 
 getting your loadout is too complicated
 at least from my experience money is very scarce which makes respawning teammates very long which isnt fun for anyone
 proximity chat is frustrating i know many people enjoy it and i respect that it gets really annoying when you hear random enemies giving calls and then all of a sudden you hear all sorts of offensive stuff i know you can turn it off but for some reason turning only proximity chat off is only available in multiplyer whilst playing warzone 2  you have to turn off entire voice chat which makes communicating with your random teammates impossible or i simply dont know how to do it
 movement is basically handicapped waaaay to slow 
 servers are trash 
 simple animations such as grabbing stuff are bugged

#####

damn i used to love this game and dont get me wrong i still like it but its not the same anymore i didnt want to believe all the negative stuff the people said when this game was released but now that i have been playing it for half a year the flaws are all beginning to come to my eyes i wish i could say that its a great game its well made and i have a ton of respect for the infinity ward animation team but its just not as good anymore i have also niticed my performance in terms of fps going down drastically i am still going to select that i recommend this game because i really do like i said its well made and all but for me everything except dmz is just not fun anymore
