this game is one of my favourite games of all time but i regret it ive logged a lot of hours and will probably continue doing so but at great cost this game cost me 100 to support it i was aware of the introduction to the premium shop but i was unaware of the false promises of the devs a quest was released for 20 which takes about 2 hours of overall play time to finish the devs have promised that gameplay would not be locked behind a paywall but they not only broke that promise they charged 10 an hour for players that have all paid to support this game the prices in the premium shop are far higher than most other games of this genre and despite a petition and constant complaints on their socials they have stayed completely silent ignoring the people that have paid to test this game which is already greedy of the company there are so many game breaking bugs that half the player base cant even play the game this is another promise broken by the devs they said that they would prioritise game play and clean user experiences over earning money but their game is broken their customer service is atrocious and theyve ignored everything ive ever sent them requesting aid for bugs its a really great game but the companys greed is running it into the ground before it has even released the company has lost the goodwill of the players and people are leaving in droves i will never buy another game run by gameloft i wish i didnt buy this one turns out i couldnt afford it

#####

i played this so much compared to other games and loved how relaxing it was i was not a big fan of the microtransaction system because even though most of it is purely cosmetic the tokens also opens for special quest that you otherwise miss out on i was okay with it in the beginning as it was supposed to be freetoplay after it came out of early access but now you have to buy the game buy tokens to get access to everything on top of that they launched a dlc as soon as it was out of early access which is also very expensive it is an extremely greedy move and i definitly wished i had not spend money buying it in the first place please stay away from the game to avoid financing big greedy studios that do not care about their consumers

#####

as a 34 year old male this game finally gives me the ability to live out my dream of being a disney princess

#####

as a man who just turned 30 i believe i am the target demographic for this game

pure vibes

#####

im so disappointed disney this game had such potential to be a 55 even with the minor gameplay issues  
first you turn on your promise to make it a f2p game which means all of us should be automatically refunded right since what we wanted to support was the development of a free game  
second you start hiding customisation options in a game mostly about customisation behind battle passes but i was still going to accept this because passes can be the way to fund a free game but now it is not free so clearly you dont need the pass right you should make all those options automatically a part of the base game  
then you decide to add actual dlc that costs 30 bucks are you insane the cost of a full game to add something that should be already part of a game that was supposed to be free and it is not hello  

either you make the game free with a paid pass and dlc or you make the game cost 50 and include the full game this is just the most extremely basic of the basic what are you doing shame on you

#####

am i a disney fan no
do i have kids no
am i over 40 yes
am i totally enjoying myself more than i should be at my age yes
thats all folks oh wait

#####

i bough this game for my wife to play on my laptop she has since bought a laptop and her own copy of the game to play

i wanted to uninstall it i really did but i had to see what all the fuss was about

donald is my friend now i would kill for him

please take this game away from me

#####

after 75 hours i have finally completed all there is to this game which is an incredible amount of content for an early access game i really hesitated to play this game but after being massively letdown by another game id been looking forward to for years i decided to give this one a try to hopefully fill the sour taste the other game left in my mouth and it definitely didnt disappoint let me start off by saying im not a hardcore disney fan i enjoy disney but not to the extent so many people do so that was a huge part of my hesitation going into this game i thought it would be weird to see disney characters as my villagers and friends and while it was weird for the first hour or so i quickly got over it and was hyped anytime i could bring someone new to my server

this game fails to keep you bored at least until you complete all the current content i remember almost feeling overwhelmed the first few days i played with how much i could do and just didnt know where to start but i loved that i loved knowing if i was struggling with a quest i could work on a different one instead or work on getting more dreamlight and bring someone new in i will say some of the quests can be pretty grindy especially when youre down to the last few that being said im a completionist and still felt satisfied when i finally did complete them if youre a completionist this game is for you if you need something to hyperfixate on this game is for you if youre sad or unable to focus on anything but your emotions this game is for you ive been in a very bad mental place the last few months and i can confidently say this is the cheapest therapy available

that being said theres a few things i hope this game improves on or adds these are fairly minor things but they are things i wish had been implemented first i would love to see a minimap added that shows characters nearby so i dont have to bring up the full map to find them i know you can click on a character and a path will show up leading you to them but if theyre nearby it would be nice just to glance up and know exactly where they are

gardening i think we all have the same exact gripe when it comes to gardening and that is people being in the way or accidentally planting something when youre trying to pick something up thats procced a bonus quite frustrating when im picking pumpkins and the bonus procs and instead of picking the additional 10 pumpkins the bonus gives i accidentally plant a bunch of carrot seeds or you sometimes have the pleasure of someone walking in front of you and accidentally talk to them instead i think having a few more keybind options for talking to people or planting would be beneficial to avoid missing bonuses and speaking of keybinds i would love to see the option of a hotbar and customization for tool keys whats given is okay but i play several games like this and i really prefer to customize my keys with my tools so i can easily remember what to hit in every game instead of trying to remember what the game allows

another thing i really wish theyd added was an axe or the ability to shake trees for sticks i finally had to look up the best way to gather sticks because i was spending hours trying to gather 30 sticks for a quest and i really would prefer to play the game as is instead of having to look up easy ways to farm materials

speaking of materials i hope to see a better reason to have a characters bonus be used for gatheringfishing fishing is useful for farming seaweed but then you open kristoffs shop and moanas boat which makes fishing seaweed kinda useless outside of that i found myself giving characters the gardening or mining bonus as those seem to be the most beneficial option i never saw much of a purpose for the gathering one as it doesnt seem to benefit gathering sticksdigging which imo is more important than fruitherbs

and lastly i wish there was a better rotation for items in scrooges shop it shows that theres like a thousand  furniture items and tons of clothing options but i had the same exact dress and wall piece appear in my shop 3 days in a row im sure not everything has been added for early access but it would be nice to see some rotation that wouldnt allow the same items to pop up everyday ive also had the same lamp show up at least half a dozen times and ive only been playing this game a couple weeks i feel like i cant do a whole lot of customization because i keep getting repeat items in his shop and half the time the middle furniture option on the second floor doesnt have anything in it kinda seems wasted to upgrade the shop if there arent always going to be options in the upgraded areas

that being said these things didnt prevent me from playingliking the game theyre just things i hope to see fixedadded in the future i truly loved this game overall its definitely in my top 10 favorite games i havent had this much fun playing a new game in years and i cannot wait to see how much this game grows it seems like theres still a ton of content to be released and i really look forward to whats to come

original review sept 2022 release


this game is extremely fun and worth the money to play early access imo there are so many activities and things to do this is 1000 like animal crossing but better as well 
i love watching my little ice cream crocodile follow me around while i spoiler mine for gems or go fishing for rare fish spoiler _
you never run out of things to do i cant wait for the things that get added to the game later on

a tip for newcomers make sure that you download the dreamlight avatar creation demo first before you buy the game you will be able to get a code at the end so you can transfer your created character into the full game
if you buy the game first and try to install the dreamlight avatar creation demo it will not work because the paid game replaces it for some reason

if you happened to already buy the game while reading this review nothing to worry about just get a second steam account that you dont use and that doesnt already own disney dreamlight valley and create your character there you can still transfer that code to your main steam account with the owned game it will work like a charm and you only have 24 hours before the code expires

also i recommend creating your character beforehand


_


update nov 2023

i am not a fan of the microtransactions i think there is a way to try and enjoy the game while pretending the paid content doesnt exist unless you really end up with nothing new and free left to do in the upcoming updates

im not surprised at this point if there are updates where the only way to get a character is to pay for them

#####

game was fun and engaging and monetization was fair that is until they dropped their premium shop in the latest update 

in a world where people are stuggling to buy eggs gameloft thinks that upwards of 20 for 34 furniture items is reasonable ea has better value for their sims 4 microtransactions and they were already at cartoon villain levels of monetization

if this is the sign of what things will be like postrelease then im out

#####

you know sometimes i dont want to kill things in a video game i just want to spend 20 minutes planting 500 pumpkins 1010

#####

please read this devs 

the game uses real time sync but sadly i can only play during midnight hours meaning itll always be dark ingame and it makes me very sad

could there please be a way to force it to be day time 


#####

i exiled elsa to the savannah and that feels right

#####

i am recommending this game but that comes with a catch  i recommend this game for disney fans  if you are not a disney fan skip this one

the reason you need to be a disney fan to enjoy this game is because the game play is basic  its so basic that this is just a mobile game with better visuals  im not joking  with a minor overhaul this would be a mobile game  

most of the quests are super basic   they are either fetch or build x number of things  

every task you run into is mostly the same  you press the same button over and over  the only one slightly different is the fishing  that just adds a timing mechanic to it  

the best part about this game is the music  its a nice mix of classic disney songs

well see how things go over time  right now this is only for serious disney fans

#####

walle is best boy

#####

i would be recommending this game but i paid for the deluxe version when you lot swore it would be free to play eventually buy this version to support the devs  get cool stuff i paid seventy usd to get the deluxe version

and yet i am told lololololol now pay 100 total  if you want the dlc who cares how much you already paid

𝐘𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐬𝐨 

you made a promise and you went back on it

shame on you

edited apparently having a critique is now a hot take and a way to start a war i am not whining nor barking at anybody  i am pointing out the severe greed of game devs these days no more and no less i wont be reading new comments on this thread lets all just agree to disagree

#####

in short animal crossing but disney

#####

this game is honestly going to become worse than ea with the sims when it come to paid addon content its already ridiculous and its in early access 

if you wanted to purchase all the items that have been in the premium shop it would cost you 64455 moonstone this isnt including the new paid walle quest they made too another 4000 for that or the fact that the star paths cost moonstones to open too its 80 aus to buy 14500 so in theory if you wanted all of it its going to cost you over 350 bucks 

the game it self can be fun in parts but i cannot in good conscience recommend purchasing this game

#####

is this a joke gameloft the dlc costs more than the base game are you kidding me what a disappointment 

i purchased the ultimate edition when it first released and really enjoyed the game with the expectation that it would be free on full release as mentioned by gameloft thought to myself great i could transfer my save across devices there were star paths battle pass equivalent and quest packs that i thought were money grabby but didnt mind too much as they were not really needed to play i did purchase a few things here and there to support development nothing to drastic then the announcement that when it leaves early access it would not go free i again figured it was because development cost a lot and it is a nice polished game i got hyped up for the dlc i was really looking forward to it log on this morning to go and purchase and what its more expensive than the base game alone nope 

current prices for me
base game 3399
gold edition 5199
dlc 3899

thats it im done love the game but its pretty crystal clear to me now they are focused on money

and for that reason im out

#####

warning i brought this thinking that id play a few hours at a time and ended up playing it for 112 hours and now its 6 in the morning


h e l p

#####

there is walle

#####

please let me wave back to walle

#####

very fun relaxing game similar to animal crossing or stardew valley i was expecting a half baked money grab that would get old quickly but i am as drawn into this game as i was dinkum there is always something to do the number of customization options is insane and who doesnt love bringing goofy along with you on fishing trips its not tedious overly grindy or ugly

#####

its fun but i paid like 70 for the game and it still has dlc to buy in the words of a very quotable disney film im not happy bob not happy

#####

games like this should be illegal addiction is real and should be taken seriously

#####

money cant buy you happiness but it can buy you this game which is kind of the same thing

#####

maybe the easiest review i ever wrote i absolutely love this game its so wholesome relaxing and happy it looks really gorgeous and i smile every session bumping in to my fave disney characters or listening to the cute sounds of walle its a super comforting game to play and relax with decorate garden fish cook explore craft and chat with your favourite characters as you develop your relationships you can complete quests for them and earn special items with the money you make you can upgrade the different buildings in your town you can also find hidden memories collectables as you explore the world 
the game is not finished either there will be more characters and content added over time but there is plenty at the moment at about 50 hours i still hadnt unlocked all charactersareas i dont regret buying this game for one second its so calming and peaceful and makes me smile every time i play dreamlight valley is a little bubble of happiness and positivity waiting to soothe your soul

#####

please before buying or creating your character download dreamlight valley  avatar designer tool and make your character cause 90 of cosmetics are not available and you need to do friendship missions or by digging  forging etc to get randomly after creating character use code to import it ingame you can import via code once
 i am not sure but i think after buying the game you cant download avatar designer tool
i played 8 hours straight game is so fun and addicting i was afraid about microtransaction but for now its only cosmetics
game pretty and run smoothly in 4k 60fps high settings gtx 1080 ti

edit
i played about 15 hours on onexplayer handheld gaming pc it runs 60fps all the time 

i didnt expected these rewards thank you you made my day

#####

disney dreamlight valley is a very promising disney game which is loosely inspired by animal crossing
living in your own decorated valley and hangout with your favorite disney characters
it sounded so fun right but is it really 

ive bought the ultimate edition for 7000 which is the most expensive version of the game
this version gives you many items and also 20000 moonstones which is in game currency 
moonstones is the currency that can bought with real money or you can claim 50 moonstones a day when you login
this game will go free2play and it was no secret that eventually after the game released we would get a premium shop so they would make money
we also have a starpath battlepass which cost moonstones too 
id like to quote what they have stated on their own website 

quotemicrotransactions will be limited and will focus on cosmetic items core gameplay mechanics will not be monetized and the base game will not require additional purchases to be enjoyed as intended after early access we have plans to add paid expansions that will add significant content to the game but this will not impact the original full game experience offered at launch

please note at the start of early access monetization mechanics will not be fully implemented to ensure the game is meeting player expectations we will leverage community feedback to implement these systems to ensure disney dreamlight valley is polished and funquote

well thats a effing lie now is it 
they started with promises and made it seem like they were listening to the community and giving us gifts
but slowly gameloft is showing their true colors by creating content behind paywalls like the walle quest and a premium shop with skins that cost around 1500 each which are crazy prices
to buy all their content every week cost around 4050 so understand that if you want to collect everything the game will eventually cost you hundreds
i dont mind spending a bit of money but these prices for a singleplayer game are insaneeeee

on top of everything they are breaking promises for example organizing events that end on a certain date and suddenly they end it early while people were working so hard to enter the contest
they also pretend you can win cool prizes but the last time we won a teapot which was copy paste resized item
a summer event was coming where the rewards were 2 skins for 2 characters people were so excited for this and as soon as they realized that they have put those in the premium shop too 
where is our heroic clothing set or our walt disney  mickey statue things that were promised with the community challenge

all they do right now is implement more and more ways to ask you for money while the game is in early access and buggy af 
those bugs dont get patched fast if there is a problem it will be fixed with the next update which is weeks later
everybody is complaining on twitter and ig about it but they arent responding on any of it 
the game is going down hill pretty fast right now and it isnt even released yet

#####

just here to let you know this game works on steam deck game crashed during the opening but changing to proton experimental fixed that change the refresh rate to 45hz set the game graphics to medium or high and youll have a pretty solid experience 

the game itself is super fun so far i can see myself sinking way too many hours into this 

an issue right now is that the ultimate edition perks dont show up ingame

edit the ultimate edition perks showed up in my mailbox after rebooting the game thanks for the tip mapleruse

#####

its animal crossing meets kingdom hearts

#####

i have been in a depressive pit lately and my boyfriend got me this game to cheer me up and it had been my happy place and just what i needed i am so in love this game makes my inner child happy and is just comforting fish cook decorate craft hang out quests and more thank you for creating this game for people like me

#####

this game is like a warm hug from a childhood friend

#####

hundreds of games thousands of hours and ive never felt inclined to write a review until now

dreamlight valley is by far the best life simfarmingwhatever game that ive ever played it takes the best from stardew valley animal crossing the simsand pieces everything together to make the most relaxing sim you could wish for endless crafting cooking and decorating options make it impossible to be bored for even a second the fact that you can only benefit from hanging out with your townies means you truly get the most out of each character and their storieswhere in animal crossing i will just neglect the shit out of my islanders i love that time is synced to real life i love cooking with remy to discover as many recipes as i can naturally town building like the sims has given me a hundred hours of gameplay at almost 200 hours inalmost all toons max leveli am nowhere near putting this game down and i know it will only get better

#####

its not embarrassing to play this game as a grown up men because lets be honest we all been experiencing disney related products or services at some point in our life

spoilerthanks mom  dad for giving me a life sized donald duck doll for my 5th birthdayspoiler

#####

give us jack and sally before i riot

#####

changed my lifenow add multiplayer pls

#####

i did not realize that a game that retails for 40 with an additional 30 dlc would have itself entwined with micro transactions that makes me ill knowing that it preys upon people who really fall in love with the game it made me immediately refund because i am one of those types of people that loves to get all the things in a game but if all the things involves continuously throwing money away to buy tokens in order to get things then i know i will either not play it enough to care not worth the purchase price then or play it so much that i spend more on it than i should also not worth the price really disgusted that a disney game would do this knowing that many of their players are underage no thanks

#####

final edit so ive dumped a decent amount of hours into this game its pretty fun though it feels less fulfilling than other cozy games i enjoy acstardewhm they finally fixed my dreaded nighttime only mode with an options in the settings to change time manually love to see it guys now ive never played any game that has a real money based game mechanic except poe which if you know is strictly layered armoreffects this game seemed to have verbiage that a player could achieve the optional seasonal items by playing and grinding away but it seems like its almost impossible to collect the moonstones required to unlock the premium items which is pretty disappointing while i dont mind giving a free game some cash for cool armor in an arpg this is literally a game about dressing up and decor so they essentially created a paywall behind core game mechanics and it feels wrong i wouldnt mind paying cash to unlock the items themselves because im both busy and an adult not a kid playing this but paying cash to unlock just the opportunity to unlock items is a crap mechanic i would play this game with a realistic outlook so far there isnt much to do the tasks can feel more chorelike than rewarding it absolutely will get kids into the gamblingesq addiction of wanted to pay real cash for the chance to unlock items in game 5510 meh but with mickey ears

 


while im enjoying the game i cannot overlook that this game is tied to your time i have little hours to even play video games all of which take place around 710pm this means i basically bought a night time simulator game where the characters complain loudly how late it is where its always dark and moody where characters hang out in their homes because they have reasonable bedtimes im so angry about this huge oversight other farmtown sim games always have a way to set a game clock or the devs understand that console times can be changed but i cant change my pcs time and from what ive read online this game punishes you for time altering this chill game is honestly just depressing me with the perpetual nighttime its so good i almost want to buy this on my switch but im petty and refuse to give them more money or one more sale to add to their numbers

edit yes i know how animal crossing works ive played all of them but also im no longer a teen with a varying schedule and changing a ds3dsswitch is not the same as changing my pcs time it messes with my calendar events and meetings i tried de syncing the time and nothing in the game changed

yall stop telling me to change my timezone on my pc it isnt used just for gaming again i dont want my calender and eventmeetings to be messed up

edit 2 seriously now i have time specific quests specifically get this morning crystal this afternoon crystal and the evening crystal and wait for days until a character decides to stay awake so i can complete tasks and build friendships i stand by what i said dont make the game tied in real time

     you would think that for as many hours i have played this game that i would fully recommend it but i dont really i bought the cheapest version and refuse to spend anymore money on it i just save my moonstones from blue chests to spend on the events speaking of which i used to get 2 blue chests a day but for the longest time now i only get one per day
     at first its a lot of fun collecting characters critters clothing etc but it really just gets tedious after awhile i have to turn off all the voices and sounds because those get annoying really fast the quests are all just fetch quests 
     the thing i enjoy the most is changing my wardrobe but even that gets old 
     decorating my house is okay but you cant really interact with things as a long time player of the sims i wish i could do more with my house and the items in it 
     ive played so long that there is rarely anything new in scrooges shop and when there are things they are often just stuff i can make myself in the customization area  things like different colored head wraps and turbans or tee shirts with motifs i could make myself 
     i like the new dream snaps event because it is a good way to get more moonstones i also liked the potato quest to get the rainbow fox
     speaking of critters i have collected almost all of them but there are a few rare ones that only show up once in awhile and  sometimes even after feeding them their favorite food i still dont get to collect them so i dont know if thats some kind of bug or what edit apparently you need to feed some of the critters more than once but who knows how many times so that makes it really hard to collect the ones that only show up once a week
     i am not a fan of the in game clock because sometimes the only time i have to play is at night at its so dark ingame that it is really hard to see anything i dont really like when its foggy either for the same reason edit i found that in the graphics setting it is possible to offset the time to combat playing in the dark so that helps in ingame clock remains but at least i can see what im doing now they just need an option to turn off the grass
     i do like that its controller friendly because i play on pc with a controller but i do find that setting up furniture and decorations is a little easier with a keyboard and mouse 
     there have been some bugs in the game but the devs seem to correct those pretty quickly and usually they will give some sort of compensation 
     after youve collected pretty much everything there isnt really much to do in the game anymore i log into it each day just to see if theres anything new in scrooges shop usually not and to find the blue chest other than that i just wait for a new event to come up 
     i think it would be nice to be able to make some of the characters stay in their houses i dont like some of them and wish they werent wandering around all the time and talking to me if i get too close to them

goofy has a phat a 1010

i was really excited for this game i love disney and im an even bigger animal crossing fan so to see the worlds collide in a similar styled game was exciting sure i thought the price point was high especially for early access but with the promise of f2p for later users i thought it was fine then came the store prices another weird overpriced issue 30 for a skin really i mean sure we see it other places like in apex overwatch etc but again those games are f2p and now with the devs announcing the f2p promise is being walked back where is the justification for their pricing

as if the f2p walkback wasnt bad enough were also being told that characters will be locked behind a paywall now the recent expansion announcement shows rapunzel and gaston are we expected to pay 30 for two characters will all future characters be locked away for a high price point or will it only be the popular ones in an attempt to squeeze even more money from those of us who were loyal fans 

base game is 30 itll be 60 for the base game  expansion on a game that was said to be f2p on release during the first year of their early access deluxe edition is like 60 when not on sale so with the expansion thatll be up to 90 you are quite literally punishing people who bought the higher editions in an attempt to support the game and the devs in the early day 

disney being money hungry is nothing new but come on at least be a bit better at hiding it the expansion and the store price points could be brushed away with the promise of f2p on full release but thats no longer a thing so whats the new excuse 

rip to this game i was really looking forward to it but im done

editing to add they also really fucked creators over content creators streamers youtubers etc advertised the game to their followers as a future f2p game they were under the impression that it would be the devs never corrected or updated this so that creators could lets their audience know its a completely bad faith move 

also looking back the last time ddlv twitter commented about freetoplay was back on jan 6th 2023 this is after tweeting about f2p multiple times a year throughout 2022 so just how early into 2023 did you guys know because sitting here it looks like they knew theyd no longer be doing f2p for at least 8 months given the fact that they stopped advertising it as such ew

#####

i am a victim of capitalism

#####

as of 612 before it goes freetoplay its good but knowing the trackrecord of the developer the monetization is probably going to get bad

#####

but just because were finished with a part of ourselves it doesnt mean that part of ourselves is finished with us merlin

an earlier reviewer mentioned being the target demographic for this game im almost a decade older and i feel the same way i remember being six years old and renting adventures in the magic kindom for the nes with my mom the same year i watched the magic castle at disneyland light up from on top of my uncles shoulders i was the same age my nephew is now 

i enjoy the postmid 90s disney movies well enough but they just dont hold the same nostalgia for me when you can remember the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin and the lion king coming out in a fiveyear span its difficult not to be critical of modern disney except for the dog in up he might be the best character of all time

anyways this game is so good that doesnt matter

i wont go on about everything i love about the game as most of the reviews have done a great job of that already it has that vibrant cartoonish look of fable or kingdoms of amalur but it plays like an animal crossing game so far with almost 40 hours of play time ive only come across a few minor issues

 ive had to force close a couple times due to my companion being stuck between myself and a doorway when trying to exit
 with my gamepad pressing rb until you arrive at the last tab freezes the menu so that you cant go back to a previous tab by pressing lb
 please give us an option to untuck shirts from pants i have a hoodie on at all times so i dont feel like steve urkel running around the valley

as you can see these are all very minor and im sure theyll be patched out quickly well maybe not the shirts ive got a wishlist like every other player but based on the amount of blank plaques in the castle weve only seen a very small piece of an already incredibly immersive early access release

2022 was one of the most difficult years of my life ill spare you the details because it seems like everyone is struggling right now but suffice it to say i spent most of it in a very dark place the world at large seems to be fixed in a state of aggression and disagreement

disney dreamlight valley reminds me to slow down and remember how i once looked at the world with some optimism and positive sense of community and that is priceless going into 2023 

100 recommended

#####

youll love this game 

im a 30 year old woman and after work id find myself being besties with some of my favorite disney characters this game is so sweet and wholesome and it helped me through some rough times it reminds me a lot of animal crossing which i also enjoyed and played a lot of i highly recommend this to all ages its okay to embrace your inner child itll definitely make you smile

#####

i would recommend this game if they werent absolutely fucking us my own stupidity to think that spending 100 on a game would let you have one dlc but it seems when they renamed the editions after release its supporters from day one are just basically told to give them more money i am honestly glad i didnt spend anymore time on this game than i have this company is so wrong for that glad you guys can sleep at night knowing you screw your own fan base over

edit hahahaha yeah im stupid for assuming but when as buying a founder ultimate version and we spent 100 on a copy of this game where literally now you can get the dlc for free with the cheaper copy now is absolutely terrible but there is no reason to be insulting me in the comments about my review just laugh at my clown behaviour and move on with your day thanks 3

#####

disney has lost their minds it seems the game itself is 40 euros which is already very expensive than they dare to add ingame purchases which are insanely expensive and they keeping pushing you to buy and now they have the balls to add a dlc for 30 euros when the game wasnt even completely finished in the first place not even mentioning they were going to make this game free for everyone but decided against it 

meaning if you want the full game you have to pay 70 euros not even deluxe version and then will be greeted ingame with the tons of shit you cannot excess unless you pay extra on top of that shame on you disney i regret buying the game

#####

gameforge did the unthinkable  they made a branded game from a company that has a questionable record regarding content and made it into a surprisingly good game

this game is a cross between stardew valley and animal crossing but with disney characters  you will be clearing out thorns rebuilding homes traveling to new lands to recruit new people and experience their worlds and building friendships with childhood characters we all loved  the lore setting characters music all fit disney and they make doing some of the mundane tasks a bit of meaning  this was a world built out of love and actually tries to tell a message  

the story opens up with the player going to dreamlight and a character talking about the forgetting that must be cleared which is what the whole game is based on  disney characters have forgotten their world and their roles within and lost their memories of it  without going too much into what the story is it almost seems to tell a story that parallels to the things we forget in life memories that fade with time  its such an amazing story to me and i think more people than myself can draw thoe parallels between the game sstory and what the game is trying to say about us

and thats what this feels like a labor of love and personality rather than some meaningless cash grab with disney characters as we all thought we would get from something like this  

while this game does have stardew valley vibes in it especially regarding friendship mechanics think of it as an animal crossing without as many time gates and with farming mechanics  the farming and gathering are pretty simple  your tasks are simple and most of them will be simplistic fetch quests or other mundane things  the fun however is in interacting with the disney characters and progressing the game along to see what neat areas you will be seeing next  

definitely recommend if you are familiar with disney characters have young kids or just want something casual to progress in to pass the time by and want to build your own little disney kingdom

#####

i enjoyed the game for quite a while in early access micro transactions and all
i have always assumed that games with a freetoplay economy are profitable alternatives for companies who dont want to sell games up front and keep releasing dlcs thereafter this seemed like a cool business model for ddv so i kept playing

but then disneygameloft started releasing fullpriced dlcs for disney dreamlight while retaining the perks of a freetoplay game their ingame shop virtual currency premium upgrades etc 

i have never paid 50 for a game that also offered ingame currency and also offered pricey dlcs but as disneygameloft confidently integrate multiple revenue streams into their crappy game disney reminds us that anything is possible when you believe

disney i am in no way surprised that your game is designed to siphon as much money from players as possible 
im just disappointed

#####

this 30 game with a 30 expac brings to you
1 expected content quests and skins locked behind more paywalls ursula  walle packs
2 microtransaction only skins item path
3 a battle pass star path

other than a subscription service gameloft has implemented every avenue of monetization  ironic since i probably wouldve paid more if the game didnt feel like it was trying to grab every penny it could from its supporters

#####

perfect for vibing while using no brain cells i love it

#####

i absolutely adored this game i recommended it to others before the devs implemented shamelessly predatory ingame purchases that gradually became more and more necessary when the prices are ridiculous i could spend 50 of ingame currency and buy 46 sets you might think whatever i can live without furniture items but the same costly currency is required for what used to be free to players participation in special events is limited without it but it used to be the only way to earn the currency unless you count 10 per day worthwhile considering 1 furniture set can cost around 2000 points and 2500 points 10 i dont count it 

the devs arent responding to complaints from the community so i will no longer recommend this game

#####

soooo addicting only way it can be better is by adding jack and sally 3

i wanted to write a review for the game much earlier but i waited until i had completed all the quests in the game 
its lovely peaceful and very relaxing 

the gameplay feels a bit like my time at portia but with disney characters the graphics are likewise too
you must fish gather mine and grow resources which are used to build various objects needed for your quests

there are times when you need to find hidden items cook meals or fetch items requested by other characters
you can furnish your house and the map with over 1000 different furniture items and you can customize your character with over 700 clothing hairstyle and accessory items there should be something for everyone 

i think the main difference to my time at portia is that there is no combat 
dreamlight valley is safe to play even for young kids 

voice acting and music are both very enjoyable 
the world design is nice even if i wish it was a bit larger 

some people wrote that the game was grindy but i didnt feel like it was of course some things need more resources than others but isnt that the case in all games with item crafting 

the game is in early access but the only bugs i personally noticed were 
  characters that spent time with me occasionally got stuck in a rock while i tried to mine 
  at the end of buzzs quest the definition of a hero the game completely froze after closing it via task manager and restarting it the game continued to run fine tho  

i loved playing the game as you can tell but there are also so minor issues that bothered me

donald he is annoying he keeps getting anger attacks where he throws himself to the ground and speaks gibberish the first few times its funny but he keeps doing it so often that i sometimes wish that i could just remove or drown him 

some of the quests most of them are fine but there are some that can only be done  completed at certain times of the day the games daytime is connected to your reallife daytime so if youre playing at lets say 8 in the morning it will also be 8am in the game 
theres a quest that requires you to do tasks in the morning during the day and in the evening
so if youre not able to play the game at this time well sucks to be you i guess 

at first youll be overwhelmed by quests from all the characters however when you reach the end game it feels as if the developers padded the playtime with unnecessary waiting
for example some seeds will need a few reallife days to grow some quests lock each other out so you cant even do some of the other quests while you wait 

dear developers thats annoying just remove this nonsense 

h1 overall disneys dreamlight valley offers a lot currently in early access there are already about 60 hours of quests tons of customization options a lot of lovely characters beautiful scenery and music there is no violence so the game is suitable for children 
the only things i would like to see in the future are more quests and more characters as well as the removal of the annoying wait a few days interruptions maybe add some achievements
im aware that the game is going to be free2play someday but i believe right now its well worth the current price of 2999 h1

ayo the  is going on over there you guys going mental were still in ea this is going to be free to play how can you market more physical copy bundles dreamsnaps  cozy editions pumping your microtransactions get your  together you had a good thing going but you are  your potential gameloft go hide on social media with your 1000month twitter handle and charge your players for more   800 hours and my loyalty feels scorned do not buy do not interact it is a greedy moonstone fueled fever dream with unworking features slow dev updates and a variety of gamebreaking features across all platforms to boot because im pissed its also a glorified advertisement for disney ip new pixar film fuck the content we promised heres encanto turning red and elemental  i will keep this review updated update the communitys new patch content the last 2 updates have been a majority of added items to the premium store wish you guys hadnt been such bloodsuckers to the community because now when you could really use some support with this unity policy update ill now be sitting back watching to see how you shove that problem onto your players on top of everything else greed and greedy pair together so well yall were made for each other update  they have tucked their tails between their legs and walked back the free to play model theyve been advertising since day one along with locking characters advertised in the basic edition behind new surprise 30 dollar expansion packs surprise i bought it listen new players do not join i only continue this plight due to my sunk cost fallacy

#####

i feel like such a child playing thisand im here for it its basically animal crossing but with disney villagers if you dont like animal crossing but like disney i would say try it on game pass first but if you love both you will most likely really enjoy this game

just got walle to move in to my village like come on who doesnt like walle

#####

the only thing i have to say is bring more male clothing and gestures to the game there is no reason for disney sims like game to be only for women and the gays straight men love disney too

#####

okay so the best way to enjoy this game is to take it easy dont try to rush it all at once like you really have to just take your time and enjoy the little bits it provides its cute theres a lot of customization options and world decorating available but the characters currently are limited at 100 hours i have completed all there is to do and at first it is overwhelming but i stress to take it a quest at a time and ease into it

i would suggest buying just the base game rather than the editions as the items provided are all cosmetic and honestly theres better items in game to work towards there are some weird bugs that will pop up here and there but savequitreload seems to take care of most of them

overall if you like running back and forth and caring for your villagers needs in quest like format decorating fishing mining harvesting and taking selfies with disney characters then youll enjoy this game

#####

truly feels like ac new horizons but with kickbutt disney characters i am addicted if multiplayer were added it would be even better

#####

unfortunately with the february 16th update they included a premium shop while im not against a premium shop their behavior since implementing it has been less then ideal

it is largely agreed upon by many members of their discord that the prices of the premium store is outrageous with no evidence that they are listening to player feedback 

the premium shop runs on a varied timer ranging from 57 days the first batch of premium drops costed roughly 50 didnt have any option to buy any of the items individually bundles of three items each and rotated put after five days the second batch was about half the price but datamined evidence shows that this was probably just coincidence as most of the prices were datamined with the items themselves with large fluctuations up and down

aside from the rather overpriced premium shop despite the backlash gameloft has been practically silent on the whole thing many of us want them to respond to know theyve seen our concerns but instead weve only been cornered off into one section of their discord server and restricted to 6 hour message timers despite them ensuring their paying attention to community suggestions and concerns theyve clearly shown the only thing they care about is cash

#####

buyers beware this game contains extra premium options in the form of a battlepass and premium store if you buy any itemsclothes from there you are not guaranteed to keep them with the latest update gameloft changed last years premium christmas items from their original red to a rather dirty looking pee yellow when asked about it the reply is we will take note of your concern 

they may change the items you paid for with premium currencyreal money any time they please and turn them unuseable

update they have been turned back to their original state but only the christmas items and not various other items that they have uglified over the past year

i was having a great time playing the disney dreamlight valley game but then i realized something im the main character and ive just been running around this valley doing chores for everybody the whole experience feels more like slavery than it does playing a game im building homes gathering supplies and doing random tasks for the other characters so that they can open businesses or go on vacation i dont want to be anyones damn slave im the main character and i should be getting other people to do my bidding ive started this whole game off wrong


#####

addicting disney version of animal crossing i started playing this on the nintendo switch and was frustrated with all the crashing playing a few hours and crashing a total of 56 times each session was a bit ridiculous got it on steam when it was on sale and the play is so different no crashing at all and smooth as butter if you want to be a true pumpkin farmer i would suggest getting it on the pc

#####

this game is just animal crossing mixed with stardew valley but the villagers are disney characters if you like those type of games and like disney you will love this

#####

first impression so take with a pinch of salt 

controls can be a bit janky
characters are fun and interesting
world is gorgeous
the animal crossing gameplay mechanics are fantastic and feel more in depth
great framerates even at 4k duh i would expect no less 
no pay to win elements at all everything is earned in game or cosmetic only no extended waiting times for anything either even farming takes just a few minutes 

overall pretty darn good but not perfect at all needs some polish around the edges especially in the movement and camera control areas rating 810

#####

i get jumpscared every time donald throws a tantrum

#####

if you enjoy stardew valley for the tediousness and many tasks if you enjoy animal crossing for the cute and the daily grind and of course if youre a disney fan this is a game for you

#####

paid 70 for preaccess was told it would be free to play when fully launched and they changed it into a cash cow not worth it

#####

ursula is a vibe she just chills out in a different lake every minute and doesnt do anything mama is living

#####

first off this game was supposed to eventually be free to play and that has never happened 
second i already paid you for a game and you want me to continue to buy moonstone so i can get the cosmetics i want

nope so sick of microtransactions

goodbye ddv

#####

do not get this game it is not looking good

this game is in early access but promised the community that it would be free to play people waited and missed out on events for the free to play option fast forward to two years later after refusing to communicate about its eventual release and they finally announce theyre going back on their word as well as announcing expansion dlc for updates and characters in game even after buying the game are you kidding me 

ive played this game for nearly 230 hours and it is not worth the high price i loved playing dlv but it is absolutely riddled with bugs microtransactions and constant choppy low quality animation for what its currently priced as the low quality is outrageous some of these bugs are literally gamebreaking not being able to move past certain quests etc not even going to mention the fact that people are still having issues with the switch version with it crashing constantly i was hoping that these issues would improve overtime as the game developed more but none of these have been fixed you seriously cannot tell me this game is worth buying if its still filled with gamebreaking bugs choppy animations and glitches 

a blatant spit in the face of the community

#####

i really wanted to play animal crossing but i did not want to buy a switch to play only that one game so when disney dreamlight valley became available on pc though steam it was as if my prayers had been answered if you enjoyed stardew valley if you enjoyed animal crossing if you enjoyed minecraft if you enjoyed craftopia if you enjoyed any farming crafting building type sims you will adore and love this game my vote 1010 stars everything i had been hoping for all wrapped into one very nice package with mini mouses bow on top thank you disney finally someone got it right

#####

i wish i could evict goofy 

#####

all i can say is that it wasis worth every penny there is so much to do never a dull or  i need to find something to do next  moment because there is always something if you love adventure life simulators then this is most def the game for you it is like  the sims  but filled with lovely childhood nostalgia at the moment of writing this i have over 34 hours in the game  i just got it i can see thousands of hours more tbh haha so yes  i think that this game is worth getting  deserves awesome reviews the only thing i would say is that i think there needs to be a better balance with coins  that they should def add some achievements  but as the game is in early access im not to upset about it hope this helps you if youre having doubts about buying the game

#####

respectfully donald is missing a few screws

#####

its great if you didnt pay for the game
its oksoso if you paid money for the upgrade pack
 as of writing this i played 45 hours and paid for whatever the premium ultimate package was

things i like
early game progression is fun

house items are great i like the tree fireplace

early game cooking experimenting is fun

things are really expensive and fish give you tons of gold i guess this could be a negative if you dont like endless fishing

lots of different items to gather plant collect

friendship doesnt decline if you dont talk to people everyday  im not forced to play to ensure i dont lose progress unless you count thorns respawning but thats not really an issue

things i didnt like
i made a boy disney wants you to make a girl or be a cross dresser  outfits are geared towards females  would have been nice to have more male clothing options  especially when a lvl 10 friendship reward is a dress

they need to fix gathering spawns  in areas a player unlocks there are usually 2 separate sections  one section is not accessible until a player completes specific quests  if you gather all the stuff in the section you have access to when the item respawns it can spawn in the section you cant get to yet  i used the immersion breaking move the well to the side you technically shouldnt be in yet to get around this but that just feels like cheating  btw you need some of these gathered items for quests so thats why its almost necessary to use that well moving work around cheat

once you assign a character to a profession like mining or fishing thats what they are assigned to  you cant change it

some quests are pretty tedious  having to dig hundreds of holes for mudclay comes to mind

bugs will probably be fixed but for example its annoying not being able to dig up the shiny spot behind scrouges shop because its too close to the building

late game is kind of lame for me 45 hours in youll have full stacks of basically everything and not much to do except decorate  i guess that is the draw for some people so maybe this is a positive but i just feel like something is lacking once you get to lvl 10 friendship with everyone

#####

i hate that i love this game

#####

be aware those who are playing on steam deck the opening animation where we find merlin for the first time crashes the game 
play through the tutorial on pc before switching to deck 
love this game cant put it down

#####

in case you are thinking if you should get this game now or wait till the full release that will be for free and you are a person that can wait not like me then i would advise you to wait for the full release 100 

edited bugs are finally fixed and the game gets better and better so at this time i would definitely recommend this game

to be honest its a really nice game and if you enjoy this kind of games then for sure you are gonna love this 

at the start they were some bugs that caused troubles in gameplay however the issues were fast resolved and at the moment everything is smooth

as a personal experience when this game was released as early access it was clearly a beta or even alpha and 
i was not really feeling that i was playing the game as i had to open a new ticket for almost every quest i was getting and report an issue with a quest that was not letting me progress into the game however this was fast resolved and fixed

#####

ive played over 700 hours of the game on ps5 without putting any money back into it and have been able to complete multiple star paths without putting any additional money back into the game and actually have more premium currency than i started out with due to being able get 50 moonstones free each day it adds up slowly

the premium star path costs 2500 moonstones and as i said you can earn back 2000 of that by completing it 10 days of finding the blue chests that give you the 50 free moonstones puts you back where you started

premium items costs between 750  3750 moonstones the current dream bundle costs 4000

premium currency is expensive in this game and whether it is worth it or not has been debated extensively but is ultimately a personal decision to make

i personally love the game and think its a great way to spend time but its not for everyone its very grindy and my friends wont play it because of that id recommend maybe checking out some youtube videos to see if its something that you think would appeal to you

#####

if you are a disney fan this game is a must play it is really similar to animal crossing playstyle so if you enjoy ac youll enjoy this game in terms of time this game is way more lenient than ac because you can shopsell 247 and if your villagers are asleep they only sleep for a few hours and not all night long ive been playing this game since it released and have been having a blast theres been bugs here and there and annoyances like no customizable keybinds but theres nothing that you cant really work around also if you play on multiple devices using their cloud sync just make sure youre also manually saving dont trust their saves back up your local saves too just in case  if you have customer support issues tho be prepared to wait for at least 2 weeks or more for a response these devs take forever to respond and youll probably forget that you submitted a ticket by then

#####

great game but i cant recommend it due to the heavy monetisation its quite obvious that this game was originally intended to be freetoplay given the sheer amount of premium content locked behind a paywall though i dont mind the shift to a paidfor title in and of itself that it retains its pervasive monetisation despite its high price tag sours what would otherwise be an excellent game edit did i mention that there are ads yes fullscreen popup ads for premium content on the main menu
as pcgamers review said i myself can justify my own irresponsible spending as an adult but this is a game aimed at children who likely want to play with all their favourite characters which paints a rather sinister picture i will concede that the premium content sans dlc is largely cosmetic and not necessary to complete the game but again this is a game where children make up a large portion of its target audience and in my opinion such rampant monetisation does not belong in a fullypriced 60 title let alone one aimed at kids 
disappointing that what would otherwise be a great game has found itself tainted by corporate greed if you do wanna try it wait for a discount and check the wiki to plan out how best to spend your moonstones i already planned out which premium items to spend my moonstones on but first i gotta wait for them to reappear in the weekly shop lineup did they seriously lock elsas iconic frozen design behind a limitedtime paywall

h1tainted by gameloft greedh1

tldr

 ddv has enough content for the entry fee but at what cost

 gameloft has gone back on their word to make ddv f2p and its now a paid game imo their business model has been altered in an unhealthy  bad faith manner

 i only purchased this game as it was eventually going f2p this year

 i would not have purchased it at all had i known they would go back on their word

 unless youre a diehard disney fan its nothing special that you cant find many more trustworthy devs who make better games in the genre just without a fancy franchise


disclaimer my rating is negative because ddv stated theyd have a f2p model upon launch that theyve since gone back on the only defining reason i bought this game in ea was its f2p model i wanted to support the development and people who otherwise couldnt afford to purchase it early if i knew that it would not be f2p i would not have purchased it at the time i felt the base game offered more than enough free content for dlcs or additional purchase options not to be an issue which is no longer the case as theyre not going f2p i wont be playing this game past getting achievements its ruined the experience for me and broken trust that wasnt earned but still given and i dont recommend it to any of my friends i simply cannot trust a company that can go back on its word especially when its so close to the promised launch date transparency is imperative to gamers especially on steam

the review below isnt finished at my preferred quality as i dont think gameloft deserves more than the time ive already spent on this so itll look like a jotdown of notes but with all relevant details just not my signature fancy schmancy polish my original review below was going to end with a positive rating im only posting it to reflect the state of the game outside of the drama surrounding it 


ddv reminds me of mat farming in rust runescape chill genshin impact minus combat animal crossing new leaf  pocket camp gameplay loop torchlight fishing vibes

done well
in a nutshell genshin impact with no combat
many animal crossing og elements
it activates the pleasure centres of my brain with the tailored nostalgic soundtrack per companion

done poorly
 painfully timegated if you have a job or a life you wont be able to make certain time slots in this game without changing your system clock its a strange mechanic to have in 2023
 poor camera movement in general obnoxious transition camera movement
 causes mild simulation sickness leading to nausea or dizziness that i didnt get used to over time 
 you bump into everything and get stuck on everything and certain things like treesrocks have invisible walls etc it doesnt help with the nausea
fix this is what helped me play on smaller windowed mode reduce mousecontroller sensitivity completely in game settings reduce mouse sensitivity further through my mouses software or pc settings remove all the trees and foliage possible in all biomes after youve enjoyed it a bit 
even then this games camera movement is really poorly designed for a aaa third person game all the clutter in each biome in the game is painful it looks nice initially but causes eye strain and nausea your eyes will spin and spin and youll feel sick imagine being at a theme park and being there for hours on end the sensory overstimulation is exactly what it feels to play ddv 
 ea related a  frequent crashes i had to force close my game more than 5 times just within my first 35 hours that means for me every day that i played for about 45 hours i would always get one or more game freezes where id have to force close i havent had any substantial issues with my saves at this point but this many crashes is definitely an issue b  desync issues at times you dont have correct visual indicators parts of your crops teleport and stay that way clearly early access state but not in a way that gets in the way of enjoyment c  buggy item spawns nothing game breaking yet but you will lose things under other objects get things stuck eternally etc 
 needless movement momentum when you run in ddv and change directions abruptly it slows the character model down in an animation that is annoying and redundant in a nonaction genre game its commonly seen in genres like platformers and punish or aid the player to utilise physics in the game and make it look like natural momentummovement in an action game it would be understandable as precision movement is the whole point in a casual farming sim i dont understand why there is punishment for moving and changing direction fast my only thought is this is linked to what visually looks the best or makes sense aesthetically as someone who plays games at a relatively fast pace and am used to a lot of quick efficient movement regardless of genre it is confusing that players have to work around this in ddv of all games it also adds to the myriad of poor design choices the game has made that causes simulation sickness or worsens it

you start by squealing at the disney bunnies and squirrels but realise the best is when you notice two completely random disney characters having a nice chat on a bench sometimes ill just fasttravel and see a random turtle plod plod swimming away in the far ocean that i have to squint and make out and its the cutest thing the random genuine grins and smiles i got playing this game make it worth it once i found walle my fav in ddv staring out at the ocean and then having a ridonculous chat with ariel about which human thingamajigs might do what

ddv is relaxing to play in different ways whether you 1 reveal new biomes 2 meet new charactersworlds 3 finish quests or 4 acquire dreamlight and 5 participate in events you can just roam around and enjoy the disney of it all have fun taking photos or screenshots 

theres a lot you can do but the ui and gameplay loops make everything easy and clear to understand and stay interested in i have a very short attention span and get very overwhelmed by details easily but ive also been gaming for decades so i need something intriguing fun and addicting ddv delivers the mmorpg minus mmo that id been craving for years that being said no mpcoop is saddening because i wouldve gotten all my friends on this game if i couldve all that being said at the 160 hr point i am deathly tired of the game and just want to 100 it and be done

overall this game is incredibly well made i wanted a chill time waster and i know this will be it for the next 600 hours edit at 164 hrs 600 turned out to be incorrect and im now bored there are too many properly done things in this game from features to sensory immersion that its hard to list them constructively without simply saying it has everything you need the accessibility you take for granted and the happy feelgood world youve been craving the devs have thought of everything and covered everything i purchased this at full price standard though i knew it was going to f2p i rarely do this edit hilarious in hindsight as a lot of my enjoyment in ddv heightened by my knowledge of this going f2p

 achievements tip
this game has several currencies as is usual these days dreamlight is one that is used to open up different areas and access characters there is a dreamlight menu when you press esc whatever mini quests you complete in dreamlight duties and anything in that dreamlight tab is what counts to your steam achievements counter nothing else is counted so dont worry about achievements dont proactively do anything just focus on your dreamlight duties as you play naturally and especially for dreamlight duties collect them immediately so you can get the next one in line available

#####

presented in a deceptive way when you buy this game youre really just buying a microtransaction for some ingame currency they lock a lot of the best stuff behind moonstone currency which is complete bull this is 100 a microtransaction f2pstyle game that isnt even free and not even as good as a game like animal crossing which has none of that moonstones easily run out so youll have to pay up to get the good items also this game is clearly aimed at younger kids so its scamming on kids as well and making them feel sad when they get into the game but they cant get certain items now theres even paid dlc but they still have the moonstone garbage in the game just charge for content not ridiculous currency and this game would be great but because of that it really feels like a scam

#####

so i alternate between this and the dead space remake and i seem to have found my overall gaming bliss

#####

i am so sad and disappointed

the game was so fun and my husband gifted it to me at a time i needed a very simple game and it was fun the events were cool not always perfect but cool glitches and bugs were fixed once in a while and i was ok with it but now  it is just a platform to spend money on furniture that is just not real even though sometimes people are struggling to buy food to live in real life i mean why did developpers had to make so many things expensive  i mean everything is bound to moon stones  to make premium missions to have the cool thigns in the event now you have to spend a lot and i mean a lot of money just to make missions accessibles  ok this whole game is about grind but at this point the grind is not even accessible because you cant have moon stones in another way than spending money 

and okay you want to make people buy moon stone  just make at least a little bunch of cool accessories accessible by grinding for the pet or for one type of clothes and dont say there are already items like that because those which are accessible are as accessible as  they are uninteresting developpers you know what you are doing  turning a great game about a disney world putting stars in the eyes of the young and  the old into a living hell of disappointment

like it alot the cash shop is the scariest thing  they need to make a lot of improvements and fixes still  but overall i like it alot and im cautiously optimistic  seriously tho the cash shop is more like richie rich expensive than scrooge mcduck they need to seriously lower all the prices accross the board while making sure to constantly add new and compelling content to the scrooge in game store 

what i like most
magical theme
real time weather and lighting
variety of themes
holiday celebrations
beautiful to look at
photo contest is cool but yeah


dont like at all

stamina bar it is not fun running out of stamina and back and forth to house to rest not even a little takes long enough as it is to pickplantwater crops

no tree cutting you pick up twigs ok i guess

not enough in free item store not enough to decorate with

worlds are a bit too small

cant change ur character name

npcs often just get in your way

npcs can only be assigned to one trade one time

cant access event decorations for instance the holiday stuff should be available for sale from in game free shop for everyone  at least the basic stuff 

no social anything the npcs will follow you and provide buffs to the few shallow craftgather skills in the game 

materials are way too scarce and way to time intensive to grow in the case of crops
the fishing skill is the only one in a acceptable state crops are meh again way too time consuming and the npcs just hinder it more even with the buffs youre wasting time running around picking up the extra crops and such ur assigned npc drops all over the place

this game needs a ton of work and in some cases an overhaul trade skills 

minimal craft skills and they are basic as it gets mining fishing crops cook thats it 

no exploration at all  you open a new world walk around it in under 3 minutes thats it 

minimal pets you can friend wildlife but just not the same


they need to worry less about the cash shop which honestly has no business in this game until its ready for launch and not in beta  they need to focus more on adding depth to this beautiful game with potiential  

i got my 2500 worth but will this game hold my attention for the long haul  no not as it is atm  i actually find palia to be superior in every way except the magical moments a disney coat of pain can sometimes inspire

for instance palias social and crafting is already light years ahead of dream valley

#####

pros and cons because i love this game i own it on two platforms but i am a bit urked that i spent 70 on this game just to potentially spend 30 more on a dlc that i want for more features and characters especially given that at one point this game was proposed to be free to play disney is greedy for that good game tho very cute

#####

is that a train i hear oh its just donald

#####

its a kingdom hearts mixed with animal crossings game very fun to just mindlessly play and finish quests with your favorite disney characters i particularly like the sandbox style of this game and getting the chance to build and create your own little village lovely game and lovely graphics

#####

this game unfortunately feels like a massive cash grab

like animal crossing without the charm if it was free to play like it was supposed to be you could forgive the season passes and paid dlc its a shame because this game could have been so much better

game was supposed to be free this year supported only because i thought that was such an amazing thing they were going to do for fans everywhere taking it back is a slap in the face to everyone who bought early access to support the free release shame on disney gameloft and anyone else who helped make this terrible decision

#####

gameloft proves to be the money grabbing partner we dont want promising gold and delivering garbage the game was nice but as any good farmer game its slow and repetitive with all the promises during the pre release they came down to 0 of delivering these promises few samples  it would be a single player game with no high payment system besides moonstones the game would become free to play base version as soon as the release would be there with a ton of fixes for all consoles and pc the game is far from perfect at this point i would say to expensive for there are better alternatives with the same type of gameplay

#####

let me weave you a tale a tale of deception from gameloft

they release a game in early access but fail to actually tag said game as early access until enough people complained they say the game will be free but cosmetics are gonna cost ya free to play no content barrier cool

but then things change more microtransactions get added than we were told about and theyre much pricier than we were led to believe but its fine the game is free to play and gameloft has to make their money somehow really odd that theyre dodging any direct answers about what will be free and what will be paid but you know free to play right

ffw yesterday when everyone finds out that that game will never be going free to play and theyll be locking noncosmetic content behind a base game paywall 2 more areas of the map three characters and some pets will cost 40 which they explicitly said they would never charge for characters from day one but hey the prices in the ingame premium shop are still astronomical and they gave no indication that they would be adjusting them even though theyre now getting anywhere from 30100 from you as a barrier to entry 

interestingly the content in this 40 content pack has been advertised to us as primary base game content for months belle was the main character advertised but she was only added to the game just a few weeks ago rapunzel gaston and eve are now locked behind that paywall but mother gothel is an integral part of base game and youre just supposed to deal with it 

you can throw every gripe about freetoplay games in the book at my head but once they dropped that model and didnt indicate that any serious adjustments would be made it was an immediate uninstall

animal crossing for disney fans

#####

i love this game its relaxing and i need the steam awards badge so im writing this review if you love animal crossing disney characters with a sprinkle of stardew buy it

#####

bought into early access and been playing since launching september 2022 i was excited and got the founder pack

early access is buggy of course we paid for the privilege of playtesting so report what comes up anytime a patch happens things are going to break
seasonal starpath isnt too bad and some collectibles are great some not so great some are laughably poor its really hit or miss
adding the moonstone market was understandable game was supposed to be free to play on release gotta make revenue somehow right

they announce game wont be free to play ok plenty of paid games have microtransactions mo money mo problems
collectibles and quests blocked by paywall yes i did get walle and ursulas mission packs but getting ursula out while im active was a pain before the peekaboo games of getting her at a water side space to even talk with her

the day has arrived full release more paywalls they want 30 for dlc the villagers want things from the area locked by the dlc paywall collectibles now have percentages for completion but hey you are missing things from beyond the paywall oh and all ingame purchases are in moonstones wanna access advanced starpath use 10 for 2500 moonstones walle or ursulas packs 4000 moonstones meaning you either get two of the 10 moonstone packs or go for the 20 pack for 5500 i do not want to know how much money i have already put into this game anymore i am already ashamed

also who decided the sleep schedules for these characters i get jack get his house setup leave his house to try and get some things for him and hes asleep when i get back i want a bullhorn in game to wake these idiots up or chase gothel with it i know this was supposed to be a family game at heart but the relationships with the villains makes me think theyre trying to teach us to just put up with toxic tactics 

this is a nostalgia fueled cashgrab and i am not sinking anymore money into this pit

#####

at the time this review is posted the game is in early access and the review should be seen accordingly the game is currently in an incomplete state with broken quests unreachable items and absurdly loud music at 20 volume still loud but the game itself is actually fun to play however for the price tag of 30 minimum and the ea tag it bears i recommend buyers beware

now for the nitty gritty of the game and what is good and bad we will begin with the most fundamental aspect of the game which is resource acquisition this game will force the player to grind out a lot of materials by doing repetitive tasks these tasks often cost energy or physical time however to offset the energy you can recruit disney characters to grant you a chance at additional nonquest resources at level 2 friendship  above as long as their role matches what you are wanting free resources from so if you want more stone and ore you get a character that has mining selected if you want more crops harvested you get a gardener as of the time of writing this there are 17 characters you can have follow you ingame that means you can select each profession 3 times and have 2 leftover the professions are gardener miner fisher forager and digger however the chances for items increase based on the friendship level max 10 of each villager with said profession so for the moment if you get the game choose wisely

now for the next aspect of the game that it will literally force you to do that is friendship almost everything in this game revolves around that aspect and admittedly locks you out of past the starter content unless you get several levels of friendship for different characters however it is admittedly very easy to grind out early levels this nets you gold motifs furnishings or even clothing it also unlocks their sidequests which may or may not be annoying doing actions with said friend while hanging out gets you experience as a character friendship experience for your buddy and if you are doing their profession action a lot more of everything unfortunately the game fails to really explain this well and i see little option to go through previous tutorials but it is both a fun mechanic but devastatingly annoying to grind out levels for most folks

finally we come to the questlines the final aspect i want to focus on in this game its annoying hands down the quests are broken some fail to register items in your possession some fail to recognize you doing an action and some just break entirely luckily for me usually a full restart of steam fixes this somehow but for an ea game you can always expect bugs though i am very surprised most of these got past alpha testing glares at game companies skipping this important aspect of game dev

all in all i can recommend the game once it goes down in price gets more updates and some much needed tlc from the development team ill give it a 6 out of 10 for sparking enough nostalgia and assembly line whimsey to warrant its purchase

#####

game was sold under the pretense it would be f2p developers waited until the first dlc was a few weeks from release to tell everyone they changed their minds after hundreds of thousands of players had been patiently waiting for a year to get their hands on this at no charge 

now all of the content is paywalled including future updates that will include significant characters and gameplay pushed out as dlc dont worry though they did say theyll shove the occasional free content update in there to make it feel balanced cause free color variants of already existing clothing is equal to receiving new characters with questing

the best part of this paytoplay base game and paytoplay dlc is that there are also macrotransactions yep macro because paying 15 for one single digital house skin in a disney reskin of animal crossing is not a microtransaction did i forget to mention the battle pass events that you also have to pay to participate in theres just so many things you have to pay for i cant keep up 

watching streamers transition their communities towards other games after building it around ddv the past year is one of the saddest things ive had to witness in a while this game is nothing but a good idea plagued with broken promises and greedy shareholders

 animal crossing x disney if youre a fan of either youll enjoy this very simple gameplay relaxing and easy to pick up tons of customization for your character plenty of craftable items to decorate your valley with and you get to hang out with some really cool disney characters premium season pass content better than microtransactions personally

 currently slightly buggy some quests requiring crafted or collected items can take a while due to respawn times let me pet my companion

i bought this game in early access to support its development the game was supposed to be free to play in its full release with income being generated from cosmetic purchases ingame and then the next promise was that no game content would be locked behind purchases then greedy gameloft went back on that promise too and has now released an expensive dlc for content i now regret that i gave them my support by buying this game in ea

and after all that there is still an ingame currency which is not just for cosmetic purchases an example is the walle dream bundle from june 2023 which had character quests for walle and cost 4000 moonstones

dont support such scummy practices this game is not even unique in this genre

#####

night thorns are growing in my room strangers who call themselves my friends tell me that i still have a real life i dont know what that is and i dont really care either they keep talking about how i have to work and how i keep forgetting who i really am but goofy told me not to listen to them and who would i trust those strangers or my best friend goofy
anyways its time to tame some raccoons and plant more carrots thats all i need in this life farewell

#####

i cant stop playing and its all i think about rn

#####

disgusting money grab

#####

good game being ruined by greed

#####

this game would only be better if it never tried to be f2p highly recommend for cozy disney fans blown away by amount of content but the monetization needs to be turned down heavily

#####

this game is incredible its stardew valley in 3d please gameloft add the ability to date the characters and add nightmare before christmas

#####

animal crossing meets disney
would recommend
thats it
thats the review

let me catch nemo and keep him in an aquarium in my room

tldr the devs have made every effort possible to squeeze as much money out of the player base as possible

eta dec 7th the dlc is now affecting players that dont have it multiple of my villagers have items only found in the dlc as their favorite items such as bumblestone and glowing flowers leaving me wholly unable to give them gifts for the day

bought for 30 on the promise that it would come out of early access as free to play today their first major update dropped at an additional 30 for 25 of the content we got from the initial purchase half of which was promised at launch and later changed to be dlc gameloft has gone money hungry and until this game releases with the promises they made on launch this will remain a negative recommendation there isnt enough replayability for them to be charging this much money your character only levels up to level 40 its somehow an even slower trickle for store items than animal crossing at least with acnh you can manipulate the game the check the shop multiple days this game will break entirely if you try to do that the devs have made every effort possible to squeeze as much money out of the player base as possible

#####

this game unfortunately feels like a massive cash grab

like animal crossing without the charm if it was free to play like it was supposed to be you could forgive the season passes and paid dlc its a shame because this game could have been so much better

#####

i am appalled at the direction this game has gone announcing a dlc while still in early access wild said dlc that upon release will only be a third of the way finished crazy sad to think that the game was advertised as freetoplay with a season pass that has turned into a microtransaction monster we were told major content wont be locked behind paywalls yet here we are will multiple new biomes and characters only unlockable through dlc while i could understand if this was a year or two postearly access its not havent even left it yet dont get me wrong the current content is great the stories are captivating and i always find myself having something to do however i shouldnt have to be dumping hundreds into a game to unlock everything

to elaborate the costumequest pack for individual character is 4000 moonstones premium currency the closest pack is 5500 moonstones 20 as of review there is two of those already one for walle and ursula how do they expect people to pay for base game however many dlc they plan on releasing and almost 20 for cosmetic pack per character at this rate wouldnt surprise me if they did multiple per character 

the company does not listen to its fan base they only see us as cash cows save your money get a game where you as a player are valued as more than just a wallet if you are deadset on getting the game just know how much content you are going to have to buy past base game otherwise you may find yourself stuck at a paywall

#####

this game started off really fun  it is compared to animal crossing but take that lightly  also disney characters what not to like  i really loved it  but it is in early access and with each update they seem to take something away  an example of this is kristoffs stall which gives you common materials needed to craft you were able to get stacks of 99 items and it was nerfed to 310 items each  the materials needed to craft is insane so this really puts a huge damper in the game  it is going to be free to play  so keep that in mind with each update it is heading to that sort of game play like a mobile gatcha game  i stopped playing completely to see if it continues this path or makes better changes

#####

as of december 2023 it costs 142005 moonstones to buy everything in the premium shop including two character quests priced at 4000 moonstones each

this translates to buying the largest moonstone bundle of 14500 moonstones ten times for 145000 moonstones to cover the transaction that is 500 usd in addition to the price of the game in the ten months since the shop launched that is how much additional they have tried to fleece from their players while releasing an incomplete 30 dlc on top of that

#####

stitch is the best and nobody can change my mind about the little guy

#####

i love doing everyones chores as donald duck screams like a train in the background 

wish i could cook in bulk though
1010

#####

i really want to love this but i just find there are too many tiny things that add up enough to irk me and lower my opinion i am aware these sound like very petty issues but i really cant bring myself to look past them

1 no ultrawide support this really sucks

2 the walking animation looks very clunky has no weight and is slightly faster than the actual walk speed 

3 the stamina bar is completely redundant it exists only to be in your way as an extra thing you need to work around

4 the price is steep for what will be a f2p in the future that said if the above issues are addressed then id happily turn this positive

5 i like the idea of the battle pass style events but the items in the pixar one are starting off on a weak note

6 premium currency always leaves a bad taste no matter what the game is purely on the premise they can turn the tables at any point to push for a more predatory daylight robbery style pricepoint i dont trust gameloft enough to not do something like that

being an early access title i hope they take all this feedback and act on it because if they do this could be something incredible

#####

if you are a fan of animal crossing or stardew like games this is for you  there is so much to do and unlock and it is very flexible

#####

game is fun for a while  can get grindy and fetch questy  
takes the developer a long time to patch problems and issues
disney people will like it for a relaxing animal crossing like experience  paid dlc leaves a little to be desired for another price of the full game

#####

disappointed in their lies  claiming it would be f2p then changing it at the last minute and trying to charge people who already bought it to support the game at launch even more money cash grab

#####

for the love of god vote with your wallet cancelling the free release only to release a 40 dlc is unacceptable either wait for a massive sale or for them to get their act together which i doubt disney ever will they shouldnt be able to pull a stunt like this and have everybody basically say yeah sure well keep paying for things we were supposed to have for free

#####

cons
real time setting  if you can only play in the evening youll only hear evening greetings and youll only see a dark and gloomy valley 

the real time linked quests  if you have a real life and cant check in at all times of day or wait around waiting for it to rain in the game

the broken quests   dont you dare actually play the game and harvest things ahead of time  youll get a quest to go flower picking with someone and be stuck forever  rather than fix the quests scrooge crafting to give you one step at a time or to register both steps you were just told about they just flung in a pile of extra crafting material  um thats the hardest way to do that  but actually fixing the quest would mean admitting they made a mistake    

currently i cant water 20 of my farm plots nor dig them up or destroy them  why  bugs  but the microtransaction system is a working on target

baccessibility  flashing bubbles when fishing  lighting  bright glare off the sea  no settings whatsoever  do they want to give people migraines and seizures  seems like they dont give a damn b

grinding for cash  all the cute disney stuff costs a whole lot of money from scrooge and the updates to places get more and more expensive 

chasing ursula and ariel around to talk to them is a pain  you can zoom out the map but not enough to figure out where everyone is  

pros
you can wander and talk to disney characters  17 of them at most currently

the unlocking via upgrading tools is a nice in character method


#####

just let me marry walle plzz

#####

seriously once you really get into the story its fantastic  i am very surprised by the game because i rtruly didnt expect to get into it  hell it even got me chokedup at one point  like actually crying over my keyboard chockedup  itll get you in the feels in a way thats really unexpected  this reminds me of the disney stories from the golden age the ones with really deep and meaningful direction but it doesnt appear that is the way the game is going to go when you start playing  you have to give it time but i absolutely do believe its worth it  i dont believe this was made for kids as its very apparent from the story itself that was made for those of us who grew up with disney  this was a labour of love and it shows

to the devs  thank you for that one section in the game i dont want to spoil it for anyone but im sure you know which one im talking about  i still wasnt ready and had to stop and have the cry mentioned above for a bit because it really did get me in the feels with how personally it hit me but man was done so beautifully  i truly hope your storytelling abilities arent overlooked with how this story truly pulls you in  its original and needed in this day and age

#####

i have had this game for 3 days and i already have 17 hours in it i cant stop playing it i am a grown ass woman but all i want to do is play this game i have skipped many meals because i cant stop playing it

#####

i wake up to disney dreamlight and fall asleep to disney dreamlight

#####

animal crossing meets disney meets stardew valley with a dash of kingdom hearts mystique so far so good i have no real complaints about it as a fan of disney this ticks all the right boxes my only real annoyance is the stamina bar and why god why does someone have to run up to you and watch you while you fish as someone who fishes in real life the pet peeve is real and i hate it merlin you dont need to watch other than that though i recommend it as a solid comfy game do keep in mind it works in real time 910 would fish again but please stop watching me

#####

the game is good
i am a person that gladly pays for games because its a job to produce them i do pay for a service i am a woman and shopping is a way of life i love wasting my money
anyway such an important dlc for 30euros is pathetic everything about this price policy and management is pathetic
i wouldnt buy this game again

#####

i would recommend this game with this notable caveat it very much is early access

when i saw the game was in early access i was somewhat surprised this isnt some unheard of franchise from an indie developer its disney you would think that of all companies disney would not be asking full price for a game thats not fully developed and by not fully developed i do mean

you will reach the end of the available content in under a week which would be fine in a storyquest game like dragon age but is somewhat sad in a game that is designed to be played across weeks like animal crossing and i literally mean that some exec somewhere was like what if animal crossing but make it disney because thats exactly what this game is

you will encounter multiple major questbreaking bugs that will not allow you to progress

the noises that donald duck frequently makes will erupt from your speakers at unholy volume  shrieking whistles and screeching to the point where you will turn the character voices all the way down or risk scaring your family pets neighbors let alone yourself

speaking of character voices none of them speak their full dialogue they only produce tediously repetitive catchphrases andor character songs do i expect all fullpriced game to be fully voiced call me entitled but yeah i do

that aside the characterbased quests are nicely designed if buggy and have a good amount of grind the companionship system is fun and provides a nice boost to whatever activity youre undertaking and the design options for the player player house and town are all reasonably wellpolished the background music is also a nice selection of instrumental disney songs and original music

there really isnt much to it for the price though and i agree with other reviewers that its very odd that the rewards that you buy are only available once per account

if u are a fan of animal crossing  disney this is a perfect game for you 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2864094059

u𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦 u u are joining the world of disney valley and meet merlin who ask you to help to save the valley from the thorns  darkness around the valley and in order to save it you ask for the help from disney characters we all love

u𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑦 u i like the way u have to unlock around 4 disney movie areas at the moment like wall  e  frozen and do types of mission to unlock them to your valley  get a friendship with them u are quiet busy with farming ingredients stones jewels  leveling up your friendship to level 10 and use them for different jobs to help you out right now there are a few bugs around quests etc but u can expect that since its in early access state

u𝘊𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘴 u the best part is u can make your own character design  by dagobert duck u can buy hairstyles clothings  furniture the disney characters are looking very cute too 
the only thing i think is a bit meh are the swimming characters like arielle  ursula if u wanna talk to them they may be not reachable and at the end of the ocean and u have to wait or when u walk to them they change the side or glitch out a few seconds but thats just a small thing

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2867056971

u𝐻𝑜𝑢𝑠𝑒  𝑇𝑜𝑤𝑛 u u can decorate your own house as you wish but u have to pay our beloved moneyhungry tom nook aka dagobert duck in that case 3x to finish your house and from the inside for more rooms you also can create your valley the way u like which really is amazing for my creative being d u also have to expand goofys shops in order to get seeds for vegetables so u can cook recipes

the game is really cute and pretty linear as far as game play you can get stuck in the daily running around collecting trap so youve been warned its beautifully made and enjoyable if youre looking for a pleasant game to take your mind off things try this out

#####

the game is synced with your devices clock in real time some npcs go to bed at 6 pm yes six including the character whose whole deal is running a fancy restaurant

if this were a hardcore life sim game made for adultssure okay i could accept this as part of the challenge but this is a game aimed at children by the time theyve finished their extracurriculars and dinner and homework and chores and finally get some free time to game sorry kid your favorite characters are already in bed 

on a console adjusting the clock would serve as a workaround however this is also a pc release and some of the programs i need for work effectively prohibit me from doing that but even if the workaround was viable for everyone its still a terrible design decision why have time sync if you need to turn it off to actually play

unless they change things so that all the characters stay up later than a literal grade schooler i cant really recommend it itll just leave everyone in the household depressed

#####

relaxed casual game play that still keeps you entertained for the long haul 107 hours in and im still enjoying it

hoard hoard hoard make building chests a big priority and pick up as many things as you can  you will need them

 there isnt much tied down by a daily limit aside from daily discussions a few chests only being able to buy 25 items from the shop each day and the shops featured items gathering spots usually notorious in these kinds of games respawn much more often than i expected them to villagers are always available to hang out chat or gift unless theyre sleeping if you want to upgrade a house or business the upgrades happen right away instead of making you wait until the next day just about everything you do in this game was made to be enjoyed in the moment allowing you to play however you want until you feel like stopping then come back whenever youre ready with no consequences

 to unlock new areas and progress in the games story youll need to gather dreamlight which are points earned by completing a plethora of ingame activities what you can do well as how much you earn for each task is located in a menu akin to challenge trackers in most other games the more you do the more dreamlight you get the more dreamlight you have the more stuff you can do

 there is a surprising amount of variety from the different kinds of quests you can do stories youre told and biomes were currently able to explore im a bit over 45 hours in at the time of writing and ive yet to feel bored or as if its time to slow down new areas are still being unlocked new characters are still appearing new quests are being assigned with a whole lot more to unlock and i havent even started beautifying my village or home yet

 character interactions feel authentic despite their limited voice and animation loops giving the game much more soul than similar titles its also well worth interacting with everyone you can thanks to the friendship feature the more time you spend with each of the games villagers the more points you get towards your friendship level with them each villager comes with their own set of rewards that unlock by level along with the ability to assign tasks that help ease your grind whats most interesting and impressive though to me at least is how conversations with each of the villagers reveal historical media backed facts about them rather than simply filling the conversation pool with pointless banter

 its battle pass appropriately dubbed the star path is off to a good start so far whats free and premium is made very clear with a progression style similar to fortnites your ability to go to the next page is determined by how many items youve acquired from prior pages premiums price is standard at 2500 moonstones 999 usd and you get 2175 87 back if you make it to the end of the path the challenges assigned in order to progress in the pass dubbed duties are also reasonable even at their worst i just hope that future paths last longer than 34 days

 character customization is a pretty big deal for me because i always want to make sure my character looks right unfortunately i always notice an imperfection or two over time and usually cant change that without mods or spending money dreamlight valley allows me to be a nitpicker without punishment by giving us the ability to change everything about our character at any time all we have to do is open the wardrobe located in our main menu and everything we had access to when we started the game is made available again including gender

 little details can make a big difference and id hate to litter this review with blips for each one of them so ill just list off a few of my favorites here your gathering tools are unlimited thanks to magic removing the hassle of rebuilding or rebuying them when youre hanging out with certain villagers or spending time in their homes their theme songs will play characters interact to just about everything youre doing whether its fishing mining or trying to take a selfie with them what time it is in the game matches what time it is for you in reality with each of the games characters having their own scheduled habits the collection menu is a real time saver granting access to a lot of information id otherwise have to look for through a google search 

  the devs have been fantastic supportive and seem to be really excited for the future of this game so far every bug ive reported directly to their support center was acknowledged and responded to within a couple days comments made on their social media platforms and within their discord server have been transparent and genuinely helpful weve also been shown quite a lot of what to expect over the coming updates with hints of more including multiplayer on the way if they keep this up dreamlight valley will have a long and prosperous life ahead of it

h1what i didnt likeh1
 theres no way to check the controls for this game or reassign keybinds

 the camera though fun to use is held back by horrible controls and functionality limitations selfies work fine but trying to line up my shots in its notsofree mode is usually pretty tedious a lack of control over the poses and expressions we make is also truly unfortunate 

h1nitpicksh1
  the games characters occasionally speak to each other through speech bubbles this is fine but the speed at which the text creeps into each bubble is annoying to me and i hope we get a way to speed it up down the line

 its early access so bugs are to be expected and i experienced quite a few fortunately every single one that i experienced was pretty minor but they were still enough to break the immersion and bring about frustration in a game i otherwise have a great time with

h1overallh1
whether youre a disney fan someone looking to get their hands on a lifesim with a lot of things to do or both dreamlight valley is absolutely worth your time if this review wasnt enough to convince you to get it now worry not the game will be freetoplay sometime in 2023 

h1extra infoh1
 playtime 45 hours
 visuals pretty good charming cartoony 3d visuals that are easy on the eyes
 story it wont win any awards but its sweet and nostalgic
 chaptermission select you cannot replay quests once theyve been completed
 new game no
 dlc entirely cosmetic
 photo mode yes but it could use some work
 optional content a whole lot
 update frequency a few serverside updates and one somewhat large update a week after launch
 accessibility options surprisingly none

2020 i was stuck at home and looking for an escape a fun lowstakes game to keep my mind off of everything else going on in the world

so i discovered animal crossing

flash forward to 2022 and things dont seem as dire in the world but personally i need another lowstakes escape and ive found it in this game

much like ac it has that ok just one more objective feeling and then you discover like ac youve been playing for hours

i know its still early access so there are a few bugs here and there but im currently 27 hours in and have only had one point where i had to stop the game and restart that cost me about 1 minute of progress but lets face it progress isnt what games like this are about right

i dont consider myself a huge disney animation fan it was always a bit on my periphery sure i knew of the exploits of mickey donald and goofy and how they are part of our culture i vaguely remember seeing films like the little mermaid and beauty  the beast for example but i really wasnt what youd call a superfan

with that in mind i was a bit enchanted no pun seriously when i ran into the animated merlin for the first time it brought back my vague memories of the sword in the stone the bumbling affable wizard trope is alive and well in this game hes the first friend ive gotten to level 10

and i know im several paragraphs in and i havent started in on game mechanics yet and honestly i might not be the best source for that kind of minutiae the best way i can describe the game is incredibly lowstakes survival with animation worthy of the films that preceded it

ive needed a game where i can destress and i spent the first 10 hours just meeting characters like mickey and donald and doing very simple quests for them and then i met more characters like remy and moana and walle whose films id never seen we talked and they had me run some basic errands and i just had a lot of fun

im making the most of my disney subscription to catch up on these films btw  not an ad

ive found over the years that i enjoy games where i can craft taking small bits and making bigger more significant bits and then finally something significant this game definitely scratches that itch the cooking mechanic is a lot of fun and theres always something new to build at the workbench

yes i can see where you may end up spending realworld money but it would be for cosmetic things or ways to speed up the game like growing crops for example right now though it doesnt seem like theres a grind to get to do new fun things

to summarize i spent 30 on this game and its so far given me more than that in value if youre a sorta disney fan like me try it out but if you are a big fan i think youll absolutely love it


#####

im really frustrated
at first i was suuuuuper excited and had a ton of fun playing and i still do really
but what incredibly bugs me is that the studio is doing recently

not mentioning the decision to not make this game f2p how it was planned but the situation with dlc more expensive that the base game bout 13 more thats just riddiculus
and whats more gameloft is nearly forcing players to buy dlc by making gameplay in base version more difficult because there are tasks that you cannot do when you dont have the rift in time

i still love the feel of this game but the mikrotransacions and subtly forcing people to spend that much money is just riddiculus

gameloft is slowly destroying something that could be a real gem

#####

pricey paid dlc what the extremely overpriced store items and star path are not enough money for you uninstalled no thank you

#####

do i hate the fact that this was suppose to be f2p and then they changed it last second yes
do i still enjoy the game as a whole also yes

if you love disney and cozy farming games this is absolutely for you if you want to collect everything including cosmetics i would not recommend as many of the fun cosmetics such as tool skins and houses are locked behind an additional paid currency however they have added a way to get this paid currency for free by doing voting and looking for certain chests its alot of grinding and if you buy this currency its not exactly the cheapest either

tldr buy if you like fun farm game dont buy if you are a collector of all items in games

#####

h1very cozy game h1
if you love animal crossing you will like this game
even if you dont know much about disney its still nice to play since i love disney the atmosphere with the music is just gorgeous

iu few tipps u
 try to follow every quest so you dont break anything
 the game sync with real time
 try to get your bag upgrade fast and build a chest
 easy money get remy fastcastle right door and cook souffle with 1 of each buyable item in restaurantmilk butter cheese eggs sell themi

it can be cute from the beginning
but in a few hours you can see its repetative and boring
and now they added premium shop with high prices
not worth it and your time

#####

disney animal crossing

#####

how does this have such high reviews

its typical mobile gaming nonsense but on pc with microtransactions and an abundance of bloat and with the aim of becoming free to play with increased grind and bloat i mean for goodness sakes its gameloftthey churn mobile games out ad nauseam but somehow slap a disney skin over it and its perfectly satisfactory

it doesnt even have ultrawide support

i really cant be bothered supporting this rubbish

#####

a great concept the game was fun and very addictive and it did not disappoint until this latest update when you pay for this game right now youre buying the ability to beta test an eventually f2p game that originally had the promise that premium content would be granted as free access during this ea period if you paid in now this is still stated on their website

recently theyve began implementing grossly overpriced microtransactions for digital currency for premium items and after the fanbase gave their feedback on how badly received this is gameloft doubled down and now have began locking quests behind a paywall as it is now the developers are picking and choosing what feedback is heard and theyre pushing further to see what more they can get away with 

what is here is pretty alright ive had very little issue on pc versus the performance disaster that is the switch port granted ive sunk a ton of hours on switch until the constant crashes brought me to playing this exclusively on pc that being said i never spent more on this game other than the initial purchase and i dont plan to in the future if stripping future content and locking it behind a 20 microtransaction is the developers plan moving forward look for a different game

the characters story and life this game brings is amazing my childhood characters are brought to life within the game play helping remy cook or teaching donald anger management strategies seeing them all walk around is adorable i would seriously injury any who messes with walle and his precious boot that he likes to offer you the game play is very grindy but well worth it the time passes by in a heartbeat i got this game dec 26th i am now 53 hours in on dec 31st

this game is in early access but i love it to pieces i hit bugs or glitches every couple hours sometimes back to back sometimes never a quick shutdown of the game and rebooting fixes the problem i have never had an issue with saves being set far back since the game saves quite often

#####

did you know walt disneys fav character was goofy wtf did micky dirty

#####

im just left so disappointed
i loved the idea behind this game and preordered the founder edition but as an experience it has just progressively gotten worse and worse to the point where i cant help but feel disappointed every time i open it

not only were they dishonest about the lack of microtransactions locking story as they now have an expansion that is the same cost as the entire game but now since the game isnt free to play another promise they have broken after many shelled out for early access its still locked to the platforms you buy it on i bought this game hoping to eventually play across my pc and consoles and with my friends as freetoplay makes it easy to invite friends to play 

this game has every type of micro transaction there is a battle pass a cosmetic shop and now expansions a la sims its far too much and its driving this game to the ground its disney even one of these monetization models wouldve made more than enough to keep it thriving i did not mind at all when it was just the star path 

i was excited to play this with my friends but i would not recommend it at all in its current state i think the bad press this game has gotten will sour many people from trying this game and its a shame that such a good idea has gone down like this


#####

i bought this game because i was excited to support an early access game that would eventually be free to playnow youve backtracked the decision for ftp and added a paid dlc that costs most than this game should despicable

#####

such a cute game who better to have as your neighbours and pals as those from your childhood favorites and come on what little girl did not wish that they were a disney princess or got to meet and hang out with favorites such as mickey mouse etc now you can experience what that would be like to be part of the disney family and friends and this game has made that experience happen like as ariel the little mermaid had sung someday ill be  part of that woooooorrrrrrrrrlllllddddddd 

see dreams and wishes do come true 

updated
may i add a small request can you please do something about the companions that invade personal space a little bit too much i am speaking about harvesting when i harvest my crops from my garden i am missing out on so much when the plant procs to allow me extras because the silly toon wanders over and stands on top of the plant and it almost always makes me open a chat dialog this is extremely annoying maybe just have them stand a few metres away from you at all times to avoid this from happening because no one wants a toon so close in your personal space when you are trying to harvest stuff



#####

i get to run around barefoot in a princess dress and hit rocks with a gold pick axe that probably weighs 3 times my character does damn girl do you lift while mickey mouse watches on need i say more

#####

this game is so grindy i assumed that a disney game would be made for kids but with how long it takes to get anything done i could never see a kid playing this it takes forever to get quests done and the game is super buggy ive gotten soft locked multiple times and had to force quit the game also for how buggy and grindy the base game is the dlcs are absolutely not worth 30 and i refuse to buy them disney needs to fix the base game before adding dlcs that are way more expensive than they should be

#####

i love this game but i cannot recommend it until an update provides an option to lessen the intensity of the lightning flashes i dont know how this got to early access without anyone pointing out that the intensity and frequency of the flashing is idangerousi if youre photosensitive in any way seizures nausea etc please know that the lightning storms make this game unsafe to play until it is fixed fortunately weather is tied to the real clock and not ingame time spent but i shouldnt have to stop playing a game or go indoors ingame whenever the game feels like it to play safely

ill remove this review when this issue is fixed

#####

as much as i loved the demo the game i paid for is worthless to me i might give access to my grandkids but this game is trash it claims controller support not working the dev team dont have any answers or anything of real value on the discord server  devs say they will support you through discord they dont respond steam discussion dev dont respond so i go to the gameloft website they tell you on discord if you need real help used their web page it says you will get the founders pack on whatever platform you purchase on but you are able to use any email address to register and save your game to the cloud i started playing the demo sometime ago and saw that the game was on sale so i bought it it was a dud it does not have full controller support like it claims and theres no real help for issues in this game i have found this to be the case for most big game dev companies especially mobile game devs that are trying to make consolepc games if you dont mind playing on your keyboard and mouse then this might be a decent game but for me its a hard no

#####

i started this game 6 days ago played for 4 and have almost 60 hours because i love it so much i agree with the comparisons to animal crossing and stardew valley and personally i love that this game has everything i wanted for ac clear quests and objectives that you dont i need i to do but makes gameplay so much more fun if you do i also started off with just the base game but loved it enough to buy the upgrade to ultimate edition 

h1 pros h1
list
 free movement placement of literally everything from houses to bushes and trees and even the teleportation wells
 vast ingredients and meals to cook with them  cooking meals for characters both in restaurant and for gifts
 plenty of fishing spots  a much more relaxed fishing style than ac and sd
 the only limit on gardening is space and your wallet
 incredibly wellbalanced friendship levels its not too easy or hard to get characters to level 10 without some dedication
 gold coins arent a massive pain to farm for ³farm pumpkins endgame w at least a few characters at level 10 gardening
 battle pass is easy enough to catch up on i started the christmas one with 7 days left and i finished with 37 hours remaining without stress or worry
 i wish resource spawns were faster but then theyd be pretty game breaking theyre honestly fine where they are
 little things like interacting with the critters adds to the immersion so much
 there arent many clothesaccessories in the game i dont like
 watching classic disney characters interact with present day characters is such a feeling spoiler ariel and walle trading human artifacts kristoff and donald duck working together to save the forest etc spoiler
 nighttime looks just as pretty as daytime in its own way honestly go appreciate the plaza at midnight ill wait
 dreamlight isnt hard to farm for either you could focus on gardening or fishing or mining or doing the 6 daily quests that just give you another when you complete one or a mixture of everything i unlocked all realms currently 5 in the castle and all biomes currently 6 not including the meadow on the map within 60 hours of strike grinding strike gameplay
 having companions give you extra fishresourcescrops is  very nice
 ² the clothing in this game is so fun its a bit limiting w only being able to purchase x pieces a day but it all gets added to your catalogue  its fun dressing up as a glamorous princess or the most random creature in existence
 ⁶i love some of the details added for the characters stitch hates water and every time its raining i see him in his house on the map idk if this was intentional but if it was then gg the devs bcareb about this game i also love how the characters are obtained in some really unique ways like finding mirabels doorknob or finding 3 missing socks over 10 days to unlock stitch
 ⁷literally the fact they added different sized chests for the players after reading the feedback i mean they were probably going to add them anyways but they also added sort and smart stack as well as a priority so id like to think the devs really are listening to us
list


h1 cons h1 all bugs resulted in a force close
list
 strikebug get stuck leaving my house most commonstrike
 strikebug once lost all controlsno buttons workedstrike
 strikebug once had maui conversation bug where the conversation menu was still up but conversation was over unable to move or exitstrike
 strikei wish we had more inventory space right off the bat we collect so much stuff and theres like no storage i have 8 chests i crafted and they have 2 rows of space but show they have up to 6 or 8 or something can i upgrade them please strike ¹theyve added smallmediumlarge chests to the game and i can hoard peacefully now 
 ⁴i wish there wasnt an ingame shop for premium currency but i understand the devs need to make money back once the game goes ftp still sick of seeing microtransactions in video games though but unfortunately i doubt my one will review will stop them 
 ⁵the fact that there even is a battle pass event fomo hitting me bad after finding out i missed 2 events by the time i bought the game
list

so yea all in all i think ddlv is a pretty good game

for a quick recommendation i would say if you enjoy decorating an environment and fetch quests its got plenty for you to do if youre interested in the basedlc option you should know the rift in time dlc is scheduled to have two updates leaving the dlc somewhat incomplete till summer 2024 i would only recommend picking the game up on sale

i started playing week 2 of early access and have put roughly 400 hours into this game across steam and xbox the game has changed a lot over time and i expect it will continue to change despite being out of early access

premium currency moonstones
personally i dont think paid games should have a premium currency however ddv has made it possible to earn tons of moonstones in a fun way with weekly dreamsnaps i have been able to use my earned moonstones to collect any premium item or star path i have wanted if youre not interested in decorating i dont think youll like this aspect of the game and may miss out on heaps of moonstones however anyone who enters a dreamsnap will automatically receive 300 moonstones the following week

premium shop
as stated before i have never had sny issue being able to obtain any item i wanted in the shop i do think the shop itself needs an overhaul as of right now the shop rotates 4 items each week i think it would be preferable if they offered more items if not all items 

free to play
many complaints have come out about gamelofts decision to backtrack on ftp personally i think this is the better outcome for the game as other disney licensed games produced by gameloft have been ftp mobile games that over time have turned into pay to win games

gameplay
there is a main story with lots of text overall the story is well written and cohesive however it can be overwhelming for people who have a hard time focusing on so much dialog all of the characters we have gotten so far 30 look fantastic and have dialog that sounds natural for each character 

you get to do the typical farming sim tasks mining fishing planting and cleaning up the valley at this point there is no combat in the game majority of the tasks you do for the villagers are fetch quests ultimately the game shines in the design mode where you decorate your valley

cross platform
the game offers cloud save across pc xbox and nintendo switch you can also share youre base game with family sharing 
if you purchase the dlc you will not have access to the dlc island unless purchased on each platform dlc is also account specific which means if youre sharing base game with family they will not have access to your dlc this in my opinion is my biggest issue with the game so far

other
the game will continue to get free updates that will include new characters at this point we have a rode map for the first half of the 2024 year 

the game still has bugs and with every big update we receive we get fixes as well as new bugs 

it is clear the developers are fans of disney as you can see designs and items ripped straight out of beloved disney movies from all years

its also clear the developers have been listening to their players as theyve added and changed many things players have asked for though not always in the best  simplest ways

i dont think gameloft is a trustworthy company and they do not communicate they withhold information as long as possible as weve seen with ftp and the recent dlc which they waited nearly 1 hour after launch to communicate that the dlc would be account specific

#####

its the type of game where you login  do chores but still enjoy doing those because mickey mouse will randomly come stare at you while doing it
i love fishing in this game because having those cute disney character come cheer you on by your side when you catch a big fish is so sweet 
not sure if i should complain about the microtransactions because this is how gaming industry is these days  theres not much you can do about it 
on the other hand who is actually the main target audience for this game is it for children or adults if its children the moonstones shouldnt be sold in the game perhaps put it somewhere else if its adults can we get more clothing options even i got the ultimate version  the clothings are just basic hopefully theyll add more in future updates

#####

for anyone raised on disney  right from snow white to erm whatever is on offer today  d  this game is like a dream come true pun intended you can run around your valley as a prince or princess star commander or chef extraordinaire local farmer or magnificent magician all the while bettering the land opening new domains making friends with all the disney greats grinding out some mining or fishing or foraging and whathaveyou or just running around  picking flowers and saying good day to everyone

this is an extremely emotional review lets just set that in stone right now as someone whos first official theatre movie at the tender age of about 4 or 5 was cinderella i have a strong affinity for most things disney  i went to disneyland in california when i was 7 ive loved almost every disney princess movie ive ever seen in my over50 years of life i was literally raised on disney  movies the mickey mouse club books records you name it and my kids have had a fair dose of it all too

so that is how at the age of grandmotherhood i have come to this game i am finding it such a lovely escape into fond memories and dreams after a day of hard work even though its in early access it feels polished wellplanned and good

a few of the things i love

1 i change my avatars clothes and hair  often  for the tasks i decide she should do that day although to be honest it doesnt always make sense  sometimes shell wear her best ballgown to mine for gems or fish in the rain because disney

2 it seems everything is tied to everything else really well example you need to garden so you have to dig holes in order to plant seeds digging holes gives you sod or clay or pebbles or whatever which you also need in order to craft that thingymabob you want for your yard mining for gems will give you money when you sell them but also coal ore for cooking and crafting and stones for paving and crafting and iron for ingots and such or gifts for friends  so now you can make new andor better andor different objects to use or have in your game and it goes on

3 the townsfolk aka disney characters are welldone and truetoform its lovely how someone will sidle up to you as soon as you throw your fishing line into a pond or how they wave at you or stop as you come close as if to say hey lets chat it just kind of  makes one happy

4 the graphics are well done as in they are certainly not realistic because who would ever want that from a cartoonbased game but they are again truetoform castle stuff looks castley and cartoon stuff looks cartoony they appear and disappear in your view as needed and end of world lines are rarely thought about or noticed in this game while i find that navigating through some of the biomes is a tad frustrating can anyone say forgotten lands i do have a choice even there i could easily just remove some of the trees because the developers are just that great to allow for that or  i could just suffer and say well what do you think it would be like in a crazy dark place like the forgotten lands and just put up with it truth be told  i mostly just put up with it lol

this game seems to have nailed it all  ambiance music arrangements characters story lines some of the challenges along the way are of the sort where one has to think for a bit but most are easy enough for an elementary student to work with they all relate well to the stories and characters involved even after a challenge is over or all of them at this point in my own journey thus far there are other things to do earn money for things you want from scrooges store master collecting all kinds of things keep digging and planting and mining and foraging and fishing and clearing thorns for more memory fragments

i tell ya this ones a keeper ill be happily trotting around reorganizing and improving my own personal dreamlight valley for quite some time to come i assure you

#####

very fun and very easy for people who are bad at most games like me lol

#####

lied about paywall added expensive dlc will not be returning

#####

i have stayed with this game for a long time there are parts i like and i keep waiting for the bad parts to get better but they havent the game is extremely buggy updates are slow to come and very small its a decorating game and yet its so hard to get any furniture or good items because they want you to pay they keep talking about the game becoming free to play in the future but so far its been about a year and the game is still for sale and yet theyre monetizing it so aggressively its insane there havent been any decent furniture items or clothes since they added the premium store because they want you to spend 15 real dollars on 23 pieces of furniture or one outfit ive never seen greed this bad the whole game feels extremely bare bones like they just hastily threw something together to get the fans in to bleed their wallets dry all the quests are identical shitty fetch quests nothing actually fun or interesting go get me some apples and sticks and come back oh go craft this random thing go talk to three characters were throwing a little party seemingly every other quest ends in some shitty little party  where 45 characters just sit around some furniture they made you craft and thats it

#####

if animal crossing and disney merged together 

the pros 

 its super relaxing gameplay just run around do what you want at your own pace 
 youre meeting your favorite disney characters and they help you along the way by getting more items for you the longer you hang out with them and the more higher their bonded level is with you 
 so many options of furniture and clothing to choose from scrooge mcduck is always happy for a paying customer
 its super beautiful and the music is sure to make you hum along 
 i honestly thought going into this game it was just going to be some disney game where it was annoying and not in it for the fans but i truly believe they did a good job in making something pretty fun and awesome

the cons
 it can get repetitive over time
 they dont have a lot of the disney characters in the game please i hope the updates will dish out more 
 even though ive leveled up quite a lot i still feel like i deplete energy extremely quickly and it can somtimes be frustrating 
 youre backpack level three storage cost 20k to upgrade to hold more items and thats a bit pricey considering that before it only cost if i can rememberlike 5k or something
 the music will loop they dont have a lot of soundtracks yet i hope so i sometimes find myself muting the music and watching netflix or listening to my own on the side while i do my basic farming needs
 there does seem to be some sort of battle pass system upon entering there was a pixar event where i had to spend some moonlight to get however i dont know how to earn more moonlight yet and im hoping the developers will talk more about the moonlight systems because if theres going to be an event i want and i dont have enough moonlight im not gonna be a happy camper so i didnt purchase the battle pass event

i put so many hours when this game first came out but sadly i stopped playing because of the shady side from gameloft dont get me wrong im not blaming the entire team i am blaming whoever is making the bad decisions about their premium shop prices this game was supposed to be an early access and open to the everyone to give their feedback in order to improve the game well 6000 people signed a petition telling you that the prices are too much for the quality of items you are trying to sell every day people are telling you through discord twitter reddit etc and you choose to ignore this valuable feedback ignoring it will not solve the problem put your big pants on and address the issue your players thats all we are asking just say hey so we are not lowering the prices because xyz or what most of us are hoping for thanks for your feedback we have considered adjusting the prices based on xyz people will always be mad if you keep ignoring what could have been an excellent game this game can still be saved if the monetization and quality issues are addressed 

time and time again people repeat the same thing please listen to the fans who care deeply about this game  since this game heavily relies on new content daily because its a simulation game that means people will get bored and done with everything fast 
as of right now its a one and done for many because its clear that there is no clarity on the true intentions behind what was originally stated in what is to be expected anymore it does not hold up to its own mission standards 

when this game started it was in a good direction and i would have recommended and actually did recommend it to many people to play as for february 2023 when the premium shop was introduced that is when everything went down hill for the players i no longer recommend this game until gl addresses their players about this issue i stopped playing a long time ago which is really sad because i had hope in this game but now i dont 

i do not recommend this game in its current state

#####

i really wish that they shouldve gave us the new dlc for free instead of making us pay a huge amount of money

i really loved the game and put so much hope and joy that i finally found my new main game i bought the founders edition 1 year ago looking forward to f2p game now i am very confused and disappointed that ive to pay another 31 just to play 3 more bioms which is around 6 hrs gameplay  and everyone else has to pay 71 bugs for a game that doesnt offer content for that much money just in november i had so many bugs got stuck in caves where i had to force altf4 multiple times there are other games for 31 that offer so much more content than this game im just very sad about that i now cant afford to pay 31 every other month to continue playing i would not have bought the game if i knew i would get lied to and scammed

#####

sims  stardew valley  disney  addictive game 
you cant be too old for this game 
important note the game is real time sync if only play at night the game stays dark light depends on real light
game is still single player

#####

i love it cozy and brings up the better childhood memories its like animal crossing but with disney characters just give me alice in wonderland star wars characters and cruella then im the happiest

#####

stardew valley but make it disney

#####

i want to recommend this game i really do unfortunately if you are someone who has an unconventional schedule welcome to the hell that is the game running in realtime mixed with time of day specific quests and if you try to get around this by time changing on your device be prepared for your game to break completely lost 30 hrs having to make a new game because i did not see the value in waiting over a week until i would be able to finish one quest in a game i paid 40 to play early access  devs have stated in he official discord they have no plans to fix the bugs caused by this either i get not liking people time cheating but not all people are going to be able to do time of day specific quests

#####

this game is everything i wanted from animal crossing and more as someone with 100s of hours in stardew valley i was very hopeful for animal crossing new horizonsmy first and only experience with animal crossing i found myself not liking the fact at some point there is a wall on how much you can progress without time traveling as an example at some point there are no new fish you can get because you have to wait for the seasons to change irl this game does a great job at always having something you can be doing  even in between updates there is just so much you can do you can take it as fast or as slow of a pace as youd like i strongly recommend this game and am looking forward to seeing future updates

#####

i really want to love this game but its a 30 earlyaccess game super laggy and buggy and the premium shop is outrageously priced wait until its free
updating now that this game is no longer early access and will no not be free to play no this game is not worth it i love the idea of this game but licensing it to a developer that makes phone games was a bad move its literally just a moneygrab with disney characters

#####

devs lied about future pricing structure really regret buying this   was supposed to become free to play after awhile and now theyre cranking out 30 dollar dlcs  get bent

#####

i have mixed feelings about disney dreamlight valley and unfortunately the negatives far outweigh the positives on the surface its a charming game with potential but the developers relentless focus on squeezing money out of players through microtransactions has tarnished the experience

one of the most frustrating aspects is the constant testing of players who paid to be testers themselves instead of genuinely valuing their input it feels like the developers are using us as guinea pigs to determine just how much they can get away with charging for ingame content

the pricing of certain items is simply outrageous charging 20 for small quests is downright excessive these quests while enjoyable are not worth the steep price tag leaving a sour taste in the mouth of those who expected fairer pricing

to make matters worse the inclusion of a scrooge skin priced at 10 is a perfect example of how out of touch the developers are this skin doesnt even contribute to the immersive experience as scrooge remains confined indoors completely detached from the magical valley its a clear cash grab preying on players nostalgia without providing any meaningful content

additionally the star path rewards are heavily skewed towards motifs which are predominantly useless in the grand scheme of gameplay obtaining 50 or more motifs as rewards feels like a slap in the face to dedicated players who invest time and effort into progressing

disney dreamlight valley had the potential to be a fantastic game but its monetization strategies have severely compromised the enjoyment and value for money the constant testing of players and exorbitant prices for trivial content combined with underwhelming rewards demonstrate a lack of respect for the player base its disheartening to witness such exploitative practices in what could have been a truly magical experience

please note that i have spent hundreds of hours playing disney dreamlight valley and my criticism stems from a genuine desire for the game to reach its full potential while i have invested my time into the experience it is essential to emphasize that being a dedicated player should not translate into being treated as a mere source of revenue

#####

this game honestly had so much potential when you still just paid for the beta access and the game was supposed to be free
now however they just stopped the beta and instead of receiving an actual benefit for supporting the game in early access they just punish everyone by charging even more money

this game never had enough content to charge money in the first place with fishing being the only activity besides waiting for crops to grow and resources to respawn while other similiar games had dungeons minigames and pets to develop so i expected alot more content to be added here instead they just ended the early access because they figured that people would buy this unbaked game anyway and they where right

so now this went from an expensive investment into a harvest disney to a f2p title that costs 40 but still has the f2p monetizetion of a f2p game

#####

hello my dear friends 

the game has left the early access and now it is fully ready for a proper evaluation however it did not receive a positive review despite the amount of positive emotions it brought to both me and my daughter 

excessive grinding detracts from the enjoyment of the story and the game lacks a variety of interactions with characters making it appear flat and onesided the game is genuinely boring we didnt even participate in the latest star path even though we really wanted to get a skin for stitch as participation requires a lot of time and it is very dull 

in addition previously all characters were available for free except for the cost of the game itself and now to acquire new characters additional purchases with real money are required this represents a completely different direction as everything seemed quite different before 

i really want to express my opinion about the freetoplay f2p refusal policy and the release of paid dlcs that cost more than the base game however my review will disappear from the search results of course i strongly disagree with their policy 

they deliberately informed about it during the early access received a bunch of negative reviews and now these reviews are considered irrelevant and hidden from the games steam store page 

we played the game for 100 hours and the rest seems like pointless grinding for rather mediocre skins good skins are only in the premium category and i dont want to disappoint my daughter 

therefore i will have to hide this game from the steam library we dont plan to play it anymore and buying a second copy for multiplayer is not an option 

a constructive assessment of the game is approximately 510 without taking the companys new policy

#####

dont lie about releasing this game as free to play then add microtransactions and then release a dlc that costs over half of what the base game costs the excuse to continue delivering a premium game experience when on release many of the bugs that have been there for quite literally a year at this point are still in the game

the greed and audacity is unfortunately very believable but still extremely disappointing

#####

do not buy this game  for a year everyone was told it was going to be free to play and the developers recently backtracked on that promise and are making the game monetization based  not only will you have to buy the base game but now you will have to pay to open new characters areas and content with dlc packs  plus they already have a cash shop in the game where you exchange real money for moonstones to buy star paths the equivalent of a battle pass as well as skins  some skins cost 2000 usd after tax already such as the houses  this is just ultimate greed and companies like this dont deserve to be supported  there are better games out there that do the same thing that dont cost an arm and a leg

#####

cant believe some people thought this game wouldnt be full of scummy monetization gameloft has been doing it forever just filling their game with microtransactions pretty much ever since their founding date lmao

oh and dont forget that this game was supposed to be free to play after launch instead they increased the price and added an overpriced dlc

#####

disney dreamlight valley

hi im xts and my best attempt at a review is this


i love it it is adorable to look at the characters are adorable you can quickly gather things and change your hand held tool quickly cooking is a bit wonky but it could always be worse 

you get rewarded for doing things you enjoy doing you like to farm theres farming
you like to gather theres that cooking is also there but youre auto picker isnt best so its a lot of single  manual made dishes i wish i could click and say make 5 of these but i cant so far its one at a time

the characters may stand on top of each other when you exit a building 

they love to watch you fish and if you ever wondered the definition of a photo bomber just pull out your camera  you can hit t to get a bigger picture full screen picture

the game is kinda magical imho 
 
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2886681040

this game was gifted to me because i really wanted it and this sweet soul got it for me and it wasnt even on sale  im big on sales i am so thankful 
you can customize some things about your clothing like patterns on your mickey ears pattern on your shirt im still early on and am taking my time but theres so much about this game that is therapeutic and relaxing and encouraging that i cant recommend it enough  theres some guides online and better reviews than this 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2886681344

i recommend you look into updates issues in discussions news and announcements for how active they are and read other reviews for other perspectives i am a woman who loves all things cute and adorable 

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2886681509

hope you like it as much as i do if you get it 

im at 24 hours into the game taking my time so many outfits

#####

when the dlc costs more than what you bought the game for 

#####

quit the game around early april and likely wont be coming back the store prices are still disgusting and seems like the developers couldnt care less about listening any feedbacklowering prices just had a check to see if anything had improved and it has not so leaving my final review

if you dare speak out against the store or anything on the official discord the modscommunity will try to silence and restrict conversation ive seen mods deleting peoples feedback on the premium store on a regular basis quite frankly the main discord is one of the worst most heavily moderated positively toxic communities ive ever been a part of this wouldnt be a huge issue except is the only place to provide ea feedback which you cannot do properly because of the moderatinggatekeeping on said server

here is an imgur link showing posts from premium store feedback channel httpsiimgurcommnuo0pgpng
bear in mind this is a few of the most recent deletion posts and theres a good chance that many people probably dont even realise their feedback is being deleted the mods been doing this since the store opened back in february

highly suggest you avoid unless youre happy to throw 50 into the store every week though i still wouldnt bother as they seem to hate new players  all old star path items are perma removed and will never be available to you if you do decide to give it a try avoid the mainofficial discord like the plague join the dreamlight leaks discord instead

#####

bought early on for my fiance and kids
back then as it was for most of the time since the games been out
it was buy to play early access free to play at release

well the plan changed
now the game isnt free to play with microtransactions
they raised the price on release and not only that wasted no time
in charging another 30 for an expansion
all while having released rotated store content available only through their proprietary currency



i should have known better i mean i did
i took a chance and got delivered only unashamed unabashed corporate greed


do i recommend hell no

#####

i only play vicariously through my teenage son but theres really not much to dislike about this game so long as you like the cosy life sim genre and dont have a disney problem 

it really is well made and produced really good graphics structure and vibe while theres nothing new to speak of it does put all the right ingredients together in the right order with the added charm of dozens of beautifully recreated disney favourite characters and lore which is great so long as you dont have a disney problem

as far as i can tell no microtransations are essential to progress the game which is expansive and always branching  there is always something to do a new challenge a favour for a friend checking up on something your working on so a very fulfilling game offering good playtime value as long as you dont have a disney problem 

in summary a very good fun well made game that will surely satisfy and keep you occupied for many hours but its all about disney

so only dont buy if you dont like cosy lifesim adventures or if you have a disney problem

#####

with the new update a single item from the premium shop costs as much as the base game bit of a slap in the face yeah

#####

tldr was supposed to be freetoplay and now its not and things that shouldnt be locked behind paywalls are

as a big fan of classic disney and an enjoyer of farming games i cannot recommend this game

the gameplay itself is fine basically animal crossing meets disney without the wait times i may add however this game was originally slated to become free to play a year after the initial release gameloft has since not only retracted that meaning you have to pay full price to access the game theyve now introduced dlc that includes characters and locations important to the main story

as it stands in order to get access to the full story you need to pay a minimum of 70 now some of you may think thats normal price for a game but keep in mind this paywall for new content was never once mentioned over the year the game has been out and the base game originally was supposed to become free to play 

but because the game became moderately successful theyve become greedy and are now trying to suck your wallet dry

so if you havent already purchased the game please dont dont allow companies to justify these anticonsumer practices with your money

#####

01112024 

im not seeing this issue as of today  however i am seeing repeats at mcducks shop even though i only have 49 of the furniture unlocked  note that i do not have the expansion yet as i was trying to work my way through the original game first  i grow a ton of pumpkins so i can hit up scrooges shop daily for everything present  yet just today there was only one item in the shop id yet to buy nothwithstanding the table along the right staircase which is the first time in the past _four days_ when i saw something brand new  again i am buying everything in there daily clearing it out empty there are no longer mannequins in the front windows and havent been for months i have bought so much of it

im having trouble seeing what the point is in logging on daily if theres nothing actually updating daily

still not a firm recommend but if you can get it for a tenner itll kill some time

12072023 

oh look the core game now requires items only available in the expansion to meet your villagers requests  as someone who is still working on the story of the core game this sucks  i am now locked out of star path rewards  the path i paid real money for  because i cant make my villagers sand stew which requires materials only available on the eternity isles

imma just not recommend this until gameloft gets the peas out of the potatoes

#####

hii this is my first time writing a review  so sorry if its cringy or anything is spelt wrong as im dyslexic
i hope this helps okay so i like animal crossing so i thought this game would be fun and i love disney a lot this game is very fun and i havent really had trouble with it besides for 23 things the first one is when i build a lot once i close build it freezes and flashes a lot but easy fix just have to restart it i also lag when i first open it but it goes away after a few minutes but thats about it i bought it on my switch and laptop so it was definitively a good game in my opinion

#####

scam company milking people for every dollar promises broken slowly adding dlc they promised would be free 
please dont waste your money and support these scammers

#####

i mean there is walle

#####

my inner child is happy

#####

windows pc wont boot after several crashes

my laptop is dell g7 and after several crashes my pc wont boot anymore i tried to use dell os recovery and it showed partition table error but after so many attempts to recover my os wont still boot potential buyers beware this is a real hard lesson learned for me when buying early access releases

i had some crashes with other games and so rarely but i was able to recover before but this is the worst since the built in recovery tool was not able to repair it completely i know this is early access game just spreading this for awareness

#####

my 4 year old is having a blast with this very simple and easy for him to play and learn but there is a bit too much dialogue for kids regardless i am sure many older kids and adults play as well so its not a real concern

#####

cooking with remy is all ive ever wanted 1010

#####

scummy practices and decisions as many others bought ultimate early access to support what was supposed to be a free game now its turning out to be like diablo with macro transactions in a paid game lets not kid oourselves they stopped being microtransactions a long time ago

#####

this game needs a reality check lots of updates that makes it even more grinding than it needs to be for decoration your valley this game offers to a degree some hours thats indeed fun for the overall so far disney experience but this is slowly but surely turning into a seasoncosmic infested game thats not worth the time money or energy 
the recent updates have made to slow progress on all bug related issues and its sad to see how much focus the microtransactions are getting i understand why they are there and why a company thinks its a good idea but this is keeping the company in mind and not the players

get it when its free and play the story quests dont bother with buying the gameearly access or the season pass moon stones

#####

gorgeous game new content seems around the corner often and tons of old characters and familiar ones to wander and explore with
ive had zero problems with the game so far though i have seen a few people having some in the forums only thing that does draw it out and kind of the point is real life timing on crops and a quest or two

#####

i was ok with supporting the base game and its obvious license cost during ea for already somewhat steep converted 35usd in local bucks iirc the largermax pack was around 6080
thankfully i did not purchase any bigger packs in anticipation of gameloftdisney pulling obvious greedy and disgusting ahattery

as other reviewers pointed out numerously after getting carried and generously financed through ea by many fans and families the greed reigns supreme over fairness and gratitude gameloft andor disney pulling an ea sims4 and paradoxworthy pricing model with following numbers in my region

35 basegame to get carried for an incomplete game through ea
or 6080 for the largermax ea supporter package

only to end up with following greedy ripoff converted localusd pricing after 10 release

 47  basegame
 83 gold edition
 120  total for a gold edition and their first dlc d
 which doesnt even include any passes or other expensive greedy and simplistic ingame mtx paywalls and whatnot for a cozy but after all quite a simplistic and primitive game

thankfully such situation doesnt apply to myself but if you are the kind of individual or family thats barely able to pay all bills and insurance let alone have some quality of life while working 100 or more while still potentially supporting such a game at full price well then i guess you get what you deserve anyways all the others  can thank a passive ignorant majority that cheers and revels at purely evil greedy crooked and vile institutions governments and corporations including the likes at gameloft management who clearly have zero morale ethics and zero empathy for life or anything thats even remotely sacred or truly valuable

if you are financially struggling but unable to notice any similarities between the social cultural and political causes and problems in your life compared to business practices and greed cultivated in gamelofts upper management well i guess then no one can help you

examples of negativity and greed do not get much clearer than this  right here


#####

pay attention to the recent reviews from long time players i have probably well over 200 or more hours clocked into this gamebut i played on xbox pc live until i very regrettably chose to buy it for the switch 

it was brilliant fun at first so i invested in the 80 ultimate package i purchased this under the pretense that 1 it could even halfway function on the switch its been almost a year and it still cannot 
and 2 that the money i payed for special edition cosmetic items and early access would allow me to enjoy all the fun of the game a huge part of this being the decorations and styling our avatars and designing clothing 

the storyline was enjoyablea little lacking but i assumed when i logged in today after taking a hiatus since probably around dec or earlier of 2022to see a ton of new developments lots of rewards for the total 140  dollars or so i have spent on this game trusting that the switch would be fixed and buying the platinum  on steam 

at that timethey were refunding those who had to buy again and werent being given the special edition items at that timethis game had a lot of promise despite some pretty horrific bugs that made it tbh basically unplayable unless on the pc 

as others have saidthis game was advertised falsely  the full controller support is false its actually abysmal i frequented the discord server for a while as well and yesas others have saidvery policed i ended up just keeping my mouth shut and leaving 

to log in today and see that not only are the bugs just as bad as they were priorbut now those of us who got the special opportunity to collect items before it became free to play with micro transactions have a fun new opportunity to spend what is some of the most inflated pricing for cosmetics ive ever seen

i dont blame devs for this im sure they are doing whatever they are able this is the result of greed pure greed the game has turned into any other phone game where you are essentially just mindlessly doing tasks with time controls in place just to get yourself a measly cosmetics

if a fanbase invests money in a beta or early access gamei expect returns for that and honestly this has been a slap in the face

i feel very badly for the devs here and wish them the very best but disney has gone mad with this one this game doesnt have a large base of younger or very young fans the demographic that already bought this game is the demographic it appealed to and we werein more ways than onebasically scammed

i really enjoyed this game in the start i enjoyed the discord before i saw what kind of behavior was happening there and fans themselves being treated incredibly poorly i enjoyed the time i got to spend decoratingin between constant game crashes i enjoyed the storyline and characters chosen doing this to a demographic who spends less on sims planet zoo and morewill ruin this games chance at anything 

its a bummerit was an enjoyable game but im not going to spend every second of my day trying to get the last free items we all really payed massive amounts of money forso i can feel better about the greed that occurred here 

this is clearly a cash grab and somehow an incredibly blatant and bold one that appears to have no remorse 

i cannot recommend this game at all actually i do not trust whomever is controlling these prices to not continue this and worsen it and i will not compete for special items while this company acts as if this game has anything substantial to offer beyond this design aspect not when it costs like it doesnowduring early access already or honestlyever again

#####

this game is not worth it they started off telling people the game will eventually be free then canceled that and added paid dlc and characters behind pay walls all on top of in game payed cosmetics and battle passes its unfair and its only going to get worse

#####

at first i really enjoyed this game but for a game that is about the decorating and beautification of your island it was super frustrating that in order to get any items you would have to fork out more money then they release a dlc that costs almost as much as the base game which is a joke especially for a game they originally said would be free to play they lost my trust and i will not invest more time into the game

#####

i enjoyed playing this game when it first came out cozy gameplay and disney characters is obviously a winning combination but this game is truly the most egregious cash grab ive ever come across originally they said the game would eventually be freetoplay so microtransactions for cosmetics made some sense with the way the game industry currently operates though i would argue that cosmetics should be considered fundamental aspects of a decorating game now theyve walked that back so after paying full price for a game you still have to pay for content within that game and the prices are ridiculous 20 for three pieces of furniture 15 for one house skin or for a questline and a character skin before the game is even out of early access theyre doing a paid dlc i stopped playing this game months ago because the relaxing nostalgic feelings inspired by the characters and gameplay are utterly overshadowed by feelings of anger and disgust due to these exorbitant microtransaction prices

#####

taking a beautiful fantasy realm and turning it into a moneymaking dystopia disney all over

its like animal crossing is using pokémons engine but its disney characters

at least there are no ugly villagers i have to boxin on a cliff in their yard to maybe hopefully try to get rid of yes i am a monster

i was very happy with this game until this morning i just updated the game on my switch i had well over 120 hours grinded unnecessarily made like 5 huuge farm lands once i updated the game i hit continue and its forcing me to start a new game ive never felt so much hatred towards a game i literally want to punch mickey mouse in the face to death i doubt ill pick this game up ever again it mostly works

810

#####

a great game ruined by greed promised to make the game free on release nope its 30 or 70 if you want just a few extra things in the game emphasis on few promised to release free content upon release nope that is another 30 for a little bit extra content dont give money to liars

#####

this has no right being this enjoyable it is however very very enjoyable

dreamlight valley is relaxing scratches that checking things off a list and collection itch in a nice world with fun recognizable characters works like a dream pun intended on the steam deck and its as if it was tailormade for it easy to jump in for 1015 minutes and do something but also easy to suddenly realize five hours have passed and youre somehow very hungry even though you spent some of those five hours cooking ingame the character customization is excellent and it has decent enough decorating

it is in early access though and deserves that label for now since there are plenty of bugs  but none that makes the game harder to recommend theyre mostly small annoyances that i hope they get sorted

i never thought i would put 86 hours and counting into this and honestly it doesnt feel like i have

#####

i bought the ultimate founders version of the game and ill be honest i never use any of the outfits or companions but thats not to say i regret buying it just if youre a completionist  buy it if not you dont need it 

the game does a great job of tutorial to free roam though most of the valley will be locked blocked by night thorns your menu is your bestfriend it will show you where gemsfruitsvegetablesfish will be on your map so consult it as much as needed there is no set order for which thorns you should remove first you are free to open them in any orderbut your quests will definitely guide you on which biome you needi literally opened the biome i needed for a quest like 2nd to last so was not progressing through the story for the longest time lol

this game is early access yes i have to yell it for the people in the back early access  it has bugs some funny some annoying as heck i only regret not getting the game sooner i got it january 2023 and have been playing a lot ever since

#####

devs are liars do not buy this game

#####

before i begin i want to point out that i am an older cisgender straight male who loves action movies explosions and games like doom and company of heroes 

and i absolutely adore this game 

one of the few early access titles i feel 100 satisfied in purchasing i bought this game because i am into the type of exploration and systematic unlocking of certain gates within the game while it unravels a compelling story despite the bugs that are predictably in an unfinished game nothing i have encountered has been severe enough for me to uninstall and wait for it to bake a bit longer im eagerly awaiting updates as i push to become best friends with all of the available characters each of their stories and questlines feels so nostalgic to their characters the way that the characters mesh with each other and bring to light their individual desires all the while remaining in a persistent state of positivity and encouragement is extremely refreshing and compelling characters encourage you to keep doing what youre doing and fill you with positive reinforcement as you go about your tasks and it genuinely makes me feel better id recommend this game in its current state to anyone that loves fetch quests building and exploring and disney as a whole the monetization is a minimal aspect to the game and while i completely understand that it might cause some other reviewers to react negatively i dont feel that its intrusive or takes away anything from the game although that might change when multiplayer is incorporated 

see below for observations both positive and negative 

1 while its great that the devs allow any and all clothing to be worn by any body style id really like to see more specifically maleoriented options  especially as quest rewards i understand that its a bit difficult when a literal disney princess offers an iconic dress but this is your time as a dev to use your imagination and create a male equivalent how about a frozen tuxedo or a minnie mouse polka dot button down oxford shirt it would add a lot of value for you to be inspired by classical apparel in new and interesting creations 

2 your sound designers are fantastic all the ambient crystal hums and fauna sounds in the different zones make the game really pop the inspired musical scores make me want to buy the soundtrack please keep doing that perhaps create some special remixes and allow the player to play them with the dj booths dance partiesemotes i also encourage you to add location specific easter eggs chances for certain sounds like hyenas cackling in the elephant graveyard or play the fantasia music when interacting with the magical broom 

3 some of your bugs are a bit frustrating but expected examples characters not allowing you to pass through or push them randomly add an unstuck feature players sometimes dont transition when enteringexiting buildings fixed by alttabbing outin the game 

4 some of the props furniture etc is really too expensive its taking almost a week to gather all the flowers to build a single balloon arch doesnt that seem a bit excessive heres a suggestion allow the character to build zone specific stalls like kristoffs bring in the 7 dwarves and let them mine gems in a mine similar to walles garden and moanas fishing boat 

5 donald falls down way too much 

6 ariel and ursula are quite challenging to level up as friends because you cant hang out with them perhaps provide an alternative way to interact such as fetching random doodads for ariels collection like when digging with walle or provide ursula with magical potions and be a test subject for her drink this potion and briefly turn into a fish flopping on the ground 

7 real time constraint can be really offputting to those that can only play the game certain times of the day consider making the daynight cycle a 4 6 or 12 hour rotation instead allow changes to propsfurniturelights to be based on time of day characters sleeping is an excessive gate that really doesnt need to be there consider removing or exchanging for an alternative arielmoana is exploring or buzz and woody are playing etc 

8 weather is great but this is a magical world make some rare weather twinkling lights in the swamp fireworks around the castle magical blue snow in the frost etc 

great job yall  keep it up

#####

so good just wish the expansion was free content

devolved into a cringe cash grab not worth the time or money it has maybe 10 worth of content that they now charge 60 for just monetizing peoples enjoyment of disney dont pay 60 just to see an empty husk of a character walking around and sometimes give you a one line from a movie

#####

this is my girlfriends favorite game so you should play it

#####

cant recommend simply because the devs are dishonest and show no appreciation to people who bought their expensive ass founders pack bullshit not going free to play and charging for characterstory dlc get fucked gameloft

#####

this game is really cute with beautiful graphics i loved it and was enjoying it so much until i was so bored of waiting to move on at first their was so much to do and i was progressing at a good pace until i seen how long the orb grows in the sunlit plateau scar biome it took a few days for it to complete but i decided to try and do other things in the game then when i got to one of the last seeds available in the game currently which is pumpkins and found they take 4 hours in real time to grow i thought i hope this isnt going to be a mobile pay to win type of game for pc now im down to my last few quest with all the characters that i have leveled up all the way and omg tedious as hll very very slow moving ive been waiting hrs and hrs and hrs and hrs for progression in these remaining quests no exaggeration now im positive this will be a mobile type game available on pc platform i looked it up and sure enough it is just go to screen rants website and you will see sure this game will become free in 2023 but there is a reason the game is synced to real time but there is a reason you need to be connected to the internet while playing there is a reason you will end up needing to wait for hrs upon hrs if not a days to progress faster as to keep playing there is a reason and that very reason is to milk you for all youre worth it is a very cute game as i have said but its by a mobile game developer game loft who is just using the walt disney franchise as a very greedy way to make lots of money i feel like it was such a let down towards the end when i realized it was gonna be a mobile kinda game whata shame fellow gamers please dont waste your hard earned money on a greedy developer if you do youre only supporting the idea of turning all pc games into endless money pitted mobile games and its so disgraceful when i play a game on my laptop i dont intend to be on it for just a few minutes and leave to wait forever to progress i play on my laptop for a real game where i dont have to stop suddenly cause its too slow and boring and i have to wait for a crop or whatever the item maybe for 4 hrs or more also for beauty  the beast fans dont hold your breath they are not in the game right now as shown in the advertisement it all ends up being a let down

to gameloft
i would advise you to re think the route you are bringing this game why not just have people pay for a base game then put out dlc packs with for example 1 new biome a couple new characters a few new clothing furniture items a few new quests a couple new crops seeds and recipes etc i would buy the packs like ea does with the sims but instead you are gonna turn this game into a greedy mobile cash cow game and you wanna make people wait hrs if not days for any kind of progression this simply is just not fun to play this way on my pc so please take the ea sim route of this game if you need to keep making money on it i paid for the ultimate edition for this game and 70 plus tax is more than enough

#####

i know everybody has been saying such positive things about the game and while it is amazing there are a few things you should know or else you will be me and get stuck and frustrated easily

 invest in okra early make a big ol plot of okra to farm and sell it will really kick start your gold amounts
 the more friends you have in a skill and the higher friendship you have with said friends the better the bonuses are doesnt matter which friend you have equipped so i recommend switching out friends when you max out a friendship make sure you have plenty of buddies in every skill
 speaking of always do everything with a buddy everything it will make you level up so much faster
 the game is in early access it has bugs live with it
 buy out clothing from scrooge when you can furniture cycles but i find clothes dont really cycle well but once you own it it shouldnt repeat so its good to buy things just so you can find what you want
 you can basically change most anything later dont sweat about placement
 merlin and a lot of the realms characters are very important in terms of progression so level those friendships up early if at all possible

#####

disneys version of animal crossing

#####

i will start this off by saying as a full grown manchild i was sceptical when my partner told me how good this game was my manly brain couldnt process how a disney game would be appealing but my partner got me into this game with the allure of an animal crossing style game something we both played together during lock down i tend to only play when my partner is playing but still it is a fun game and i have sank a decent amount of time into it it is one of those games where you will say to yourself i am just going to do a little more mining then come off and then 4 hours pass

if you enjoyed animal crossing then this is the game for you i dont bother with making my island look pretty but there is a lot of grind to get done for resources and achievements which i enjoy plus a bit of competitive play as i try to catch up with my partner managed to get this fps player to try something different and in the ever growing cozy gaming category



#####

what could be a great game with so much ip to chose from and bring together is tainted by instability poor customer service events based around buying premium reward tracks every 30 odd days grind grind and more grind all rounded off by quest time gates as it stands they are just developing a micro transaction filled mobile game for the pc
so after the latest big free update  the cash shop has appeared and wow this seems to be looking to be a contender for diablo immortal with regards to micro transactions and how fast you can claw money from the player base their wording of latest big free update along with these practices they are already showing in early access looks that before long you will be paying to get latest updates and methods by which they can take money from you in their grind fest
a serious hard pass on recommending this game in this state

#####

this is the second time i have purchased this game and third platform to play it on  my hours prior to getting it on steam for my deck were about triple what they are as of this writing for this version

the basic summary is that if you are a fan of animal crossing andor stardew valley you will enjoy this since it basically copying all the mechanics and features you liked and several you didnt like  the game is still in early access and will be ftp later this year or next and there are still some things being worked out by the devs

for starters its a massive mess when it comes to collecting stuff and storing it  there are 21 different crops you can plant for example and almost as many different kinds of crystals gems and other minerals not to mention harvestable resources like various kinds of good stones dirt etc

that would be awesome if it wasnt such a pain storing it all  the storage chest system is being overhauled in the update 3 due next week on feb 16 2023 and i hope they do a massive bit of fixing for it to make it easier and less irritating

once you have opened up the full map and unlocked access to all the crops and various things you can foragemine then the sky is the limit when it comes to what you can do with decorating and rearranging your valley elements  the story and friend missions are all simple fetchcrafttalk quests and theres a lot of them with more getting added with each new character put into the game

the controls are pretty easy to get used to if you have played other games but there is little in the way of documentation or telling you how to do stuff early on  you have to either figure it out or go online and seek out communities of players  for example when you are trying to unlock remy from ratatouille there is a task where you help him in his kitchen and he asks you to wash dishes  the dishes are in a glittering bin on the floor so you cant miss them  what it doesnt tell you is that there is no interaction prompt  you walk up to them and have no idea what to do  you cant pick them up and there is nothing which pops up  it was on a whim that i pulled out my watering can and poured water on them and that did it  for this reason very young players or people who are not used to established game mechanics from other games might have some difficulty and frustration in trying to progress and learn

overall the game is a success in my view and worth the price if you want something along the lines of games already mentioned  the best thing if the devs hold true is that the game will be expanded continuously in the future with a mix of free and paid dlc updates to add to the game and fix user issues or feature requests

#####

it has potential but its definitely not worth the price considering how buggy and lackluster it is hopefully the developers will listen to the players more and improve the game later on especially when they said it was originally going to be a free game smh

#####

i like a game at least sometimes with no deadlines no time limits no rush or stress i like the open world concept so that i can create the world the way i want to while i do find several of the npc characters to get very irksome and repetitive with their few lines of dialogue i dont usually have to associate with them for any reason beyond quests this game is a pleasant way to pass the time in the same way that animal crossing is

#####

truly addicting and really fun definitely a relaxing chill out game
ive finished all there is currently in the game but for a new player there is loads to do already and im looking forward to seeing what they add and what new characters are going to be added as its disney the list if almost endless d

star path can sometimes feel like a chore but otherwise the tasks are mostly pretty simple
i wish you could craft more than one food item at a time maybe a max of 5 or something would be good
placement of items can sometimes be a little annoying and i wish you could place things a lot closer together

but other than those few picky things id definitely recommend the game if youre looking for something chill to play and enjoy games that are sim like 


update 
so they added a premium shop which seems to change items every 5 or so days and the items it sells are cosmetic house items decorations outfits hair styles and so on the catch being you need moonstones to buy these item sets and the pricing is not good much like any other games that have micro transactions
you can find moonstones in blue chests as you play but nowhere near enough to be able to get a set of items or all 4 sets from the premium shop so if you really badly want that stuff you buy moonstones with real money for this reason i wouldnt recommend the game as its just ridiculous i knew they where adding in the ability to buy moonstones at some point and i should have known the pricing would not be good
you do not have to buy the items to enjoy the game and i would never suggest buying the items from the premium shop or buying moonstones but hopefully its your money and you do with it what you please
they could have easily added other tasks for limited times where those items were rewards or popped them in scrooges shop for a high gold price you know the currency that you dont pay for

premium shop and moonstones are a huge no no i wish there was a mixed option when writing a review as i personally do really like the game as there is tons to do and its pretty relaxing but the premium shop is not necessary there should be other ways to get pretty items like you know quests or scrooges shop

ignoring the premium shop and the buying of moonstones i would still recommend the game


update 2 i just wanted to add some more thoughts about the moonstones and premium shop the chests you can find that have moonstones in them now have 50 stones the store still rotates items and the items seem to come back around occasionally that ive seen 
what i really want to say in this updated review bit though is out of all the games that have micro transactions that ive played disney dreamlight valley is one of the better ones since playing the game through a lot of updates and star path seasons ive managed to get extra tasks for most of the star path seasons which you unlock with moonstones i missed one though and buy some things from the premium store all without buying moonstones 

ive managed to do all that because there are a few ways you can get moonstones for free of course you still have the chests you can find but now they also have a dream snaps competition each week and you can earn moonstones just by participating

im not saying that i now love micro transactions woohoo no i still think theyre not good but unfortunately thats how a lot of games are now im just saying that disney dreamlight valley is more giving to their players which is surprising because well disney haha

anyway as i mentioned ive not bought a single pack of moonstones and i personally dont plan on it as i can get them just by playing there have been certain things in the store that i just personally dont care for but if you are someone who wants it all youll probably have to spend some money to get it all


disregarding the store completely though the game is still very much enjoyable and you dont need anything from the premium shop to enjoy it

#####

its a good game fun for disney lovers however i felt the need to refund it because for me at least its very timeconsuming and grindy still a positive experience but i do recommend going in with the expectation that it will be a gridndfest to build stuff and access all the items if you are ok with that and love disney its a nobrainer i dont have too much time on my hands to play only this so for me its a pass but i am sure it will be great for tons of people

#####

i loved this game for so long because if you want you can just grind away and get stuff with ingame made money i was literally in tears realizing that you now have to buy premium rewards now even just for the mostly cool  event items really makes me sad i really hope they fix this

#####

i really like this game it felt cool to explore the worlds and storylines of the characters its really cool to level up your friendship you get rewarded for every playstyle

i find it really annoying how they integrated the microtransactions and even a battle pass especially considering its a kids game kids will never be safe from this kind of frick and thats sad

#####

games wack
why does my paid for game have an energy gauge that is so limited that its like someone took mobile game mechanics and force fed them into a game that we have to pay for

#####

im very disappointed in this company i bought this game thinking it would eventually be free to play but no of course instead they lied to us and its all just a dumb money grab waste of time and money

#####

so far i am really enjoying this game as an almost 30 year old guy i first saw dreamlight valley and wrote it off as another kids game

then i had a friend who said she has been playing it daily and has to peel herself away from it i totally get it now

this is what i wish animal crossing was during lockdown the bonus is all the disney characters you know and love 

gameplay is smooth and easy to end up grinding for hours when you tell yourself ill pay for 20 minures

microtransactions are all cosmetic so if you dont like spending real money on pixels the dont they dont force you to buy anything

yes a season pass is implemented into a paid game but its a 30 game some people seem to forget that diablo 4 an 80 game also has a seasons pass  microtransactions

i just dont get all the gripe behind a dlc being added for more story content again its a 30 game if you want the devs to keep pushing free qol updates past 1 year after release dlc and microtransactions make sense

no one of forcing you to spend real money on that fancy pet or tool set 

#####

greedy developer trying to cash in on a game that alreay sadly failed  see player numbers on steamdb for that

didnt really fix things in a yeear of ea game barely changed quality of life still is bad designed as liveservice game imagine stardew valley but more grindy etc little to no content but wait they now want 30 bucks from you for some dlc while the main game still is barebones

i hate trashing the game and i didnt until they crossed a line in my opinion

fix your game make it non tedious to play then we can talk about dlcs and stuff that are as axpensive as the game was when i bought it

#####

idreamlight valleyi is like if you were to throw ianimal crossingi the disney corporation a little bit of iharvest mooni and the eensiest dash of ikingdom heartsi into a blender and add microtransactions

in the game you play as a customizable human character which i would advise designing in the separate character creator to get some bonus items who finds themselves transported to the titular valley after falling asleep at their childhood home youll find yourself helping out many disney characters that live there while unraveling the mystery of the valley and its affliction called the forgetting theres almost no end to what you can do in a day and you can easily find yourself playing for hours before finally deciding youve had enough for now

judging by blank doors and empty docks they are planning to add ia loti so there will probably be an intimidating amount of things to do whenever it is that the final update drops

now the game isnt perfect originally this was going to go free to play this idea was scrapped but left over from that are aforementioned microtransactions in the form of a premium shop with items that circulate once a week as well as the games equivalency of a battle pass the star path with some things in the latter being impossible to get without paying for the premium version these are overall cosmetic in nature but there are some larger packs that introduce questlines and if you miss anything from a star path it seems you are out of luck so shame on you for being a johnnycomelately fortunately you can earn some of the premium currency by finding a chest that randomly spawns once a day and participating and voting in the weekly screenshot contests

on a mixed note sometimes characters are based more on the sequel to their movie so elsa and anna are in ifrozen 2i form with their original outfits being locked behind a circulating paywall some characters also have models that feel off in the style of the game

the voice acting can be hit or miss too remy and buzz are actually voiced by their respective actors and sound just as good as they would in their films woody and vanellope are voiced by their original performers siblings so they sound similar but slightly off anna and elsa arent voiced by their original actors but they sound close but the strangest case is stitch who is voiced by his original actor but i assumed was an imitator because he sound quite the same

the music can also be a mixed bag oftentimes a remix of a theme from one of the properties  will play hearing a peppy version of ithe mickey mouse clubi theme can be a little jarring scar doesnt have be prepared play when you hang out with him just an elephant graveyard type song it was a bit disappointing but now i am just getting into nitpicking territory

all in all i would recommend this game if youre a disney kid one at heart or just want a fresh alternative to nintendos popular life simulation game

#####

its like animal crossing and disney  a little kingdom hearts pretty fun

#####

im a long time disney fan and let me tell you this is everything i couldve ever dreamed of talking to some of my favourite disney and pixar characters makes me so happy and just the little things like going fishing and harvesting plants and feeding the wildlife really make this game so much more fun of course its still early access and i reckon there will be some bumps along the way but so far in the small amount of time i have played this ive loved every single moment

#####

this game is fine its a life simulator similar to nintendos animal crossing but with disney characters and more of a story while you can play this without spending any money they do show you the micro transaction store just enough to give you some fomo they announced this game would eventually be freetoplay but recently went back on that and said it will retain its 2999 usd price while this price isnt bad it having micro transactions for items and clothes you cant otherwise get still along with a season pass makes it annoying at least its either a freetoplay game theyre charging 30 dollars for or a 30 dollar game they also put micro transactions in

i bought this game in early access while i had covid and couldnt do much else and stuck with it for a while i even had a glitch that got me stuck in the story so i couldnt continue when i told gameloft they had a very generic response just explaining how to do the quest i told them they didnt help and waited months for another response by the time they got back to me properly i had already restarted my save file so i may keep playing the game

overall i cant recommend this game because any game that you have to pay for to play that also has micro transactions just feels like double dipping to me not to mention they lied saying it would be free once it came out of early access go get animal crossing instead or another life sim

#####

an endless checklist constant feeling of reward brain chemicals go brrrrrrr

#####

this game is great for an easygoing player who likes games where they can start and stop when they please
it has a farming element although there arent many growable items you can fish mine cook and forage whilst you complete quests 

that being said it isnt without its faults the game suffers from clunky pathways especially when your quest is to speak to someone in a river ariel ursula and you cant reach them until they spawn in a different location
personally i would have enjoyed more challenges and areas to interact with the portals are a bit naff as there is only a small space to go to and you cant explore or touchcollect items unless its specific to the quest youre on 
i think this game is great but considering its disney and relatively pricey youd probably expect more

in terms of accessibility you can play with a controller on pc which is always handy the overall functions for each task isnt complicated so most actions can be done without intense button mashing 

i wouldnt recommend buying it at full price but it is worth having in your library for a cosy laidback gaming session

#####

works like a phone freemium game

#####

i bought this game in ultimate edition when it first became available the game is cute in general and offers a cozy nostalgic vibe but it quickly got repetitive and really boring nostalgia alone kept me playing it i wanted to unlock characters etc however it now is more like a mobile game with its financial paywalls decorating is a core game mechanic that requires a lot of real money to be spent on the games premium currency in order to get access to you also have to pay real money for dlc content that gives you access to new biomes or content in the game its actually awful everything you do in the game is extremely repetitive in a slow and boring way it feels like i endlessly have to forage against my will just to keep the place clean storage is extremely difficult to increase and feels gated over time nothing but the characters themselves bring life to the game and the characters only walk around making sounds unless they are directly related to a quest it just isnt fun if you like disney enough to spends lots of money to see it you will like the game if you like to do the same thing endlessly with meh rewards you will love tthis game if you want to pay for the game repeatedly you will like this game for me though its not fun enough to even keep it installed i cannot recommend

#####

disappointed i wont be able to unlock the new area and characters and items 
disappointed that as an early access member all i get is a couple of cosmetics
thankful i didnt buy the ultimate edition because then i would have paid more and still not be getting the dlc
frustrated that you made a f2p game with in game purchases chose to have people pay 52 for the game instead and then ask them to pay 39 almost full price for dlc plus you are still keeping the in game purchases and not giving us a way to earn the new expansion either with moonstones or game play or anything 
all that being said i did love this game i want to support games i like and support the developers artists and creators that made this game what it is i dont care if people need to pay to own and play but dont hide content behind paywalls and respect the early access gamers that have supported you from the start


#####

if you are looking for the experince of living in a magical disney theme park where you have a daily repetitive task list thats pretty chill and easy to do while listening to podcasts then youll probably like dreamlight valley that being said it does crash glitch and softlock quest progression a lot and should probably not be out of early access already but if you thought you were going to get disney does animal crossing this is not it 

build the perfect neighbourhood is such a misleading line you have very little control over much in this game you can fully customize exactly three things what your character wears the interior design of your house and the outdoor landscaping nothing else you cant even customize what the outside of your own house looks like and a lot of times you dont even get to pick which neighbours show up in fact i think gameloft assumed you would want all the characters in your neighbourhood because they all have interlocking quests and it seems like you cannot progress the main plot if you dont try to collect them all the game also doesnt really treat the characters like they are the characters from the moviesshows they treat them like they are theme park actors and while i dont speak for anyone else its really off putting to me it feels like the game wants me to treat them like dolls to be played with and not characters to connect with it actually makes doing things for them feel like a chore

if you want a game where you are able to chooseremove nieghbours or you want to design a particular aesthetic for your neighbourhood be advised that this game will not allow you to do either 

for the core gameplay itself it is very minimal and repetitive but its hard to realize that at first since its got that freemium mobile game flow design that really sucks you in 

for the life sim part there seems to be a ton of things to do and lots of things to see but by day five it started to get old fast because you will essentially be doing the same things every day talking to the characters every day becomes a bore even though its clear that the team put a lot of work into the written dialogue its probably because each character only has about two or three voice acted phrases and they repeatedly shout them at you as you walk by as you are chatting with them or as they walk by you you cannot escape it unless you turn off voice for everyone in the sound menu

for the adventure part im not sure who this is for the adventure itself is less about exploring discovering and more about fetch quests in fact i think every adventure part of the game so far has just been a fetch and make quests as in fetch the thing now make a thing with the thing you just found now use the thing you just made the worst might be the times where the game tries to mix it up and makes you wait until two characters decide get close enough to talk to each other then you just have to sit there waiting while they have a conversation without you if you walk away from the conversation they will stop until you come back and then they will start from the beginning of their conversation you cannot make them talk faster and the quest will not progress until they are done then there are the other worlds that you can access through the castle to explore and find new characters they are tiny like bachelor apartment to basketball court tiny worlds they are basically rooms you enter and can finish exploring in less than a minute filled with even more fetch and make quests you will never return once you are done unless its part of another quest because theres nothing else to do there

im not going to really go into the economy system in any detail but it feels like this was supposed to be a freemium game that pivoted last minute to a paid game its not great

and lastly this game is barely a few months out and theres already fan controversy about one of the neighbours spoilermother gothelspoiler is a key character that shows up once you start spoilerthe curse questspoiler you have no control over whether or not you let them in to the neighbourhood spoilerif you find her triggering at all since she is literally the personification of an abusive parent you are going to have a bad time she will follow you around until you take on her first quest demanding that you help her she will constantly be around and like all the other characters will shout one of her three phrases at you if you or she gets too close you cannot ignore her the game will not let youspoiler 

if you want an adventure game with disney characters its probably better to just get kingdom hearts and if you want a neighbourhood life sim its probably best to stick with animal crossing i cannot recommend this game

#####

disney dreamlight valley is one of the best comfort games around even if you arent super obsessed with disney i love the amount of quests there are i hardly ever get bored in the valley theres always some work to do also just remember this game is still fairly new there will be soo much more content in the future have fun saving your valley rulers 

#####

when i heard about the bugs i was super skeptic to buy this but also because im not that big of a disney fan a lot of people say only buy this game if you are a huge fan well im not a huge fan and i still really love this game there is sooo much to do and if you love decorating youll love everything youre able to do in this game

basically if you love animal crossing and stardew valley just get this immediately

#####

game is not gonna be f2p so keeping the moonstone packs purchasable in the store is a joke just remove this bs currency also keeping future characters locked behind 30 dlc i was looking forward to unlocking rapunzel at least what a bad decision l devs

#####

when im not playing and mmorpg i am a self admitted simfarming junkieand this game is really fun  i am not a disney lover by any means and i still have enjoyed this game  even though all the characters are from disney its not overkill there is so much to do but there isnt anything that seems out of reach  im only 10 hours in and i cant wait to continue the journey  make sure to do your avatar first so you can import it over before starting

#####

i resisted this game for a while but as a new mom who loves gaming but struggles to find the time this is heaven sent i play it on the steamdeck and it ports over beautifully its very much disneys version of animal crossing or stardew valley there are story quests event quests character quests etc there is optional dlc and micro transactions but you dont really need to spend more money to enjoy the game there is still the occasional bug but i find it a very relaxing game and very easy to pick up and put down if i only have a half hour here or there to play it got me through those long nights with a new baby theres an autosave feature but also manual save great disney soundtrack some of the characters like mother gothel and beast are reallllly annoying lol

#####

absolutely greedy the base game was 30 before it got fully released it got fully released with the dlc and is now 40 and the dlc is 30 so 70 in total which is a aaa title nowadays 

its absolutely not worth it ingame currency so you get their version of the battlepass still with the 70 bucks you pay i really enjoyed the game in the beginning but reconsider pirating it because those greedy devs shouldnt make a single cent out of this game after the decision they made

#####

writing a review because i see a lot of misconceptions of this game i love it btw

does dreamlight valley have micro transactions yes 

do any of them pertain to the main story no 

character bundles are mostly clothing options and trivial side stories that add nothing to the story and are basic fetch quest for each character there are currently two the other thing is the premium shop these sell clothes items and skins for your houses that are all cosmetic not needed for the function of the game 

can you spend real money yes but you can also earn in game currency to buy those items too this used to be achieved by finding blue chest around the valley once per day and getting 10 moon stones now they give you 50 plus you can earn hundreds to thousands of moon stones each week by participating in weekly fashion or decorating challenges these do not require a lot of thought to be honest you just make sure your picture has the right number of that style and vola i have never gotten under 400 moon stones 

does it still take time to get to the 4000 needed for each character yes but at least it is do able 

i hate micro transactions with a passion and i still wish they didnt but i think dreamlight is doing okay with it nothing is needed to play the core game 

as for the dlc that is the same to me as the happy home paradise option in animal crossing new horizons since it has a completely new game mechanic to it 

as for my review of the game it is lovely and very much an animal crossing meets disney hybrid would recommend for that

#####

walle is cute

#####

the fact i paid for the ultimate edition which was 7418 before any of these changes happened i have to pay another 30 for the dlc absolutely not folks who paid that much a game that costs more than your current expensive edition should automatically get the dlc for free never getting my positive vote wish i could just get a refund instead of having this

#####

a warm bath of my childhood

#####

how are you gonna charge 30 for an expansion when the full game isnt even really done

#####

i love this game but its such a cash grab so i cant support it

#####

i like this game but two things have dragged it down

1 missions that can only be completed at certain times of day i work mornings so i am stuck on a mission other people have other life commitments edit they have extended the time periods which has helped me but time specific missions are still hard

2 for over a day now that game will not finish loading you into the server they have wasted time putting out hotfixes for other issues the other issues dont matter if we cant play the game

#####

while i enjoy the game i cant in good conscious recommend a game that tells everyone it will be f2p on release to only reverse that decision while adding more and more paid cosmetics in a up until full release singleplayer only title there are plenty other games in the same genre not tied to a billion dollar corporation  that are better and more deserving of your money

#####

what can you say its a disney game good for all ages 
i did come across a few bugs although it is in early access but nothing game breaking 
i highly enjoy the game so far and would still recommend it highly

#####

first of all i wanna say i really love this game its very good and fun also really addictive there is a lot to do and a lot of quests it has characters we all know and love and it looks beautiful its like animal crossing but with characters you know and meaninfull quests and a story it follows

now you may ask okay why did you give it a thumbs down i barely do well let me explain it to you

 free to play
before this game came out officially on dec 5th the game was in early acces as you may know they announced this game as being free on release which would be great so you can easily cross play and use the ingame cloud save anyhow a few months before they said that it wont be free anymore which to me was sad but i thought it was fine like alright they need money to make the game now im starting to think if that might have been the case really or if they just wanted more money from its players they also added 20 euros to the base game when it officially came out the gold edition bundle is reasonable as early acces player you get the decoration items which is nice 

 dlc
havent played the dlc as much yet but it looks great so far it looks really filled with content however i have some problems with it first of all its more expensive than the early acces price of the main game now almost as much as the main game it  really sucks that those characters raps my fav are put behind a paywall and here is why i think they just want more money the dlc isnt really a dlc its more of an expension pass an ingame purchase its linked to 1 cloud save file email and also only accesible on the device you bought it so if you have multiple cloud saves you gotta buy the dlc multiple times which also means you couldnt even use it for cross play but have to pay ingame buy it in game to make sure its linked correctly dont buy it on steam itself and dont download anything why is it locked then you cant even find this clearly you have to really dig on the internet to find this answer its burried on their support page 

im really starting to question which is worse ea or gameloft

will i still continue playing yes does this really suck also yes do i love it yes am i dissappoint yes its really like what i always say all my homies hate and love disney should you buy this its really up to you do you wanna risk having more behind paywalls go for it you dont need the dlc i think so you could also play without besides all the money stuff its a good game worth playing

do not buy this game
1 the battle pass star path in game isnt special nor premium quality the majority of the bp is motifs which are stickers you can use to customize clothes they sell furniture and clothing in the premium store instead of including it in the bp when its very obvious that it is meant to fit the theme of the bp meaning theyre intentionally putting trash in the bp so they can make money in the premium store instead
2 additionally its a massive red flag when theres a premium store before they even finished the story and before they fixed all the bugs
3 the premium store is absolutely predatory fomo bs items may or may not come back the rotation is a weekly duration and in order to collect all of the items they sell in the premium store which is all bundles as you cannot get singular items you would need to drop 50100 dollars which is just not feasible
4 the exchange amount of money to acquire moonstone is honestly awful 5 for 1200 moonstones 10 for 2500 moonstones 20 for 5500 moonstones this is important to know because the premium store will sell one bundle for anywhere between 30006000 moonstones that means if you wanted to get one bundle you have to pay 20 imagine if you want to get all four please keep in mind that the rotation of items is weekly meaning you could be shelling out 80100 a week and 400 a month on this game
4 they have refused to listen to their discord community in regards to the feedback regarding the premium store 

do not encourage this behavior in the game industry while i am happy for you if you make enough money to be able to purchase these items the behavior behind this model is harmful for children and incredibly predatory as much as i wanted to love this game i cannot and will not overlook the scummy behavior

#####

  if you like item collection and the cozy vibe this game does deliver that however with all of the games out there this one is a money sink and doesnt offer anything really different just disney  if your main goal is to play with those characters and vibe with the disney feel then this game is for you just expect to end up paying just as much money then if you went to an actual disney resort minus food costs of course

  an actual f2p game is called palia and offers more with actual multiplayer this game has been my replacement for dreamlight valley and the community is pretty nice and fun to hang around in

#####

to be completely honest i havent had a game that has caught my attention this much in a very long time animal crossing was a huge part of my daily routine when it first came out i love my nintendo switch as much as the next person but im more of a pc gamer disney dreamlight valley is a game that combines my love for pc gaming and animal crossing all into one thing i have owned disney dreamlight valley for almost two months at the time of writing this review and one thing i can say is that it never fails to bore me i find myself logging in everyday to do my daily tasks like talking to villagers gardening or cleaning up my valley on top of that i think the one thing about this game that makes me enjoy it so much is that for me my valley will never be completely finished yes i can decorate the different areas and believe me with 249 hours into this game i still have plenty more to do but i always finding myself changing things or finding new ways to put my creativity to the test one thing i do appreciate is that the game offers a way to earn paid currency by doing weekly challenges for anyone who is worried about the paid currency with the introduction of dreamsnaps you will have no problem earning moonstones i have racked up quite a few moonstones over the past few weeks with these challenges and its a fun way to get the player base involved with the game and the community  i am completely in love with this game and i cannot wait to see what more it has to offer within the upcoming months for anyone who is into disney and loves the concept of animal crossing i would highly recommend this game

#####

its times like these that i dislike how steams rating system is based on a binary do you recommend this game yes or no for disney dreamlight im somewhere in the middle but leaning more towards no having played 10 hours so far i wanted to refund somewhere around 3 hours but that was past steams time allowance for refunds  so i hunkered down and decided to milk this game for all its got after posting this review ill sink more time in to complete all the available early access content but somewhat begrudgingly  just to get my moneys worth out of the 25 i shelled out for it 

this game is going to be completely freetoplay some time in 2023 and i would recommend if youre on the fence to just wait until its f2p as it is now youd just be paying 30 for essentially a grindy f2p mobile game

to disneys credit this game is a solid attempt at a life sim theres definitely isomethingi here 

list
fun to play in chunks of 12 hours at a time
graphics are really nice all the characters items and worlds are wellmodeled and animated
robust character creation options outfits and accessories allow for a high degree of customization mostly unseen in this genre of games
the limited voice acting  mostly short oneliners when you start talking to characters  is really well done i do wish theyd done full va at least for cut scenes
list
 
i might be showing my age here but ddv feels like disneys virtual magic kingdom attempt at an mmo back in the 2000s  but rendered in a way worthy of 2023 i could see 10yearold me really breallyb enjoying ddv but its just not quite scratching the right itch for nowalmost30 me 

h1consh1

some people might think its unfair to compare ddv to animal crossing  a game franchise thats had 20 years to perfect its craft unfortunately its a bit impossible bnotb to compare to acnh or stardew valley two similarly cozy games that involve comparable mechanics mining farming cooking friendships fetch quests etc i would argue that ddv is inferior to both of these games at least in its current state 

theres no combat in ddv to make it a childfriendly rated e for everyone game in line with the disney brand this turns the main game plot into a bglorified series of fetch questsb getting increasingly harder to fulfill as each quest asks for more and more resources some of which are rarer and harder to get im looking at you iron ore 

let me quickly break down the three main forms of currency
olist
dreamlight  earned by completing quests doing common actions like fishing talking to villagers selling items mining etc used for unlocking new realms where you go to complete quests to bring disney characters like moana or anna and elsa back to your town or new areas of the valley certain resources are only attainable in these unlockable areas of the valley equivalent to acnh nook miles
star coins  earned by selling foraging items crops etc to goofys stall completing quests or leveling your friendships with disney characters used for buying seeds crops upgrading goofys stall to offer more items unlocking the fasttravel points buying homes for disney characters upgrading your housestorageinventory space and cosmetic items like furniture and clothing from scrooges shop equivalent to acnh bells
moonstones  premium currency the early access founders pack comes with 8000 but there are ingame battle pass quests to grant additional moonstone used to unlock exclusive premium cosmetics
olist

in order to progress the game you need to grind enough dreamlight and coins to unlock areas and characters lots of farming and fishing which anyone whos played a life sim is understandably down to do but even after shelling out thousands of coins for new areas of the map certain sections are still inaccessible until you upgrade your tools  a quest line that requires a high friendship level with specific characters some of which you need to bring to the valley still and even more grinding for resources 

your storage is super limited with the first few upgrades being pretty reasonably priced but jumping from like 2k to 10k coins out of nowhere until then the only recourse you have is to craft chests to store the million and a half different resources you need to hold onto just in case some random quest later on needs like 20 of it chests are 25 softwood each the point is this game is an bendless grind cycleb where youre always grinding for dozens of resources at once

the brealtime syncb reminds me of animal crossing but without the freedom to time travel through days and seasons if you try to time travel ive heard theres a high risk youll brick your dreamlight save completely so youre stuck playing at a bsnails paceb grinding and waiting for resources to respawn or crops to grow or certain characters to wake up 

for me i only have time in my schedule to play games at night which means certain parts of the game just arent available to me at least with acnh i can change my console datetime to catch up on daytime activities  and with sv there are no such time constraints

heres the thing its not really the grind thats the problem im used to grinding a bit when playing life sims its that the grind is clearly to get you to sink more time into the game artificially with a model thats very obviously going to be f2p this is a game thats bsupposedb to get you to grind to a certain limit each day and log out then log back in tomorrow its a game designed for disney lovers capitalizing on their love for disneys animated properties 

for some people thats enough but for me bddv feels emptyb

not to mention that every single time ive loaded this game ive run into a gamebreaking bug also when i first started playing this game i got incredibly motion sick within 30 minutes had to turn down the graphics which do look very nice tbh and uncheck the flashesscreen shaking settings  and take some nausea meds 

also cooking in this game is so painful for iwhyyyyi you have to drag ieach ingredienti to the pot manually for each recipe and you cant cook in bulk plus recipes sometimes stack and sometimes dont in your already limited inventory space  total pita

h1qol updates that id like to see implementedh1
list
storage and inventory management a sort button for your inventory and storage an auto depositall button like sv has for transferring items from inventory to storage making the house upgradesstorage upgrades cheaper 
quests a way to track multiple quests at once and to track the cost of certain upgrades like unlocking a new area or building a house for a new character 
let us teleport from inside buildings please and add a fasttravel point for the castle 
pls all the gamecrashing bugs especially when enteringexiting houses or trying to bypass whoever youre hanging out with at the time
a way to skip through the dialogue bubbles when characters talk to each other why do they talk so slow i spent the entirety of the moanamaui apology conversation mining and fishing nearby while i waited for them to finish geez 
fastermore visible respawn timers on resources and crops i spent like 30 min waiting for pink hydrangeas to respawn for a moana quest and i ran around for an hour between all the available mining veins to try to gather iron ore or checking on the tomato plant growing in the cave before i finally gave up if we knew how long it would take for these spots to respawn or finish growing i could just log out for a bit and come back but things seem to take anywhere from a few minutes to hours d
list

h1tldrh1 
unless youre a hardcore disney fan just wait til this ones f2p its aight but not worth the 30

#####

after hours in game i honestly cant recommend it
the direction it is going with overpriced dlc constant ingame purchases and the most recent dlc causing issues with the main game this isnt a direction that has a future for the players 
there was a lot of promise when it first came out the story had potential and was a wonderful mix for both older and younger gamers alike there just isnt the replayablity to keep the game alive without spending a huge chunk of money once the main story is over the game becomes a meaningless grind even with the events its just a grind

#####

tldr  disney dreamlight valley is a nothing sandwich

this game couldve been any cozy gamers wet dream instead its just an empty shell where a good game could exist if disney cared about anything other than milking our wallets as much as possible i have completed everything there is to do in the game heres everything they said about the game vs the sad reality

 hanging out with disney characters is extremely bland the only thing they are good for is assigning them a specialty for example if you assign mickeys role to be mining then when you mine an ore theres a chance mickey will throw another piece at you thats your entire friendship with any character

 the quests are laughable collectharvestcraft x thing and deliver to y character or even better go to talk to this guy the most unimaginative repetitive quests ive ever seen

 one thing i was looking forward to was visiting different worlds like walles world theyre just decorative areas where the only thing you do is complete a few quests to make them come to your valley there is never a reason to visit them again you cant do anything you get nothing else from them the worlds are also sometimes just one room like remys kitchen or a kids room for toy story characters

 the store is built on scarcity honestly there are very few clothing items and they only show you a handful each day probably to make sure you dont wipe out the entire store and force you to come back to the game every day theres also a 20 item limit to how many decorative items you can buy in a single day which makes no sense if youre in the middle of decorating a room tough luck come back tomorrow

 the clothes and decorations are for the most part incredibly bland considering its disney there were sooooo many options better than yellow tshirt with logo from movie and teal tshirt with logo from movie are you kidding me the sims 1 had more complex clothing options and they didnt have the technology and resources disney has

 the furniture is infuriatingly minimalistic there are a few pieces that look good but there is sooooo much fluff for example there are 5 or 6 different items that are the same counter but one has the door on the left one has the door on the right really and they multiply that fluff by making the same set in several extremely opaque colors with no texture or detail theyre basically cubes

 the npc interactionsdialogue are laughably shallow same 510 lines of dialogue that dont take into account any of your previous interactions with them when 2 npcs meet they have one or two dialogues which are just prescripted nonsense

 the game is clearly missing chunks of content at the end of a big quest line you usually put together a party and take a picture to complete the quest the game fades to black and im sure theres supposed to be a cutscene there

 the animation glitches are inexcusable for a game thats been in early access for so long ive had the game 6 months prior to full launch there have been no improvements characters glitch all over the place get stuck in a spot while walking teleport to a different area if you enterexit a building 
 jack skellington is very hard to interact with because hes so tall and the dialogue option only appears in certain camera angles add to that that if there are several characters around they tend to gang up on you and ive talked to mickeymirabelremy so many times when i wanted to talk to jack to finish a quest

 the price for premium cosmetic items is ridiculous 10 for a character skin when i already paid 40 are you mad
 like others have said they have a couple questlines behind premium currency paywalls which is a massive dick move on their part
 as an extra fuck you my ursula premium quest was bugged for three months they didnt even fix it at full release they released a patch a week later for a quest that was just collect 10 of x and the 10th item wouldnt spawn its not rocket science to fix that

this game feels like a mobile port and i think it would have worked much better as a phone game free to play and filled to the brim with predatory microtransactions
do yourself a favor and play any other cozy game there are a bajillion of them and none are as bad as this

#####

since this game is no longer free to play they will no longer be evaluated on the basis of oh its free to play what do you expect 

tldr no this game is not worth the total price they are asking for gameplay length is about 30 hrs as of writing this the rest of the time was decorating for different seasons before getting frustrated with the glitchy decorations not saving when leaving the build mode 

so with that in mind this game does not have enough content to warrant the continuously increasing price the game play is decent and has an interesting decoration system but a grindy crafting system tacked on to it the cooking is decently indepth but will give you carpal tunnel if you keep at it for any length of time and the quality of life to let you batch cook will be locked behind a premium paywall its a shame theres not really much point to the cooking system other than to cook large amounts of items to make money which gets super grindy to say the least theres a restaurant where you can serve about 4 characters at a time but they just continue to sit there till its time to shift them out you feed them you dont feed them it makes no difference so no satisfying reason to interact with the system  

you will get the characters unlocked and leveled up in pretty short order along with completing their questlines 

this is a gathering farming mining lifesim without the actual depths of most of the other lifestyle sim games on the market for an insanely cheaper price point 

if you are going to employ all 4 pillars of monetization you better have a the best game ever made and this game fall very short also using the excuse of devs need to make money is simply nonsense there are a million games on the market that are paid gamefree to play games that seem to stay afloat with a fraction of the price and monetization methods that are used in this game manage your budget better

#####

this is an early access review written on launch day
i have to say im extremely impressed i was a bit scared about stamina management microtransactions and such since the developers are gameloft and i normally stay away form those type of games but i have to say  all my fears have vanished gameloft has kept their promises and more all microtransactions are cosmetics only and they have implemented a very forgiving energy system
really they have done everything right with this game so far im in love with the beautiful music graphics and the magical feeling is in the air everything from the easy customization to how fast you can cook has just the right flow and speed
the game runs smoothly on ultra settings and ive only met one minor bug which had a quick solution 
will this style of fetchgame get old fast time will show but so far there is almost too much to do ingame and you are always busy with a fun new quest with motivating and exciting prizes
if they keep this up and stick to this version of the game i can not recommened this game enough

#####

completionists be aware that this game is tied to real time and that there are collectibles only available during certain hours on a particular day ie 10am4pm on mondays this is even worse than ac where you could just try catching certain critters during the weekends 

also from what ive seen so far this game uses fomo to keep you playing there are exclusive items for firstweek preorder you cannot get if you buy the game now there are monthly star paths with exclusive items and at the moment many of these items count towards completion if you dont start the game early enough youll never be able to 100 it which sucks

time travelling would also cause a lot of issues and the devs have said that fixing them isnt a priority 

i suppose this game only caters to people with flexible schedules which is fine but i wouldnt recommend it to people working traditional hours and dont like missing out

also the community is very toxic in general and cannot handle any valid criticism of the game if you talk about the game not having a lot of engaging repeatable content besides decorating they will accuse you of complaining and tell you to stop rushing things they simply cannot accept that their beloved game can be flawed i would recommend people to not engage with the community at all

#####

they said it would launch free to play then they released it with a 40 dlc and you still have to pay for it nasty devs dont support
the game is fun and well made but i was looking forward to playing with friends upon a free to play full release ive played since day 1 but now ive lost interest

#####

i loved this game at release since then there have been changes to the amount of gatherable items to pots that allow you to gather more of a specific thing and now a shop there are quests in the shop now in addition to vanity items 
im disappointed that a game meant for kids to enjoy as well is now a additional purchases type game
no thank you
update now its no longer otw to being f2p its paid and cash shop will still be in its not vanity items only the quests are there for things too character changes as well ursula from sea to land witch walles dandy costumes and quests surrounding that etc mixed up character progression gothel is in but a paid expansion for rapunzel btb are in but paid expansion for gaston  game feels rushed world is too small for as many things as you need to put in it gatherable items are too hard to come by now and the potions i mentioned are usually needed for quests with gather x gems but they require a specific rare drop to make and last but not least  a game some of us have paid for now has additional price tag of 6030 depending on how they handle the newest release im over it 
update 2 dec 23 im also a macapple owner i got this game through arcade the expansion is free the store is removed no pay to play items its a step up but there also arent any vanity items  and possibly no star paths

#####

as a lifelong fan of everything animated disney i have to say that this game hits all the stardew valley beats while mercilessly exploiting my nostalgia to the utmost factor and i love it for it  its animal crossing meets kingdom hearts and bless that mix

i have a huge request though please please please allow disney afternoon characters to have toon town again i went there when i was six with my parents and i met don carnage and its one of my core memories i really would love to see darkwing talespin ducktales and gargoyles all have their own event imagine meeting darkwing and gosalyn their house from the show being in the valley 

that being said i do recommend that if you do pick this up get the whole package while its on sale otherwise enjoyable all around

#####

good first impressions game runs good 120fps at 4k easily with 50 gpu usage on a 3080 12gb looks pretty good about fortniteish which i really like sadly my name is offensive  wybrem weird 

update
ye the game is pretty good its closer to farm together than animal crossing but thats oke considering its early access and the first real game from gameloft im impressed it will come to mobile and you can see that in some of its design but its not a bad thing 

there are no artificial limitations stopping you like in typical mobile garbage  i enjoy it a lot and will continue to play it the devs are quick to fix issues atm and yes there are some bugs but not to many in my experience so far

only a few small nitpicks no 329 219 32 or 1610 support only 169  i hope the add that later the walking animation is terrible there is no jump button thats fine but let us hop over fences like in farm together basically make all movement like there no winnie the pooh 

#####

i liked the game initially but i dont like this bait and switch from a f2p game to a full priced game with dlc and microtransactions

#####

edit this game is no longer going free to play i still stand by the premium store being extremely overpriced and thats one thing that needs to change newer premium store items do have a more premium look and feel to them which minimally makes up for the price of the items 

with the last 2 updates there have been major improvements to the game play itself with the dlc adding a lot of new content that is helpful in managing the more tedious tasks of the game the variety in characters is improving also and im finding myself playing more consistently like i did prior to the introduction of the premium shop 

i have changed my mind from not recommending this game as i feel it is currently in a better state for fans of disney and the cozy farming game genre if you do not like both of these things i still would not recommend this game to you 

original review do not buy this game wait for it to go free to play gameloft is treating their paying early access beta test players horribly with the introduction of the premium store the quality of this game deteriorated very quickly i paid to play early access and gameloft is charging ridiculous amounts of money in their premium shop gamelofts reasoning is testing out the pricing if they want to test out premium store pricing than early access needed to be free this game had so much potential and gameloft has basically shut down all communication with the early access community they arent dealing with the premium shop issues and its been nearly 3 weeks at this point until this is remedied i will not be recommending this game

#####

it was a fun casual game at the beginning but now there are too many microtransactions for it to be worth it even if it was free its just annoying that soooo many things are locked behind so many different paywalls there are plenty of games like this spend your money on one of them

#####

i was a day one adopter and played only about 100 hours in six months which is a great thing a game you can enjoy for a few hours a day or even a few hours a week and still come back to it

the questing is welldone there is much to do especially with the special events even though my level neighbors and buildings are mostly maxed out it didnt feel like a grind

there are some bugs and animation issues but the game is in prerelease there is a premium shop lots of people are complaining about in preparation that the game will be free however it seems to be all cosmetic if they make me pay to unlock charactersmaterialsmoneyetc then i would be pissed

oh yeah gameloft please add something so reallife friends can somehow someway interact with my valley i would appreciate it


#####

saying this game would eventually be free for all to play but it would have ingame purchases
then not making it free anyways and still have ingame purchases and then paid dlc
at this point you know they dont give a shit about making a good game and just wants money
i regret supporting this game

#####

coming here to leave a negative review after buying piecemeal dlc that was heavily implied to be part of the original ea rollout at some point i picked it up because i wanted rapunzel more or less why i bought this title in the first place and now i have a big cashgrab feeling i cant shake from this title i wont be buying additional dlc and im shifting my recommendation for the game from if you like disney and cozy games to if you dont mind the sims dlc model or you love one of the few base characters

tbh i figured this would be the case but hoped maybe a huge ip like disney might be able to release a game in ea without nickleanddiming their fans this is not the case expect to pay 30 for every three disparate characters for the remainder of this very very long empty roster of disney characters that once appeared to be a slow rollout for a partiallyreleased title

if you dont care about money and you dont care about bignamed ips taking advantage of the ea system that was meant to support small development studios and you dont mind keeping up with battle passes and grinds to receive the items you paid real money for dreamlight valley is fine nothing special unless you crave disney charm specifically but im still awaiting much of what was promised to me as a collector edition owner at that in the original title and now see paid dlc rolling out so thats the current state of the game and it doesnt feel great as an early heavier supporter

#####

if you like animal crossing and disney you should have already bought dreamlight valley

h1early access reviewh1

before anyone starts to flame me with this is an early access game how dare you i get it you like ddv so far but keep an openmind to anothers opinion and we as gamers always deserves better especially on pc also ive been a part of many ea games prealpha throughout beta builds of a good number of games in development and this feels like a somewhat polished alpha build

this game ddv feels like a mobile freemium scaled to play on pc somewhat decently as many comments have pointed out you can almost see the f2p tag being added to this game due to how it feels when you play it in its current state you basically go around doing tasks like

olist
collect crafting materialsingredients in different biomes to make gradually complicated decorationsrecipes
have small talk with disney characters in order to get that daily checkin progression point
do constant mundane tasks to collect progression points in order to unlock new biomes spoileralso disney characters realmsspoiler
spend increasingly ludicrous amount of ingame money on buildings clothes seeds and ingredients
keep your stamina up spoilereither by eating or going inside your housespoiler
olist

i came into this game somewhat blind with hearing through the vines people comparing it to a stardew valley mixed with animal crossing id say this is more heavily influenced by ac than sv due to the lack of actual rich mechanics farming is really surface level and the same can be said for cooking spoileryou basically throw ingredients in a pot and it grills liquify steam etc any meal for you even when you come across a bbq grill its the same thingspoiler and foraging

dont get me wrong the visuals of this game are nice the music is pretty okay and ive yet to encounter any gamebreaking bugs except for some visuals ones spoilerursula going into body of water that i cant accessspoiler im truly lucky however i need more from my cozy games to feel satisfied from giving my money or time to a company after having sunken a little over 15hrs in i can confidently say that anyone on the fence should strongly wait for a full release with substantial additions and a good discount unless it becomes f2p then thatd be a big w for future players

also the premium game currency the one youll have to pay for with real money down the line is currently only available via the crazy priced deluxe and ultimate editions even if the rewards you can unlock are purely cosmetics they arent anything out of the ordinary compared to what you can get by crafting or finding in the games world at the time of this review the current event is mainly about the incredibles clothingitems etc and has a premium track that needs to be unlocked with the money currency lunar medallion thing which can be exchanged in order to purchase more event tokens incredibles icon if the daily tasks rewards dont provide you with enough to get all items theres also a premium unlock available on the daily tasks

i had hoped ddv was going to be a higher resolution inspired version of disney magical world 1  2 which has similitude to ddv but with so much more to do look it up for more info as it feels like rune factory but without the romance on the 3ds but so far its pretty lackluster ill just have to let ddv cook some more in the oven and will dust out my 3ds to play some disney magical world in the meantime to sate my craving

#####

the game is animal crossing mixed with stardew and yes there are bugs but theyre putting a patch out tomorrow and have more content planned for the end of this month i would pick it up solid 910

#####

for disney fans to join their favorite characters and live among them
the game is beautiful and has lots of details and things to do
you start in an overgrown village with only a few of the residents remaining
while you start and clear the village from the thorns you get to to try many different things such as cooking farming mining and crafting

you help out both the good and the evil characters to rebuild the town while forming friendships with said characters

decorating the town and your own house is also a big part and you unlock many different items and cosmetics to shape both your enviroment and yourself

the game is in eary access and from what i read it will be free to play later
if you want to play now you have to at least buy the first pack and the other two are for cosmetics only
seems fair to me



#####

this game is such a mixed bag the initial story and development was really fun and inspiring i got a lot of hours out of that but the further down the line you get the more you feel like its just a boring grind and wait for new content to arrive and when it does there is always new stuff they want you to buy from the premium shop and the story or characters added are always too small or not enough to keep you playing for long i cant recommend anyone to play this game beyond the first story part and its so sad since it has such a nice setting and fun start of the game 510

#####

as a former kingdom hearts player i just love this game its very similar to animal crossing but it ignites some latent joy in my heart that i get to interact with and do things for disney characters its also neat that you can do a lot in terms of customization both of your character and the clothes they wear there are a lot of things to do im excited for when they add more characters in and have enjoyed the ones present so far

#####

buying the ultimate edition and not getting the dlc is honestly just so disappointing
so many promises of not making the paywall for new content only to leave the microtransactions and adding pay for content
so disappointed
also after the last update the amount of bugs is just overwhelming the controller keeps disconnecting random tposing
map glitches out characters disappear midconversation and the list goes on
i think that i will finish this season because i took the pass but after that im giving this game a long break

#####

it has a lot of aesthetic appeal and is very clean and wholesome overall a fun game respawn rates for harvestables and other things is good i do wish the game had a little more depth to it and multiplayer has a long way to go this game has many similarities to animal crossing and in a lot of ways is a better game but is lacking in other ways like the multiplayer function store selection etc it is kind of frustrating that there are ponds in annoying areas and you cant move them nor can you coverredesign the ground i hate the grass on the beach shores

#####

cash grab done

#####

if animal crossing and disney had a child it would be this game

jokes aside game makes u remember how excited you were about everything as a kid and shows you in its unique and fun way that you can still do that

#####

gameloft are lying sacks of crap i bought the game to support it and get some goodies that would be unavailable after the game goes freetoplay and then decide to no longer offer freetoplay to ensure quality the game has freetoplay monetization all over the place and you have to play every day to rack up enough moonstones to get anything good if you dont want to spend real money on it utterly disgusting

#####

not compatible with steamdeck as they claim when i create my character the game attempts to start but always crashes also unable to get a refund because it has consumables this game is a scam

#####

it gud
