you start to like the game for the first 10 levels then once you get to level 11 you start to see how bad paying to win is on this game the first 10 levels of this game for any new player is basically a free trial then after that if you wanna keep playing online you better cough up a good 800 on characters and player cards just to even have the potential to compete against the other no lifes at the game who spent a whole student loan on the game the game used to be good because it used to be playable to people who didnt want to pay for stuff and paying money on the game didnt make you characters over powered it may get you to a higher level but you could easily grind to level up back then now they introduced cards and player buffs and the game went downhill people barley even play this game anymore because the pay to win people drove the rest of the player base away i remember seeing this game on my recommended free games page on xbox and i used to see how much my friends played and how cool it was the developers understood what the people wanted and didnt do it for the money and now theyve become money hungry its sad to see how people have good intentions on what a game should really be but gaming ist the same all developers get tempted by greed eventually and they fall into a deep hole of get money now and make the game good later its funny because when they made the game pay to win and lost all theyre players they tried to fix the game and balance it out but its still unplayable to players that play the game for free honestly youd be better off making fresh accounts until the get up to level 10 if you really want to go through that trouble of playing fair games with either bot players or rarely good people that arent pay to win i once had a 20 win streak before i was level 10 now i get 1 win out of every 15 losses now dont disregard when i say this game is pay to win you probably dont know how dead serious im being when i say this game is entirely pay to win after a certain level but please take heed of my advice because you will see at some point what your free character can do and youll see the massive difference between that character you have and someone who put a whole home mortgage loan into the game then youll understand that thats just the way the game is and how sad that all the fun you had your first 10 levels is quickly erased and if you think that paying only 100 buck is good enough to compete then your dead wrong the game will let you have 1 game against free players with your newly leveled up character just to give you the illusion that the amount of money you spent was good enough then the next 3 games you play instead of going against people who are free players or people who only spent that 100 bucks that you spent now they will put you up against people that spent 500 then youll have to spend 500 to compete with them do you get the pattern now no matter how much you spend it will never be enough because the game demands money from you if you even want to enjoy it for one game its trying to get you hooked on buying more so youll beat more people thats what people who work for pay to win games do they try to get people hooked on buying theyre products thats how they pay theyre bills is from good for nothing losers who dont know better they simply feed off of other peoples addiction to the game so dont give this creators what they want only play till your level 10 then either quit the game or make a new account the moment they realize that theyre money grabbing towards people isnt working then theyll make the game actually decent so people will play it again thats all i have to say about this game the creators used to be loyal to there fans and they let greed get the best of them its a sad thing to see but all in all id play nba2k or something like that this game generally isnt fun because it takes you a month to grind the 01 chance to acquire what the pay 2 win people have so please dont give these greedy creators the satisfaction and please dont get sucked into spending money on this game

#####

please bring back freestyle football 

#####

this game is a scam the game was already launched before on october 2017 as 3 on 3 freestyle and was closed in january 2019 without giving us any compensation or something  now they relaunched it as 3on3 freestyle rebound how about those hours of game time effort and money well spent to the previous game now you just relaunched the exact same game with updated features when they could just updatepatch the game or they could even just add dlc instead of closing the previous one

#####

what a real pity i had read the reviews before trying the game and i hesitated to try it for quite a while fearing it truly was pay to win but in the end due to a serious lack of street basketball games i surrendered and played the game for about 2 weeks every day

now i know all those reviews were right the game is ok for the first 10 levels or so it looks fine despite theres no full support to controllers at first despite the messy ui and bugs the game itself is fun enough for you to start considering investing some money
thenthe moment of truth arrives after level 15 or so you just play against hyperplayers with max level characters who move on the court like the flash and dont miss a single 3 point shoot even when such players end up in your team they will ignore you and basically play solo scoring a ton of points by themselves taking you to a mortally boring victory all you have to do is sit and watch the egotistic performance
repeat forever and you get  the picture i now uninstalled the game because to me its practically finished

what are you asking me why dont i spend money to get a max level character as well because ive seen how the game is played once you get there and its not fun to me rushing back and forth scoring 3 points faster than your opponent and dissing other players just cos you created the perfect sniper is not nice team play nor even a game i have better stuff in my steam account to waste time on such mechanics

its a pity truly because there are many ways of making money with a freetoplay game but joycity chose this lame system the game looks nice even despite some idiotic costumes and humongous teddy bear backpacks that make no sense or stupid moves like kicking the ball into the basket hows not a foul so why not make a move where i kick the player in the face to steal the ball then

i dont know how long ill have to wait for another street basketball game but this madness is not what im looking for in fact its what games should not be especially multiplayer games if you are a developer and end up with a teambased game where players play solo then your game is a failure 
joycity thinks too much with the wallet or is it because they suck at game design who knows i wonder if they give a damn

#####

pretty good game but lulus boobs could use a little more jiggle

#####

they take the same game every time change the ui and the name and try to milk the players for money

#####

pay to win isnt that bad if u dont gotta life to grind but what really pisses me off
 pass me the ball
 pass me the ball
 pass me the ball 

like bro why is the player base so ass like they dont understand the basics of basketball
players will deadass drive to the paint full of big men and try and dunklay up while ur spamming pass cuz ur open in the fucking gyat dam corner player base is so so so so fkn stupid i cant even enjoy the game because of the average iq of the playerbase

#####

dish it to the dawg

#####

ive played few hours but i didnt like several things

 no ingame chat impossible to talk to your teammates
 no friends list must add through steam
 most of the time youre matched against bots which gets boring quite fast
 to unlock all characters and skills you must grind quite a lot and playing against bots is just not fun
 could use an option to change camera angle

the gameplay is alright but devs should use some marketing skills to make this game more popular

#####

this game shouldve released as early access because so much stuff is misssing
1 open court to shoot around
2 ability to change camera angle
fixed3 setting the window resolution doesnt work throws out random numbers doesnt change the resolution at all
4 when connected with a controller but still playing with keyboard the game only shows controller button controls hard to navigate when learning a new move
5 its impossible to view all of the inventory you have you need to search for attribute cards in all characters
6 only 1 generic court with minor changes
7 only 3v3 mode 1v1 doesnt count because you still need bots but i guess it fits the games title
8 no chat window in game
9 no friends list cant directly invite your friends to matchmaking
10 the playerbase is too small

it is the same as fssb2 with better graphics different game engine but worse gameplay less skills and constumization and lacks a lot of overall functionality
i understand that this is like arcade mode of the original fssb2 that works on consoles but for pc it just lacks content
seeing how there are more people playing fssb1  fssb2 it would be logical to focus more on a new fssb game

this is not from someone who is new to the game ive been playing since 2015 on the ps4 this game is pay to win as heck if thats not for you this is a sure skip you will lose no matter how good you are as a player the game was created that way to squeeze every dollar out of the community now is not the time for optimism but either letting the game burn or the devs fix this enough is enough

#####

pay2win freestyle moms card

#####

fun game but its easily pay to win mobile game vibes

#####

game is literally all pay to win there is no fundamental basketball just speed cards and shooting cards its awful

#####

im like kevin garnett out there in the paint

#####

i have never seen a more pay to win game then this i played it on xbox for quite sometime at that point early on it was actually worth playing somewhat today you will spend money on food buffs on coin buffs on stat buffs basically you can purchase so many different things to make you seem like a god this game does have an aspect of skill for each character learning how to use their abilities is a huge thing but it is overshadowed by being able to purchase skill cards and personal buffs called pbuffs i can guarantee this is the most money grabbing piece of garbage not only the game but the company itself this company is garbage and i hope they go bankrupt they give a huge horrible rep for video games trying to actually cater to their fans instead of just their pockets

you start to like the game for the first 10 levels then once you get to level 11 you start to see how bad paying to win is on this game the first 10 levels of this game for any new player is basically a free trial then after that if you wanna keep playing online you better cough up 1k on this shitty game just to even have the chance to compete against the other no lifes at the game who spent a whole student loan on the game the game used to be good because it used to be playable to people who didnt want to pay for stuff and paying money on the game didnt make you characters over powered it may get you to a higher level but you could easily grind to level up back then now they introduced cards and player buffs and the game went downhill people barley even play this game anymore because the pay to win people drove the rest of the player base away i remember seeing this game on my recommended free games page on xbox and i used to see how much my friends played and how cool it was the developers understood what the people wanted and didnt do it for the money and now theyve become money hungry its sad to see how people have good intentions on what a game should really be but gaming ist the same all developers get tempted by greed eventually and they fall into a deep hole of get money now and make the game good later its funny because when they made the game pay to win and lost all theyre players they tried to fix the game and balance it out but its still unplayable to players that play the game for free honestly youd be better off making fresh accounts until the get up to level 10 if you really want to go through that trouble of playing fair games with either bot players or rarely good people that arent pay to win i once had a 20 win streak before i was level 10 now i get 1 win out of every 15 losses now dont disregard when i say this game is pay to win you probably dont know how dead serious im being when i say this game is entirely pay to win after a certain level but please take heed of my advice because you will see at some point what your free character can do and youll see the massive difference between that character you have and someone who put a whole home mortgage loan into the game then youll understand that thats just the way the game is and how sad that all the fun you had your first 10 levels is quickly erased and if you think that paying only 100 buck is good enough to compete then your dead wrong the game will let you have 1 game against free players with your newly leveled up character just to give you the illusion that the amount of money you spent was good enough then the next 3 games you play instead of going against people who are free players or people who only spent that 100 bucks that you spent now they will put you up against people that spent 500 then youll have to spend 500 to compete with them do you get the pattern now no matter how much you spend it will never be enough because the game demands money from you if you even want to enjoy it for one game its trying to get you hooked on buying more so youll beat more people thats what people who work for pay to win games do they try to get people hooked on buying theyre products thats how they pay theyre bills is from good for nothing losers who dont know better they simply feed off of other peoples addiction to the game so dont give this creators what they want only play till your level 10 then either quit the game or make a new account the moment they realize that theyre money grabbing towards people isnt working then theyll make the game actually decent so people will play it again thats all i have to say about this game the creators used to be loyal to there fans and they let greed get the best of them its a sad thing to see but all in all id play nba2k or something like that this game generally isnt fun because it takes you a month to grind the 01 chance to acquire what the pay 2 win people have so please dont give these greedy creators the satisfaction and please dont get sucked into spending money on this game this game could be fun with a hard restart none delusion character designs get rid of the anime make it not pay to win better matchmaking and unrated so there are no sweaty mfrs in my chill lobbys who spent all daddys money to get their characters the courts need to be larger the only good part of this game is the idea there is a reason nobody plays this shit developers should to their target store buy a toaster oven and take a bath with it you always get brain dead teammates who have zero clue how to play the game and never pass if you want to hurt yourself just bash your head against a rock way less painless than playing this game dont install

#####

look i am gonna be honest the game is dying but as a player i feel that this game has some of the smoothest controls minus people who chip out cheese with clark and jimmy because at least 25  of the time if you chip out your guaranteed to lose the chip out in the first place if you face those two

that and for someone who mostly plays fps and tps games and brs this game is amazing and i love it

what this game really needs to do is reed reviews like this if the game really wants to succeed they should do these things to help it regain popularity rather than just float

1 you gotta advertise
2 you need to add a 5 player full court mode with a ranked scene that can provide competitive towards small competitions for money or esports
3 the battlepass needs to cost the red coin or money so that players can get the battlepass continuously and be able to gain its rewards
4 make battlepasses a bit longer say like 10 days more or so
5 remove the character pay wall and instead just make it so that 100 red coin is like 5 instead and then make every newer character 100000 blue coin and every older character besides the base characters a 50000 blue coin from there you can just get players to grind the game
6 add a bit more blue coin reward for players daily
7 make it so that player can only get up to 4 non base characters and then add the pay wall after so if a player really is dedicated and wants to play all characters then they will pay the money
8 finally just give the game some love

i understand that the team still cares about the game its pretty obvious but the game needs love it needs things like this to succeed

and for me as player i love supporting low market nuance games that get little traction this game is one of those

i play veiled experts 247 when that came out and i did the same with this game when i first tried it look you need people to play by adding these features you can challenge nba 2k games since those games stink on pc and there is not competitive play outside of my team

that and for me as a player i am sick and tired of the only games being competitive are games like rainbow six siege valorant league of legends and so forth all saturated boring ass games so do this game some justice have a server maintenance and make changes like this and the game will succeed stick to the free to play style and make it good

please

#####

pay to win garbage fun game until you get matched up with sweats who spend  their entire  minimum wage check on 3v3 freestyle game blows

#####

i used to love this game when it first came out it was somewhat balanced now its crazy pay2win cant even have fun with the game anymore can someone else just make a better version because there is no coming back from this

#####

this game sucks shots are a coinflip complete pay to win game which requires no skill to play if you run on 5 braincells i would highly recommend the daily login bonus sucks too im on past 12 and do not receive daily rewards from deals they provided its garbage

#####

dont install this game it uses ur mic without you knowingmy webcam microsoft lifecam hd3000 has an led that lets me know when its being accessed i installed the game to play with my friends i entered it and the cameras led turned on that is a huge nono for me bthats literally an invasion of privacybheres proof of it happening urlwwwyoutubecomwatchvi6rpwlxsmsk proof urlafter that i saw that the my webcam was the default communications device in windows while my main headset microphone was my default one i doublechecked the games settings for voicechat and i found nothing also my webcam only turns on when the game is runningthe conclusion is that the game literally uses your microphone while you are playing it without having some kind of voice chat im sorry joycity but i cannot play your game when it listens to what i do

#####

its a good game but has a low player count i would recommend it but it is a pretty dead game so if you feel like reviving it then feel free to download it

#####

still has the paytowin model like the previous version sigh this is so disappointing

#####

this game is pay to win like shit it can be fun when u get in a game with people who are just skilled and dont have a shit ton of cards and freestyles on and yall will have a good competitive game but 95 of the time that inst the case majority of the games u join u are gonna be going up against cheesy ass characters like ox queen who will just spam step back 3s and will not miss dont even get me started about the pfc specifically howl and double d who have a 3pt rating of like 20250 who will hit threes consistentlyregardless i cant stop playing smh

#####

game mechanics are great game play is pretty good but
balancing is trash and some positions are not viable enough and the game is either too grindy or pay to win making it annoying to play if this game provides more in terms of skill expression rather then play time or money invested it will be insanely good but still its decent to play every now and then 

still no matter how many times i come back the game is the same

#####

a pay 2 win game  no doubt
game itself is fine however the biggest issue is matching system you will be all fine until level 10 
after level 10 you get matched with people maybe level 70 with all p5 characters and all pbuffs and all ability card for you  you have nothing
you want to catch up  you have to spend so much more cause you missed tons of events   if you spent a bit like 5 you might get one p5 with no skillyou need item to level up the skill of you character no ability card you need to get ability card by random draw so good luck level 1 at p5no item to level up again nothing then you will get out shot out rebounded  out everything people just move way  too fast and has insane freestyle like quick point and you cannot defend 
skill means nothing in this game unless you pay a lot to have the same move speed as others
the only purpose for rookie like you is to make those wallets happy so they could stay there and spend more 
i like fs1 and tried fs2 but no one is playing that for this one  if you like to spend money or make wallet happy go for it
however i hope devs could check what i wrote here and improve the 
1 matching system
2 give wallet advantages but gap could be covered by timeeffortsskillstalent
edit
the new big event just doesnt make any sense because there is no mentee mentee should be under level 10  are you serious joy city  people could get to level 10 like in an hour if we stupidly finished rookie tasks  thats what i did  twice  for my ps4steam i think it should be level 30 or sth instead of level 10

#####

there is nothing else to say but this i expected more
this game is plagued by a plethora of issues i can name a few right off the top of my head
afk players
sealclubbing the reason why newbies quit so fast mark my words
the general lack of mmph in the updates hard to explain it but the ones that give us new characters or cosmetics rather than actual new content balances or revamps in the game arent really good the game should have shipped with the solo training court from the start already requested by the entire community but as expected of joycity lies then radio silence
the lack of marketing
i didnt even know this game was released no notification no nothing i am even subscribed to the fs2 newsletter on steam horrible launch i must say
game is friendly to people that dont spend money in it or is it
i respect the fact that all the items required to progress into the game aka make your charactermain stronger are free
however i dont like the fact that you have to literally pour your heart out and play nonstop to actually get those credits you need to progress the grind is crazy difficult like on another level of difficulty that i would go as far as to say that it is almost unfair
if the adminsmodsdevs can see this review here is what i recommend you do close this game
thats right
close this game
because all youre doing right now is denting your wallet keeping this game up i am sure that rereleasing a game like freestyle football rather than this in a similar state would have been the wiser choice
eu is the most populated server in this game right now most of the players in jc games are from eu actually combine that  with the fact that football soccer is such a popular sport in europe also combined with the fact that it would be the first fifapes esque f2p soccer game it was a gold mine right in front of your eyes and you somehow blew it on a game that no one even liked off the bat
no comment really do whatever you want gg from me though

played this on ps4 for awhile didnt even realize the pc version rereleased until recently lower playbase was immediately noticeable as well as the skill of the players themselves being very poor but it was still fun got level 10 started getting matched with level 40s with quick shot who ball hog entire game and are unstoppable hitting 3s with centers at 100 clip became a lot less fun every match consists of passing the ball to the person with quick shot freestyle and standing still until you get on defense reminded me why i didnt play all that much

until that point though its a good game getting in matches without the tryhards is still fun too bad that hardly ever happens once you reach level 10

game gave me stage 3 cancer

bh1nothin strikebut netstrikeh1b
not a fulläss review but more like initial impressions  grew up on inba jami and while i didnt manage to play as much ifreestyle 2i as i wanted to i dug what i did play of it

that wasnt the case for i3i

ifs3i sports pun unintended a new art style which is part of why it looks so bad  ifs2i had a clean albeit rather clichéd celshaded look that it pulled off really well  everything fit  ifs3i instead has one of those modern overdone polygonal but cartoony looks that might as well be the modern equivalent of clicking on the art style dropdown in unreal engine and clicking defaultnone  just because its a freetoplay game that could probably run on a phone doesnt mean that it should look like a freetoplay phone game especially when ifs2i looked as good as it did

the art style gets even weirder since it just plain isnt consistent  player characters are stylized and cartoony environments are moreorless realistically modelled other than the fitting bright colour schemes but the crowds cheering on the games are lowpoly stick figures that look like they fell out of the unity engine asset store  ballers courts and crowds all look different and just dont jive together  they couldve and shouldve done better with this  and they did with ifs2i

monetization feels all over the place  i managed to earn enough in ifs2i through regularäss gameplay and probably some login rewards to get the character i wanted and decked her out in reasonablycool clothes  youre going to have a hard time doing that in ifs3i  sure you start the game with a few characters unlocked presumably permanently and it seems like kim i think thats her name costs 0 currency to unlock which is great
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2360044371
but you want to change your hair colour  put on some clothes  forget it  the only customization items i could find in the shop that cost ingame currency were a few tshirts all of the same model with the only difference being their colour  one of which was white  thing is every character has a white tshirt by default if you unequip the stock outfits  i guess we should be glad those white tshirts dont cost reallife money

characters and those tshirts were all i could find or at least remember that cost ingame money  everything else costs microtransaction currency even celebration animations and you start the game with none  so every time your team buckets some boomshakala a tiny ui window appears showing you that you have no animations to use and that three of your four animation slots are locked you filthy cheapskate  hit the shop already  how do you sleep at night without giving us money

supposedly theres a certain amount of paytowin in terms of the characters  i dont know about that i got a trial of a fivestar character and still cant win but i can see stuff like stats and abilities being an issue sure
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2360049982
first impressions are bad and we havent enough gotten to the gameplay yet

there is no tutorial to speak of  ifs2i had plenty and really tried to teach you the game  you wont find that in i3i  i havent touched i2i in ages so maybe it makes more sense coming right out of that one but systems mechanics and hud elements arent explained  what is the segmented horizontal line that sometimes appears near my character  what is the activereloadingstyle line that appears when i try to shoot because even if the vertical line is outside of the differentlycoloured area shots can still go in the net
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2360044812
nothing is explained at all  i see dudes doing cooläss motionblurry dodges when i try to defend and i dont know what the hell thats about  none of my steals have ever connected  none of my blocks seem to work  i cant dunk at all but maybe thats because my trashy skinny white girl doesnt have enough pot leaf symbols on her socks  hell inba jami on the wii felt better than this even when playing with its bullshïtäss motion controls

maybe theres some kind of tutorial system hidden within the menus but i dont recall needing to seek that crap out in ifs2i or the gameplay being quite this bad  when the second quest you get is win a 1on1 match online without the game teaching you anything something is clearly fuçked  i spent the next two hours losing over and over enough to fill an entire göddamn experience bar having learned nothing and never getting that one victory  also there doesnt seem to be way to skip the whollyunnecessary countdown youre forced to endure every time you finish a match  why cant we just jump back to the menu and move on like any other game

iedit found the tutorials and training modes  theyre hidden in the game modes as practice rather than part of the quest system to help you learn the game  the tutorials only seem to teach about defence though so even after doing them all and screwing around in the free practice mode with the instructor bot dude i still cant figure out how in the hell to dunki

this is not bon fireb  id say its more like a dumpster fire  if theyd just remade ifs2i or just ripped off any inba jami even the bad ones maybe thisd be worthwhile  i cant find any reason to check this out especially if ifs2i is still available

at least some of the dribblan dunkan ballan waifus are cute and seem a bit less trashy than some of the girls of ifs2i  but there doesnt seem to be any kind of jiggle physics and you cant customize them decently with ingame money anyway so why bother

a shot of my ifs2i character for posterity if nothing else

#####

actually one of the worst basketball games ive ever played online fully pay to win you green a shot perfectly and because your chracters arent good enough it rims off and your ai teammates dont know how to play crazy

#####

pretty disappointed with the customer service i get it bugs happen however they do literally nothing to address it even when you get in touch with them first it severely diminishes the quality of what was otherwise an okay game

#####

either bots or no queue your game is dead

#####

at first when starting to actually get into the game i was enjoying it and having fun the more i play it however the more i realize that the game doesnt support free players at allplayers who dont want to spend money on the game all of the free characters stats at the lowest level are on paper just as good as the paid characters but when playing those characters or against them you notice that the stats dont matter and if you pay for a character then youll be better than any free characterwhen comparing specific stats i have spent money to buy a character since i couldnt be bothered any longer to deal with that bs just to realize after that to actually unlock the good abilities of said characterand all other paid characters you have to spend wayyyyy more money some of the paid characters abilities dont even work properly im not going to even bother with explaining how horrendously broken some of the paid characters are just wanna ask this at the end how does one dunk block and layup through the backboard

#####

if you were making a tier list of the worst basketball games of all time with no doubt this needs to be mentioned

tried it due to its graphical change over fs2 but left extremely disappointed

at low account levels youll be matched with people from various consoles that have no access to chat its hard to find other steam players so team communication is a big problem people at this level do not pass even when youre open so youre forced to play a rebounding position to interact with the ball at all i highly suspect that these were bots and not real players because i matched with 2 players with one called a random name and the other called the same random name with a 1 after it  they even used the same characters having them appear to play on console gives the bots an excuse to not respond to your chats

i joined a crew esg to get more player interaction but they told me that i should quit unless i bought the 90 ultimate edition the game seems extremely pay to win and the community is hostile to nonpaying players characters resources to level up stats level up skills and most importantly ability cards are all gated behind paywalls they give the illusion of free to play by offering occasional resources from missions but to grind out anything viable youd have to play 1000 hours over many months

#####

this game took the terrible aspects of freestyle two street basketball and made them even fucking worse why is there a cooking feature in a street basketball game

#####

waste of time also couldnt get it to stop running on my pc kinda sus

#####

this game really fucking suck compare with fs2
i dont know who am i playing with bot or player
  they dont know how to fucking pass 
 but its just give a little throwback  about freestyle1



#####

pay 2 win  weird stores and workshop

#####

people are sweatier than my crackhole

#####

this game is garbage the devs are garbage p2w all the way

#####

fun game but dead game

#####

its extremely pay to win
but i love yamming on doods with a bald ass black man 



#####

well so meh but still better than nba 2k23

#####

this game would be awesome if it wasnt so god damn pay2win

#####

this game is so pay to win i hate it so much its also more toxic than the smell of my dads farts please fix this game i hate it so much with all my heart

#####

unpolished pay to win trashcan game but man its so much fun

#####

i like that compared to its ps4 counter part their is way less pay to win features making it better for new comers or returning fans my only problem is that it was on steam before and the people that played in the past are not getting a refund

#####

chillin out maxin relaxin all cool
and all shootin some bball outside of the school

#####

its a good badketybal gmar


#####

p2w

#####

how will this effect lebrons legacy 

#####

pay to win trash

#####

it took me a long time to find the match is this dead game

#####

i crossed my friend pain in a game tell him how trash he is

#####

fun  i love big balls 

#####

many game mechanics and player ability tied to real cash items that boost your character  without said items youre pretty much fighting a constant uphill battle poor matchmaking and a whales playground  play at your own risk

#####

not chog only for people who use condoms

#####

you get the ball you shoot the ball 

trust me listen to my words on this you wont regret it

#####

its basket ball game and its free cant complain

#####

great game overall even tho it need a lot of bug fixes but for the time being it is a very solid game

#####

big dog

#####

if you want to play a game with buddies or just by yourself like me and having  to deal with people ball hogging then this is the game for you 

#####

this game is not good at all you have to spend 15 to unlock 1 character oooorrrr you can play 150 games back to back to grind out one character then after that you have to play or pay way too much to get skills for you character to even have a chance to win a game against the people who did spend thousands in this game i do not recommend this game if youre wanting to have fun with the squad or by yourself just move on and buy another street basketball game

#####

it is one of the most fun basketball games eveer

#####

i love characters design in this game and characters stat but i feel pain about pay to win  dont have many players to play  toxic community

ps this is no neutral review so i guess i give negetive for now

#####

better than dota2

#####

this game is terrible and not very responsive i will never recommend

#####

this game doesnt have crosssave plus no booty shorts for big dog

#####

cant get it to work on the deck so sad

#####

terrible game extremely pay to win if you play by yourself and your other two teammates are together just stand in the corner cause they wont pass you the ball no skill based matchmaking you go against players that pay 600 dollars to fully upgrade their main and never miss overall trash ass game

#####

ball throw net

#####

sadly good game with lot of potential sadly u only play with trollers vs stackers all the time

#####

pay to win shitshow still fun with some mates though i guess

#####

swich this game for fs foot ball

fs2 still best 

#####

there is no hiding that this game is pay to win its either that or play the game for hundreds of hours on top of that the game has some very annoying gameplay mechanics at times the biggest one is when you green time a shot it does not go in half of the time it only increases the chance that a shot may go in prestiging character to p5 is really grindy not to mention all the different types of boosts you can give characters that can make them op however with all of its problems this game with friends is really fun 3on3 is a fun game to fall back on when you are bored of all your main games if you manage to get 3 team squad together this game will be a blast unless you play on top teir matches or ranked because thats where all the pay to win players and sweats are but it you decide to just play on low tier games and if you have decent ball knowledge you will have a good time 
in short pay to win game fun to play with friend stay away from top tier games to avoid bs unless you are masochist in that case go ahead i aint gonna stop you i give the game a solid 710

#####

pay to win dont play lol


#####

what a stupid fucking game  i played this game in 2016 when it came out  and the game was so great before  everyone was equal  and now i return and realize how this game works  this game is a typical korean game  basically more money you spend more skills you have  you dont even need to practice  you just need to spend money and then you are going to be the best on the court  awesome game  feel bad about this stupid game still a stupid game  the game balance is just so bad as it used to be  people are spending money to buy things that is find  but how about the people dont  are we trash  nobody passing that ball and theres not a single button for reporting awesome

#####

pass me pass me pass me quit hogging the ball quit hogging the ball quit hogging the ball over here over here over here dunk dunk dunk im open

#####

called 3on3 but you have to wait and eternity to play 3on3 because you have to level up and levelling up is literally impossible because 1v1 takes 100 years to find a lobby when you do find a lobby youre completely useless because the bots dont even pass the ball and just shoot that fucking ball without a reason they be marked by 100 people and they be still shooting the ball anyway take fortnite and the sims 4  make them have sex and there you have it 3on3 characters if that wasnt enough the spectators around the court look like they came out of roblox its like they took a portal from roblox dimension to just look at a basketball match in fortnite if that isnt enough to convince you that this game is garbage  the stats of the characters dont make any sense an sg literally has more points in long layup than 3pointers which is literally the whole point of sg why would i spend real money on a sg who cant even do three pointers if i wanted to do long layup i would have just used the free to use sw it looks like a 10 year old who watches nba every once in a year and doesnt know anything about basketball made this game just because he didnt have money to buy nba 2k21 id suggest you play freestyle 2 although you might as well play nba2k20 cause that shit is full of cheaters anyway gg ez would rather play basketball in real life than this

#####

behind the back jumpshot is pay to win and spamming dash is unbeatable

#####

you absolutely cannot win without paying

#####

to be completely honest they should bring back games like ghost x  ultimate if they really want to compete with other developers but that might just only be me though


#####

pay to win

#####

controls are straight dookie


#####

a shit game delays bugs money

#####

this game makes me wanna die

#####

this game is fucking terrible pay to win garbage

#####

the game is alright but it constantly runs so you cant ever delete the game or move it to a different hard driveneeds to be fixed says ive played for 308 hours but ive only played it once for like 20 min

#####

steph curry with the 3

#####

kobe would not be proud

#####

game literally has less than 20 active players at any time

edit 1  and those 20 players consist of sweaty chinese players playing in other regions on max statted  max prestige rosters

#####

this game is pay 2 win

#####

confusing menuhud pay real money to play characters and slow matchmaking time its so bad

#####

spend at least a few hundred  to p2w

#####

hate to play against ai
so happy that joycity launched it on steam 
have fun an stay safe

#####

fun but not enough players

#####

cool recommend

#####

fun but its just suuuuper pay to win with all the hours i put in let me tell you dont take this game seriously unless your willing to spend money

#####

this game is p2w like a mf and full of sht its still fun af tho especially when cindy blocks big dog and make him do a back flip to the asphalt f2p p2w fun game

#####

this game is very fun to play with friends until you begin to encounter all the p2w nerds with the op animations that just completely dominate the game to the point where it does not even feel remotely fun to play anymore

#####

honestly i do very much like the game but i do not recommend this to anyone to put it simple the game is dead absolutely nobody plays it ill be searching for up to an hour for a 3on3 game and i just give up just choose a different basketball game

#####

i have never seen such a flagrant violently aggressive thirst trap in any relation to basketball with microtransactions comparable to blizzard activision

#####

game is still not worth it you got guys cheating on day 1 of this  this is so trash bring back freestyle football cause at least you had a better chance of playing people that dont cheat also it does not help that this game feels like it was rushed it seems like the devs still dont care like normal until it hurts their wallets still have not changed my opinion nor have been given any proof to

nice to know the report button will stop working when you want to report cheaters sad

just seeing a bunch of fs2 hackers playing this cause they are not banned on it yet and probably will not be

also your new system for fair play still penalizes people for being stuck on loading screens and having to dc

and your anticheat still sucks

and you do nothing about it stop saying it works when there is no improvement


#####

this game is fucking poo ive changed my mind i thought 2ks contest system was broken but on this game it doesnt even fucking exist the only thing that keeps me playing this game is the sheer size of lulus honking ass fuck its yummy and that anime bitch her voice makes me wet because im such a simp for anime girls but other than that this game is complete dog shit

#####

im 4 hours in and im surprised with how much better it is than its fs2 counterpart way more easier to get a game and isnt lagging for old heads whove played the og fs2 from level up 20 years ago ignore the reviews youll enjoy this game out of about 20 matches i only seriously encountered an overpowered whaler twicesame guy i have no clue about the balance of matchmaking since you cant see the level or stats of your opponents but i guess its a bit skewed in my favor seeing as im a new player with the advantage of playing almost every iteration of fs though it was pretty obvious that i was matched against fellow newbies its a very niche game and may take some time to get the grasp of the mechanics but when you do its a pretty solid game tbh unlocking your first few characters seem to be a breeze as well as you get around 250ishhigher if you win plus a bonus if youre mvp it seems ingame currency per win plus various rewards for leveling up your account ranging from 3k5k ingame currency i seem to remember starting with 5k ingame currency though i may be wrong but now im up to 40kish without spending a dime in a little over 4 hours a single nonmicrotransaction character costs about 15k there also seemed to be a free unlock of any ingame currency character which i wasted in my excitement to unlock one so be careful on that and make sure the one youre purchasing is the one youre really going for as like most moba gamesyes it feels like an action moba it reminded me of overwatch each character has its strengths and weaknesses all in all a good game and im having fun so far ah and get used to the occasional ball hog teammate lol

#####

im not the biggest fan of sports games but i do love the occasional quality title the classic nba live and nba jam games the 00s madden games mlb 05 nhl 94 the tecmo bowl games blades of steel and other titles are quite a bit of fun

this game definitely doesnt belong on the list of classic quality sports games or even the good modern ones the controls are very sluggish and borderline unresponsive the characters move around like they are playing on a court filled with pudding its not uncommon for the sloppiest of shots to go in from long range while a perfectly timed and open shortranged short completely misses the game seems to be more about luck and how much time and money you are willing to spend to obtain powerups than legitimate skill

setting aside any potential issues with the progression and gear systems the game itself just isnt very much fun perhaps the versions of this game on other platforms are great but the steam version on pc playing with a keyboard is a frustrating experience of wondering why your character fails to respond to your key presses and why your ai teammates refuse to acknowledge your input and make bad decisions

not sure how to turn this game into a quality sports title and i believe its marketed to a different tier of customer than the buytoplay titles its more of a pet and gear collection game that just happens to involve basketball than a basketball title with progression mechanics

avoid this title

#####

freestyle as moba

this game is full of bugs although it is a fun game its easy to run but the basketball aspect  the point of this game  is illogical a center should not be hitting 3s like its nothing with the 3pointer stat being less than everyones

#####

sos help jokes aside its a solid game

#####

po

#####

honestly wouldnt be bad if the game was paid and you didnt have to buy individual characters to stand a chance

#####

verified for stem deck but not loading properly


#####

p2w  extr toxic

#####

bring back freestyle football not this garbage fs2 street basketball is miles better on pc do not understand why joycity brought this game back to life

#####

when someone dc or leave in your game everyone in that game dc tooand there is a lot of leavers playing this game

#####

its freestyle street basketball  seems like less pay to win in this one than the old ones theres weekly free characters that are max level so you can always play a well built character better than nba2k22 for multiplayer and the spirit of basketball actually passing and screening for teammates rather than dribbling around and shooting long distance 3s

#####

there needs to be better elo matchmaking

#####

i love nothing about this game

#####

freestyle 2 was a broken game that is still broken and is dead on water as the only people who still play it are sweats who spent 1000s on their characters imagine that but boring more p2w tactics and even bigger grind the ai is a joke so 1 vs 1 is extremely easy if you just pick a sf or pg and pump fake 3 on 3 like fs2 is full of p2ws who spent 1000s joycity and gamekiss cannot even make freestyle 2 stable and they decided to port their ps4 game that is so bad that they give stuff for free and people still do not play it to the pc that just shows that all the people who for 6 years including myself have begged gamekiss to give a damn about their community by making their games not crash use a better anti cheat system than the xigncode which is easily exploitable and by not being the greediest developer out there have been not only ignored but abandoned by gamekiss they either do not care or do not have the intelligence to make a functional game that people actually want to play without needing to be rich or be in california nba 2k myteam may be p2w garbage but at least their games are stable have good animations and controls and they have real nba rosters and not hot anime waifu women and buff anime men as their characters this game died on arrival and your reputation with how poorly you managed freestyle 2  has driven people off your games i only played for 40 minutes and uninstalled the game because of how bored i was

#####

i like this game daily logins and playing casually good basketball game f2p grind is difficult at first but well worth the grind i always recommend it to friends

#####

trash

#####

i swear this will give you a malware not a joke

#####

cant recommend because of the terrible community otherwise good attempt to make something fun

very good game  fun alone and with friends also join the discord that me and my friend create on this game  we are going to do a lots of events like tournaments  with cashprice and an easy way to get discord nitro   here the link httpsdiscordggpzb3pm7ehg enjoy 

#####

its a good game differently from fs2 premade character are better since each of them has his ability sets and strength  weakness i would even say less p2w then  fs2 as paying cannot get you a prestige 5 character or max your skills no equipment to increase stats so is everything pretty good 
need more player but premise are pretty good
 100 recommended

#####

this game has 0 working servers youll lose connection which will give you a message that bricks your game every single time you try to play and it takes like 10 years to restart the game

#####

street ball for freaking infants stunk doo doo

#####

no playerbase

#####

010 not enough anime girls

#####

its fun but server status is really bad

#####

no surprise here joycity releasing a half baked money grab shit for a game if they really wanted people to play a game they should have returned freestyle football and not this dog shit its actually sad how bad the gameplay is and what makes it worse is you cant even play because the server is so unstable 

under no circumstances should you give this game a try its a waste of time

#####

how about work on controller support for pc i used to play this on ps4 but refuse to play on my pc and tell friends about it because it sucks due to the lack of controller support

#####

so fun wanna more player

#####

pay to win

#####

gave me a trojan horse

#####

#####

100 recommended this game does have p2w but the f2p characters have abilities to make up for it and at the end of the day its up to a teams coordination and skill got me into street balling recently too

thx for the developer response 3

#####

this game is a disaster 1k on console was a waste of time ngl

#####

at the time of the review i have 1800 hours on my steam account and 1500 on my playstation account first of all you need to invest at least 30 bucks to feel at least minimally afloat without this initial donation you will not have characters and they are actually the basis because there is a goal that has not changed for more than a year when you get the characters you need to spend 2 hours of your time every day just to get one p5 character per month or again you have to pay lets imagine that you like it you do it at one point you start to get thrown at guys like me those who will completely discourage you from playing lets fantasize a little bit more you went through all these circles of hell and you still wanted to play at one point you enter a ranked match level up and meet players using cheats when you ask the developers to deal with it they do it once a week they dont care about you or your problems the only thing that really matters to them is to get more money out of you so that you can buy new characters and different cosmetics for them so i recommend this game only in one case if you have a lot of free time and you like being disrespected by the whole community then go for it otherwise i recommend saving your time and not starting to play this shit
after all my time spent the only thing i can call the developers is trashcity

#####

we are not making it out the courts with this

#####

game sucks

#####

rebound basketballs

#####

absolutely awfulthis game is one big ad with literally no sense of direction do not waste your precious time with this one folks major oof alert

#####

the game is so optimized well that my dick works better than this game also in the game every 2nd man sold his house and kidney to get me in this game to avoid hitting the ball is not a blow and hitting the air hits everything physics is equal to my knowledge of physics from primary and secondary school thank you all for reading and dont download the game if you dont want to lose your hair and now i greet you im going to find a wig



#####

balls

#####

lag is bad in this game people use it to get advantage and be hard to block

#####

ngl havent even played the game but wtf how these people getting so many awards for saying yo dont hog it 500 times

#####

i dont like basketball but if you do i would give it a go

#####

mechanics are mid but they work really easy to learn if u play the game without a sweaty attitude and rage baby mode then its really funny to play with friends this the kinda game you would install if ur bored and just wanna play a free group game with friends

#####

bad game but the black girl is hot

#####

pay to win bad matchmaking was only playing for 2 days already was playing against top 30 players almost impossible reaching prestige 5 without paying or being a high rank which is hard to do without prestige 5

#####

no

#####

great but inferating with the characters being fully upgraded and still miss every time

#####

just bad nothing like the original

#####

actually better than 2k21

#####

the exaggerated swagger of a black teen

#####

good grapich

#####

i played fs2 and fs 3on3 before it got removed from pc i am glad this game is back people need to realize this game does not aim to be some kind of nba2k replacement but to be honest it is for me its colorful and has an arcade feel to itkind of giving me nba jam vibes if you play with a friend or two and use discord this game really shines people will always complain about mechanics whether its nba2k or this game i think this game does a great job with position roles and the diverse selection of characters available is awesome of course there are things missing here and there but id expect them to add them eventually open court to practice no chat while in a game etc

i kinda dont understand what these people are saying about matchtimes regardless of ai included or not 
i never have to wait longer than 35 mins to get a game

i will update this in the future but for now this game is worth spending hours on

its free so why not

#####

love the gamebut camera angle pls

the game is so great just wait new gamer to come

#####

good

#####

very good game worth downloading since it is free and its easy to understand

id give it a 610 when playing alone but playing with friends would be a 910
the games are very fast paced so if you feel like playing one it doesnt feel like you sit there for an eternity

the controls are very simple and easy to use so it only took me one game to understand everything

#####

extremely money grubbing

#####

3on3 freestyle is a ok game its free to play but ehh not worth to spend hours in it

#####

in all honesty this game is absolute garbage and is not worth the price

#####

this absolute masterpiece of a basketball game has changed my life for the better from playing 3on3 free style rebound i have developed real life skills that i never would have imagined to acquire 23 years ago i have learned to dribble shoot and even increased my vertical to 40 inches i also started seeing a change in my confidence inside and out of the court this is the best game ever

#####

when you cant afford 2k

#####

great game ngl
wish the servers were more active

#####

i understand the game is free but the amount of glitches in the game and the characters disparity of skill is too hard to bat an eye on grinding for items is like grinding items for a idle phone game which sucks the controller is fine but lemme tell you no one is on steam servers you play against bots all day or xbox players which are also bots until they fix some glitches this game is actually worse to play than 2k gameplay wise imagine that any game should be better than 2k because its just a curry spam mess

#####

a much worse more pay2win fs2

h1310h1

#####

this game disappoints me very much the game doesnt give a lot of information on everything and so i made a bunch of mistakes also the game is very buggy they seem like they are most interested in coming out with new content than fixing the current bugs in the game the matching system can match you against a high level player even if you are a beginner the skill level based on players is really based on how much time and money youve put into the game

#####

baita jogo

#####

halal game super goodyyy



#####

its the best arcarde type bascketball game ever

#####

dont play it online is so unblanced

#####

it been probably about 3 weeks since i download the game and could not find not a single match on 3 on 3 you  know the game title i played a lot on the ps4 and recommend sticking to consoles version of 3 on 3 freestyle

#####

kobe

#####

its pay to win and the rng is trash

#####

its pretty good

#####

its good i just suck at basketball games

#####

sucks

#####

got dunked on like 20 times than the mofo had the audacity to call me shit dont recommend

#####

the game is fun and good

#####

310

#####

trash company made the same game 3 times in a row fails to improve anything except netcode there is a good game here somewhere at the mechanical core but its impossible to see through all of the layers of bullshit rip the dream

#####

the more money you put in the more wins you get simple as that good luck trying to have fun without spending money on this game with its overpowered freestyle ability system 

#####

great game really underrated a bit hard to unlock all the characters

#####

better than 2k

#####

i would rather kill myself and be damned to eternal torture then play this fucking horrible game im not kidding when i say this piece of horseshit was born in hell i hope the worst for all the people that enjoy this game and i pray on the downfall of the talentless loser developers everyone who likes this game i hope you fucking die and i hope this game gets deleted off of steam forever never play this shit fucking game oh my god

#####

yall convinced my boy to spend 60 dollars on this fuckass game 

#####

hooray pls dont play double d


#####

the games fun but very newcomer unfriendly theres beginner only matching but its far too broad the people who are nearly out of that matching will have several maxed characters making those matches a horrible experience not to mention there are so many characters that when you first start playing you might feel cheated a few times until you see what everyone can do youll have to muscle through a rough beginning and a harsh grind to see if youll enjoy the game aside from a rough start the game does have a steep learning curve and once you get past beginner matching youll go toe to toe with the best there is the constant uphill struggle might be a turn off for a lot of people but i think the challenge is rather fun and when alls said and done the game has a ton of satisfying moments when you manage to utilize your characters strengths to their best
and joycity can you stop adding 23 characters of a team to the game and then forgetting about them clara and nikki need love too

#####

bad gamei dont recommend that game very bad ai bad controlsthe gameplay is shtif you want to rage  quit after 5 minutes of playing thats the game  you are looking for

#####

welp worth to try

#####

pay to win

#####

best game

#####

not a good game at all

#####

this game is utter rubbish

#####

surprisingly fun
despite its pay to win gameplay model
grind to unlock new charactersabilities
bot players

the only reason im giving a thumbs up is due to the fact that the devs are very respectful towards their community 
i play this game everyday on ps4 on ps4 this game is finished and amazing pc wise its very stale and broken this game should be in early access lots of work needs to be done on pc if you compare ps4 to pc its not even  close to the same level 

this game is wonderful just not on pc

this game has a great variety of players and the game is overall really good one thing that would make it better though is a voice chat system

i played this game for about one year its a joke so many hackers joy city does not care to be honest fellas they want money smh also play to win type vibes ngl

#####

i dont recommend this game pay to win thing is still here i mean you can earn ingame currency but it is going take quiet of time i dont really see big difference between this game and fs2 yeah its unreal engine here but game is mostly the same new graphics and interface i didnt play a lot  but 510 matches is enough to make a decision this game could be a lot better if they make decent matchmaking at least

#####

better than the newest 2k

#####

very guud


#####

im not saying the game is bad but the players are awful for me 99 of the time nobody passes and they just shoot fade aways from halfcourt and this is allgame idk what to do this is all time

#####

this is game is so fucking shit

#####

this was more of a flop than a rebound

#####

dead game like freestyle 2 street basketball

after a certain level like f2sb you play with all the higher level players that have all the unlock of most of them better abilities skills etc it is at level 10
after level 15 you get matched up with max level players with no near any missed shots
paytowin game cant win if you miss events etc you will be too far behind
too low population will match with higher levels that can always win against you
dead game about 100 ish players on steam population

either pay to get the unlocks to catch up or fall behind

same thing repeated from f2 sb
i think this game was renamed from 3 on 3 freestyle to 3 on 3 freestyle rebound
probably because the game died out

players tend to afk a lot when ingame

lot of bad connections that players drop from seems like the same as the old game
same lagg issue from fs2 where they still score it shows the msg but you are right in front of them

ui is kind of all of the place and not very friendly to look for stuff and confusing
no report option no idle kick afkers
inbox is in    with friends list on top of the screen
the old game had easier to view events and what stuff did

cant choose your points like the old game
its a preset for each character and you level your character with boosts

#####

very very good game

#####

played 20 years  i can make my character 5 stars i am almost there

legend says he died and still have no 5 stars character

#####

3v3 basketball is a great concept but i dont know why all modern implementations are awful this game is promising but having to play a basketball game with keyboard leaves the game is deficient if the game was flash game or we were in the 80s this wouldnt have been a problem

#####

play this dead game

#####

overall rating 410
story 110
coop 310
graphic 510
pay2win 1010
multiplayer gameplay 110
high skill ceiling no
is developer rolling patch to it no
note this is a pay to win game

ok so despite my low amount of hours in this game as an avid player of the freestyle basketball 2 f2b i feel like i can give a good review on how to make this game better 

so i was really hype to see joycity expanding on their 2d counterpart and making a 3d basketball game i have clocked in about 200 hrs into f2b and i really thought that the addition to a physics engine rather than preset rib bounces would be good for the realistic aspect of the game while still having the game aspect of special shots and such when i opened up the game and starting playing in the practice mode i was happy to see that my takes on this were right definitely an improvement but there were a few things that i saw while trying to move around the menu and game 

     1 first thing was the lack of a tutorial when it came to character menus and upgrades compared to f2b this game has a lot more customization when it came to the abilities upgrades and freestyles special shots and that says a lot because that was f2bs strong suits however with a lack of someone telling you what each thing does i feel like it scares of a lot of people me included at first and for the people who do keep playing keeps the game repetitive because people dont have the knowledge to diversify their characters im not saying you should have an hour and a half breakdown on everything but give players the knowledge of the basics and allow them to expand if wished to speaking of characters

     2 i feel like the character arent balanced to each other i like the rotations of characters of is nice as so early games dont have the same 3 characters in it but when the rotation have people like the professor in it i inadvertently created the same issue characters with super good strengths and weak weaknesses is ok but when im facing a pg who can pass like a pg shoot like a sg can cross you up and only sometimes misses rebounds or you have c vs c except 1 c can shoot threes so you either have to play up and give up board or let him shoot it makes it hard for me to enjoy the game without picking them pay to win exists in this game as it always has but i never minded it as in f2b as the diversity of character made it at least interesting and youll never get the same p2w character twice but with the rotation feature it makes it a blaring issue 

     3 other things that i dont have to go into are things like 
more options like camera settings
make farming a little bit understandable explained in 1 but would definitely help to make playing the game a little more rewarding
the games is dead which is an issue but i feel like fixing other mentions could get this game a lot more traction

overall i like this game a lot and think it has a lot of potential and would recommend trying it out as its really and could really get the player base up again and it def could be better than f2b


#####

i waited 5 minutes to load into a game and all i see is a brick wall while i try to play off sound queues only

#####

its not responding what to dooooooooooooo

#####

foarte penal


#####

its okay bit repetitive

#####

would be a better game if retard jeff did not shoot 8 million three point shots

#####

this game will be a good game if they add some features like chatting adding friend lobby

#####

great game buggy tho

#####

what the fuck is this even though their soundtrack sounds like garbage and mechanic is worse than 90s trash arcade games and pay to win

#####

pls me open lvl 15 pack

#####

good game however physics need to be alterd

#####

this game is much better than toxic ps4 version

#####

yes been playing fs and fs2 for a while and thats a great upgrade
i love the character system with the ability and skills makes it more balanced
matches are slower than fs2 course but i just like it more
im a fan thats for sure  game is growing as well right now its not dead
strong recommend 


#####

lol meh controlsgameplay feel clunky very much lots of voice bits playing at once all the time really stressfull and character just dont look realistic i dont very much enjoy the cartoony forknives style ggwp 
also it opens links without permissions and tutorial kind of annoying escape only hotkeys to quit and not close an ingame menu qol  not too good

#####

get the ultimate edition if u want to enjoy this game or else

if u starting new good luck most likely everyone gonna walk faster than u sprinting
if u just want to play this game without spending money for characters gotta say u have very high tolerance good luck completing the most optimal pbuffs
most importantly if u playing with randoms good luck most people dont even pass back for open 3

#####

you cant create your own character
