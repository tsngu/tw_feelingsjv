this is the best game tycoon i have played since game dev tycoon i can truly feel the love that binogure studio put into this game ill make this a short bullet point review but this has the perfect mix of depth and fun without overwhelming you in the slightest

pros
 includes all consoles from atari 2600 to ps5
 you can make your own online store become steam
 make multiple consoles including home and portable consoles
 being able to port games from windows 95 all the way to windows 7 is a fun touch
 includes lots of game combos you can make cartoon  platformer to make mario
 customising your office is one of the highlights of this game
 needing to hire producers hr marketing and server managers instead of just developers
 exclusive game events and needing to buy and negotiate licenses adds that needed touch of realism
 sliders arent the only thing that effect game quality how trained your staff is very important equal amount of quality to all areas of development is important to get a 110100 game
 lots of sliders to mix and match development you can make 2d games in the 2020s without being shunned on

cons
 the game is too easy once i reached the quota to make big to triple a games you will be making billions
 no competition it feels like im the only person developing for my platforms both game store and consoles something around there needs to be changed so that the other developers develop on your platforms and rival you toe to toe in game sales
 needs more events the video game crash doesnt even effect anything no piracy events no real roadblocks in the way
 unlocking new genresthemes takes way too long i personally felt stuck to making samesimilar games in my company
 need to be able to research new tech make 3d graphics a thing early on instead of it just being unlocked with time
 more customisation items for the offices i felt quite limited even though i made some nice looking offices

overall i do legitimately love this game i bought it and spent over 15 hours straight playing it im so glad that games like these are still around to surprise me with how fun they are seeing all those bubbles pop up and make my game run at 15 fps in a 100 person office is just awesome 810

thank you for reading my review its been a while since ive written one

#####

i played this game a few times and it was ok but the developer kept supporting the game and made the ok game in the best game development tycoon experience i have had its not as fancy as mad games tycoon 2 but it has so much charm and the interface is so responsive and fast there is always a one more go mechanic the game keeps getting better with every update and the fun factor is trough the roof this developer deserves your money and you get a lot for it in return

h1overviewh1

first off on advice from this authors attorney frankie fine print lymann copycat games are not a crime see data east usa v epyx for proof that copycats do not constitute copyright infringement remember igame dev tycooni take the awesomeness of the aforementioned game add interior decorating an outside world where buildings can be rented bought and even constructed and then add in some nice new ideas along with a bad idea and you have icity game studioi in case the reader doesnt know the game is a management sim in which the player starts a game company starting in the year of the players choosing and goes from rags to riches through developing and publishing video games

h1graphics and soundh1

very little has changed from igame dev tycooni with the primary difference being that the dots that swarm from employees to the video game production window look distinctly different and interior decorating of offices is possible

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2262264087

the sounds are basic in nature and are neither standout nor gamebreaking the music is a hodgepodge of ambient and lounge music

h1positivesh1

igame dev tycooni was already an amazing game but take the game and improve upon it and you have the greatest video game company management sim currently on the market

unlike in igame dev tycooni the history is more detailed and like in real life the video game crash of 1983 is a twofold occurrence

also different is that while icity game studioi allows for paying a flat fee for the rights to develop and publish video games for a specific console the fee is one time which can normally be purchased without any stipulation but starting with the inesi likeness the player will need to negotiate an upfront and usually steep fee along with the possibility of exclusive rights to publish games for a console

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2262114984

in an attempt to be more original theres even more consoles in icity game studioi compared to some other video game developer games out there  the player is a fool if they remember systems like the iatari 7800i and iturbografx16i and choose to develop video games for these systems but at least the systems are represented

h1negativesh1

there was one thing that was wrong about igame dev tycooni that was implemented in icity game studioi  having to guess how many points to allocate to each stage of production and getting penalized if too many points were allocated to a certain aspect of the game gaming gods help any player who isnt playing icity game studioi without a guide and the iimpossiblei difficulty setting really should have been named iannoyingi because unlike at lower levels the player cannot see exactly how many points theyre allocating to an aspect of a game and will have to swag it on the sliders

h1conclusionh1

this is the last review ol il pallino is writing in an official capacity for some time will this author be back with another curator belonging to rexnetwork or will this author be reviewing for a different friends curator page time will tell fortunately icity game studioi turned out to be such an awesome game that ol il pallino can give an unconditional positive recommendation so he doesnt have to deal with an angry developer again

edit how is it possible this game is in early access at the time of reviewing  this game plays absolutely nothing like an early access game

h1the honest word of il pallino or elseh1

gdt game dev tycoon has been the standard for this genre of games game dev tycoon genre but i can no longer say that gdt holds the crown to being the standard 
city game studio by far should be looked at as the gold standard for this genre
the developer has listened to the fans and has implemented new things updates after updates which is remarkable 
if you like gdt or game dev story or any other game in this genre i highly recommend buying city game studio at full price period
it is absolutely worth the money
if you are on the fence get off it and get this game

pros
 give contracts to others
 multiple studios
 stonks
 create your own console
 porting to other consoles
 all consoles in existence
 easy to understand
 all themes unlocked at start
 choice to have a long or short game
 a lot of genres
 a lot more

cons
 ui might be daunting at first

#####

i think this game has the most features so far out of the early access games but in doing so it feels like it not as immersive and compelling 

i think the stats could be better in terms of data tracking

competitor studios ips  and your ip dont feel like a brand or licence 
biggest selling games of all time list  this should be a must have feature 
little things like this would make it more immersive 

i dont see numbers apart from my own games in terms of stats

i feel like if i am a power house like ea it should be my studio that wins game of the year and gain recognition not just me 

its the little things that will make the big features feel more deep that could make this game class a

worth a buy because we should support the potential

btldr game dev tycoon but with significantly improved replayability depth and options im surprised it hasnt gotten any more attention so farb

this game is probably the best game development company manager currently on the market starting in 1975 by default but can be changed you have to run your own game development studio until the late 2010s taking into account the changes in the gaming industry that happen during that timespan from the 1980s crash in the home console market to the release of the latest generation of consoles

the core gameplay loop is simple but engaging you develop a new game choosing the genre and a matching theme along with the platform you want to release the game on then you go through the three development phases while adjusting sliders to fit the genre in all of them for example a casual game would need better gameplay design but a less interesting story while the opposite may be true for an adventure game the amount of options for genres and themes is already massive in the base game and it can be very easily increased with mods which gives this loop insane replayability similar to what it had in game dev tycoon and just like in that game seeing a game get nighon perfect reviews and sell hundreds of thousands of copies in its first month is the perfect dopamine boost

as the game goes on games will grow more and more advanced to keep up with the increasingly demanding audience you will need to develop your own game engines to add new and exciting features into your games this again is no different from game dev tycoon this time around however you can choose to make your engines open source which will allow your community to improve on them for free or you can allow your competitors to use them for a fee you can also use your competitors engines yourself if youre willing to pay them for it

but city game studio not only adds features horizontally by giving more options for features and genrethemeplatform combinations it also gives you more to do vertically you have to actively compete with other game companies with the ability to buy them out and trade their stocks perhaps most interestingly you can develop your ivery own game consolesi there is also the ability to develop your own immaterialized store like steam the platform you are using right now to accomodate all of this you can buy multiple studios across the city of varying sizes customize their insides and hire as many staff as you want

if all of that didnt sound impressive enough ill have you know this entire game was developed by just one person who is still actively improving the game and communicating with the community 

now if youll excuse me i have to get back to fixing the coffee machine in my third studio

#####

i wanted to enjoy this game but theres something missing 

its strange all the pieces are there for a good game it has the same components as other games in its genre but each of them is not as polished or complete 

example employee happiness affects how good your games are but other than some overall advice on how to improve happiness more plants vending machines theres no explanation as to why a specific employee might be unhappy adding more of that furniture helps but thats apparently it

there are a few tips on what was good or bad about your game but basically you just stay in the slider ranges and youre golden no detailed explanation of why it might have scored lower than another game or why one scored better  we can only assume its a combination of the aforementioned sliders and staff happiness  energy 

its relatively trivial to release good products in this game especially if youve played other similar games somehow it feels a little hollow to do so i think the pace for creating and releasing games is too fast products are designed built polished and released at blistering speed and theres no sense of urgency or danger if you get it wrong because its so fast it doesnt feel important click churn move on to the next one the feedback for each one is minimal and the feeling of owning building and releasing games just isnt there 

the staff have happiness and energy but they dont have needs they dont like to work on specific products they dont have specific skills theyre just broadly separated into generic categories of production they are for all intents and purposes machines with varying levels of 3 stats the games you create dont feel unique they feel like little more than meaningless grey boxes that make money there are some basic options for how much time to invest in each area and additional addon features but they dont seem to be that important 

i want to like this game but it feels like im playing a corporate simulator at the level of a psychopathic ceo products staff offices  theyre all meaningless faceless machines that you build and hire to push out boxes that make money i dont care about any of it at all replacing the staff with actual robots might make more sense 

the news alerts are intrusive and largely unhelpful placement of furniture is arduous and lacks any copypaste or grid placement to help many parts of the game are like this  either vague generic or shallow so its difficult to become invested or want to spend a long time on it once youve released a number of games and started a few studios a few hours worth of work it doesnt feel like theres anything more to explore i can spend experience to unlock additional genres really but why its just another type of grey box theres no reason for me to do that it doesnt make any difference to making the number go up 

its a decent game theres nothing wrong with it i didnt find a single bug and it has all the parts it needs its frustratingly close to being good but its not

#####

released skyrim 600 times in one save made todd howard proud

#####

really good game gives me the illusion of being a game dev without the suicidal depressioninducing work and hours

#####

this game is really fun and complex i edited my review because the things that i asked for were actually implemented i highly recommend it

#####

love it 1010 but can you add a feature spinoffs where you can make a spinoffs of games that is popular or make more the 1 million

#####

a phenomenal developer who actively listens to the community still continues to support this game and its great to watch it grow 

this is a game i come back to yearly every year the dev has added a new twist and i play for another 15 or so hours 

this is a 13 game that eclipsed its rivals in the genre and provided vastly more entertainment and longevity than many 60 games 

the developer should be proud of this achievement no game is perfect but what is here is excellent and vastly overachieved my expectations 

i look forward to seeing what you do after youre finished here

#####

this game is pretty fun and not as predictable or easy as other game dev tycoon games
nice graphics and awesome content so far cant wait to see how this game grows and progresses

#####

bicity game studio a tycoon about game devib is a tycoonstyle title where the player manages his video game company the game starts in 1976 but the start date is configurable it all starts with odissey and ends with the era of last generation consoles

players have to create their game engine manage one or more studios fulfill contracts unlock new genres manage marketing campaigns manage servers manage a dematerialized store negotiate with console manufacturers to obtain exclusivity or the right to publish games they also have to manage the competition crack their game to increase sales and hackers to get their secrets

inspired by a few similar games like igame dev storyi igame dev tycooni and isoftware inci this is probably one of the most advanced in the genre its absolutely crammed full of features to keep you and you business busy the developer mentioned that since the initial release theyve added in hacking cracking training building modding i mean you can have several studios working on the same project you can make your own video game console or your own digital store the shop has been revamped and so much more

masterful execution of balancing addictiveness and enjoyability

bthe goodb
 solid despite some limitations
 over 500 user reviews giving it a very positive rating
 most advanced in the genre
 you can have several studios working on the same project

 not the best graphics

if you liked game dev story and its pc equivalent game dev tycoon youll be very satisfied with city game studio

#####

really good game dev simulation game

#####

one of my favorite game dev games so far

#####

game geek
the ultimate game 
1110

i play this game on a potatotier macbook pro 2018 game runs perfectly if you like game dev tycoon but wanted something better get this game theres consistent updates and improvements and the discord server is full of the latest developments it is a great simulationmanagement game

#####

should work on a dlc or something so i can give this company more money great updates keep it up

#####

it takes the game developing game to a whole new level where you can have multiple game studios working on different games or the same game all at the same time while you can also make your own game console you can also make your competitors make games for it meaning you most likely will sell more consoles

#####

h1 disclaimer h1
this is a sort of uninformed review because i havent actually finished the game i just got to what is probably the halfway point 2000 and felt like writing about it
h1 overallh1
city game studio to me is the much more in depth brother of game dev tycoon while gdt felt more like an idle game cgs feels more like a management game and i really like it
h2 side note h2
this is not a critique but ive noticed the english is mildly broken i dont think its a problem because its intelligible you can tell what they are trying to say im not gonna blame someone for english not being their first language

#####

this game is without a doubt the most immersive complete and effective game dev sim ever made and this statement is no hyperbole i stumbled upon this game around two years ago and have followed its long journey throughout its early access process

for the past year during the fine tuning process of its development this game has added many features that other game dev simulators either lack or fail to compete with in this game you can do things like buy your competitorswho are dynamically programmed and can make their own games buy out each other expand etc you can make your own game console handheld or home and choose the components in it you can chose to be publisher or even build your own version of steam within the game the amount of things effectively packed into this sim leads me to recommend this game if you have been looking for am immersive game dev simulation experience this is the game for you

#####

im just a sucker for these types of games and this one feels quite polished 
feels promising thus far
its also made on linux and thats awesome

#####

going into it i thought it would  be just another game dev tycoon clone and while of course while it is very reminiscent of gdt it expands upon it in quite a few ways

the largest thing here is having more than 6 employees and more control of the studio itself along with the ability to have multiple studios honestly when i realized i could create and name multiple studios and have them make their own or collaborate on projects i was super excited

while i wish there was some more options in stuff such as console cases overall this game is really fun and well done especially since it was made by one dude

#####

i am a huge fan of simulationtycoon games so i already had huge expectations for this game

when i first started the game the game crashed instantly without even getting the first menu after making a forum thread i got in contact with one of the developers and they helped me

we found the problem and the solution and now i can play the game

now about the game

if you have enjoyed game dev tycoon or other similar games before than you will enjoy this one too it takes a different route from what were used to and that makes the game more enjoyable you should definitely give this game a try

im bad at reviews and i barely write any but because of the help i received i need to write one so that i can support the devs even more

#####

game that not only caters to my passion for game development but also serves as an incredible time killer this game has captivated me with its immersive gameplay and the constant efforts of the creator to enhance the experience i find immense joy in witnessing my virtual studio thrive and my games receive positive reviews from virtual players

the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and easy to grasp making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned gamers the variety of genres and platforms available to explore ensures that the game remains fresh and engaging allowing me to experiment with different combinations and unleash my creativity the process of balancing development tasks managing resources and strategically releasing games adds an exciting layer of strategy to the gameplay

what sets this game apart from others in the genre is the continuous improvement implemented by the creator it is evident that they genuinely care about their player base and actively listen to feedback regular updates and patches not only introduce new features but also address existing issues ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience its refreshing to see a developer who is committed to refining their creation and creating a positive community around it

i must also mention the supportive and friendly community that has formed around this game the forums and ingame chat provide a platform for players to connect share ideas and assist each other its wonderful to be part of a community that shares a common passion and is eager to help fellow game developers succeed

in conclusion this game has truly captivated my attention and kept me hooked for hours on end the realistic game development process coupled with the constant improvements from the creator make it a standout title in its genre if youre a fan of game development or simply enjoy engaging simulation games this is an absolute mustplay i can confidently say that it will provide countless hours of enjoyment and inspiration

on the surface this looks like an expansive take on game dev studio with elements of other software development genres like software inc unfortunately those surface looks are all you get game city studio suffers from the same flaws that game dev studio and software inc have without any of the mitigating changes that have been provided over time you can have multiple studios and have multiple people working there but theres no way to change who is working on what once it starts accidentally give that huge publishing job to the tiny expansion studio that you only use to crank out dlc welp enjoy eating that 1m failure penalty

it follows the formula of game dev studio to a fault without consciously considering where things could be improved if game dev studio was kairosofts game dev story but more so this is game dev studio but more so or game dev story cubed your developers have three different skills but are locked at how high they can go except for random new grad hires and must contribute to every part contrast this to software inc that allows projects to have a design team work on the design a programming team work on the base implementation a polish team work on bugfixes etc so that people within the team can work towards their strengths because of this or perhaps as a reason for this you are only permitted to work on one task at a time if you have a team with half strong design and half strong dev you cannot use the designers to do design contract work instead of dev work instead they must put forward their disappointing skills

the studio construction aspect may be fun for people who enjoy that although ill warn that theres no reason to consider aesthetics or function beyond your own interest dumping a bunch of coffee machines in the corner will make your office extremely productive you can rent additional studios or later choose to buy them although with the truly absurd difference in price between the two it is unclear why anyone would choose to purchase a building 20m fixed vs 10k monthly you wont be playing that long similarly you can eventually create a console such as my creation the shamecube or even an internet based game store but even there the options are somewhat lackluster you just press the right numbers to make the things happen

basically if youre looking for a small update to game dev studio this may be fun for a bit but it gets old very quickly and i wish i could refund at this point

#####

updating this review to just say i fully support this game i played it for the first time in a few months and all the new updates have been great i hope the fixes and improvements keep coming


im torn on how to rate this on the one hand its a fun and addicting game nice graphics good gameplay with some unique twists but mostly inspired by all the other game dev games out there but on the other it lacks replayability id say the price is worth it for the one run you probably enjoy

after beating the game on normal difficulty ive found myself coming back to the game but not playing more than a few minutes i didnt use any of the guides for slider settings during the first run so decided to try using them during the second run where i upped the number of competitors to 12 the max and set the difficulty to hard but theres no challenge at all and not very fun i know there is a random combo mode however i feel like that adds an unnecessary challenge and ruins the immersion

the other thing i noticed is that no matter how well or badly my games are doing i seem to be making more money than my costs by a factor of 10 or more 1 million in sales less than 100k in costs this makes it so you can rent the largest building and max out the building and still be okay financially

i have minor complaints about the ui for example setting the hr for a studio i always have a hard time find it i also wished it provided more info about your studios and your games

while the studio concept is cool it doesnt seem any different that having multiple dev studios in say software inc or mad games tycoon

also disappointed apples mobile devices were not included i hope theyre added along with the ability to create your own console

lastly i absolutely hate the two mini games  hacking and cracking terrible terrible terrible i hope the dev removes those

story time my first run was very successfully my company was called electronic arts inc and i started to buy out all the other game studios and named them after real studios ea owns or has shut down for even more immersion i named games after famous seriesfranchises many that have been undoubtedly ruined by ea the number of fans peaked at about 450k in the 90s i believe before it plummeted to 90k by the end of the game 2020 average game rating went from 8 to between 5 and 7 and only went up to 8 near the end of the game when i actually tried to balance the teams by the end of the game i had 12 billion in the bank with something like 13 studios and over 400 employees held a yearly convention in february at my own convention center rented out servers for my virtual estore all in all it was a fun run if not a bit rushed as i was going for all the achievements i hope there are some added for buying every studio owning your own convention center hosting your own convention center being worth 1 billion dollars and milestones for number of employees

#####

if you like games like game dev tycoon youll definitely love this one it has a lot of features to make a game when you create your games first youll problably notice that you may not know how to make a perfect one but the more you complete the games the more youll have hints on how to make a goodperfect one over time if you dont mess this up you should be able to make perfect games

the better the game and the better popularity your games and company has the more cash youll make you can have more than 1 studio as well so you can work on more than 1 game in this game

of course its in alpha but it feels very solid even know the developer seems to listen to its userbase when they feel like a certain features needs to be in the game it makes sense since game buildingmanagement type of game is a rather a niche one

dont look at this game for its graphics thats not important here i mean its a management sim so stats and numbers are  i do feel there should be a bit more animation and more fun stuff going around for example your characters when they go in holidays should get up and leave when you repair or upgrade stuff there should be a mechanic coming in and reparing it when you work on an action game they the computer screen of all your characters should mimic what their working on i guess with time well see this kind of stuff implemented

conclusion
if you played games like game dev tycoon buy this youll be happy with it



ps how many times did i say the word game lmao

#####

addicting entertaining time waster amazing gameplay features all round beautiful experience respect to the developers

#####

im not one to review but this game doesnt have enough support it a fun creative game and it has a lot of potential it has lots of consoles game genres and themes which allows for lots of customization also its more user friendly then software inc but software inc is like that because it allows for more customization for the graphics of the game but it is like that because its i software i inc not i game i inc also its an improved version of game dev tycoon 

yet there is some flaws to it first its very short you can finish this game in 5 hours if you would like but that doesnt mean that there is no replay value to it you could play this again and it different every time second you cant make dlc or updates it would be great to make a lots of dlc ea style or update your game without having to making a new one third and finally make a theme research tree you did such a good job with the genre tree you can pull it off but dont block all of the themes off we need basic ones to start us out on what ever genre were doing

all in all it is a good game that has a bunch of potential with some minor flaws and is overshadowed by bigger and more popular games like game dev tycoon or software inc

#####

excellent game dev game id daresay this is probably the best one out there right now having improved upon the releases before it

#####

i like this game a whole lot it has a lot of depth features etc the ui is solid and the graphics match the games style theres not too much of a learning curve which is good for a more general audience i do wish their was more customization when it came to actually creating the games themselves not a lot of game dev simulation games do that its always simple when it comes to creating games

in this game you start as a really small game developer from your home youll make games to grow and will buy a new building which will be their own studio this game feels a lot like game dev tycoon but i like it that themes are already unlocked at the beginning of the game and that you can have multiple studios and them doing different tasks   it is nice to keep one person at your home because you can let different studios different tasks when having just one person at a studio in a building that doesnt cost that much money he can do ports of games and do the research what went well and what not in already published games you dont need a whole studio for those tasks just one person 

on the steam guide section you can find good guides for knowing how to place the sliders to get a good game without it youll need a lot of trial and error before getting it right 

this game has a lot of achievements you expect in a title like this some are for creating a game with a familiar name some are for just making x games having x studios and going on like that the unlock 75 platforms achievement might be missable because after a while the support for a platform stops  most of the achievements are for just playing the game without worrying about them which is good 

it has a few very grindy achievements a bit too grindy if you ask me i got all the other achievements when i was around the 300 games mark this was with restarting a few times so it might be even possible to get all the other achievements earlier from that point on i didnt care about anything anymore expect the number of games it took around 5h 25 of my gametime to get those 700 more games and post mortems i had like 31 studios all with 5 people so the game already had the setting that i was making indie games those take less amount of time to make it was a real grind and i could only handle around 100 games a day before i was just too bored to keep going it always sucks when games to this very long grind at the end for those last achievements because it let you leave the game with a bad taste for an otherwise good and enjoyable game

#####

necessary features lacking as of 1st july 2019
 copying of studio designs
 joint studio projects
 team training
 headhunting it should be possible to hire renowned professionals for premium not just lure them from your competitors
 developing own engines to decrease the workload
 release cancellation for all platforms at once
 autorenewable ad campaigns
 autoattendance at cons
 ways to get genre points other than making games
 release of patches updates and addons

also variety in rankings is lacking you should have dozens of phrases for every opinion of every journal and site
graphics could use some optimization with studios of 100 members causing lags on pretty decent machines 3770k16gssd1080ti
slider values feel very random rpg not requiring good artwork open world games not benefitting from increased mod support wtf and unnecessarily contrived come on physics as a game development parameter in 1980s

all in all a tentative thumbs up this may turn out to be a decent game yet

#####

underrated game ive played madgames game dev tycoon and this game is in the same league

#####

game dev tycoon but better

#####

best game dev around

#####

one of the best tycoon games on steam by far adds all of the features that people wished for on game dev tycoon

#####

nope 

it pretty much rips off game dev tycoon to the t i mean damn at least change something and yet is worse in every possible way

the ui is clunky and confusing you dont really know whats going on because theres way too much going on with almost no really direction yes there are popups that tell you what is what but they arent triggered at the right time and usually get so lost in the mess of a ui

the gameplay it is exactly like game dev tycoon but misses the mark in every step while gdt made the reviews more or less random with some elements helping to prod the reviews in a certain way here it is straightforward pick a combo that has a good score with a trending genre and keep all the sliders within the recommended limits and there you go a good game change any of that slightly and its bad i mean think about it for a second if you focus on optimization more than what is recommended you end up with a bad game how

also why arent there resolution options most of the text icons and images are low resolution and it is so annoying why would a 2019 game have low res assets
it stayed in early access for 2 years but i think it needed way more time than that its simply not a polished game if you ripping off a game at least make it better than the original or make it cheaper but no its neither

not worth your time or money

#####

advantages
 nice genre of the game its interesting
 porting to other consoles is a good idea for the game


disadvantages
 quite a easy game once you can full experience for anyone genre of the game just keep your production and will be 80 marks or more
 repetitive task in different genre of the game although we can choose many game genres for our production i cant see the different between those genres
 i dont know what is the meaning of those low market share consoles ill definitely choose the higher market share

i love simulationtycoon games good game for me anyway 

#####

i really want to love this game but ive ended up hating it 

it is so close but at the same time so far and the irony is youd have to rip out several hundred features from the game to get at the essence that would make it great it fails as the sum of its far too many parts it should have been game dev tycoon  and starts off with a similar feel of early bedroom dev fun as you try to move into your first studio but it quickly turns into game dev adhd

whilst it effectively keeps you glued with its just one more click hooks it inexorably accelerates into a mess of plate spinning and frustratingly watching entire platforms be born and die before your eyes whilst you wait for your team to develop a single new game because you didnt keep up and just when you think you might have a handle on the game concepts it adds in some more to put an end to that hope

the biggest flaw is that the game encouragesdemands you to expand your studios and staff in a sort of minigame played out on a pointless city map and thus keep up with resources required for the everaccelerating pace of technology  but the kicker here is that you dont want to what you want to do after a while is focus on developing that perfect game with one studio  a work of love patch it and then keep the online base happy and you just cant afford the time to do that or you fall behind it feels like a thing you can never get to enjoy because the dev of this game wanted to add in every possible aspect of game dev and beyond  like building your own consoles at the expense of any time to savour your creations

ive tried to play through this game twice over a year apart almost having fun each time but there was a point reached each time where i just suddenly went enough and within 30 seconds after hours of investment had quit and uninstalled it as well because it had just got so ridiculous i wanted out 

that is never the response you want a strategy game to have on you

#####

better than game dev tycoon

#####

while similar to the more wellknown game dev tycoon this game offers more gameplay variety and complexity this can allow for more multiple repeat games

#####

i can make a small fortune by completing contracts one after the other but im barely able to make 10k of profit on a game that is very well reviewed needs a lot more balancing

#####

shouldve add an option to make a movie adaptation of our games

#####

i really wish i could recommend this game as it has some interesting ideas but at this time i simply cannot 

my first issue is the user interface and this kind of problem is simply inexcusable for a game about game development of all things the interface is clunky and the icons are humongous this is a pc game at its core but the ui is designed for a tablet or console  the experience is somewhat bearable if one sits a few meters away from the screen as one would using an xbox 

the second problem are the sliders and employee skills percentages during the game development phases what do they mean what do they do the tutorial does a pisspoor job of explaining it and while on the face of it they should be selfexplanatory their use remains a mystery to me despite creating some semisuccessful games

#####

the game is very fun in the beginning and then it falls off fast
there simply is nothing much to do then doing games the same way as this process doesnt change

i think it would help the game greatly if there were layers to managing the everyday business of building software just like the real world

you start out in your garage  you do everything yourself that part is great 

at the point with 550 employees and 115 games in the making you would get some project managers taking cares of the nasty details you would be busy hiring people educating them andor planning products making deals development of units and marketing point is youd be doing managing tasks

when you have 5 offices and you are a real company you would be busy with your competitors trends bugdets and strategy youd hire managers and be busy with executive tasks you could go into every detail since you have done all jobs but you dont need to if you dont have to 

tldr
good game basics fun start
game atm lacks layers content to feel nonrepetitive after some time eg project management developing units server farms outsourcing jobs or doing contract work for others contracts both ways 

anyways fun for a few hours and i hope the developer continues with love for his baby as it has potential

#####

this game is kind of fun but i do not like the lack of beginnerfriendly tools how annoying managing multiple buildings at a time is and the incomplete dark mode ui would recommend for people who likes building a game industry

some suggestions would be
have some competitors pop out overtime in the map to simulate more people joining the game industry
allowing subsidies where the ai will instead manage itself for less micro
going public into the stock market where people can invest in the company for a share of all profits
expanding into certain regions and the blockade of sale in the warsaw pact

#####

this is just game dev tycoon but 200 better

#####

h1 labor of love for me h1
i played this game a few years ago when it was still in early access and even then the game gave me one of the best experiences for a game dev tycoon three years passed and 2023 is ending as im writing this and the game is still getting updates consistently and now has become an even better game that it was on late 2020 when i played this is a labor of love award winning game because even after coming out of early access is still getting better and better and were talking about a small studio that as far as i know is only one developer or a very small team this is an easy recommendation a really good game that has been taken very good care of and whose developer has always been very dedicated to keep improving the game even if it wasnt necessary

#####

city game studio is a wonderfully complex and fulfilling experience 

the game is true to its genre with many unique mechanics i havent seen in other games its very enjoyable as the more you play the game the more subtle bits of complexity come forward i was surprised at how much is in this game and asis in early access is well worth the asking price 

in addition to the game just being good the devs are extremely active and involved with the community ive started paying attention to the discord and have seen bugs reported and then fixed within an hour its really something to see

i highly recommend city game studio and look forward to experiencing its evolution throughout earlyaccess 

buy it

#####

a tribute to and a marked improvement upon game dev tycoon at first it seemed like too much added complexity but the tutorial does a pretty good job of guiding you through the early steps is decorating the office strictly necessary not really but it allows you to play a sort of minigame of arranging your employees and decorations for maximum efficiency though it hilariously doesnt require you to leave much actual room for your employees so you can pack them into some pretty tight arrangements if you want to 

finessing the percentile system is a little less than transparent and clearly i disagree with the game on how much time and effort should be put into certain aspects of development  it does make one scratch ones head that if you invest any more than 25 of your effort on cutscenes the game wont be good i cant recall any game reviewer saying those cutscenes were just too damn beautiful theres also the same problem i had with game dev tycoon about the game saying that certain genres and game types were incompatible spoileryou cannot convince me that vampire and eroge dont go togetherspoiler i realize the game is trying to take something subjective and make it into an economic simulation but some of the pairings or notparings did leave me confused

but despite these little gripes i really did like the game the game has a great sense of humor automaticallygenerated game names are absolutely hilarious the punny renamed competitors are clever also the sheer volume of early consoles recreated here is fascinating clearly a labor of love by the programmers 

if you liked game dev studio youll love city game studio and even if you didnt like the former you may like the latter because of its improvements on the original

#####

i want to like this game i want to love it you just cant though every time you start to really enjoy this game something comes along to ruin your enjoyment the ui is horrible ui shouldnt be that important but in this case it is so bad it completely distracts from the game 

annoying little bugs pop up randomly the reminders for that goals you are playing through started scrolling repeatedly during game play and setting off an annoying sound i had to restart the entire game 

the game doesnt make much sense either the beginning is confusing and slow you end in a loop of doing the same thing just trying to bring in enough cash to make it to the next step but you feel as if you arent progressing 

i development is confusing too id almost rather see less choices in genres and more focus in actually making the development and reviews more refined 

i understand the indie development and tackling a topic such as this in this case though take a pass and try out some other tycoon game 


#####

this game is nostalgia incarnate if you want a great game dev business management game with a ton of content and an amazing creator who is dedicated to adding more buy this game

#####

as an avid fan of simulation and strategy games i recently embarked on a nostalgic journey back to the golden era of video game development with city game studio let me tell you it was an absolute delight to step into the shoes of a budding game developer in january 1975 and witness the evolution of my own virtual video game company

from the moment i set foot in my modest rented office space i was captivated by the immersive gameplay and the authentic atmosphere that city game studio effortlessly created the game beautifully captures the essence of the era making me feel like i had truly traveled back in time to the early days of the industry

one of the standout features of city game studio is its easytouse interface which allowed me to dive right into the game without any unnecessary complications navigating through the various menus and managing my companys resources was a breeze and it greatly contributed to my overall enjoyment of the experience the developers have done an exceptional job in streamlining the gameplay mechanics ensuring that players of all skill levels can effortlessly grasp the intricacies of running a game development studio

the depth offered by city game studio is truly remarkable as i progressed through the game i had the opportunity to witness the phenomenal growth of my company from hiring talented programmers to enhance the visual aesthetics of my games to recruiting developers to ensure the highest quality every decision i made had a tangible impact on the success of my virtual studio the sense of accomplishment i felt as my games gained popularity and my company expanded was truly gratifying

city game studio strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and complexity offering a satisfying challenge without overwhelming the player the gameplay mechanics and progression system are welldesigned ensuring that i always had meaningful choices to make and objectives to strive for whether it was selecting the next location for my studio or managing the workload of my employees every decision felt consequential and contributed to the immersive experience

considering its incredible depth engaging gameplay and polished mechanics its astonishing that city game studio is priced at just 1599 in a market saturated with games of this genre city game studio stands out as one of the best choices available 

in conclusion my experience with city game studio has been nothing short of fantastic the game successfully captures the essence of the early days of video game development allowing players to embark on a captivating journey from humble beginnings to becoming a thriving tycoon with its easytouse interface depth of gameplay and attractive price point city game studio has earned its place as a musthave for any fan of simulation and strategy games

h2first look reviewh2
incredibly addictive  

you start as a solo game developer and have at your disposal a few adjustable parameters to create the best game you can  i started on hardest setting played realistically  failed pretty quick  

i tried again still on hardest and simply maxed everything as much as i could  this time we launched  game of the year 5 times 2 years in a row

as you expand you need to hire more employees rentbuy property and develop game engines whilst at all times producing games growing your fanbase and balancing the booksit can be tricky especially when ps2 want 500000  96 months dedicated development

you get to attend shows and promote your games advertise through various media outlets and evolve as year by year new and improved systems come into view

it is tough it is confusing and it is rewarding

sadly i didnt record my second lp because i was merely trying to figure the game out seems i did at least a bit

61 hours in my first look that is addictive alright
really nice ui
nice level of options expansions and variations
easy to learn hard to master

it is quite a basic game concept really not sure how it could be improved upon  it doesnt get in the way but basic it is nontheless 

gameplay

#####

i really like this game but we need more interactionthis game was fun the first time i played it but after passing it i had a hard time wanting to come back for a second timebecause after i knew how to allocate points there were no other points that could excite meboth competitors and players seem to be just numbers to me
i think an important way for players to gain a sense of accomplishment in this type of game is to have adequate interaction and feedbacki know that the developers of this game are very willing to listen to the suggestions of the players so why not add the function of player community in this gameplayers in this game will only faithfully buy the game then wait for the next time they shell out moneythey have no claims or even desireseven if my multiplayer online game sells astronomically theyre only willing to play it for two months and then the number of people online plummets
please add more events for players to make decisions such as a game being cracked or a competitors discount saleby the way its just too easy to hack a competitors game or get a competitors game type and it makes the research points ive saved pointlessi suggest adding some restrictions such as spending some money or time to complete the crack cracked games are abominable both in reality and in the game so why not add anticracking and anticheating features to the game like in realityall in all this game really has a lot of potential and needs more content finally if you need a game designer please contact me

i played all the way to 2021 in city game studio on the highest difficulty unlocked by default and here are my thoughts 

tldr all style no substance its basically a featureless clicker game with a game dev story skin im surprised this is their full release it feels like a game that should be just now starting early access it started strong but then never expanded beyond that i kept expecting more managementfiddly bits to show up and they never did over time you instead unlock things like more sliders while creating games that youll very quickly have zeroedin on their ideal spot and then never touch again or more advertising options despite the best option still just being clicking the button to use all advertising or more optional sidefeatures that arent worth engaging with

long version
1theres almost nothing to be doing at any given time its a very passive game other than clicking through menus theres no training of employees their skills raise automatically theres nothing to manage you dont negotiate salaries or set hours or much of anything except click through menus to make games 100 of all of that stuff is done automatically literally the only thing you do is click the new game button choose a genre choose a theme then hit create game  wait for it to complete and repeat

2 the gamemaking process is pretty handsoff  you dont really need to fiddle with sliders or anything because the game does that for you any given slider has a target area shown to you and how wideaccurate it is is based on how many tips you have for the genre youre making this means that after making a game of a specific genre a few times it shows you exactly where to place the sliders for maximum scores in addition to this you can do things like contract work  work that literally takes under a second for your studio to complete which pays very well and gives a massive amount of tips for the chosen genre so theres no thought to put into the sliders you just slide them into the indicated area

contrast this against game dev story the og where you had zero indicator of where the sliders should be  it kept you fiddling with them with every new release trying to put together the perfect combination that was engaging solving a genre after doing a few seconds of contract work isnt

3 the best way to make money is to pump out new games repeatedly updating older games making dlc making your own console mmos cracking opponents games being a publisher for other studios  all these options the game gives you will just be ignored because the entire game boils down to just pumping out game after game after game why should i make a dlc for a game with 100million in sales to earn another 10million when i could just make another 100 million game instead you click through the new game menu so many times that i stopped even bothering to name my games there were too many of them

4 it has no answer to you scaling up the size of your business once you get above a certain number of employees you can do things like contract work in literally subseconds and it pays millions your own games eventually demand higher and higher scores which is the only resistance to expanding but you can just switch genres to get away from that or just stop making games and pump out contract work instead

5 it falls into the same trap as every other game dev story clone everything is based on real life videogame history and so for anyone who has been playing games since the 80s90s there are even more systems and subsystems youll never interact with for example you know that when the videogame market crashed in the 80s nintendo released the nes and started a renaissance so theres this moment where the game tries to build up a lot of suspense about the crashing market and tells you to be smart about what platforms you buy licenses for and says that things are going to be rough for a while  but you can just buy the nes license and coast to cool millions easily its a game that has a billion different consoles and even includes shit like the ouya and each one has different stats and capabilities and blah blah blah like it expects you to weigh the capabilities of each console and determine whats right for your game  but guess what i am a gamer so i know that if i just make pc games and then build my own digital distribution platform i will become a megabillionaire so i ignore that entire section of the game theres no reason to build a console make games for any platform but windows port games etc

6 it has absolutely zero of the charm that game dev story and other games in the genre have  like you never get letters from fans about how much they like your games youre never told howwhat your games are doing in any terms other than the raw sales numbers and fan count

tldr its basically a featureless clicker game with a game dev story skin im surprised this is their full release it feels like a game that should be just now starting early access literally any other game in the oversaturated genre is a better pick

#####

great game with an ongoing great support even years after the initial release recommend to all people interested in this kind of game

#####

enjoyable give it a chance 

#####

ive been playing city game studio for little under a month at the moment ive found it to be an awesome game that i already love to its core now yes it does look a lot like ye ol game dev tycoon im not ignoring that fact infact in my opinion its taken that base concept and made it 100 times better having added new part that make that concept so much better from the players prospective

the impressive amount of genres themes and customisable areas is amazing it leaves you with a million and one ways to play the game which is what i personally love in this type of game  there is a tyon of depth after 7 hours of the game im only just getting into the deeper end of thing i can definitly say it will give you hours of fun and because of that and its improvements to the concept of a game dev game i relaly do hope that you pick city game studio up i garuntee you wont regret it heck if you want to see how the game plays have a look here  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzz8d6_pgaolistpllscwsmnuzieyqq6r6twttrls9pigfat

codewritten by hidden gems review  httpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator38624426code

city game studio is a game who probably has been inspired by dev game tycoon there are some similar features but with this game seems they evolve in a better way and add a lot of new features in the process

the basic mechanics are you build a company of games and grow up contracting employees renting space for your company  and upgrading your games but there is more content and more technicism than that  you can even hack other games or companies and steel tecnologies or crack games that make it so cool and fun 

for me the game is already brilliant and complete only they need put save slots there is only 1 single save for being a perfect tycoon game

you can see my gameplay here  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvajsxdzyuzn4t2s

#####

sorry but i didnt understand the economics of this game at all for example the first game gets 91 quality but brings about zero fans and barely pays off with the same nearzero costs i dont understand how competitors choose engines  with the same features and a lower commission of 510 almost no one takes the engine with rare exceptions how the load on the team is arranged  why the team always fails to cope with the load i have absolutely no idea what factors affect it there is not a single guess i dont understand why i need a personnel department because the personnel officer always demoralizes the team but does not bring visible benefits it makes no sense to distribute the load productivity drops even more i dont understand why hiring doesnt affect anything at all  the team continues to fail in percentage terms by the way what kind of percentages are these and why 1000 points are indicated as the limit is also unclear to me by the way the roles of producer and accountant are clear this is a good feature

i like the concept and the possibilities but in the game almost all the mechanics are unclear at the same time i really want to master some features like creating a console or a digital store i didnt even begin to figure it out with it by the way its not obvious what to do with it in the interface but i dont really have any motivation  its negative first i want to learn the simplest things for example learn how to manage a team and create profitable indie games

i sincerely and wholeheartedly hope that you the developer will not abandon the game halfway through because it looks promising but something definitely needs to be done with the transparency of the mechanics so that there is no feeling that i do not control anything and the game seems to be playing itself

one more note there is a lot of content in the game which is great but i have to skip most of the content in the first 20 years since i dont have the opportunity to do anything with it i have neither the money nor the opportunity to actively use it by the 2000s i had almost completely ceased to be interested in the novelties of the console market for the same reason im developing too slowly to have time to react

unfortunately my conscience does not allow me to recommend her right now but i insist on putting her on the wish list i am sure that she needs polishing a little time and a hidden diamond will turn out

#####

i saw another review that this is basically game dev tycoon but better i have to fully agree with that

in its current state the game is game dev tycoon expanded and there is still more content to come

on top of that the developer responds to a lot of feedback and makes regular updates

#####

as a video game history nerd its pretty wild to play out my fantasy of working at atari in 1979 that fact that city game studio is built in godot is just icing on the cake congrats on leaving early access

#####

if you enjoyed game dev tycoon or enjoy tycoon games in general this charming indie game is for you this game is a much expanded on improvement over game dev tycoon create your own logo build your own studio make games about pandas fighting aliens or whatever tickles your fancy you can make your own console or your own steam digital store you can buy out your competitors and then liquidate all their assets how fun its a fun business simulation game you can spend hours in i recommend it

#####

dont get scared away from the ui because i at first did but the game is amazing when you understand the ui 

has everything i ever wanted from gdt and some must buy

#####

im giving this game a second go after a few months of not playing it and i gotta say that im actually really impressed with the progress that it has come to lots of new featuresqol and the game even seems way harder than it used to be

still has ways to go but i can definitely see the potential if the dev keeps up with the updates which i hope he does

most definitely worth the price if youre into early access games and supporting the devs the progress has been really good surprisingly good wait a few more months if you want a more complete game but its definitely worth the money at the moment

#####

this game is a great concept and has plenty of more concept coming in the near future this game differs from the rest of the developer tycoon games and has more potential then the rest

for its current state its still a good piece shows its true self of its true nature of how the developer tycoon games evolved

9410
pros its a overall a good experience with good developer feedback and your feedback to the developer you can get your suggestionsbugs in quick for gameplay it has good replayability value
cons minor bugs but hardly noticeable this is expected for a early access title

#####

absolutely fantastic especially for early access steep but rewarding learning curve that just takes a few solid tries to gather an understanding of the mechanics if you like tycoon games then this one is worth the buy at only 1599 i see games from devs with similar ambitions release for 30 and with less content than this early access title so stop reading this and thank me later

#####

game diving is hard and this tycoon doesnt pull punches struggle as an artist eat nothing but istant noodles and try to push for that next hit game a nice sim that i wouldnt want to live irl

#####

maybe in the future right now everything else besides just making games after 2001 is not an option online games and store are not worth it

edit after developer response
it is extremely easy to make money fast i got 50m from an indie level game with 4 guys via publishing but thats all the meat of the game and it gets boring fast after doing that same thing 20 times

about the digital store its not developed properly you can open up a digital store so youre thinking that you can stop making games and turn into something like steam right wrong you need to develop the sale part of the store before you can sell anything but the store shows as being online again a store without the ability to sell anything after developing multiple parts of the digital store and enabling all of them no one will even come to sell on your store you have to create your own games to sell on there why

similar games like software inc and mad games tycoon cover the same concept in a more detailed and truetolife way and it just feels more satisfying here its just a lack of content and things to do except making games one after another

#####

its very additive i have 100 hours on with in the first week

#####

ive played most of the videogame tycoon games that have been released on steam i like this one the best 

if you wanted a more featurerich version of those games with more hardcore simulation elements this will be perfect for you

#####

this is a great game and its been updated constantly  its a labor of love by its creator and their attention to the game and the community of players who enjoy it truly shows its not perfect but its still great and its constantly improving

if youre only going to buy one gamedev game this is the one

that said there are two greats in this category and i would recommend them both for different experiences cgs this and mgt2 are the two best games of their kind both have benefits and drawbacks compared to each other  but i have enjoyed both immensely ive tried other game dev games and id say stick with these two

#####

the game is decent there are some things i dont like for example that you cannot import a company logo but have to draw it in a cheap paint program there are also some things i did like for example that you can automatically have your office decorated if you dont want to bother with it this is a good feature i havent seen in other games before 

however in total the game is pretty uninspired and sterile if this game had come out in 2012 i would have called it a milestone but in 2019 or even 2021 its not enough since its basically 99 the same as game dev tycoon after almost a decade it has the same enjoyable aspects but also keeps the same fundamental flaws in game design after all it does not feel like an evolution much there are just too little fresh ideas or improvements over the countless other titles in the genre of dev simulators which makes it feel a little too generic 

in fact if the game stood for itself it would be fine but since other similiar games exist and be sold at much lower price you have to ask yourself why would you choose this one and not another

#####

very fun played games like this on mobile before and it cant even be compared to this would recommend 1010

#####

i waited to review until i did my first full playthrough and i have to say this is the best game management sim since game dev tycoon its also deeper than that game as well

the beauty of gdt is its simplicity and the style
the beauty of this game is the business side of it buying properties making more studios and allowing different studios to work on different things

i would say a couple options need to be added things like allowing more game genres from the start picking one like action pushes you to stay with that one when you get good at it and not explore other options and possibly a more obvious way of seeing how many copies a game sells without having to go into tooltips thats just a preference

also another big thing is that the developer is super fast at updating the game and amenable to comments and reviews

#####

i came from recommendation of the well known game dev tycoon expecting a buggier version of that well i dont think i have very accurate expectations

the sole developer for this game has quite an ambition instead of just a clone of gdt there are features added and layers of management that its spiritual predecessor lacked furthermore there are more features on the way and potentially even some sort of interactable city

in my experience this game isnt the sort of bug ridden ea game but actually quite a pleasant one with a decent amount of content already

considering this is largely a oneman project i am extremely impressed at the level of ambition  and credit to where its due i think its on the right track i recommend anyone who liked the original game dev tycoon and try it out and also those looking for a deeper and wider experience than the original

#####

the game has very high potential in terms of depth gameplay performance and stability currently new updates and features are available daily the future prospects are good it remains to be seen whether the developers can maintain these extremely ambitious fast development steps

#####

if youve played game dev tycoon then this will be familiar to you but in a good way as this takes everything from that game and expands upon it adds a few new features game is also still being updated despite the fact that it launched in a satisfactory state so kudos for that too

#####

severely under appreciated this is like game dev tycoon but with a lot more mechanics  that make the game extremely fun and repayable if you were ever interested in the game dev genre this is mush better than pretty much all other options

#####

updated for august 2021 end of early access

compared to game dev tycoon city game studio is much more complete from console and engine making to having to compete with real competitors and being able to own as many studios as you want there are still things that could be improved but overall this is probably the best game dev tycoon out there and more than worth it for its low price

#####

the game play is fun but i have one major issue with it the losing system so when playing the game you lose when you go below 0 dollars period there is a loan system in the game so instead of instantly ending the game when you go below 0 dollars you could maybe like every other games similar to this give you a 1 million dollar loan or something and have a popup

#####

im not normally one to post reviews but i really like this game unlike other game dev tycoons ive played this one feels more realistic in terms of how long your games stay on the market if you make a good game advertise it well it can sustain your company quite well the developers are also great which really improves my overall feeling about this game i encountered a bug that caused the game to crash when you port one of your games to a new system i went to the discussion boards and asked if anyone else had this issue within 6 hours the developer had responded to me and apologized for the problems the bug caused and promised to set about fixing it right away the developers positive response alone is worth a positive recommendation for this game because it shows they care about their game

#####

good game dev sim that deserves more recognition the game is still being updated consistently

#####

its really fun really addictive



#####

this game is not as in depth as other games in this genre but i like it it progresses at a good pace and you dont start off as a failure like in most other games like this its not that this game is easy its just that in the beginning the critics dont judge you like you made a game in 1970 in 2021 which unfortunately most games in this genre do they have you start from scratch but judge your games like you have all the knowledge tech points of the game i like the autoupgrade of computers but i do think there could be more furniture available since you have to furnish this big office when you buy your first office all in all i just played for like 4 hours straight and i wasnt bored at no point the tutorial is kinda funky but youll get the gist

#####

easily one of the best video game tycoons on steam and definitely one of the best for the whole genre i had initially gotten really into game dev studio but during my first playthrough i kept thinking  when do i get to design my own office when do i start competing with other big companies when can i make my own console afterwards i searched through steam looking for the game i had imagined game dev studio could be

thats when i found cgs this game is a lot more complicated and theres a lot more granularity to the decisions you make but once you get the hang of the new mechanics it really is an incredibly immersive experience

the community is friendly and the developer is receptive easy to use mod tools exist which makes it very simple to start adding a lot of basic custom content

overall would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a little more out of their game development simulations

#####

game dev masterpiece

#####

its not perfect but based on the 9 hours ive put in so far im having fun with it

sometimes depending on the speed some messages can pop up and go away before you have a chance to read them like a game over for instance where you know you lost but you didnt see why

scaleable ui would be nice too as the ui elements are relatively large and either making them smaller or being able to see more information within windows would be nice or even being able to resize some of the elements on the screen like desktop windows would be nice im mostly thinking about the info box on the right side of the screen that could stand to be larger vertically since there is a lot of unused screen space above and below it

it would also be nice to have some off design elements to make the studios feel more like game development offices and less like regular business office maybe stuff like game posters statues or displays that you can sometimes see in actual dev offices thats more a nice to have than something needed though

#####

very fun game

#####

considering its still early access this is pretty good but i think it can still do more to differentiate itself from other similar games

#####

有个恶性bug希望能修复修复后改好评
1 我给工作室替换hr替换几次以后就会发现不能再次给工作室指定hr经理了hr经理是一次性的吗
2 制作人市场经理这些功能性职位也是一次性的我游戏已经下架了还不允许我使用之前的制作人难道每个制作人我只能用一次然后就解雇掉

im glad to see your reply to my questions i dont know if you can see this message too
the question 2 is my game has discontinued but i cant assign jobs to my producers either

this is truly a gem in the game dev tycoon world ive played mad games tycoon 1 and 2 game dev tycoon and a few other dev tycoon games and none are quite as good as this many of the previously mentioned games have very easy ways to just become rich but not this one

im leaving this review because i want more people to get into this

#####

give it a couple of months and this game will be one of the best video game tycoons out there you can also get it now and give suggestions to the awesome solo developer that has been working on this game since it came into ea

#####

its worth and its getting better each update i recomend it
very deep gameplay

#####

worst game dev business simulator ive ever tried 
horribly unbalanced in ways i would not expect to be fixed  

pros
late game supposedly has some more variety than some other games in this category

cons
on normal difficulty
highscoring games dont necessarily earn you any money i lose money on about 90 of games i produce and earn very little on the successful ones  
high scoring games barely earn any fans 140 in my experience but averaging 5  
no way to track how much money your game engine makes
game progression locked behind arbitrary and unclear walls
only way to make money is contract work for other companies which does not give you genre points or experience with building the game types you build for the other company  
cannot save regularly only one autosave 
contracts sometimes randomly end before the time is up causing you to fail contracts with huge penalties
marking email as spam does not block that type of email
menus are poorly organized

if you want an idea of how this game plays check out the beginner guide on the community page take note that the strategy is to not produce any games until you have 100000000   

in the beginning the first thing to do is to take on contract work asap and constantly start on the smaller ones that require like 1015 production points  

keep taken on more contract work and buy i would say upto total 34 small studios and fillem with 35 devs each  

you will want to basically keep this expansion process up till i would recommend you get like 200 devs under your wing

once you get 100m saved you should be safe to try and make your first i would say 3 games however you wish tho most likely they will not bring in enough  to make a profit

#####

	great game and fantastic approach to simulation management
	dev is addingtweaking stuff almost daily
	very fun experience and one of those games that make time fly
	could be considered a true successor to game dev tycoon

#####

this is a very good game and in my opinion better than game dev tycoon which have been a good game in this genrethe fact that you can create different studios makes this game one of the better ones on the market creating different kind of strategies how you wanna approach your gameplay the one thing i dont like about it is that its a lot of micromanaging there is no option to set someone else in charge of things which makes the game very repetitive i recommend this game if you have played something else in this genre of games

#####

the game doesnt give the player freedom and space for creativity dont play this play mad games tycoon 2

#####

if you like games like game dev tycoon you will love this game as well been having a lot of fun with it and with a fair price for an indie game its a little gem to pick up 

see gameplay footage in my playthrough

#####

in depth and detailed game studio simulator cant recommend enough also with the constant flow of updates the game is always getting better


#####

you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain 
i became a multibillionaire mostly thanks to mods and own everything and everyone wants to destroy me until they fail and i buy them out

#####

very nice game i thought it was going to be a gdt clone but i was wrong 
recommended to everyone who enjoy tycoon games

#####

for what it is i cant say i didnt enjoy it i think it is rather vauge about what it wants from you the vaugeness of it leads you to make allot of false assumptions about what it is they want if you do not give them exactly what they want you will simply fail there are some things that ive found to be completely misleading

for example there are certain amounts of time that are the correct amount of time these time sliders however as far as i can tell simply extend the development time of the game that is to say there is no time rationing however if you spend less time on something you seem to get better results it really wants you to spend a very exact amount of time on each thing unfortunately you have to play a game of hot or cold to figure out how much time is appropriate and since there is no reason to spend more time than less time you might as well use the bottom most possible time until the game tells you what it wants since you are appearntly penalized the same 

this is not the only issue but there is allot of this kind of thing just mechanics that dont work quite how you would assume they would work

#####

awesome game they update the game all the fucking time and its only getting better

edit much better now

#####

awesome had real fun playing it  it is a lot better than game dev tycoon which is still good
thank you so much for making this

#####

un des meilleurs jeux de simulation au quel jai jouer je recommande fortement a tout type de gamer ou casual

#####

love this game i missed the first one in 2013 looked like cartoon on cover so i passed i played dev master and liked it a lot the bubble sliders are kind of hard to get the hang of for me this is a good tycoon game and a lot of fun for some people who may have lived in palo alto in 72 when pong came out and have been gamers ever since runs at 60fps fx 4300 rx560 i played until 2010 on my first play thru and learned a lot up to 2003 on my second and already have new ideas for my next play thru if you like dev games and tycoon games this would be a game you should try 27 hours in three days got it on a friday didnt get much work done and not getting much done today on mondayi dont like to pay much for games and will wait years for my favorite aaa games to come down in price i bought this on sale and and very happy and would have been happy at full price which is saying something good game fun game not a stressful game for what it is i would say 90

#####

i find the game kind of annoying to play  i enjoy this genre of game but ironically so many of them seem pretty badly designed  this one has you splitting up into separate studios very early something that while perhaps realistic just wildly increases the micro and switching screens and such nonsense  there arent good saveload options it is not clear what some things do our how certain game systems relate to others  should i release a port or a sequel  who the f knows  there is not autopause or popups that are useful to help you deal with the micromanagement and overall the game seems more a series of chores than a game

i also never understand the desire to make this genre of game real time  if ever a freaking genre of game was amenable to being turn based it is this genre weeks months even quarters just have staff with skills and then click next and the progress increments  no more trying to time pauses or wasting 100k or 100m because you forgot to pause while micromanaging someones bathroomvacation breaks

which brings me to this genres bizarre love of having you decorate the office and decide what desk and furniture to use which a the correct option is always the best so it is no decision at all and b is just boring  the auto furnish feature here was great loved that but what in the hell am i doing furnishing the office anyway

i run similar business the computer and furniture for my staff is whatever makes them most productive  that is all the more i deal with it

behind the slick and attractive ui i found a lack of thought to user experience and presenting functional and useful information efficiently  

anyway it is not a bad game it had few bugs that i saw and does what it says on the box so to speak  but it just isnt for me

#####

i hate to not recommend this coz this game looks cool and awesome however in my experience the gameplay was pretty hard on easy modei even set the money into 900m and i still ended up going to bankrupt lol its just so frustrating hard to play tbh i was dissapointed lol i thought its gonna be fun but it turns out the game was so unplayable for me all in all id rate this as 610 need more improvemnts i really thought this one is going to be better than mad games tycoon 2 but i was wrong nevertheless this one has more features which i liked and makes the game even better than any game dev games out there
edit i changed it to the beta version which was unstable yet i was still getting bad results on easy mode as for now it may be im just badsuck at this game coz i always get like 55100 which was not too bad for the 1st game i created its just annoying when i get those marks inaddition i kinda like how realistic this game is the number of sales were quite accurate for new devs just like in rl the good thing about in this game is its features everything that i wanted in every game dev games were in this game which i really liked so much its so cool seeing those featuresmy fave feature is the auto furnishede mode thats the best thing this game has  overall i changed my mind to rate this into 810 very nice game highly recommended 

for devs this is my suggestion can yall put the number of sales in the report sales menu coz i cant be bothered to always drag the mouse to the graph just to see how many sales im getting coz thatd be handy and a cool feature to add in 

another suggestion change the background plssssss im begging i mean it doesnt look bad neither good i just dont like it how bout change the background to a real city or make the game 3d just like mad games tycoon 2 they went from 2d to 3d that would be so freakin awesome id love to see that in the future 

okay heres the list that i wanted
make the people to move around so the game would look lively not bland
change the ui on the left side where u develop a game coz its too massive could have made bit a bit smaller
change the price of the gamemake the price even higher this game has potential and u really deserve it u could go for 30 bucks however in that price i want to see new features like 3d the peeps were walking round etc
support like the feature in mad games tycoon 2
produce a disk versionsame feature in mgt 2
we can publish digital version premium edition and deluxe edition we can set prices for each version
multiplayer
basically just copy the features in mad games tycoon 2 theres nothing wrong with that the important thing is all ur fansim one of them were happy with enjoying ur game thats all it matters 
languageswhere we can select a specific language
change the ui of the game reports they look hideous 
there are some games which really do not need story character cutomization etc so i set them to like 16 and on the game report says i failed on the story and thats so unrealistic how could a theme park game needs a story what the hell fix that pls asap

that would be it for now

ik being a game developer is extremely hard i know the feeling of just staring at ur computer for ages and trying to figure out what could possibly go wrong or whatever take your time and have a rest sometimes ur doing such a great job keep it up 

best dev game 1010 now 

btw would you mind me asking this dont asnwer it if u dont want 2
how much money you guys had already spent for developing this game
sorry im just curios 

i can be a developer one day who knows lol 
life is pretty tough lol 

anyway its a great game 1010
i highly recommend this get it now support the developer theyre putting a lot of work for this 19 dollars nzd would be mean a lot for them you dont have a heart if you dont buy this lol get it now as you should

cheers

#####

gameplay is great would recommend

#####

good

#####

i love this game

#####

a very decent and mainstream step between the devstory and software inc with lots of fun and a much clearer game industry direction i enjoyed it and the mods gave it that realworld authenticitynothing like dismantling eais there

#####

going bankrupt for no understandable reason simulator 2021

#####

i think its a good game the only problem is its very hard to build fans even with publishing

#####

city game studio is one decent game but with a handful of problems if you are looking for something a bit more than game dev tycoon and are also patient enough and are willing to learn how things work i would recommend getting this game

it expands on game dev tycoon a bit more although gdt is more casual than what actual tycoon games do it gives you enough to manage enough so it doesnt feel overwhelming

although keep in mind this is me playing the game after getting the hang of it and also playing it for awhile for me to understand the ui and the mechanics for this game

the ui is one of those handful of problems that this game has very clunky for a beginner also no tutorial yes there are popups that give you hints but thats not really a tutorial console production hard to sell off because it doesnt give you a good head start i wish you could develop in more platforms than just one market research is a new thing but it is very confusing too as well especially with the switch buttons not really giving you a name or hint on what it does

i would rate this game a 710 i myself enjoyed it cause i like tycoon games but with these handful of problems it is hard to recommend it to someone who doesnt want to spend more than 2 hours to learn the game

#####

pretty fn good bruh

#####

i wish steam could let me give a meh rating to games as this is too good for a negative and not quite enough to be a positive thus my up rating to give you some idea of the length of this game im writing this review after one playthrough from the 70s right up until 2024 initially i wanted a few playthroughs now though i am looking for a different game

i wanted a simple game to relax with after work and whilst this game serves this purpose it becomes apparent how shallow it is after about 20 hours fun was had from remembering all the platforms i had experienced in real life plus the random name generator i purchased this game on sale and kind of got my moneys worth if i had paid full price then i would have likely opted for a negative review

in this game you can self publish games undertake contracts produce consoles and game engines and finally trade on the stock market developers have three skills and these correlate to the stages of making a game design development and polish theres hr reps who can increase productivity and control on what stages developers can work although this seems to be a bug as i could not find the option for random firing sprees to destroy game progress or office morale marketing managers to research trends and produce hype and network managers to reduce server load

sliders are used to dictate the rough amount of time to be spent on each area during the above stages getting these to the right values are what results in better reviews and lower game development cost it is possible to release indy normal big and aaa games

so why the negativity the games shallowness and lack of polish in areas

1 each platform has compute and graphic capabilities these get used by game engine features such as open world cinematics etc yet these features do not seem to affect reviews in a meaningful way yes the reviewers note not all resources were used but ive made millions off games that did not why not just use mono sounds and 2d graphics all the way i have googled for any reasons without really finding an answer
2 yes it is possible to set up something like steam or have a store front except this is not really more than a few mouse clicks you spent more effort reading this sentence
3 universities seem pointless developers level up by themselves
4 placing items in buildings is simple no one leaves desks or moves through doors so it is possible to just cram desks and vending machines all in one line for maximum bonuses 
5 development costs for games change without apparent explanation one month it will be around 4k points to release a normal sized game and then the next it is 600 this does not seem to be influenced by competitors and certainly not my actions
6 the optional mini games for hacking defending and cracking yeesh  ouch
7 progress bars in this game are inconsistent and annoying a few of them will be  progress and others are time occasionally the game will decide to mess about and cause the task to fail when it is around 60 full leading to fines for not completing contracts i was nowhere near the deadline when these tasks failed

#####

as an engineering student and game developer or trying to be i liked this game i will compare with gamedev tycoon
first of all the game is more modular than gamedev tycoon due the gives you more options than gamedev tycoon have for example  port game after the release updating game engine and more also you can open more than one studios of course the gamedev tycoon not a bad game but if you played many hours like me you probably look alternatives

#####

real good

#####

at this time i would wait to see the direction the game will go

#####

the game is absolutely bug ridden and when combined with the very unintuitive interface does not make for an overall pleasant gaming experience

if you havent played mad games tycoon yet then id go play that instead its a much better simulated game dev experience

however if like myself youve already invested hundreds of hours into mad game tycoon then id still suggest waiting until this game is fully released or be prepared to deal with a lot of frustrating bugs that conspire to ruin your gaming experience

#####

this is what every game development tycoon game should aspire to be the business managementdevelopment options abundant the balance between risk and reward utterly satisfying the gameresearch progression surprisingly well put together and again very satisfying the graphics leave something to be desired but by no means are bad as well with the music  while being repetitive and unvaried doesnt make you want to turn offdown the volume 

i would give this game an easy 9510 for its fresh take on the classic dev tycoon genre and the way it implemented its many new features that are missing from all the other dev tycoon games 

this game by the way is still in early access and is still improving all the time ive been playing for 16 hours straight and have only experienced one minor bug that did not impede my gameplay build mode controls hud stayed up after i left build mode and was fixed with a simple reloading of the game and one other instance where i though i experienced a bug when i lost half of my fans but after some research i realized it was from my own mistakes and bad advertising i had dismissed a notification without reading it whoops

but dont let anything stop you from purchasing this game and having countless hours of enjoyment i personally cant wait to see how this game finishes or for consoles to be released

#####

so far really boring game doesnt come not even near games like game dev tycoon or  software inc

absolutely poor and empty game feels like mobile app

competitors dont make sense as they do nothing
no real market competition or requirements by consumers
themes makes little sense if you decide to go for sports games

all in all im not happy

zyzla out 

edit

came back to this game like a year or so after my initial review and can honestly change it to positive as a lot of improvement is made here

#####

i find the interface cluttered and confusing and the gameplay uninteresting


#####

it is a good game not sure about replayability though i finished the game in about 34 hours

#####

its nice game with huge potential

#####

rating 8510 editing review because i now finished a game

i have loved this game since i got it  the more years went by the more i got invested in the game and it kept my interest throughout there are a lot of key elements that city game studio does better than any of its competitors and it is a very fresh take with clean ui and a very responsive dev it provides a variety of gameplay and is in itself challenging

my only con with the game at the moment is that it does not feel balanced although i still am yet to play on the hardest difficulty although the earlygame was quite challenging once i made millions from a hitgame and released my own consoles i was just a moneymaking machine with little effort creating hit game after hit game although this is partly from me being good i guess i do think competitors could be a bit stronger in some aspects or some balancing 

otherwise really incredible game best game in the game dev simulation genre  anyone who have played the other games should definitely play this

#####

this game is frustrating i love it

okay so to address the elephant in the reviews this game has quite a few simulates to game dev tycoon but that should not stop you trying the game out at least

my reasons to play the game
 the game offers a great challenge to the player
 it shows potential in growth with updates to the game
 the game is quite user friendly for and information intensive game
 it has everything game dev tycoon has but more note i love game dev tycoon alot and will continue to play the game
 it offers more room to play longer especially with the map size option and game speed option i can see inspiration from civilisation settings there
 the sounds are great and rewarding to the ear
 the pixel art editor for company logos is great and fun to play with
 the fact you can create  your own studio building for conventions and studio areas is great
 later in the play through you can assign different studios to different projects and have multiple income streams

the improvements i would add to the game
 have a more immersive tutorial it was too easy to skip the tutorial on accident at times and would prefer a more stand out way of being told what to do for my first play through
 the character customisation is a lot similar to game dev tycoons character creation i would add more options for the character via hats gaming chair or chair customisation wrist accessories anything that can maybe differentiate from game dev tycoon
 the music was a bit loud on launch but that could just be my headset and personal volumes so nothing important
 the games difficulty is awfully hard even at the lowest level it is quite easy to go bankrupt even after a load of contracts that got me to 3 mil i would recommend the offers for payments to be lower in at least qa difficulty i payed a console 19 mil on the first 5 years of my company was a bit insane to see

there is a lot more to discover as i havent played long but this is what ive came across so far and it is great
based on the features ive listed i hope it take your mind of the people that chose not to see the potential in the tycoon and try it properly

#####

favorite game dev tycoon game with coincidentally a great dev worth

#####

goty

#####

nice

#####

very fun

#####

great game i strongly recommend

#####

this game is excellent even though im having trouble with game ratings

#####

developer is releasing updates almost daily talks with the community and listens the game is a mix of game dev tycoon but so much more advanced even in its early state

#####

an excellent start  if you like tycoon or game dev type games youll probably like this alot  theres still alot of work to be done in terms of ui but so far its very promising  keep an eye on this one

edit

omg omg post 02800  thank you for giving us what we wanted the ui the convoluted mess of a ui is gone  its now what i was wishing for a deeper game dev tycoon game  if i didnt know better id say this was a sequel that said

dont stop improving it team this is a great step in the right direction but take it home

#####

its fun with a lot of room to grow
if i would compare it to gdt id say that they are similar but cgs have a little more to offer with hopefully more content and  mechanics to come

#####

amazing game developer talks to the players which makes it 100 better and updates every few days highly recommended

#####

fun game i feel like there could be improvement but i cant put my finger on it

#####

yea

#####

for a early access game its pretty good it would be nice to have a multiple file save system though otherwise no major issues also onlinemmo for gameplay needs a bit more like mini updates and expansions

#####

good game

#####

i played a lot of game dev story a couple years back and i was thrilled to see a new game of this kind i am not disappointed 
this one is even deeper the more i play the more new features and possibilities are added and im hooked

i usually play aaa games and dont write reviews but ill definitely check more indie games after this one 
good job thanks for the hours of fun

#####

i loved game dev tycoon and i was looking for a fresh experience city game studio has the same appeal and certainly was addicting for the first few houres but in retrospect it seems to me as a waste of time i didnt like a few things

it is too hard to make money with good indie games compared to how extremley easy it is to make money with contract work  just contract work for the first decade and build a team and farm tips to then release a mega game which will flush you with cash i recommend decreasing the payout of contracts the more you do them

there is never enough decent designers in the hiring pool and the hiring pool doesnt increase in size which is quite annoying at the later stages of the game having 70 workers and many million dollars also balancing your teams becomes tedious and the fire button should ask you again if you really want to fire a person

conventions arent intersting and do not feel impactful at all

when you release your own console you want to it to do well but you are the only one releasing games on it which is blocking you to gain a sizable marketshare with your gamestation this leads to you spamming publish game offers so more games in total are released which feels very micromangy and tedious

i love that you can do your own engine but this leads you to always make an engine which is the same as all your competitors and you can use that engine on any platform  why not make it harder to develop an engine and make it so that you have to port it to other platforms

the game also needs more lively competitor companies you can buy out all your competitors quite early and they never really were any competition in the first place

those were a few thoughts of mine which ultimatly made me not like the game

#####

ce jeu on ne va pas se le mentir est très inspiré de game dev tycoon  
mais le travail est là on sent la passion du développeur derrière des mises à jours assez courantes et du contenus déjà très présent de quoi passer une vingtaine dheures fortement plaisante 
attention tout de même je conseille vivement de mettre la vitesse de jeu en lente en lançant la partie sinon en 78h vous aurez vite fais le tour de tout le jeu ce qui a été mon cas jai refais une partie du coup p 
bref si vous cherchez un jeu indé fort sympathique foncez 

#####

great game that builds on what game dev tycoon had and makes for a game thats more fun and expandable with just the base content available with modding possible in the future

i hope to see more in the future 

#####

the finest game development simulator ever made and perhaps by far  it is a joke that game dev tycoon is immensely more popular than this  this is still getting updates  the only flaw i can think ofother than it not being made by a big team of highly skilled and wealthy developers is that there are no difficulty achievements  get this game if its your type of game

#####

at current once you get to a decent company size youll start having most of your employees resign without warning and youll spend more time hiring new employees than developing games or even playing this game cant recommend it as it is as with how frustrating it is to get your studios average development scores to equal out so the game doesnt yell at you about it when you try to develop a new game youll just give up after a few hours at best its an interesting game with good potential but it really needs some work on employee resignation

#####

i used to have erection problems but after playing this game im now rock hard
i used to want to make games irl but after playing this i realised thats too much effort

ive played game dev tycoon  mad games tycoon but they arent half as good as city game studio  its so easy to lose hours playing this you can make your own engine to make games make your own consoles and online store  you can pay other publishers to make games for you buy shares in competitors but most importantly you can get free mods of the steam workshop to change the name of parts consoles and publishersdevs to their real life names

i rate this game making game a in game made game out of ten

#####

ok

#####

if you enjoyed either game dev tycoon or startup company youre gonna love this game

seriously if thats you buy this game right now

its pretty much a crossover of these two games but on steroids and its glorious i suggest playing on easier difficulty to learn the ropes and then if you like a challenge go for for the higher difficulties you really have to try and fight for survival against the competition and i loved every second of it

#####

i like this game but i feel as though it is too bare bones and the mechanics are a bit contrived my main focus in making this review is to highlight what i feel is a mechanic that is underdeveloped and not well thought out genres and themes are a neat idea but the way they are implemented is not so neat

themes are basically topics from from gamedev tycoon however unlike in gamedev tycoon there are very few themes in this game and nearly half of them are either so vague you cant even really discern what they mean which is bad because then you will have to trial and error to find out which genre it works well with or they are so specific that their isnt even broad enough of a concept to give the player an creative liberties an example being the sports genre for which there is soccer soccer and more soccer an entire genre limited to soccer

genres have the same problem more or less some of the genres are only compatible with a few or even only one theme sports others suffer from the problem of being to vague especially the first seven genres in gamedev the genres were similar to the first seven in this one but in that game those were the only genres it worked in the case of gamedev because  of that though if there were super specific genres it wouldve completly cut out the ambiguity of the starter genres making them in a way paridoxical what is an action game is it not an fps tps or any of those things if it is why is action even a genre in the game to begin with it is made redundant by the more specific genres and therefore an obsolete genre

#####

i have no idea how i managed to missed this game for a year steam please fix your recommended algorithm

#####

feels like a solid take on the gamedevtychoon genresubgenre
also very positive that it is built with only freeasinfreedom software

#####

deeper than game dev tycoon but graphics need polished

#####

so as someone who plays just about any gamedev tycoon game that comes out i have to say im mixed on city game studio

on the one hand multiple studios works quite nicely games like this and mad games tycoon 2 have learned from their predecessors that confining to one big building only gets you so far
theres nice features in here like having a level of relationship with console manufacturers and offering them money to get development licenses and theres a massive variety in genres
its nice to have competitors though they feel a bitirrelevant at a point they eventually are just massrespawning due to constant buyouts it would be nice if a competitor was flagged to compete with your favourite  most common genres of choice

on the other hand this game often feltunbalanced or lacking unless youre on the higher difficulties the game has a kind of too big to fail issue where your development costs are negligible even if a game flops badly even developing a console is rather cheap it just requires a lot of skilled labour to pull off in a reasonable time once you get one breakout hit youre set for life

universities was an interesting idea but its crazy that theres no weaker  costlier alternative to train staff early on you have to get insanely rich and then build a uni campus not to mention it can take an absurd amount of trainees at even medium sizes

it often feels like things are unexplained outside of a few simple beginning objectives staff have caps to their stats but this goes away if you train them at all though this isnt mentioned at all until the developer brought it up in the discussions this led to me playing for hours trying to avoid unskilled staff in the hiring list because their stat caps were terrible

despite the amazing amount of genres theres a serious lack of themes for games this is probably because im spoiled by mad games tycoon which loves to add themes like theres no tomorrow but i do think it could be fleshed out a little

theres awkward breaks in console parts eg handheld cases just completely stop after around the turn of the century i was competing with a new 2019 handheld that was more powerful than the latest home consoles but it had the same case i used in 1999

i cannot stress enough that whoever thought it was fun for us to have to hunt around a massive office for broken coffee machines and replace them needs to take a good long look in the mirror especially if you quickly use an office with preplaced furniture this is genuinely the most annoying part of the entire game


i review this game positively only in the absence of a mixed option it could be a comfy 8510 if it got the rebalance and polish it needs though i lean towards calling it a 610 due to quirky innovations to the overall genre that are let down by aforementioned issues

#####

i mean its a pretty good game

#####

at the moment i would have to not recommend this game it has great potential and has a lot of features that were missing from game dev tycoon but at the same it lacks a lot of polish quite painfully in other areas for example there is no real tutorial and a lot of the game is left to experimentation yet i find that if youre not constantly putting out hit games you will bleed money very quickly the ui is a little clunky and leaves a lot to be desired i had to start a new game 34 times because each time i would try to experiment to find the right combinations for games end up releasing a mediocre title lose money rinse and repeat until i either had no money or until i had taken so long to recover that all the other studios in the game were way far ahead of me and i essentially could no longer do anything

that being said the developer does appear to be very transparent and consistent with updates so i have no doubts that with enough time the game will reach a state where i can happily recommend it when that happens i will update my review

edit 101922 this game has made massive improvements since i last played it it is a much more enjoyable experience now highly recommend to any fans of sim or game dev type games

#####

refunded i tried to like this game but its too flat and soulless

#####

if youve played games like game dev story game dev tycoon mad games tycoon and others you know what to expect city game studio takes game dev tycoon and makes it bigger one playthrough is very long and youll be doing a lot of the same stuff over and over again all these games have this problem the gameplay loop becomes repetitive city game studio has it worse because one playthrough is a lot longer than in similar games and in stead of one studio making one game at a time youll have multiple studios that all do the same thing over and over again after a certain point making money becomes very easy and your company and you will become a soulless husk of its former self a big too realistic for my taste

#####

amazing

#####

great game

#####

i would say no not really but i have too many hours on it to do that so yea go buy this shit

#####

just like game dev tycoon but 10 times betterfasterstronger

#####

this game is better than mad game tycoon

#####

best game ever

i am very uncertain if i want to keep this game or not i want to give it a neutral rating so far

it seems promising enough it expands on things that mad games tycoon for example already had but i feel likeits almost too much not just managing one game studio but over time several more and overseeing several houses instead of just one it is somewhat as i had it with the most recent anno  too much switching between different locations and for a game development game i feel this might become too much to the point that it becomes more annoying than fun  i have come close to that point in mgt already even when my one studio was at the most expanded point that i just zoned out and mindlessly clicked around instead of really playing

#####

its a spiritual successor to game dev tycoon through and through 

many options in gameplay feel like what youd expect to find in a sequel to game dev tycoon

you can make game engines and actually make money from them via royalties

the console license system is actually analogous to realistic situations in todays gaming industry with exclusivity deals to make the license cheaper to get

i havent even scratched the surface of the game either

must have for fans of game dev tycoon

i would pay money for this game too even though i was gifted it i want to because its just that fun

#####

amazing game best game dev game out there love it

keep up the good work

the only thing that bugs me so far is the staff get exhausted far to quickly 
maybe make it a hidden skill so the staff can get through bigger games without needing a holiday mid way through

#####

the difficulties are so unbalanced easy is hard as hell and the difference between easy and normal is insane

edit after changing to the unstable version the difficulties are def more balanced and its a lot easier

#####

amazing

#####

#####

contracts are op

i was searching for a gdt substitute and i finally found it amazing game congrats for the devs

#####

a very pleasant surprise in the middle of a market that was starting to get stale after the success of games like game dev story and game dev tycoon many games of this genre have come up with many creative ways to make it work and im happy to report that this game went above and beyond my expectations 

working in the game industry in the real world i have to say that this game doesnt really capture the struggles of game development  but this is fine because this isnt meant to be a pure simulation its a fun arcade experience sure a few more elements of simulation would be more than welcome but the game easily gets me hooked with its deep features despite some simplicity in some areas

companies rise and fall in a proceduraly generated world theres a different city for each new playthrough where you can view your studios and your competition you can do a lot of things that you see in other games like this but theres just so much more that is absolutely exclusive here and it makes the game stand out like the ability to crack your competitions games to hurt their sales

the proceduraly generated nature of this game is what makes it insanely replayable when compared to other games of this very special genre i would highly recommend the developers of this game to continue exploring new ways to increase that replayability with proceduraly generated consoles designs maybe even branching out to more citiescountries maybe bringing a major expansion that takes us to the deep future where the concepts of the video game industry are completely different from what we know today

this has been a lot of fun and surprisingly the developer is still delivering free updates to this day i will happily pay for any dlc if it ever comes to that point i want more

#####

its casual fun

#####

an awesome game dev tycoon that lets you do what you want and if you want a challenge it will give you one

#####

highly recommend

#####

fun gameplay loop and surprising depth for the 20 price tag solid purchase

#####

the game is really fun i really recommend it if you like these types of games

#####

nice

#####

decent entry in the roster of game dev studio games

#####

game is in constant pause mode game doesnt tell me why i looked everywhere even with google i dont find my solution


update it worked after the 5th restart but i still dont know why it didnt worked

thanks to the dev he seems to work like real fast

#####

i cant recommend this in its current state its hideous to look at it almost everything else i could forgive but this game looks just awful ive seen better looking flash games

#####

honestly just boring

edit after dev response i say somewhere during my review that you should leave it on your watch list for now though it simply wasnt worth the price for me personally and i felt the need to reiterate that it was a good experience overall there are a lot of things this game does very well but i just couldnt do it for the price he mentions that ill like it enough eventually to give it a positive review and to be frank hes very likely correct to be fair it is early access he does post a road map so you can view that if youd like i feel bad for giving it a thumbs down because in reality its a thumb to the side kind of deal for me

honestly i was very excited for this game i was looking forward to it greatly but the price has put me off for a very long time is it good yes is it worth its price no why so many other games either do the same thing or do the whole thing better games like software inc highly recommended mad games tycoon highly recommended software company mildly to highly recommended game dev studio recommended and even game dev tycoon most comparable to city game studio in my opinion do the same thing or do the same thing at a higher level for a lower price software inc is an absolutely insane bang for your buck feature at a whole five dollars less than city game studio comparing the two feels nuts

finally i bought the game after pirating it a half dozen times trying to experience it so id know whether or not i wanted it before you get upset with me i pirated my entire steam library before i bought any of it and put my money where i felt it was deserved this game has his own protection built into the game so you never really get to actually experience the game hence why i purchased the game anyway this is the biggest purchase letdown of my entire life the experience was just okay it wasnt great it wasnt horrible it was just okay  when i could find that great experience in half of the other titles sharing similar names

so in conclusion is this game worth the price no it really isnt  at least in my opinion is it a game you should have on your watchlist yes it probably is i dont know what other changes are going to be made but at 16 dollars per purchase this game has a long way to go until it reaches a value reflecting that price i think its value is probably around the 710 dollar range

#####

its fun for a bit but be warned once you understand the mechanics it falls flat on its ass

started my second game and as soon as i could made my second office shortly after my 3rd 
in about 5 years time i had 7 studios up and running which all made decent amounts of profit from that moment on i started snowballing so hard by the year 2000 i had bought out 50 of the competitors and made games that sold over 1 million copies 
i built the biggest office possible and just shoved it full with servers to have a server capacity of 350 million without even worrying about my bank account by the year 2022 there was no competitor left in the city since i bought em all i had 10 offices running with 330 employees hadnt made a game in over 2 years and still had 33g in my bank account this was on game dev difficulty though but for some reason felt very underwhelming and way too easy

i think for a game that tries to have so many features a playthrough should have more longevity

also dont make your own console sure you could make a profit from it but youll never get it over 5 market share so its a waste of time and money making games for it and the time wasted on making a console is time not spent on developing games that could sell for 400 more profit than a console will it looks cool to be able to make your own console but its absolutely a useless feature

all in all i still recommend it since the price tag is decent and i did have fun playing it

#####

a great game dev themed tycoon game

#####

too difficult for choose combination of making game

#####

hi overall really good i just have some suggestions for the next update
1 i think this is kinda minor but when you have an exclusive game for a console and it sells more copies then the actual console i think this is weird cause it makes no sense so could you make it where the max copies you can sell are the same as how many copies of the console sold

2 please add where you can make your own console it would add so much

these are just a few but i think they would improve your game mostly 2 but if you do see this your game is great i look forward to future updates thanks


#####

buy it

#####

after playing this game for several hours and leaving every session frustrated i cant recomend this game at this stage

i can never go past the normal game stage only big hits 80 are enough to keep me overboard financially but the game is very punishing for experiments trying new game types will always result in flops and failling a contract is an immediate game over

ive tried a number of different strategies grow slow or rapid expand lots of experiments vs playing it safe marketing and no marketing etc but the result is always more or less the same and the game doesnt teach me what i do wrong

#####

ui is very clunky and very confusing its a very good idea of course it is since its a rip off from game developer tycoon but poorly executed



#####

too easy low engagement game fully completed max console max store bought all competitors in 45 hours of game at mid level

#####

it gooooood

#####

games crashed almost every time i tried playing it 
which was not really long since you go easily bankrupt and lose the game very fast

edit game improved and seems stable now

#####

its not the kind of game i usually play but you get caught up in the gameplay and end up playing it for hours the interface is really nice and easy to use
the creator of the game is very accessible to answer questions fix bugs and add new features
dont hesitate whether its to relax for an hour or so or to create a video game empire this game is really great 

#####

tldr game good

there are several prominent negative reviews about micromanaging and thats not fair everything in this game is given a fair amount of detail and focus not many parts feel too minute and fiddly  but let it be said a fair things could use some quality of life improvements

i do have some critical thoughts about the game but let me say up front this is one of the better ones of these i have played though its a tad on the easy side played on difficulty 3 of 5 but i am a massive veteran of these games if such a thing existed lol things unlock gradually making money is satisfying its worth the price replayable enough and has some interesting unique features and before i continue i just want to say  this is one of the better game dev games on the market if you have an interest in that kind of thing  get it

look this games so good at its job that i feel like it would be entirely pointless to explain what it does right you already know if you are going to like this game based on how much you like economy management  and videogaming themes i would rather deliver to you some critique so that we can all collectively help ourselves out from what this genre is turning into

okay now onto a few gripes i have with this game and this genre as a whole

the big one
i have one concern about these kinds of games and it is thus  they are all exactly the same all of them the same as someone with some minor game development experience i reckon that if these games were all designed in a bubble they would be nothing like each other but we just dont live in that timeline  almost all of these games play the same with almost identical management aspects the way the development is split into 3 chunks the sliders the little pop bubbles that float up to fill a bar and the career progression smolstudiobeegconsolesetc this game is the essentially game dev tycoon 2021 edition it has some quality of life management features and framerate fixes in my case that gdc lacked it does have a lot more freedom and company control over something like game dev tycoon though  if you liked that game you will love this one because its way better but if you werent a fan well i can only wish you good luck 

the big two
i am so sick of replaying videogame history all of these games play out as a glorified love letter to videogame history on a macro timescale but very few take a zoomed in slowed down or more hypothetical approach to the gaming industry or even a made up one every every single one if you have even a passing knowledge of the industry you can play the beats  atari collapses commodore64 keeps chugging along before pc kills it nintendo takes over the market with the nes etc etc etc im so done with this can we just like set all of these from now on in an alternate timeline with a different structure put it this way  not many other tycoon games are about the history of the industry they take place in and are more focused on the economical management skills of the player to decide the rate of unlocks not lol wait til 1990 to get the beeeeeg screens that historical reverence is almost entirely unique to the game dev genre and the movies that one time it hurts the replayability  because actual history never changes and four review scores why is it four who decided on four nobody cares about 4 review scores thats wacky japanese shit that we all laugh at them for aaaaaaaa

ahem anyway now some really minor stuff

issues
needs a quality of life overhaul for your own game library  theres no sorting by things like review or score and it was difficult to find exactly where all that info lived at first when i make a sequel i just have to remember what titles did well
the legally distinctifying is kind of all over the place your got your bonys and your binbendos and your bicrobofts but the game names can just say stuff like jackie chan and scooby doo and luigi unrelated but one of the title randomisers words is black which can make some incredibly unfortunate random game titles
contracts are useful for learning about genres  but theres no way to automatically complete them taking them over and over is tedious
game doesnt pause when a project finishes so you might not realize for a few seconds or minutes if you have multiple projects going
things like job offers trending topics and other temporary stuff seemingly rotates very quickly that stuff doesnt go from 10 to 10 over the course of one month  especially since irl zombies became popular in the 80s then never went away lol

apart from that its good its very good its nice this is going to replace my want to ever go back to game dev tycoon  city game studio makes game dev tycoon entirely redundant

plus you can make your companys logo an anime ahegao face by loading in pictures and thats always gold star from me

#####

good

#####

compared to other games like game dev tycoon and mad games tycoon id say this is one of the best of its kind

you have multiple options for platforms you want to release on  youre not limited to 1 2 3 or any amount  the only limit is how complex you make your game so if you make a simple game you have the chance to release your game on every platform at the time

you can finally make games for a platform that isnt released so you can now be one of the launch title developers of a console now

instead of just buying out a console license you now have to negotiate to get a license no longer just paying a base sum and getting a platform you now have to consider if you want to spend more money for the license or sign an exclusivity contract

you can own multiple studios and teams meaning you wont just have one game in development at a time  you can have backup studios ready to create small games or even have them port existing ones

pros
negotiating platform licenses
multiple games in development
release multiple ports together
develop games for a platform announced but not released
multiple studios and buildings
able to publish games for other companies
competitors that you can buy out or sabotage
as far as i know no limit on how many employees you can have except for when youre all out of space
you can start your own online store and choose what platforms it supports
developer is actively listening to feedback and making sure to fix and improve anything they can

cons
early access so the game isnt in its finished state yet
no customisable consoles you can release
games needing updates seem to happen a bit too frequently
sometimes hard to find out why your game got an average or lower score despite having no problems in the development phase
no way to improve or downgrade a port so it can be better for a more powerful platform or dumbed down for a weaker one
ports seem to get lower scores for some reason this might be explained somewhere knowing my luck but i cant seem to understand why

might add a few things to this review later just wanted to leave this here because i really love this game

#####

meh

#####

cool

#####

taking over the entire gaming industry in less than 12 hours
will ruin gaming again

#####

yay

#####

the game did not provide enough useful feedback to make it enjoyable to build a strategy for making games  i did not get the gamplay

#####

opening this game for the first time is like opening fl studio for the first time

#####

youre a studio in the city making games

my game series is called virtual bacon eating in which you eat bacon and try to avoid stomach cancer

#####

can there be more companies to buy make it harder have the ability to build computerconsoles maybe more maps or spread out to different maps

games seems hard until you get 40ish games out and than its just easy to make money and take over other companies

can we also rent out our buildings

i cant recommend this game just yet maybe after a few big updates i do however like the games progress the game is pretty cool until you reach 20ish hours


i tried to play again and same bug is there since i first played the game does not load saved games just get rid of the load button its useless

#####

the game has no borderless windowed and is capped to 60 fps
exclusive fullscreen screws with hdr when alttabbingclosing the game and while the 60fps isnt a dealbreaker it does make the ui sluggish

i love the look of the game and if the above issues dont affect you then disregard this review unfortunately not being able to seamlessly alttab is a dealbreaker for me

#####

i love this game i keep coming back to it and get enjoyment out of it each time

#####

very enjoyable but needs more work

#####

love this game

worth every penny

people suggest software inc over this are the same ones who complain that game is overly complex for its own good

this game is more balanced and enjoyable in comparison

wanna view how good this game is visit my video of me playing it for 4 and half hours httpsyoutubec4h1xgcsbr4

#####

this is an amazing class in a new system of game management and development i really like the fact that it has beautiful visuals many different options and directions it is still supported and contains quite few bugs for an increasingly extensive release
i can say that this is better than game dev tycoon this game has a huge potencial
in the scale of 0 to 10 this game has 8 it contains everything a game in this genre should have and leaves the competition somwhere behind i know a few productions similar like city game studio for example makersgonnamake is reasonably cool but this game is an absolute frontrunner a million times better than game tycoon 2
what i love in city game studio
1 the graphic of characters rooms even the whole city
2 interface its clear and nice
3 new options and the discovering the new genres
4 rivalisation between the ai developers
5 a wide range of choices and changes that can be made
6 creating your own console

i hate
1 it is impossible to mix several main themes
2 you cant make your own hero in some game genres
3 you cant create a spinoff or a universe
2 not too many topics

#####

its not boring anymore i said this before and im sorry

#####

meh 210
i thought it would be better than game dev tycoon and it isnt only thing i like on this game is art style of consoles
sorry pal maybe in full release i change my mind

 edit still sucks 


#####

i think it would be cool if you guys added a online option where you like have a game studio with your steam friend or smt

#####

i like eating poop

#####

everything is just so blurry ive tried multiple times to get into it but the text everything blurry

#####

reminded me too much of game dev tycoon where there was a fixed value for strategy and x adventure and x felt like i already played the game before i got started

#####

probably the best currently available tycoon game about game dev lots of unique features like the city map owning multiple buildings having your own conventions

actual challenging gameplay with multiple difficulty levels and competitors

overall even in the current state its definitely worth it

#####

very love it but

#####

its a good base for a nice game dev game but it is too basic even for an early access game

just a joke id read the name of the game with lu kims south park city woks owner accent

edit i submitted the review form i will continue following the development of the game it has potential i just think it was too early to go on early access

#####

dora erotic simulation for young audience 93  100  expansion incoming

#####

unfortunately this is not a good game it seems developers tried to copypaste the whole concept from the other games mad games tycoon  game dev tycoon but failed to do so soulless

#####

so lost

#####

worst ui ever feels like an alpha version

when i click outside an opened dropdown i expect it to close

#####

h1another poorly done copy of game dev tycoonh1

at some point somebody will finally be able to take game dev tycoon and actually improve upon it without ruining a thousand other things this game isnt an improvement its the opposite

h1prosh1
list
 adds some improvements here and there so it isnt a completely pointless copycat if you can live with the rest of the cons go ahead and buy this

list



h1consh1
list
 bgarbage uib i find it ironic that a lot of these game dev games have some of the worst uiux experience in the market says a lot about the people developing them

do you like wasted space with tiny out of place text all over the screen do you like pointless use of icons that blend into the background dont pop or dont have a reason to exist other than the fact that developer found free icons online and had to use them

well how about ui elements that are displayed yet not clickable because you arent good enough for the sales button kid how about pointless  marks on icons like its a mystery of the lifetime what they could possibly be in a tycoon game

oh hey do you like holding down your left mouse button to clickconfirm buttons like youre playing with a fcking gamepad on a pc a tycoon game

well youre in luck

 b5 steps backb there are comprehensive overhaul mods of game dev tycoon that added so many improvements that developers eventually updated the game to add some of them to the core game this game feels like it learned nothing from the mods decided to add bits and pieces while retaining the barren wasteland vanilla release of game dev tycoon was

i especially like the fact that you cant pick a genre of the game you are making i guess it unlocks later on which is genius and trending box is always unchecked despite you checking it the last time you used to sort the pointlessly large tiles of themesgenres on display id rather go back and replay game dev tycoon than sit through this halfarsed edition

 bscorereviewsb forget the part where i couldnt figure out there the fck details on my game engine were sales data reports on who was using it and for which product you get to enjoy another tycoon game where reviews of your released games are randomly generated gibberish to the point you have to wonder why even add them who are they actually making happy has anyone actually bothered reading those random gen reviews that popup after the first two times

judging by positive reviews on these copycat games it doesnt take much to please a lot of players these days

 boriginalityb you know how since game dev tycoon how every other game has copied visuals down to the ui style thinking gdt did it the best hint it didnt 

yeah this game copies it down to the icons and its still as bad as gdt even worse with awful uiux thrown in

its like prison architect with garbage visuals it worked for that game then every developer out there decided to copy them until you started puking at the thought of enduring the same style over and over again in every other tycoon game out there do you need to have a new idea an improvement of any sort do you have a fun gameplay loop that improves upon the formula

judging by the positive reviews these games get im not sure you need to improve upon anything most of these copies of gdt receive praises for just existing people want to play more of the same over and over again
list



heres an idea to all those people making game development tycoon games

take a hint from your broken review systems in these games 

try something original for a change

god bless you

the ai gave up so uhh good game

#####

horrible game runs poorly on mac and lags also ui is very unfriendly and there are no guides

#####

i always get an average score between 2535 i hate this game

#####

this is a technically functional game and in the broad strokes it delivers a game dev tycoon experience

but beyond that this game is utterly baffling in how unpolished and underdeveloped its in practice

#####

froze multiple times within 5 minutes of starting this game

#####

i made dracula bit my penis off and it did amazing i would get this game

#####

i think it would have been a good game but the sharp graphics were eye soring like my eyes literary stated to hurt idk if the graphics were intentional but not good plus my character yawned in an awkward way plus it was uncomfortably loud maybe i could have lowered that setting but didnt think of it at that time i think that this game has a lot more content compared to game dev tycoon but it was way to awkward to play this game 410

#####

was trying to buy game dev tycoon

#####

unintuitive design with no fucking tutorial game is hot garbage

#####

bstop adding new steam achievementsb they are not updates
ruined my stats
ps i liked the game in general and would give it a positive review but adding new steam achivements after the game is in full release just pies me off

#####

special cheers to the devs i really appreciate their efforts toward the game which seems rare these days

#####

10 points modern game dev remake just about
pro tip for those who seek maximum success dont fucking buyout the competition bro they stain your name with these awful titles and tiny useless studios to make money pump out games and occasionally show the fanbase you care shoutout to the hacking feature saved me millions and depressed the opps amazing opportunity 

ps grantendo stop with those damn exclusive deals tryna lose me millions ya damn rats

#####

consistent and active developer support them

#####

gm gud game

great game if you love game dev tycoon youll love this

#####

great game cannot stop playing

#####

a far more polished expanded version of game dev tycoon the sequel it never had but we were granted
a great successor

#####

910

#####

the influences of game dev tycoon are clear so its a fair comparison

instead of a big length review though i can sum the whole thing up with this

h1game dev tycoon walked so city game studio could flyh1

#####

if you like game dev tycoon you probably like this game too very worth it



101100

#####

a lot like dev simulator but with much better management elements and mechanics a lot of fun especially if you enjoy micromanaging your business

#####

very nice game to scratch that game dev tycoon itch with a bit more complexity to keep it from feeling as stale

#####

if you enjoyed game dev tycoon then youll love this game its everything gdt could have been if it had just continued development it starts off as a developer type mechanic where you adjust sliders then once you have a few games under your belt you are introduced to studios and employees it then becomes more of a management mechanic but theres tons of fun awaiting you go ahead you know you want to

#####

as a mad game tycoon fan and a game dev tycoon fan city game studio is the absolute best mix between both games

#####

as far as the game dev genre goes this is easily one of the best on the surface it appears to be a simple yet enjoyable game but it goes much deeper than that

you begin in your home as a solo game developer in the 1970s and can ultimately end up as the ceo of a multi billion dollar gaming empire here is a short list of some the things you can do in this game 

 create and license your own game engine

 hirefiretrain staff both off the street and from your competitors companies

 create your own consoles both standard and handheld

 purchase andor build various studios on land within the city allowing you to build mega studios that have 50 employees working in each one auto furnishing mode is also an option here when building

 purchase stocks of your competitors or buy them out completely and take over their assets and employees

set up marketing campaigns for your games and consoles console campaigns can be set up to run for years without having to micromanage them

 port games that youve created to other consoles

 make exclusivity deals with other game developers so they only create games for your consoles for up to 4 years

 set up an online steam style store that you can improve through research

 update your games with either free or paid updates each giving you different bonuses

 allow you to expand your company way more than any other game in the genre that ive played in my current game ive got 15ish studios with over 50 employees in each one

in addition to all that is listed there are tons of qol additions in this game that you dont see in every other game dev game simple things like random game name generator sequels that automatically name themselves auto room furnishings etc

the cherry on top is that the developer is still involved with the community answering forum questions in a very timely manner

this game is a must have for anyone interested in the gave dev genre

#####

city game studio is great  and surprisingly addictive as hell for an oldschool econ sim game

i loved econsim games like this back in the day but i honestly didnt think id ever see them again modern econsim games went in a direction where you either got awkward minigames about making the product like the movies or that were halfstardew valley clones and no one seemed to want to make games like this anymore

im really impressed at how deep and yet easy to get into this game is and it brings out the justonemoreturn feeling more than most games if i start a new playthrough and i dont have anything on theres a fair chance im still going to be playing that playthrough hours and hours later  and i work a busy job and am not someone with endless amounts of time on my hands

i raved about city game studio to a friend who is about the last person alive out of anyone i know to be at all interested in an econsim game and their response was oh yeah ive heard that thats really good i feel like that sums up the unusuallywide appeal of this one

#####

yes

#####

mad games tycoon 2 meets game dev studio but with a macromanagement aspect that was missing amazing game dev to play it needs some tweaking but developers seem to be keen on updating this game and improving it so the future is looking bright 
i still think mad games tycoon 2 does a better job overall in the pure game dev aspect but on the other hand city game studio has much more to offer as a whole so it really depends on what youre looking for as a player

#####

game dev tycoon and since i love game dev tycoon i have to recommend it if you want a different experience from game dev tycoon play mad games tycoon 2

#####

it is like game dev tycoon but so much better

#####

very indepth get if you like mad games tycoon and game dev tycoon etc

#####

while the game has some interesting proposals and innovative ideas over the genre its mechanics have very little depth in my opinion 

while i had fun playing it from the progress sensation it lacked depth and felt basic

#####

score 89

after 596 hours on mad games tycoon 2 and over 100 on game dev studio i confidently can say that this is the most in depth game dev tycoon on the market just about everything from game ports to discounts can be performed my main takeaways and draw back is that the game has absolutely atrocious graphics and ux it has a learning curve to it but it works i look forward to maybe a sequel at some point that can merge this games depth with the user friendly controls and ux of mad games tycoon 2 and the same games graphics then it would be unstoppable devs please study other games and work to improve the ui in a future upate or release

#####

best tycoon game ever

#####

at first it seems like generic if you already played madgames and gamedevty but after it really becomes unique and very amazing especially if you add mods 
btw heres the mods i use 1cgs mega dlc2all compatible beahl 3gialus expansion pack 4garbanzo custom consol 5digital store feature6computers and keyboards 7more features


#####

a game made with love and passion so many features far above any game dev simulation game youve ever played on any platform i swear
this is simply 910
the good
rich in features you will be immersed

the bad
poor ui really needs to be reworked it will give you a headache

#####

a very fun distraction admittedly there are some flaws but theyre far and few in between and i at least enjoyed a majority of the game the gameplay loop is solid the music is ok albeit repetitive befitting of the environment i suppose the game is good looking and its got a very good concept and well worth the money the main problem i felt it suffer from was that you werent really pushed to branch out to other genres if you just stick with one thats how you become the most profitable you can be and trying new things is seldom rewarded since in the early game its not hard to go in the red constantly and in the late game you risk losing a chunk of your fans

still barring that and a few other tidbits i dont like eg not being able to easily get out of minigames not really knowing whats wrong with a gameholding it back its a good game id recommend on sale or at full price if you really like the genre

#####

has a serious bug that causes hr professionals to increase happiness of developers instead of decreasing it

#####

this game is really fun i saw it on the godot homepage and searched up videos for it on youtube i saw graystillplays playing it and i bought the game and instantly fell in love with it i would most definitely buy this game and play it

si te gustan los jueguitos donde no haces nada mas que apretar un par de botones cada 5 minutos y ver crecer numeritos te lo recomiendo divertido

#####

great game the developers keep working on this game and it just keeps getting better great job

this is a very in depth and fun game dev tycoon though defiantly not perfect 

my only exposure to these kinds of games is the other game dev simulation game dev tycoon and comparatively this one easily rises above the other just from pure depth the look is very simular which i dont mind but i believe this one has a much better performance with much more going on so great job on the optimization game dev tycoon looks slightly better in my opinion but im not really going in expecting bf1 type of graphics

i love that you dont have to make games in order to be successful and after multiple playthroughs you sort of find your own way to make money in my first successful playthrough i started off depending on donations for my opensource engine and loans until the success of my games took care of me there i was playing at an easier difficulty but in my ceo playthrough i managed to pull zero loans and somehow stayed profitable just by updating my engine and taking 20 royalty from other successful games  and by also investing in other game companies later in the game the weird thing about that run was the fact that i never made a profit on a game until the very end when i had an online market place which is incredibly op which leads me to the games flaws

i think there is a major balancing issue with the online market place and how fans work in general it doesnt make sense to sell thousands of copies on an ok game and only get like 30 fans out of the thousands of people that played the game i only had like 300 fans before i started working on the marketplace and then right after i unlocked everything that you can in the online shop i instantly got like 20g and 3 million fans after my aaa release and it was like an above average game to me that doesnt make much sense i can see 1g maybe but the jump made little sense to me once you get to the top financially it becomes very easy to scale by just investing in other game companies which i felt like there was a missed opportunity for potential challenges why dont companies have the potential to go out of buissness and its your job to do the research and sell when its nessary it wouldve made the late game a lot more intresting 

if there ever is a sequel to this game i just think fixing the late game with the marketing and investing mechanics along with improving the graphics and extending the game length to 2100 could make this a perfect game sim

#####

its a good game one of the two best game dev sims along with mad games tycoon 2

#####

rlly fun successor to game tycoon

#####

i am super impressed with this game  i have to say ive been playing it on and off for a while but it seems like every week there is a minor update a tweak or something that makes the game slightly better more enjoyable to play more intuitive or more compatible with older computers with steam deck or any other way people want to interact with the game  its the commitment to ongoing excellence that makes this game stand outespecially in an age where youll find so many games with awesome potential that have been abandoned before even being out of testing

a few words about the game itselfits a welcome addition to the game development genre  my only hope is that the game system development part gets more developed  everyone is coming up with improvements to the standard game studiobut id like to focus more on building gaming systems to run the games  but either way buy this game  even at normal price its a great value

#####

very enjoyable game id say i got my money worth thanks for making it

#####

great game love the new updates rolling in even though i thoroughly played the game many months ago im back again to enjoy it once more gg

#####

this is really a great game its like game dev tycoon but has waaaaay more to it running multiple studios being able to port games remake them or create goty editions is just wildly fun packing in as many desks as possible along with air hockey tables is a lot of fun and tbh isnt too far off from the truth of real game dev studios maximizing for cost whenever you can and trying to find the next big hit or at least contracting as fast as possible

#####

this game is everything i wanted game dev tycoon to be its absolutely incredible play on the hardest difficulty for the most fun 

#####

best game dev tycoon i play this game every 3 patch and every time i have seen new features and new details in design thank you binogure studio i must buy your new game 

#####

this game is good but this game keeps on crashing everytime its hits at the end of december it freezes even tho i have 4 mods onwhy does this happen
