after 8 years playing it i didnt improve my skills ingame

however i learned new language skills now i can curse in russian and brazilian portuguese

also my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased

now i can bear the crying of my children for longer and i can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures such as очи чёрные dark eyes or garota de ipanema the girl from ipanema

in conclusion counter strike transformed me into a better father and a better person in addition to making me more patient tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures

better than any psychiatric therapy 1010

in order to play this game you need to be the wolf you need to know how to howl in fact you need to be capable of howling at will unleash that warrior howl with your mind then eat raw meat learn to adore having your fur stroked and prey on the sheep because we thrive in a land where the strong prey on the weak and thats called natural selection thats what it means to be a wolf dont let the sheeps bleating prevent you from enacting your genetic will you must gnaw on them tear them strip by strip and show them that the úlfhéðnar do not take thralls

ive been a long time player of counterstrike i was known as stumpsy or stumps i was born with a disability no hands and i stumbled across csgo around 2013 i was obviously really bad when i first started and only played cs as a casual game with friends who were much better than me it wasnt until i started messing around with mousekeyboard settings that changed everything for me i discovered the setting raw mouse input onoff and for me not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers what this setting did literally changed the way i was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me if i flicked fast in a direction i was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad so say if i was turning right it would be a fast flick to right back to center fast flick to right again etc doing this i could basically do a full 360 within like 34 swipes if i had raw mouse input turned on that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves it really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of cs2 i was looking forward to playing the game with friends and ive tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me this game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason i stuck around playing csgo for so many years it sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years i hope the devs at valve see this and add the setting back into the game

i have included a video explaining how i play and why mouse raw is so important for me

and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay

i bboughtb csgo 10 years ago why has it been bireplacedib with cs2

ikea never came in my house while i was away to replace my black chair with a yellow armchair they thought was better

its not an update its a different product
put my purchase back in my library

#####

i dont always reload but when i do theres always an enemy in front of me

#####



#####

very nice game but there are to much cheaters and its almost impossible to improve ur trust factor

#####

too many hackers and toxic plebs

update we almost got 2024 and people still cheating in counter strike 2
imagine gaben isnt able to pay for an functional anti cheat system speechless

#####

after over 100 hours of playing csgo i didnt improve my skills ingame
however i learned new language skills now i can curse in russian polish german and finnish

also my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased
now i can bear the crying of my children for longer and i can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures such as к небесам и обратно k nebesam i obratno or garota de ipanema the girl from ipanema

#####

i would love this game if vac system improves

#####

however you feel about the update to cs2 csgo should not have been delisted also merging reviews of go into 2s is very dishonest if ea and ubisoft would get shit for it why shouldnt valve

#####

love  hate  csgo

#####

i like it so far

#####

it was okay for the first few 12 000 hours

#####

no wonder cs is 20 years old this game is so addictive i was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion this is one of the most accurate fps games ever made with 128 tick servers this game requires passion dedication hardwork skill  a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun rumours say csgo is going to shift on source 2 engine within 2 weeks really excited for it 

when you will play on low tier like silver  gold nova you may lose many games because of your teammates they may do basic mistakes like run  gun team flash etc but never rage on them always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners i know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm  make sure to teach the beginners our community is already toxic lets not make it more

you win or you learn you never lose

b cs will never die b

edit source 2 is still not out you can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like faceit esea 5e play etc

#####

releasing an unfinished game and removing the original good job

#####

this game is amazing
i got made fun of for being a jew
and im not even jewish

#####

1900 hours

1500 hours of crying and stress
350 hours of laughing and fooling around
49 hours of sweating and tryharding
1 hour of fun

i love csgo

#####

you sweat you rage you quit but you always come back to it

#####

h1bithe game where happiness diesi bh1

#####

very very good game u can learn all sorts of russian rude words

#####

first shot head shot and im dead

#####

valve did an activisionblizzard and force upgraded everyone playing csgo to play counter strike 2  so valve which is it a sequel or a major patch

on top of that they replaced the store page so all the millions of reviews and stats are now attributed to cs2 even though they were earned by csgo underhanded and disgusting behaviour

i expect better from vavle of all companies i cannot support this

#####

the time i spent playing this game couldve been spent
studying
applying for jobs
making friends irl
getting a gf
spending time with my family
working out
becoming a better man in general

from the time i spent in this game i got
an extremely racist and homophobic vocabulary
free russian lessons
anger management issues
borderline autistic tendencies
sleep deprivation

1010 would never uninstall this game and correct my life

ps please for the love of all that is holy practice in deathmatch and casual as well as perfect your crosshair and mouse sensitivity before you jump into competitive people will thank you for it

#####

thanks to csgo 

 i can speak russian
  i die 20 years earlier
  i am insulted every second round as a nazi
  every other round i am called a toxic german
  i invested 300  in a knife skin
  i have met people who can look through walls
  i have met people who can turn around quickly
  my neighbors hate me
  my table is broken
  i have a good reaction rate

#####

#####

joke review theres too many here is the truth

this is the game that

you love to hate
you cant sleep at night over
you throw things around the room
you scream at your monitor
you start yelling at people that come in your room and start asking questions
you get ridiculed just for playing a match
you are cheered on by your team
you get flashed by your teammate
you meet children
you meet adults
you meet adults that act like children
you learn the term tked the hard way
you are constantly called a kitty cat
you are told you are homosexual
you are told you are lesbian
you are told you will never be a pro despite never trying to be one
you are told you will never be a minor despite never trying to be one
you are told you will never win a lan despite never trying to enter one
you apparently live in your moms basement
you find out your mom has been having some strange relationships
you find out your dad has been having some strange relationships
you are recommended to drink bleach
you learn you are autistic
you try to ruin someones internetreal life
you watch people get bans for tking
you meet the most terrible people on the internet
you meet queued people that just look forward to kicking you before the win if solo queued
you are held to high degree by your team to clutch everything even 1v4s
you learned the term clutch or kick the hard way
you are told you suck even though you have way more killskdr than them
you are called a hacker for listening to footsteps
you are told the bomb is b when it is actually a
you pop out of an angle only to get one shotted
you hit sweet sweet flicks
you cant aim worth shit
you hear the classic excuse im not even trying bro
you turn racistculturist
you find the djs
you find the soundboard bros
you find the most strategic people you will ever meet in a game
you realize you are a rage quitter
you lash out to other people who lash out to you
you try to calm others down
you learn the term tilted
you meet people who watch youtube vids and think thats the only way the plan can go
you meet people who think the team should die for them so they can get the kills
you get screwed from people leaving your team
you find people that just like to afk grief and watch your team lose and probably laugh
you find people not skilled enough to play their ranks so they throw the match and derank down
you get in a match and someone needs to go afk for 515mins or leave
you play overpass
you realize playing overpass was a terrible choice
you get connection errors
you get screwed over by your ip and get a cooldown ban
you meet people who lag purposely
you win some
you lose some
you tie some
you rank up
you rank down
you ace
you dont get a kill for a long while
you become top fragger
you become bottom fragger
you go 160
you go 016
you learn the maps
you find out you didnt really learn said maps
you find people calling out to help the team
you find people with no mics to help out the team
you find people with mics that bought the cheapest mic possible

but yet in all the madness somehow it is ok

you get back on the next day and go through the same roll of shit again and you do it with a smile at least when you start

that my friends is a game that will carry on with you forever

#####

the best teammates of all games before i thought autism was something you were born with but after playing this game i realised that you could get it later on or atleast i believe that now

#####

like an abusive relationship hate it while youre in it but miss it when youre gone

#####

iq tests should be mandatory before being able to play matchmaking

#####

after 100 hours i knew the basics of the game and the guns available
after 200 hours i threw away the knowledge of all guns and sprayed the p90
after 300 hours i clicked on peoples heads with an sg
after 400 hours i was bad and abandoned ranked
after 500 hours i played wingman on lake
after 600 hours i partook in an additional mild quantity of the winged male upon the realm by the lake
after 700 hours i was silver 1 in wingman
after 800 hours i started playing on 130 ping to contain my sheer ability and flawless aim to give the rest of the community a chance
after 900 hours i have become a master of the arts in using a nova on 130 ping and the world trembles as i kill countless awptists with a swift burst of hot metal straight to the temple
maybe once i hit 1000 hours ill finally get out of silver

now i got out of silver and im running straight back hopefully ill get back there by 1500

 bvalve please add a better anti cheat 
even other games like valorant can do it
bwhy not game devs since 21 august 2012 

 bplease ulikeu  ushareu the ureviewu so uvalveu might useesu this 


#####

not toxic at all definitely recommend

#####

so after near 2k time play im  gonna say some words
first dont get disappointed so easily u will get better 
second dont get mad against  your  friends your friends are always better against you just because 
third dont get mad at all u will lose your focus afterward game
fourth u are good at your rank dont let  anyone ruin your fun just try to get better
fifth u will face some unhealthy players that make your blood boil 
sixth dont buy cheats just dont 
seventh u will meet player on the high rank that use cheat and pay for cheat monthly higher than ur salary 
after all i dont know just be  wise

#####

i started playing this game when i started to get depressed irl
i made a lot of friends and got to know that i was actually a likeable human being
people seemed to be happy and excited to play with me
i called them friends and they helped me simply by existing and being happy with me
i grew confident learnt i was actually a bit fun to talk with
this game made me discover myself and i forever will be thankful for that
the thing that makes this game what it is are the people youll meet a lot of them its upto you to choose who to keep playing with and who to forget and forgive
the people i met through this game are some of my lifelong friends and i am lucky to have those friends
i may not play this game everyday now but this game holds a dear and special place in my heart

at the final moments of this game i edit this to say thanks for everything you have done for me
it may be just a game for many but for me it was one of the way to escape from my reality to get to meet some of my life long friends and to get to know the world and myself more

thanks 
from the most bottom and sincere part of my heart
i will always miss and remember the time i have spent with a big smile

#####

great game bro love it but need to work on scammers and cheaters

#####

my friend who i play csgo with said if i post a review on cs and it gets 100 likes and 20 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here

#####

please fix the anticheat im tired of cheaters in all games

faceit can do it valorant can do it  well make it alot harder 

#####

this is the gaming equivalent of a toxic relationship that you can never get away from

#####

fun game overall though it may at times consume too much of your day time
you will come across many toxicsalty people just ignorereportmute them 
you will have days that you may play like a pro and feel good and your dopamine will skyrocket but you will be accused of cheating by your victims
you will have days that you cant even get a shot and you will be told to possibly cease to exist and delete this game possibly something about your close relatives but as i said in my second point ignoremutereport whatever you dont like

enjoy this game be less toxic obviously dont cheat what would be the point

best game ever since cs 16

#####

so what do we need to do to get good in this game

ustep 1u
accept you arent the best and make mistakes like everyone else

ustep 2u
setup your gear have a bgoodb microphon and use it

ustep 3u
warmup before competitive games doesnt matter if you kill 1000 bots on an aimmap or play deathmatch for about 20 minutes

ustep 4u
practice all necessary skills for the game
 aim  deathmatch aimmaps practicemaps recoilmaster etc
 movement  climbservers surfing prefiremaps shortcuts from yesber too
 gamesense  matchmaking retakeservers
 mapknowledge  callouts demos from your favourite proplayer
 nades  pls learn them
 roles  entry support lurk awper

uadditional stepsu
 train your habit first callout then flame
 play daily to to improve your aim
 make pauses every 23 games to reset go outside from the room with your pc
 stop at the point you get mad after a loss may


if you follow all these steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast

have a nice day and start fraggin 

ps last step get friends to play with and play for the win not for stats

original review posted nov 27 2016
extremely fun and addictive game that is if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played

actually requires a lot of patience aim control learning of map locations etc

edit dec 7 2018 stupid crazy full with hackers now that its f2p i feel like its gonna get taken over by even more hackers rip 2012 csgo

edit 20210903 some of you are morons here clearly a huge fan base of csgo ive gathered around 9000 hours in total in my other account as well no i wasnt a noob or had no skill i was ge for a very long time

this review is from 2018 after all the new updates came into place i loved the game it was my addiction after those updates everything went down hill more toxicity more blatant hackers and i for one wasnt a big fan of the newest updates so i decided to leave updated this review with my most recent experience
reviews are meant to talk about your experience not to kiss ass and make things look good when they arent

bring back csgo

i was very young when i first got to know counterstrike back in  the early days of counterstrike 15
it was in an internetcafé during holidays where i even got to play the game for the first time 

some years later some friends from the area were playing cs 16 and thats where i joined the steam and counterstrikecommunity on january 8th 2006 

we formed a team trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local csleague here in switzerland
however due to insufficient capacity private life  of some members and a lack of morale we split up

ive seen counterstrike in all of its states from 15 on 16 condition zero source i even had my hands on the old mod called cs promod where people tried to get the gameplay from 16 with the graphics of source which was something i really liked

after a long break i decided to reroll in csgo and check out how the game had evolved it took a while but the more i played and did matchmakings good mms  the more i wanted to set foot in esports again 

csgo is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 16 and the graphics of source while its not source definitely and luckily not to most efficient cs players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many pros do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol days from what ive read

though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learningcurve it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get 

since all those years ive tried out almost all other game titles in the fps genre nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of counterstrike for me 

if youre looking for a great teamexperience which you first need to create or join in where every man counts every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff this game is for you

however if youre looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 11 like in real life with bulletdrop and things like that this game is definitely not for you

i hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community 

best regards

everyone is racist

the competitive counterstrike scene is at its peak theres more talent than ever in pro cs which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear specific criteria to make this ranking a player must have competed in a number of top tier eventsno player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online almost by default that means the player will be on a top team as well which is the case for everyone on this list i also decided to use roughly the past six months results for statistical comparison with obviously more emphasis on recent performances as they are most likely more indicative of these players current form

i use the community servers as a dating website i have 5000 hours on this game and still a virgin

surf is pretty fun though   check out this game

#####

a very good fps one of the pioneers of fps in fact
cant go wrong with csgo

cmon give it a shot you know you want to


#####

possibly the most addictive frustrating and satisfying game ive ever played
you get a bad team youre in for an hour of misery get a good team and its an hour of pure bliss have a bad day an you hit everyone for 90 have a good day and your a ninja ghost warrior in the realms of the elite
i could have got another job for the amount of time ive spent on this game but every second was worth it

#####

game has been completely ruined and it has nothing to do with the bugs etc tbh it looks and plays great it is a decent successor to csgo once you iron out the kinks however the cheaters premier matchmaking faceit 

you decided to break all of it the entire game vac live is non existent people can kill you from spawn through walls whilst bhopping cheaters can do things they couldnt do in csgo fine at least we could play faceit on the 128 tick servers you once assured us we would get oh look nope you hardcode subtick even though 128 was proven to be working better oh well lets go play csgo oh no we cant do that either 

then there is the false bans i was one of them the one you caused with your own update it was promptly removed and i am grateful but no compensation not a word to the community just silence 

ok well lets set that all aside and move on oh we cant because then there is the exploits i have never in my life wondered if was safe to play a game 

you are forcing your player base to play an unpolished game against cheaters without any active client sided anticheat serverside plugins fog of war you dont punish people for boosting with cheaters or even cheating them selves you allow them to flex and brag publicly on your leader boards there are more cheaters than pros now

and this was supposed to be game that levels the playing field we would all get a fair chance to compete counter strike is for everyone counter strike is dying and you guys shot it 

i love counter strike it was the first game i played at my uncles internet cafe as a little kid i lost entire summers to this you guys as a dev team and company have lost respect for your player base and your own game you throw us in the bin and at the same time you flex an incoming major 

you might need to climb off your high horses play your own game with us talk to the community a little actually respond to feedback counter strike has one of the most dedicated communities and i am sure if you paid even a fraction of it back to us that investment would pay off ten fold for you guys

#####

what can you say about counterstrike global offensive its everything you could ever want from a firstperson shooter you can play it like a nolife gremlin but you can also boot it up and just frick around with the lads and dads without worrying too much about strategic play its also a very fun esport to watch if youre into that sort of thing my csgo phase is done but i will always have fond memories of rushing b sneeki beeki like ezpz lemon squeezy

#####

this game is really cool after those updates its more playable then before nice to see how the developers improve this game and want players to stay with them its really cool game i reached supreme and has more then 730 wins i meet alot of ppl and some of them are actually my friends i can say thanksfully this game i got another chance in life thanks

i be appreciate some award as points or smth luv

i probably wont have a popular opinion here but it is how i feel none the less

i played cs a lot when it was first released as a mod for halflife i put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers i stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product 

counterstrike as a franchise is something of a time capsule it is a example of a late 90s shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it and taken control of it in a lot of ways

because a esports style competitive scene has formed around counterstrike it puts valve in a difficult position because they cant really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta

it was not always like this when i was playing the idea of esports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultracompetitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta a lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available

playing counterstrike back then was not the commitment that it can be now the overall behavior of the playerbase was different you may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a esports match either at least not in any great number

playing counterstrike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pubstomped by uberexperienced and ultracompetitive players it is not a overly welcoming place for new players though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out and has a culture all of its own this culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell there is not much room for anything in between

if you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive and vocal players counterstrike is for you if you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual its not the best place to start

in the end this is just a opinion i understand that counterstrike is going to be a different experience for different people i know that i am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that i have played and own counterstrike global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something i can really get into your mileage of course may very

27 million reviews as of writing this lol

been playing counterstrike since 15 that came out in 2002 for some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia to keep it short yes i would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you havent already

to try and write something useful here is my advice to you new player if you want to improve

 its alright you suck csgo is a highly highly skill based game dont sweat it if youre not having fun sucking though you should probably quit there will be a lot of sucking and its ok to rage sometimes but if its constant no fun just move on

 get a good mouse specifically for firstperson shooters no that razer naga you play world of warcraft with wont do google rocket jump ninja mice for good recommendations from a 19 years quake player

 alongside the mouse really i mean really spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity it is worth it there are plenty of guides to google

 have a minimum of 60 fps otherwise youre really gimping yourself personally i wouldnt play without at least a steady 100

 no you dont need a 144hz monitor i reached global highest official rank perfectly fine without it it is nice though if you can afford it

 as with anything consistency and practice is key the other rarely mentioned but just as important thing though is take breaks if you feel burnt out just play something else its fine you will come back fresh and ready to improve

 if you won but didnt improve  you lost if you lost but you improved  you won have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves

 soloq is really as any other game if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you i personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me

 get a prime account reach lvl 21 asap and only play with it enabled when possible the increase in game quality is noticable

good luck



#####

you should do something with the cheaters

#####

you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker

#####

this game is really nice just need a new anti cheat software

#####

hi valve just wondering now that csgo is free to play is it possible that you could reward those that have originally purchased the game

for those idiots who cant read im not asking for no refund im simply saying maybe they should give us a free key or a nice skin as a reward

sorry comments are now disabled since all the toxic fucks in the comments and was getting bored of deleting comments

#####

iq tests should be mandatory before being able to play matchmaking

#####

i created this sentence review for the steam 2020 awards

#####

















#####

in your first game your teammates teach you to be racist and xenophobic but then people say that you dont learn anything from video games huh

#####

what was the point of releasing this a large amount of features and modes that were in csgo are just gone war games and most of its associated maps are removed all of the local tscts are missing even the ones they remade for dust2 and nuke a while back danger zone the mode they added before they went freetoplay is also just gone the loadout system is odd and a bit pointless  why would i ever use the ppbizon or sawedoff over any other smg or shotgun it just made these guns you would buy on a whim utterly useless since they now take a slot where an objectively better gun couldve been the m249 has now become even more redundant also any previously downloaded matches are gone so now you can no longer watch them isnt this game supposed to be a sequelupgrade to csgo why are there zero new mapsweapons im sure in time theyll add back some of the missing things i complained about since baggage is literally featured in a screenshot on the store page but for now its seriously lacking

4 months later  arms race is back with a whopping two strike new strike maps

#####

until i played cs i never knew people could have a 0 ms reaction time i also never knew global elites looking at  the ground could flick up and kill you every time

#####

removed working game with fun game modes and replaced with unfinished game
removed all my achievements the chickens dont follow you anymore and theres no more war games
its all just competitive bs and no fun

#####

csgo is a very competetive and fun game when youre not playing against hackers but while playing with friends you have a great time no matter what i highly recommend this game for competetive games and even the community servers such as surf and bhop maps

#####

the game is fun buuut you will prob go against 12 cheaters a day if you play alot the game is good but would be better if they had a working anticheat

#####

bawesome game aside from loads of cheaters personally started playing in 2014 and regularly playing since has decent graphics for an fps shooting game and can be played on lowend pcs as well this is one of the games first games that got me into gaming and i wanna say it gave me a lot of experience csgo is not an ordinary game to perfect it you gotta have extraordinary hearing and be able to concentrate i recommend giving it a go and im sure youll be satisfiedb

such a fun game especially when team is communicating properly andor being friendly  can recommend

#####

this russian language learning game is quite impressive already after a few games i had a rather vast comprehension of the language and its underlying culture 

a few russian fellas said my grasp was fluent 

protip da da davai davai rush b cyka blyat
one of the most frequent phrases used by russian csgo pros translated rush b dont stop  until a molotov comes and then all should stop in the tunnel for a pleasant barbeque experience

#####

very good game but there are many cheaters

got called racial slurs
constantly sworn at

ive been playing counterstrike since around 2000 when it was 16 beta  it was a natural progression for me from hl deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also  ive been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours i wouldnt even want to know playing it but ive had a ton of fun with it too 

its funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that without cs i question if there would even be a steam service  its funny how things happen  

nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why im spending the time writing a review of this type especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more xp funny   

cs and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and im forever grateful for that but i have to say that the current state of affairs with the game steam and valve are a little sad  theres no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made valve and steam what it is today and thats very disappointing for me  valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from  the development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the blackberry i was going to say dodo but thought bberry was just the same and applicable  why has there not been greater advancement of the source platform to take better advantage of todays gaming pc horsepower and reinvigourate a community thats becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction as well as current playability variety and lack of transparancy  if valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole thenwhy not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for  think about it and get back to me why dont you and ill be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants  sarcasm

my review wont be complete without touching on the current steam vs opskins and the whole trading saga in general why wont valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc that requires government official photo id age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc  theres so much potential there the market history proves that so why not consider offering more than one type of service  its a little shortsighted from valsteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments or maybe you are or maybe youre just dealing with so much legal backlog from the loot box gambling situation  who knows  certainly nobody in the community why  no communication  is it because you dont think youre client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you dont consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to  a closing comment on this particular aspect of the reviewvalvesteamplease remember that every year that client base grows so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build so be prepared and be willing to change or you too will go the same way as the blackberry dodo 

anyway cs is a great game and ill always play it and just like every place in this world both real and virtual you will find the majority of people are good and dont cheat but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully like everywhere else theyre the minority

cheers
chris

ps update  my hours are incorrect my pc is never off for other reasons and cs is running in the background idling just like my av  save your time if you were going to post a comment about my hours pleeaaasee

good fried chicken recipe

in a large mixing bowl whisk together buttermilk hot sauce optional for added flavor salt and pepper in a mixing bowl add in chicken pieces cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours
when ready to cook pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 34 inch deep heat to 350 degrees
prepare the breading by combining the flour cornstarch onion powder garlic powder oregano basil white pepper cayenne pepper paprika and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish mix it thoroughly
working one at a time remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture shake it gently to remove the excess place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly tap off the excess
place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time the chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible fry each piece for 14 minutes turning each piece about half way through until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees f
remove from the oil and place on paper towels let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving

#####

the game is good but the anticheats isnt

#####

after some hours of cs go i have discovered that learning russian and turkish or such languages can be done within no time in this game also a lot cheaper than paying for classes
can recommend this language simulator even though it can be quite explicit at times 
do not worry about hackers in this game there are less hackers than players who should not be allowed to use a microphone

would definitely learn a new language again

death in counterstrike global offensive is an invaluable instructor as a longstanding tradition in the series failure serves as the ultimate lesson revealing the paths not taken the mistakes made and the opportunities for improvement it stands as the most captivating exasperating and gratifying game ive ever experienced dedicated counterstrike players invest substantial time in acquiring knowledge resulting in continuous personal growth in global offensive progression holds immense significance particularly for newcomers or those returning after a hiatus this unyieldingly intense skilldriven firstperson shooter compels players to adopt a distinctive mindset unlike that of contemporary shooters if you hail from the call of duty realm adapting your gameplay style becomes imperative for success in counterstrike furthermore counterstrike endeavors to evolve by implementing slight changes while remaining faithful to its core strengths by revamping familiar maps and introducing fresh official modes global offensive revitalizes the gameplay offering veterans new challenges and encouraging novel play stylesa remarkable feat after nearly 15 years of the franchises existence

#####

i hate this game so much but sadly i am an addict
teammates are usually either really good or really bad no inbetween
always toxic rarely nice
winning games doesnt even spark joy however losing causes extreme anger
cases are a scam obviously you spend more money than you receive
if you want free russian turkish or swedish lessons i recommend

this game is very great and fun 

#####

playing counterstrike global offensive is like playing a game of chess except instead of pawns and bishops you have ak47s and grenades and instead of a calm calculated opponent you have a bunch of 13yearold kids screaming into their mics but despite all that this game can be a lot of fun theres nothing quite like the thrill of defusing a bomb with 0001 seconds left on the clock or the satisfaction of getting a headshot on someone whos been trashtalking you all game and lets not forget the joy of accidentally shooting your own teammate in the back and getting kicked from the game all in all if youre looking for a game that will make you question your own sanity while also providing hours of entertainment then counterstrike global offensive is the game for you just make sure to stock up on advil and earplugs before you start playing

#####

this game is good if there no cheater

#####

good game but very very very toxic community 

#####

this game brings memories those endless nights i didnt go to bed those days i played all day this game was in the past this game is a memory going away in the wind the times you look back and sadly turn your head you are growing up now time to move on time to go get a job time to make something of your life time to be an adult i know no one will read this but that is ok is it really about someone reading it or the words i am typing away the 26 letters forming words words forming sentences sentences forming language language forming ideas and thought ideas and thought forming adulthood bye csgo i hope i visit until then its been a good one

if you hate yourself play this game

it doesnt matter how good you are any more you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory

you should have one of your several karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware youre being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own

your stats are irrelevant now most people arent even aware that the tab key actually has a function in game it doesnt matter if you dont know what eco means fuck team work you have a boom awp in your inventory as long as you have 4750 cash in game youre buying an awp

you will mock anyone who decided to give their nova the walnut skin same goes for people who give their famas the doomkitty skin you will only equip stattrak weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on afk players in order to pad the stats so you dont look like a total n00b

whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire an exceedingly rare special item disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise wouldve by buying this directly from the market its only your parents money after all besides your birthday is next month and christmaseasterinsert public holiday here is just around the corner so you wont have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods

you will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon your easy peasy and ninjas in pyjamas stickers totally dont look ridiculous whatsoever you will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in you dont own an ak or an m4 any more you only own weapons with names like xxx og snoop dogg and dubstep warrior

you now have all the knowledge required to start playing csgo go forth and procure many skins of great value

funny fact  2 out of the 4 people who commented here have gotten vac bannedboth seemingly agreeing with meafter about 1k hours of playing after posting this review ive come to conclusion that the cheating would never stop unless the players stop using cheatsand honestly i dont see that happening
so good luck fighting cheaters

counter strike global offensive

bcounterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play itb 

everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play csgo 

1 pfft im never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys thats stupid
2 im never going to get that angry its only a game 
3 meh doesnt look that hard

strikewithin a month strike
within a week  

1 youve already have bought a p90 module skin because oh its only 30p and you begin your slow downward spiral into the csgo marketplace saving up for a knife and opening crates in hopes of getting a knife which deep on the inside deep deep down you know youre never going to get and end up spending 10 opening crates and getting back 50p worth of skins back 
 2 youve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives its a game that can turn any lovely human being into a bsoul eating behemothb within minutes of a match starting  get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity 
3 youll already gave uninstalled the game at uleastu twice in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game ubut you cantu youll always go back

the community is butterly merciless and beastlyb with over half the people being angry 12 year old russians the betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins and the trading is completely unreliable leaving you to deal with steam support which is 10x more brutal than the game itself 

but of course youll go back its csgo its a drug a soul destroying mind numbing murder spree inducing drug

review edit down below

players we want more optimization for the game and a better vac
csgo you mean you want a battle royale
players no w
csgo and you want the game to be free right
players thats a bad ide
csgo we also brought the jump glitch back
players why the fuc
csgo primes also been given to anyone who has ever owned csgo
players are you guys fucking morons
csgo you can also buy your way into prime

valve you are actually fucking retarded what the fuck
heres literally the simplest way we can tell you how to fix this
 fix vac
 fix prime
 fix bugs
 dont put a br into a competitive fps game
 and dont fucking make the game free to play and then give everyone a coin for being retarded and actually buying this game

there was zero communication between csgo and the players you legit just asked if we were free wednesday and now i wish i was busy so i never would of have to play this

edit a more structured critical review

i decided to try the game again to give a better review rather than just lashing out at what i saw earlier and in a completely honest way im still unhappy but not as unhappy as i was prior i still love this game if it is not evident by the number of hours that i have on my account but still i have some critiques on this

the battle royale
when i heard the idea of a battle royale in cs i was against it theyve never quite been my thing and the popularity of games like fortnite completely destroyed any hope that i had for battle royales in games however csgos battle royale does have some pros with some cons at the same time do take into account that i am biased against battle royales
pros
 its a fresh new take on the battle royale genre
 thing like escorting hostages add a great addition to the game mode as a way to get money whilst still being involved with anything around you
 the idea of choosing and seeing where others drop is a nice feature

cons take into account i am biased against battle royales
 it doesnt fit well into a cs game yes i understand that i dont have to play it but it does my head in that its advertised on the main screen
 ammo is actually harder to find than real life aliens the fact that you pick ammo up 1 by 1 doesnt make this any easier
 drones break if there is a ledge near where you are standing i bought some ammo and the drone was confused if an inanimate wall was actually me
 the amount of actual shake you receive when getting hit is akin to an earthquake given i had some fun with my friends going around and bashing people to the point where its like the negev in warmup
 finally its a battle royale you didnt have to follow this trend cs even if it was planned a while ago

free to play
this is one of the more concerning things that i had with the update cs is already filled with cheaters and can sometimes make the game so irritating that ive put it down for a couple weeks as 3kliksphilip said its probably the game with the most cheaters does csgo updates not entertain you but now i have some confidence in their decision for making it free to play it allows more people to experience cs and will most likely double the population which isnt a downside the thought that valve has made the game free to play shows that they have confidence in vac and that vac will learn a lot more things due to the games new state

prime
this issue is one of the main reasons that this review is staying as not recommended the idea that you can pay into prime and that people who have already bought the game will now have instant prime this kind of makes me think that prime will be reduced to a standard trust factor match which cheaters are somewhat abundant but if valve is confident enough in their vac this shouldnt be a problem however the amount of cheaters who have probably been grinding enough to get prime on multiple accounts is worrying

valve in general
my issue with prime has nothing on this valve dont really know much about their audience we believe that we are entitled due to the amount of shit they have given us in the past years aug week r8s introduction solved quickly nerfing weapon speeds this affected pros but they can manage now #hikomissed my problem isnt really with this its with valves transparency they never tell us what theyre going to do and expect us to all love their new idea like its chef boyardees canned pasta no one has really ever asked for battle royale in cs we ask for improvements which are normally disregarded

in short im upset with this update but not as upset as i once was i still have faith in valve although it is withering at a fast pace

response to comments
papanotedvevo agreed that it makes the player base bigger dislike the concept of battle royale in cs
justsqueeze cause why cant i as long as i have skins and fun with my friends then who cares
count chocula h1z1s peak player base was 150179 its now 24hour peak is averaging the 3000 range this isnt good for a game it puts people off from the original concept
thehemmo yeah i agree with you now my man
wafflejpeg i wont play it im not being forced to its a bad addition to a competitive game and i wont play it anymore regarding optimization im glad you can run this on your 12 year old labtop as you said and yeah i was probably wrong about the optimization thing some of my friends with lowerend pcs still cannot run it 
randyco prime isnt mean to be something you can pay for prime is meant to be for people who have played the long enough and deserve a place where they can play without cheaters cool vacnet is enabled i forgot that gets rid of every cheater ever did you

i just miss source man the games only full priced because valve cant afford to make gmod assets free if sourcestyle movement was back in the game i wouldnt care what happens

#####

if you want to learn russian for free just play counter strike and in about 100 hours you can learn fluent russian

#####

its a fine game
i just want something meaningful instead of a badge for spending 15
give us unique skins a refund noticeably increased drops for skins something that is actually meaningful

#####

n1

#####

its like roulette fun until it turns into russian

#####

rip social life

#####

i have always been a supporter of this game such depth and reward when learning 
and improving at this game during my 10 years of play the same goes for previous renditions of this game

however i have to give this game my first ever bad review
i believe csgo has entered the worst state it has ever been in
this is due to the cheating in this game the entire community is nervous
90 of games turns into salty game of people blaming everyone of cheating
sportsmanship is fading play one good game you get reported and end up in low trust factor
the developers give no clear information on how this works and what to do to remedy it
updates of this game is slow and not focused on improving the game state
last contributing factor is the increasing amount of cheating in pro level games
as a whole it feels that my immediate contacts more or less feels the same and the fun
factor of the game is just disappearing

i am slowly starting to lose my respect for this game and might end
up leaving cs for good
i sincerely hope this gets fixed soon as i would like to see this world of
cs that has given me so many hours of fun and endless gr8 memories to grow
and keep growing

sincerely yours
an old timer  csgo

chicken shawarma

ingredients for four people
chicken fillet 400 g
parsley 50 g
pickled cucumber 6
potatoes optional 2
pita bread 4 or as needed
olive oil 3 tbsp
onion 1
parmesan cheese 100 g
salt 2 tbsp
turmeric 1 tsp
ground black pepper 2 tsp
garlic powder 2 tsp

ingredients for tahini sauce
thick yogurt 4 tbsp
mayonnaise 1 tbsp
tahini 1 tbsp
fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
garlic 1
salt 1 tsp or to taste
ground black pepper ½ tsp or to taste

wash the chicken fillet take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips add them to a mixing bowl

mix up the salt turmeric black pepper and garlic powder add them along with the olive oil to the chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets

cut the onion into slices and add them to the chicken mix everything together

cover the chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour chilling the mixture will marinate the chicken and infuse it with flavor

while the chicken is marinating prepare the tahini sauce for this purpose pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise tahini lemon juice salt and black pepper into a suitable bowl

finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl then mix until the sauce is uniform note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge

now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil once the oil is hot enough add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color

meanwhile you can fry the potatoes slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness

put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden

wash the parsley and drain the excess water now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely

place the pita bread on your tray take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread

pile a layer of the chicken fillets fried potatoes chopped pickles parsley and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it you can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like

at this stage preheat the sandwich maker then roast the shawarmas in the machine in the absence of a sandwich maker place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly

once the shawarmas are roasted and the bread is crispy cut them in half and put them in your desired dish you do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates and you can serve them with salad or plain

enjoy your meal

well it looks as though counterstrike global offensive is coming to an end soon it makes me sad to think about this game has had a big impact on my life ive been playing since the game came out countless memories this here video game has to be one of the most refined games i have ever played using of the heart of quake csgo has proven to be the best fps to date csgo accomplishes so much this game lets gun play become art its almost as if every spray you preform is a unique signature or tag the guns are consistent and balanced in an refreshing way beyond gun play there is the movement bunny hopping surfing airstrafing longjumping all of these incredible feature with an almost infinite skill ceiling zoom out again you have excellent maps developer and community made each map featuring a unique history and lore if we take another step back from the basic game play csgo has skins and oh baby do i like skins the style and progression of concept throughout the years a flourishing economy of trade interesting stickers and personal ones that hold the value of a team or moment in time all of these beautiful ideas and feature of csgo are blended into this master craft of a video game i mean im barely scratching the surface of depth there is to this iconic online shooter but i will end this mindless rant with one last appreciation the developers have stuck with the soul of the community from the start of this game they have listened and acted with and for the players valve has always understood what it means to host a game of this nature and they should be acknowledged for it so from one of those players genuinely thank you valve

#####

only cheaters and trolls

#####

you want buy this game  
im gonna show you somes tips for playing 
 before the match starts dont press accept its a test 
 the p in p90 stands for pro like you 
 when told to pick up the awp stare at it and go afk 
 dont buy kits this is actually team death match the bomb wont ever get planted 
 you are amazing with the desert eagle dont let anyone ever tell you different not even the scoreboard 
 very important that thing attached to some guns is called a silencer and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills 
 vac is a good anti cheat 
 skins make you better at the game 
 when a teammate asks for a drop drop them your handgun 
 never adapt to the game dont betray yourself like that just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works 
 dust 2 is the only map in the game there arent any others dont argue 
 if you lose the first round you must always ecosave which means buy armour and an smgshotgun of your choosing 
 when going through doors always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass   ignore the hate of your teammates youre pro and youre gonna get mad kills youre also shielding them from bullets how nice of you 
 crouching doesnt improve accuracy but do you know what does jumping be a ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in  everyone loves kangaroos 
50 points to gryffindor every time you change weapons 
 state that all smgs take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away your gun is cheaper so it is worse rub it in with a teabag afterwards especially if you have a p90 
 always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warmup ends at half time treat them like they murdered your family be sure to take note of their nationality 
 if you see a chicken in your gameplay you absolutely must under any circumstance kill that damn chicken it must die this is non negotiable 
 recoil control is a myth like bigfoot
 if you need to get around the map in a hurry get out your negev 
 the ppbizon is the discount negev 
 dont waste money on a helmet 350 is too expensive you wont die ever 
 you need to look at the ground where you are going make sure you dont trip 
what the  is strategy

updated review 05052018 look below 

ok i think is time for me to write a honest review for this game

counterstrike global offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games ive ever played
but i still love it

why well let me tell ya

ive had some many feelings while playing this game that ive never had before like desperation with anger rage  happiness sadness adrenaline etc

this game became a part of my life ive met most of my best friends in this game one of the most important relationships i had was built in this game ive met every kind of person the one that rages every second the leader bottom frag the canadian the mexican the australian the adult with kids the kid the furry very nice people the most annoying people ive ever met in my whole life the smurf the carry the bad team the great team the grill and the list goes on

valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players and they make changes to the very keys of the game like the rank system a whole map the gun recoil the sounds of every gun the whole sound system of the game prices of some ingame items and the community usually gets mad at it at first but we get used to it anyways

what do i mean with unfair and broken
well in matchmaking prime or nonprime youre gonna find a smurf a hacker a whole queue of griefers derankers etc
valve tries to stop this but i personally feel theyre giving up which is really annoying

another example for broken will be the rank system is so weird and unfair for some players when youre nova ii sometimes the other team could be nova master or silver elite or a weird mix of those ranks it took me around 160hrs to get out of silver after the rank system update even if i had good perfomance no rank up for a loooong time

if youre thinking about buying this game you should totally start with a friend is more fun in general but if youre a very first time player joining a competitive game i cant promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils without knowing that you gotta start somewhere but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game you should stick with them and play together more often but dont think youll always play with them trust what im telling you most of these people meet others and move on but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that youre incredebly lucky 

now datsuke all those things doesnt sound very appealing

well maybe in paper they dont but after experiencing a good game after experiencing clean headshots long range noscopes carrying a team a grenade kill seeing a hacker getting vac banned midgame clutching the round getting a kill through the smoke being called a hacker for your skill laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more besides you meet very different people you listen a new accent every day you learn a new word or a internet term every day you learn something new in general other thing i love about this game is that learning theres always something new to learn in every map every gun a new position a new boost spot a new flash a new smoke a new prefire spot i have 1400hrs right now of play time and i think i dont even know the half of the smokes in mirage 

so yea this game is really good most of the time youre gonna see yourself ragging every now and then but personally i think is worth it


datsuke 1292017



update

okay its been more than a year from my original review
have i changed my thoughts sort of

the game havent recieved much love from valve and prime matchmaking is still in beta
about prime matchmaking for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible and to my knowledge you cannot make it prime as default correct me if im wrong

the community is pretty much the same nothing has changed on that note

now i have more complains on matchmaking
i used to think that the game itself is broken i really did i thought that the hitboxes were messed up which i have a video example of that that i recorded myself here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvg0jifwjd2be watch it if you wish but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers how do i know this well i been wanting to take the game a little more serious so i signed up for esea which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the esea servers are 128 tick which is a world of a difference everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff and i believe esea has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 6080ms on esea servers is around 2035ms on esea the ranking isnt as broken as matchmaking and the community on esea takes the game pretty seriously and dont mess around which i really like that however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay so theres also faceit which provides the same service as esea but for free however faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play

so the game is pretty much the same not many fixes or changes going on but i wanted to update this review since these thirdparty services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more at least it worked for me

cool

i love siege but you get to a point youre sick of all the gimmicks 

cs is a straight up shooter where one moment youre sad the next moment you feel like a god walking the earth

lets get back to our roots  stop the ults stop the god like perks forget all the different classes lets kill the old fashion way

i slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch which tells me it is 546 am damn
another night of insomnia  

i sit up in my bed and listen to the soft hum of my radeon hd 7870 ghz edition as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates the only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard and the azure leds in my razer abyssus

i press a button and the display of a 23 inch 1080p ips monitor lights up colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind 

my desktop stares back at me the only icon the recycle bin i move my eyes to the taskbar where the icons for windows explorer star citizen mozilla firefox and lastly steam return my gaze

i click on steam and watch as a loading bar appears the light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face and if i look closely into it i can see myself reflected in the crystal surface eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia

steam finally loads oh whats this theres a sale on ah too bad i only have one cent in my wallet i click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning

my list of games appears showing me hints of open doors into new worlds strange and wonderful what path sould i choose should i join battle with dragons in the strage land of the nords or perhaps i should launch the starcitizen hangar module and lust after a dream of flight a game not yet finished

ah but here it is counterstrike global offensive how many hours have i thus spent within you oh csgo you have been the reason for many nights without sleep many days of ragequits many days of fun and sadness i pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk dividing one thousand eight hundred and eightyfive hours by twentyfour tells me that ive been within this game for seventyeight point five days so far damn

the game begins loading and i hear the soft hum of gpu fans and the silent sound of the sunrise far beyond the single window of my room

_


ah where was i i guess i feel alseep for a second there skip the intros enter main menu searc wait what 20 friends online but its like 6 am oh right timezones eh i might as well invite all these people

well i guess i didnt want to play with them anyway green light fills my room i press accept and wait for the ninth player who it seems never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means oh well it just found another match anyway

well third times the chram right i guess not fourth time does it and were away cue loading screen begin meaningless text ive seen only a few thousand times before

i get up walk towards the kitchen and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways the bleak windows of the room greet me pale dawn gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes the neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 607 i search the pantry and refrgerator but find nothing of value

i lower my standards and try again this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind i begin a pilgrimage to whence i came

the last stars of night grow cold and die as color once again spreads over the sky monitor glow winter snow cybernetic flow

my quest now complete with prize in hand i return to my chair 0s and 1s stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data all for my enjoyment i begin the first round and purchase a fn fiveseven and a flashbang grenade

i move over to long a and hold my sights on the old wooden doors an insurgent sprints through the open door firing his glock18 as fast as he can his bullets hitting the wal beside my head

i pull the trigger a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head the fn 5728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 joules of energy the neon stattrak display mounted on the left side of my case hardened fiveseven increases by one and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag the words not on my watch silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol in an absurd pun about clocks

another terrorist moves into view i fire three supersonic rounds into his chest and one in his skull again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed

a third terrorist fires and i die in the gameworld madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song and my teammates finish what i began with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen

second round man time to roll i got long  wait why are two of you going there nevermind ill hold catwalk

_


turns out they decided to rush mid with pistols poor choice  i leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgents back he screams in death as i drop the nowuseless tazer and unholster a bizon smg  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his cz75 automatic punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath i mutter to myself i fucking hate that gun while typing out #tazed bitch in all chat

childish insults fly like eagles soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see get rekt u suck time to die amirite

using the mighty power of a pistol save round the enemy gains a round

from far beyond my drywall cube a sun the color of a helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of autumn into a sky the color of krypton but here i am safe from its incandescent fingers here the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor perhaps tomorrow will be different oh but i dont think it will

the scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma chaos lies within its eyes

final round of the first half begins and i press f1 to auto buy supplanting my xm1014 from the previous round with an m4a4 bullet rain tastefully decorated with a rekt holographic sticker and renamed clockwork assfucking i once again reflect on what a stupid name that is and regret selling my desert eagle blaze to buy it

surprisingly my team manages to hold a push at long in the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision and in the downtime i skim through my ebook library on my phone ive been considering writing something in the style of neuromancer or ready player one for awhile now perhaps if i can find the right subject oh well thats a project for another day translation never

halftime and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us ive seen worse ive seen better too but what the hell this isnt hopeless yet

pistol round begins and i buy dualies partly just to fuck with people and partly because for reasons that i can neither explain nor defend im ridiculously good with them dont dis my dualie skills man just accept it like a wizard and his wand you do not choose the dualies the dualies choose you

i pop smoke mid and rush catwalk suddenly realizing i hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall

i slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch which tells me it is 634 am damn
another night of insomnia

they removed moaning

#####

just bought the prime status to write how much i hate this game

#####

yelling at friends was never so enjoyable

#####

in this game you are a terrorist or elite counterterrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts you must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies strangely each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in 

when your character wears a kevlar vest every part of your character except the head are made out of steel therefore the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head this can be annoying at first but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a characters body 

the goddess of guns can materialize guns in your characters hands a few seconds before a round starts however your character must pay for the guns which have vastly overinflated prices when you have the right amount of money the goddess will flash a menu in your characters eyes allowing them to select the guns they want more advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money

maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places vandalism is a very serious crime in the counterstrike series so elite counterterrorists are deployed to stop them unfortunately for the terrorists they are dumb and only packed one bomb however the counterterrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb so the terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend

in some maps the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and lowlevel desk jockey in a building the counterterrorists have been deployed to save one not both of the hostages in reality this is just a thinlyveiled excuse for the cts to murder the terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages one weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a hostage rescue kit which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your characters shoulders 

overall counterstrike global offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on earth even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with parkinsons disease you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic its worth picking up

i miss csgo

#####

see blatant cheaters not getting banned for an entire year
their profile riddled with rep complaints and links to vods where they clearly cheat
get constantly matched up against said cheating fuckers despite all my friends spending hours on overwatch and literally grinding for good trust factor
win 8 times in a row no rankup
get 3 matches against blatant spinbots aimlockers or wallhackers again downloaded vods show it or against an unfortunate player who has 7000 hours and skill to compete against globals but got downranked cause fuck everyone downrank twice
vac literally doesnt exist its placebo
every single hackusation on overwatch that i review ends with finding a spinbot
every single one none of the reports actually get banned

i am so sad that our beloved game csgo died for cs2 this game is so bad

 anti cheat is terrible people are getting false bans for high sensitivityamd drivers  while real cheaters are not getting banned vac  valve allow cheats
 no new content for months even old content has been removed upon this
 no new operation which is crazy since there has been leaks about seasonal operations
 no new case even though there has been many leaks of new skins and new submissions in the workshop
 all of the achievements are gone that we had in csgo and now we are left with one useless achievement xd
 danger zone which got released when csgo whent free to play is gone
 the original deathmatch mode where it was team vs team is gone
 the sub tick is embarrassing how bad it is all we have been asking for is 128tick and this is what we got
 you cant switch leftright hand anymore
 there is no commands for changing weapon bobbing anymore
 no arms race best gamemode in my opinion
 no flying scoutsman really fun gamemode that they should have released the game its really fun for us casual players
 watching demos are really bad
 no overwatch system and that leaves us with the bad reporting system where everybody who gets x amount of griefing reports gets banned
 performance issues even pros who bought pcs with the best components have issues with performance so imagine how it would be for someone who doesnt have all this money
 peekers advantage is just crazy in this game

the thing that is crazy about all of this is that valve made almost 1 billion dollar in cases last year where is the money going to valve use your money for the right thing i beg you make cs2 the best game as we all deserve it dont abuse the fact that you have a very loyal playerbase


#####

game is nice but full of hackers even on prime

#####

digital knives actually cost more than real knives

1010 goodjob valve

#####

what inspired you to play counter strike global offensive
money

#####

gives you mental issues
