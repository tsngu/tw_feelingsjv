this is the original nes zelda with some modern soulsesque touches and a cute fox

youll probably get lost  you probably wont know what to do  the manual and the signposts are speaking gibberish and everything has to be a some obscure secret that everyone else seems to know already but youre just barely figuring out  youll eventually memorize every enemy strategy but the bosses will continue to demand a lot of your skill

but thats all still nessnesera adventure gaming  not everything is given to you and a lot is held in reserve tantalizingly just out of reach  resist the temptation to read strikenintendo powerstrike walkthroughs unless youre really stuck and enjoy  

this games very worth the price of entry

#####

should have won best indie over the cat game

#####

first impression is great very polished game looking forward to play further
runs perfectly on the steam deck

update game finished in 30 hours but there are still many secrets to find
first impression was right everything is on point in tunic controls visuals soundtrack the whole game is a big mystery but solving secrets is very awarding ill give it a 9510 must buy for adventure fans

#####

is the game good yes its fantastic but it is definitely not for everyone and i can more than understand why

whats a good way to explain this well this game is more like a game for people who have played a lot of other video games before that might sound confusing so let me try to break that down a bit 

the whole game from traversing the map to reading the instructions is a puzzle now this is a really cool concept and i personally love it but with no tutorial and absolutely no direction other than a hieroglyphic like instruction manual most players will have to rely entirely on their gaming intuition andor google to figure it out what is going on

you could honestly argue this is more of a git gud issue and i cant really say anything but that that is valid it brings to mind titles like terraria where youre kind of just thrown into the water and you either sink or swim and slowly learn as you go with a trial and error approach and that is one of the most successful games of all time on steam but this style can make the game very dislikeable for newer more casual gamers and children and ironically it seems the art and animation is styled more for that type of audience as well

overall i think this game is fantastic the art style the music the combat the collecting the soulslike and rpglike elements the puzzles and the intuition this game requires would put this on the list as one of my favorites of all time you kind of just have to i be a gamer i for lack of a better less cringe phrase

tunic is spoiler a phenomenal puzzle game with some pretty good combat attached the soundtrack visuals and presentation contain staggering amounts of care precision and polish even if there werent any depth it would still be spoiler an absolute spoiler ly wonderful little fluffy cake of a game to dig into and enjoy the art is soft and cute but somehow completely sufficient for portraying the spectrum of objects creatures and landscapes youll encounter neon colors mixing with grey and green ruins and much much more its snappy to control and runs very well on a wide variety of machines including on protondeck

so what makes this game special tunics collectible manual  a halfmap halfinfodump that you cant understand most of  reminds me of when i read japanese promotional websites for mega man battle network 6 as a kid and had to intuit what the pictures meant about new features and content give your full attention to tunic try to solve it ireally tryi and youll be staring agape at the screen more often than not shouting with spoiler joy spoiler and bewilderment play with a couch copilot if you can sometimes another perspective really helps spoiler to spoiler clear the roadblocks this game throws at you in the same way that i told myself i wasnt going to look guides up for outer wilds and failed i banned myself from looking ianythingi up for this game for months after its release and my spoiler experience spoiler was better for it

combat is definitely satisfying spoiler  spoiler though still second to the secret sleuthing that propels the game forward i never felt really frustrated and when i was it turned out i had missed a key element of how combat worked that i needed to master which is a good sign i did spoiler just spoiler miss an item that trivialized some of the fights though evident when i finally got stuck and needed to find it to get a leg up

make sure youve got a good sound system or pair of headphones and spoiler dont be afraid to spoiler crank up the volume youll hear this game in your head for weeks after youre done the game does a very neat effect where itll dampen but not pause the soundtrack while you look at the manual and spoiler write things down spoiler its tracks quietly underscoring most of your critical thinking and then when you return to the game world the song comes back in full swing and supports the solution you just found its an incredible feeling

tunics real game is in scarcity of information and controlling what information is fed to you when resulting in a masterful icantbelievethisthingwasherethewholetime revelation every time it happens this means the game is an excellent crucible for speedrunners as a last added bonus spoiler

9910

this is truly one of the most incredible and special games that i have ever played  at the most surface level its a sort of fusion of the best of the 2d zelda games with a soulslike combat systemphilosophy  that is you go around and explore find new weapons and tools unlock new areas with them and then fight things with brutal and extremely punishing battle mechanics demanding splitsecond timing of dodge rolls and blocks

of course that is only the surface if you dig down a little deeper you start to find the kind of ridiculously unraveling puzzles that games like the witness are known for  suddenly you start looking at things you have been seeing all along your adventure but with new eyes which recognize hidden meanings secrets and all new ways to progress in the game in mechanics you didnt even know existed just before the discoveries  then you find even more secrets even more new systems and methods of play and things really begin to unravel and rebuild in your mind in entirely new ways

and with all of that said i have focused so much on the mechanics that i havent even begun to describe the aesthetics  the visuals are absolutely nothing short of one of the most stunning uses of stylized minimalist 3d that i have ever seen  at times its so heavily stylized that you begin to lose track of it being 3d at all and it begins to look more like a carefully handcrafted 2d world of the type that was seen in the heyday of early ipad type of games where things almost look painted and placed only for your sense of the 3d world to come racing back when you dart around a corner and the cameraperspective does a relatively rare shift

the audio is similarly stunning and the ambient smooth music reminds me of the best of games like fez where each area has its own theme and the music itself becomes part of the presence of each zone as you wander through it  from melancholy soft melodies in abandoned ruins of cathedrals to relatively zen synth and almost chip tuney notes as you make your way through forests and gardens

tying everything together is the ingame manual which has the perfect look and feel of the absolute best manuals of the 8 and 16 bit eras subtly showing you mechanics and information in a mysterious language you cant hope to comprehend but with bright bubbly visuals and the pencilpen notes of some unknown previous player to help guide you along  you only gradually find and assemble the pages for this treasure and each one is a revelation that can open up entire new game mechanics you always had access to but simply did not know about  the single most enjoyable treasure among so many in this game that you get to experience is the glimmer of yet one more new manual page on the screen which you can then greedily jump into and pore over zooming in and out to unearth all the information secrets guidance etc that it can have for you

oh and the entire game is absolutely riddled with foxes among which your character is absolutely the cutest most inspirational and wonderful example and you cannot help but fall in love with their plucky little cando attitude wonderfully emoted through every little movement and animation as they dart around and run through grass fields cliffs water etc  no matter how brutally hard the game gets you cant help but dive back in to help this little fox get just a little further in their quest to something something

in short yeah this game is honestly right up there in the hierarchy of some of the best indie games that have ever been created among the company of fez the witness braid etc  its an absolute treasure and whatever your personal gaming proclivities you are doing yourself a disservice if this does not make its way in to your library and your headspace

#####

never before have i had such an obsession over a game 

tunic is a zeldalike that wastes no time sending you right into an unexplained world learning to navigate it requires picking up pieces of the games manual ingame and using your wits to figure it out every small broadening of understanding feels like a triumph

please play this game if it sounds at least remotely interesting

#####

tunic is both rare and meticulous

beautiful art design and a justhardenough level of difficult combat combine well as tunic alights the imagination with a highly specific and unique reverence one that speaks explicitly to the history of video games as a medium what it was once like to play them in a time lost to the ages and what it was like to experience discovering a new one lightly used 

once upon a time people would rent video games from local retail stores what came with any particular game who could say sometimes they would include instruction books with passwords left in the notes section a mega man save image map hand drawn

these traces were the remnants of a run through the game left unfinished lost to its original player and time now in your hands for the first time tunic is a game that simulates such a feeling compelling in its player a simple truth slowly you are not the first but here is what someone else has learned

#####

masterpiece in game design no doubt about it

to summarize its like an old legend of zelda game except theres a fox the game plays in an isometric perspective you run around smacking things with your weapons and theres pages of a manual that you can collect and look at ingame

now heres the interesting bit  most of the manual and game dialogue is in an indecipherable language and the game will drip feed you just enough information to let you piece things together and repeatedly give you those eureka moments the game will hide mounds of information right under your nose and when you feel like youve seen it all even after a dozen hours or so ingame you will still be surprised again and again i feels like i cant exactly describe this as a puzzle game id describe it more like that one game i played when i was little and even though i had no idea what i was doing i kept playing out of this sense of wideeyed wonder at all the wonderful new things i was seeing in front of me

#####

go in as blind as you possibly can the game is a mix of a few genres and games most notably zelda puzzle and dungeon design dark souls souls like elements  combat and outer wilds progression is somewhat based on knowledge you gain throughout the game if you liked any of those games you will probably like this one also it has a cute fox so i mean come on easy 1010

do yourself a favor  go in as blind as possible  dont look at any guides  the system of getting pages of the manual that you cant fully understand is a stroke of genius

also i havent found a waterfall that doesnt have a secret behind it

edit finished the game

ill admit for many of the later postgame puzzles i looked at a guide for  the in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly and if youre not familiar with english you probably shouldnt even bother  

the surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items but because of how the manual is handled youll never know how until you see the pages or experiment a lot

i think the most amount of tries ive spent on a boss fight was 78 but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts

#####

tunic is an excellent zeldalike that is unfortunately very much let down by its combat the developer gimps our combat abilities in an attempt to mimic soulslike combat but gives us bosses and enemies with high mobility fast attack cooldown and large hitboxes that often ask for much more than what our arsenal can do our dodge is costly our melee attacks are too high commitment and short ranged and our movement speed is so slow that often i dont feel like im fighting against the boss instead i feel like im fighting against the controls to exacerbate all this our lock on is extremely finicky and just unable to keep up with certain encounters if you want soulslike combat design soulslike enemies dont insist on soulslike combat and give us hyper light drifterdeaths door bosses this game would have been more elevated by a more appropriate combat system that matched the pace of the fights the dev intended once can still make a difficult game without forcing soulslike controls stacking up against the aforementioned zeldalikes tunic really falls short in its combat department

with that out of the way however the rest of the game is superb the exploration as has already been commented upon is out of this world and demonstrates the devs masterful grasp of world and level design finding secrets and intuiting hints has been nothing short of a joy i didnt need to use a guide through the game and at time of writing im up to the final boss as far as world design and indirect breadcrumbing goes tunic delivers the best experience on the market and i say this while still riding that elden ring high tunic is a tightly designed and joyful adventure to explore kudos to the dev to have the balls to hide a secret path within a secret path and then sometimes have that be the critical path few games trust their players enough to do that

overall i do recommend tunic but i dont recommend it with as much fervor as i wish i could if its combat was better it would easily sit head and shoulders above its contemporaries unfortunately i walk away finding the combat weighing down my experience greatly if you like combat youll enjoy deaths door more but tunic just has the better levels and world design either way play both

#####

if you liked outer wilds you would like this game

your curiosity will be tickled you will want to find the secrets and you will find yourself doing things you maybe didnt expect to find yourself doing this game will stick with me for a long time

ioriginally published on gamepurcomi

one of the first games i ever owned was the legend of zelda links awakening on the original game boy it looks laughably dated now  it did come out in 1993 to be fair  but its got a special spot in my heart to this day i still get that rush of nostalgic exhilaration when i think about the exploration and mystery baked into that game and the hours i poured into my game boy pocket over the christmas of 1996

tunic from developer andrew shouldice and publishers finji wears its influences plainly on its sleeve its easy to see the inspiration its taken from the zelda series particularly links awakening the main character an adorable little fox wears a green tunic and wields a sword in one hand a blueandredpatterned shield in the other you even start off by waking up on a beach and must piece together the mystery of the island on which youre stranded as you progress through the game the art style too is reminiscent of nintendos remake of links awakening from a few years ago with its simple but lovinglycrafted visuals

this is no mere copy of a more established game series though tunic has an astonishing amount of depth to it and the elements it borrows from other games whether aesthetic narrative or mechanical all serve the games own unique identity

at first glance tunic is a fairly straightforward adventure game you wake up on a beach find a weapon bash some monsters and just have a good old explore theres a lot of zelda dna in there but theres also a significant amount of dark souls as well perhaps its considered gauche to compare things to dark souls these days but the parallels are undeniable from the dramatic and toughasnails bosses to the shrines scattered about the map that serve as checkpoints and even to the initial objective of ringing two massive bells its clear that fromsoft was not far from the developers mind

combat will be familiar to anyone whos played an isometric soulslike enemies telegraph their attacks with just enough of a window to let you react accordingly once you learn the tells you have to manage your health stamina and later on magic bars accordingly you can roll at the cost of a bit of stamina and the invincibility frames granted during that animation will be key to surviving encounters the bosses are absolutely brutal but with patience and a little bit of luck youll be able to feel that intoxicating sense of satisfaction in taking them down there are a couple of little qualityoflife and accessibility options available too  if your twitch reflexes arent what they used to be you can turn on invincibility or infinite stamina and just enjoy the story or hunt for secrets

that brings me to the other major way that this unassuming little adventure cribs from dark soul its approach to story and secrets where other games may hold your hand and guide you gently through your quest tunic leaves clues for you to piece together crumb by crumb most often this takes the form in a delightfully meta twist of pages of a retro instruction manual for the game itself with gorgeous handdrawn art  also evocative of the promotional material for early zelda games and the like  and intriguing things scribbled in the margins for the eagleeyed these collectibles are a joy to behold scattered all across the game they will introduce players to basic concepts and bits of lore as well as providing a jumpingoff point for the myriad secrets waiting to be discovered

the obtuse way that tunic handles even basic game concepts may well be a sticking point for some players i enjoyed figuring it all out immensely but when information like how to level up stats and what certain consumable items do is hidden away inside collectible manual pages theres certainly a risk of alienating some players it should be added too that the manual features only a bare smattering of english or your chosen language across pages upon pages of an invented and impenetrable language  potentially a point of confusion or frustration for some

still the important stuff is fairly easy to parse and the charming illustrations and pleasingly soothing music help to take the edge off if youre starting to feel confused the publishers have also made it clear that they endorse and encourage a bit of good oldfashioned community discussion when it comes to deciphering the games lore and secrets in the press discord server the team set up for the purpose of sharing strategies and the like it almost felt like we were back in the schoolyard swapping urban legends outlandish theories and secret codes except this time they actually yielded results which was a wondrous feeling

in the end despite the debt that it owes to series like the legend of zelda and dark souls the game that kept springing to mind as i worked my way through tunics late and postgame was lucas popes return of the obra dinn tunic obviously features a lot more action and hackandslashing than obra dinn but the sheer depth of the puzzles and secrets tickles that same bit of the brain everything you need to know is right there in front of you hiding in the folds of the environment and the manuals marginalia  you just need to figure out how to piece it together as enjoyable as the combat and the main story were it was the puzzles that i couldnt stop thinking about and the feeling of solving each one was practically euphoric

tunics cutesy aesthetic and tips of the hat to other games serve almost as a jumpingoff point a familiarfeeling touchstone to draw players in beyond that the experience is entirely its own with satisfying and challenging combat secrets that gradually unfurl and a quiet and contemplative story with its own twists and revelations its a beautiful and polished little game that asks a lot of its players at times but it has every confidence that they will rise to the occasion as the games creators put it keep your wits about you and be brave little fox

#####

there is a fox and he cannot read completely illiterate

highly recommended

#####

i wish steam had a third option to say i didnt enjoy it overall but understand some people will love this game to death

heres the basic question spoiler do you like soulslike games and puzzle games yes then chances are good that you will love this game

because really tunic is two games a soulslike and then a puzzle game in that order sequentially as in once you beat the soulslike then you play a puzzle game

see there are two endings to get the first you play a soulslike fight and explore through a series of challenging dungeons and bosses culminating in a tough final boss i loved this first game in particular its absolutely jampacked with hidden shortcuts and treasures the surprisesperhour rate on this first game is very high and i was constantly delighted

and after 11 hours of joy i beat the final boss and got the bad ending 

enter the second game a series of puzzles you solve to get the good ending is it a bad series of puzzles no but its not really what i signed up for the skills i built over the prior 11 hours were made completely irrelevant by this puzzle game 

the puzzle game took me about 5 hours after looking up two specific things i am dumb so had i tried it blind i absolutely never would have gotten the good ending 

the choice to lock the good ending behind a second totally different game is an interesting one artistically i respect the hell out of it but i didnt really enjoy playing through it spoiler

all that said if this sounds like your cup of tea then i heavily encourage you to try tunic out

#####

tunic is genuinely one of if not the best games i have ever played its like andrew shouldice asked me personally what i would like to play and then created it for me games that provide as little guidance as possible and really let the player feel everything out are my favorite and tunic trumps every other game in that genre that i have played there are frustrating moments but you only get frustrated because you want to keep unraveling the mystery of the world and something is stopping you from doing that the moments of triumph or discovery in tunic really outweigh any other experience in gaming that i have had tunic is the bar that developers are going to be desperate to hit going forward

#####

the closest ive gotten to an outer wilds experience since outer wilds

#####

this game is an experience that is several layers deep but sadly i spoiled some of those layers for myself because it was a little too difficult for me if youre going to play it please be patient with it and dont make the same mistake i did

as time passes it will be either one of the shiniest hidden gems in steams entire catalog or widely praised for years to come

either way future games should take inspiration from the instruction manual gimmick that is absolutely fucking genius

#####

this game is best experienced with as little prior knowledge possible so its hard to write a review for so ill just spoiler everything and hopefully convince you to buy it before you get to the end and if you already played it listen to me talk about why its one of the best games

u  zeldalike u imo if any game ever got the feeling spoiler links awakening spoiler was going for its this one id argue it even does it better not only do you spoiler wake up on a strange island with no bearings spoiler to add to this feeling spoiler you cant even read most of the text within the game the only thing you can even do a lot of the time is wander aimlessly with nothing more than the feeling that youre probably doing what youre supposed to spoiler as you progress spoiler things become more and more surreal spoiler spoiler you find pages of an nes style instruction booklet of the games mechanics that you have to slowly try to understand because when i said you couldnt read most of the text that includes this and as you piece together the mechanics of the game the mechanics of the world and its artificiality become clearer it adds an unsettling feeling to an otherwise inviting world spoiler spoiler so youre stuck in this world where youre constantly unsure and looking for answers and secrets while never really knowing why youre doing it in the first place while playing i would often think what would i do here if this was a zelda game and when what i thought of worked it felt like i was being rewarded for having a shared interest with the developers spoiler


u  puzzles u the game has great puzzles if youve enjoyed spoiler the witness spoiler then youll probably like tunic like spoiler the witness the game doesnt tell you much upfront but there is a lot to discoverspoiler spoiler the more you play you begin to realize how many puzzles have been staring directly at you the whole time you just didnt realize it until you get on the same brainwavelength as the gamespoiler spoiler even a lot of the games mechanics are left to you to figure out with just a few hints scattered around i watched a friend play the game and discover things i never knew about and solve problems in completely different ways it i feels i like youre only given the bare minimum information but theres actually clues everywhere it just depends on how you think that determines which ones you see spoiler and by the end spoiler you realize just how much power youve had since the beginning of the game what looked like a linear path was actually a completely open world spoiler

u  it is what it is u the game can be very challenging if you want it to be im told the games combat is similar to a small indie game called spoiler dark souls spoiler never played it myself but i hear people like it that said its also completely optional you can play spoiler without upgrade for an extra challenge spoiler modify the combat in the accessibility settings or turn it off if you turn on no fail mode you can just sit back and solve the puzzles that being said

u  it is what it is u spoiler if you want to just play the game like an open world where you can fight enemies until you reach the boss to fight then you can kind of just do that too i guess spoiler i have no idea why you would i want i to do that spoiler but youre the type of person that really wants to play puzzle games but wishes they didnt have any of those puzzles then you can turn off pretty much every puzzle in the accessibility settings as well turning off all puzzles i and i combat is also an option if you want to experience the game without actually having to play it spoiler is there a right way to play tunic i dont think so spoiler is there a wrong way it really seems like the developers dont think so spoiler

u  the b style b u i generally believe that in almost any case a hand drawn 2d version could look better then any 3d modeled version tunic is not one of these cases everything from the models to the animations to how they interact with you as the player was crafted perfectly graphics expire but art direction is timeless theres so much charm in the way the tall grass bounces as you run through it or as the bushes bounce away when you cut them all the way down to the smallest detail it all builds to an extremely pleasing aesthetic spoiler but the cute is always just offset enough to build an atmospheric feeling that something isnt right and it rides that line perfectly between inviting and somber fantastical and futuristic epic and silly but the game never tells you what it is so anything it surprises you with something out of left field it cant be wrong everything you thought it was was your own projection of what you thought the game was spoiler spoiler even the way the camera moves adds to the specific charm of the game something about being able to pan around a corner to reveal whats behind it feels jarring due to its isometric nature and style of top down adventure games spoiler spoiler being able to go behind so much of the foreground where you cant even see yourself anymore adds to it feeling artificial spoiler spoiler and when the camera pans to reveal a shortcut that circles back to where you started it almost feels like the developers are acknowledging you and messing with you at the same time spoiler its great spoiler the game kind of cycles between being a fun adventure hinting at a darker theme and then reminding you not to take it too seriously spoiler

spoiler and as you come to understand the game as a metanarrative you start to see the game for what it is its really just a game an epic adventure with unfathomable technology a cute story in an unsettling world with an incomprehensible history and just a game spoiler a game between you and the developers who put so much time effort a part of their lives into it spoiler its a conversation with no words a game in a language you cant read a review mostly hidden by spoiler text the only way you have to communicate is vague and unlikely to be seen and im really happy i saw it spoiler

the definition of show dont tell

what does it take for a game to be truly great obviously no game is perfect but there are games that are so well designed and crafted that they leave a lasting impression and are fondly remembered long after completion these are games that are admired they are used to judge other games that come in their wake this is the standard that i used in deciding whether a game is great or not 

tunic with no exaggeration is a great game from the lovely and expansive world you can explore to the tense and exciting battles you fight this is a game that thrilled me and kept me entertained throughout there is an incredible sense of wonder and excitement upon finding new dungeons or obtaining new equipment with numerous and varied regions to explore it really and truly is an adventure in the purest sense 

on the surface tunic is an adventure game that is reminiscent of old 8 and 16 bit games your little fox character washes ashore and must explore the world to find items for survival and clues to make sense of the story you fight creatures large and small with some pretty intense and remarkable boss fights along the way 

but this is only the surface tunic is actually a puzzle game in a design decision of true brilliance the game is littered with puzzles and mysteries that you must figure out to aid you there is a beautifully illustrated instruction manual the pages of the manual are scattered around the world and discovering each page brings you closer and closer to unraveling the mysteries of tunic as you accumulate pages youre given more insight into tunics story and more importantly clues on how the game works and ways to interact with the world figuring out things that were previously unknown until a page in the manual is available gave me such a sense of accomplishment i literally exclaimed oh so many times while figuring out different things with the aid of the manual 

i wouldnt want to spoil anything and you shouldnt spoil anything by reading a guide or wiki to get through this game but just know that all the answers are in the manual literally all the answers are there right in front of you 

the game does have flaws the graphics are not cutting edge and can be rough at times also once you beaten the game although a ng opens up figuring out the puzzles does sap the replay value and there is little incentive to continue playing also some puzzles are just too esoteric for what i imagine would be most people i admit that i had to seek outside help for some puzzles that i lost patience on the fact that the solution to those puzzles was something i could have figured out made me feel guilty and sad that i deprived myself the fun getting the solution myself 

after my experiences with this game it will forever be used as a benchmark to judge other games in the genre

spoiler free review 
i should preface this review by saying i absolutely adore this game it took me by surprise about how deep and complex the game got as time went on

tunic is an asymmetrical top down 3d game reminiscent of legend of zelda and the beautiful articulate 3d movement of fez and a cutesy art style which will quickly capture you in the first few minutes 

tunic throws you into an unknown world with foreign language without a hint of tutorial or dialogue youll abruptly find you have to fend for yourself and find how the inner mechanics of this game works by collecting random pages thrown about the world called the instruction manual its such a clever idea to present the rules of the world by giving you a collectible resource hidden throughout the world the manual is written in the language of tunic with a couple of words on each page in english having to understand the context of the game with just a few words definitely puts an extra spice on the immersiveness of the lore i immediately found myself invested in who i am as a protagonist of this world and how do i fit in this island

the controls are very tight i rarely found myself frustrated by the game controls once i understood what im doing and especially since the game doesnt explain to you everything in the beginning youll find yourself randomly doing some techniques you have no knowledge of as an example i found a parry mechanic early on in the game that wasnt explained until later after i found the page for it which felt extremely rewarding for me since i took initiative in understanding the game mechanics early on and i got rewarded with a technique that was present since the start of the game its just cool little neat facts like that in this game that made me fell in love with it

the world feels very much unique and each area of the game had that feeling of excitement when exploring it i genuinely like the 3d design of this game and how objects whether it was mountains or walls can have stuff behind them if youre meticulous about exploring the game doesnt shy away from teaching that from the beginning youll see multiple chests hidden away in a corner or off a ledge that might be unreachable to you if think about it in a 2d way but what if there was a path behind that rock or what if the water near this wall was shallow enough to walk on or maybe if you break the pots near the wall there will be an accessible hole behind it this is basically the thought process your brain will be having throughout exploring which is basically the cherry on top for me

boss fights in this game are incredible not a single boss fight was disappointing for me every boss felt unique and i had incredible fun fighting each one i was conditioned through multiple games to have to lower my standards against the bosses especially in indie games and oh my lord my expectations were blown out of the water i wish there was a boss rush cause i definitely wouldnt mind fighting some of the bosses multiple times

there are lots of items you can use in the world of tunic ranging from magical items that consume mana to consumables that you can use to heal yourself or damage the enemies or even to distract them for a quick escape or sneaky kill which of i made a whole use of them i finished the game with barely any items left in my inventory not to say they were overpowered but it was fun to use them and this game has a neat little mechanic that actually rewards you for using the items and treats the well known too good to use syndrome we as gamers have in almost every video game

i could write a whole essay about this game and how innovative it was for me to experience i would be definitely recommending this game to all of my friends

unfortunately you are illiterate

dont believe the specs  it runs on win 7


if youre looking for that classic topdown zelda experience you might find it here this game feels like someones take on zelda especially link to the past but theres some key differences here  the combat relies heavily on rollingdodging mechanics clear inspiration from dark souls the way the world is constructed feels more like a metroidvania with stuff locked behind such things as getting x or y item  doesnt really go into dungeon diving like a zelda game

is the game confused about what it wants to be no of course not its neatly put together but its clear a mashup of inspirations

what i do find great is the usage of glyph language to obfuscate a lot of things more games should be like this the pricing is on point as well so for me  its a yes

#####

hyper light link to the breath of the fez souls awakening

#####

amazing simply amazing i feel the same way toward this game as i feel toward outer wilds

#####

man i love this game  on first glance it appears to be an isometric zelda clone where you play as fox link and it is but its so much more  the game is just so smartly designed

you start off on the beach with no items no direction no story no nothing  its up to you to find out where to go what to do how to win and how deep you want to delve into the world  it completely respects the intelligence of the player and spoon feeds you very very little

the game most resembles zelda 1 of all things  you know the one you couldnt beat without reading the instruction manual  well this game also has an instruction manual that you collect the pages of in game  it  details the maps of areas how to play the controls the steps you need to take to complete the main game and all the secrets

except for one thing  the game isnt in english  its in tunicese  if youve ever had to play an unlocalized game from japan like if say some mediocre publisher never localized it and you had to use some bootleg rom coughsuperrobotwars then you know that maybe 10 of the text and interface would be in english and with enough intuition and trial and error you could figure out how to play the game

i was not expecting this game to so accurately reflect such an experience but it does gloriously  by putting together snippets of readable text along with the pictures and things you notice in game you can figure out almost everything  the game relies on it because while you also have your standard zelda items that unlock ability to traverse the map in ways you couldnt before hook shot etc many times you had the ability inside you all along  you just didnt know it yet  shortcuts that you could have always used were hidden just out of sight and youll be startled you never noticed they were there

so when you finally figure out how to perform some new skill it completely recontextualizes a lot of the things youve seen in the game so far  knowledge is just as powerful as some new magic item  it reminds me a lot of the outer wilds and its just so well done in this game

you figure out the secrets you unravel the story you earn every breakthrough  or you could look it up online but really that ruins the fun  theres a few optional puzzles that are sketchy logicwise that i had to check solutions for but the vast majority of things can be figured out just by paying attention and keen observation  its so enjoyable  this game is a gem

this game is good
resist all urges to google anything or ask other people anything just play it and try to figure it out trust me here

spoiler free review

in short tunic is an indie masterpiece

the content and gameplay loop stays fresh and respects the players time while presenting one of the most welcoming challenging and rewarding game worlds ive been in for years 

capturing an aesthetic that is just enough of an homage to be present while clearly forging its own identity tunic is a joy to play its art direction is charming unique and consistent throughout though the variety of setting is rich i found hours melting away as i explored and played i wanted to see what the game had next what there was to discover what secrets the next milestone would reveal what new and exciting sights there were to behold i was never disappointed

half of the impetus to continue exploring was the absolutely stellar soundtrack by lifeformed and janice kwan i bought the album a mere few hours into the game the pair have put on a clinic in an ost thats warm haunting foreboding catchy and sublime throughout not to be left out power up audio has also done an absolutely outstanding job giving the game and its interactables and combat punchy rich and powerful sound which remains consistently good throughout

i cannot touch on the story without being vague to avoid spoilers simply because of how rich it is and how important discovery is to the flow of the game prepare to be amazed then amazed again and again chasing the dragon of discovery will be rewarded guaranteed the gameplay loop is challenging but walks the razors edge of being punishing and rewarding as you become more practiced and confident its not soulshard but damn near and the rewards for your endurance are abound it does not disrespect your time or pound you to dust

all in all the game is a steal at 30 buy it buy it for your friends go on a foxy little adventure thats far far bigger than it seems tunic is one of the greatest games i have played in a very long time finji continues to be a seal of quality

thank you

#####

just play it no guides no hints

#####

b this whole game felt like it was tailormade for me ಥಥ  b

i received this as my birthday gift and i wasnt expecting much but oh boy was i wrong this whole game is filled with euphoric aha moments without spoiling much i can only say that on the surface its looks like a zeldaclone but its much much more than that as it hides everything about it and absolutely does no handholding whatsoever so you will be having a lot of wtf you could do this the whole time
the combat is tight as well as responsive and the ost slaps

there are very few games that truly do something special nowadays usually its the cookiecutter tried and true methods of battle royales or mmos or singleplayer campaigns that you can easily set foot into and play with no problem

tunic is different its an adventure game its an exploration game it has good combat and even greater puzzles but it does something that most games today dont it combines that nostalgia for the games of yesterday with an innovative concept that could shape the way games are played going forward

everything about this game is so refined despite its isometric blocky looks at first glance the soundscape level design and art are something to behold the nods it makes to selfreliance and community sharing like in the days of old nintendo gaming are well done and appreciated you will very easily find yourself humored and amazed at the small little details put into this game and absolutely dumbfounded at some of the bigger ones

if youre on the fence about getting this game or if youre completely set on getting it absolutely do it no questions asked but do not look up any walkthroughs or guides beforehand go into this game completely blind and let yourself enjoy the experience i promise you as someone who did just that you will not be disappointed 

tunic is very solidly my game of the year and is definitely close to the top of my list of favorite games ive ever played

theres a great big world to explore in this game full of excitement and danger and everything in between be brave little fox

#####

do not look up guides

i just have to preface my review with that this is an absolutely amazing example of a game that knows how to obfuscate itself and every step of progression is taught by way of the manuals paced uncovering and two very important questions can i do that and is that important every single part of the game i learned from outside was either already in the manual pages id collected or not required for progression to that point everything is taught to you but in a wonderfully obfuscated format that rewards you for taking the time to analyze it the zelda elements are a beautiful meeting point of the original lozs completely obscured progression and lttps combatprogression sandboxing the same sandboxing that makes lttp so good for randomizers and the combat is only obscenely difficult until you pass the knowledge threshold

but again that knowledge threshold is major almost everything in the game can be accessed or completed from the start the top speedruns are under 20 minutes and skip over half the world because theres just that much access however the content is gated primarily almost exclusively by your knowledge thereof and the structure of the game intends you to figure it out as you go and keep an eye open for any little detail that could possibly be important if you give in and look up info online you risk what is effectively sequence breaking by exposing information you were supposed to be rewarded for figuring out yourself the single detail i could possibly say is worth spoiling early is the character customization because its not required for any part of the content and could easily be missed if youre not running into every conceivable corner looking for it

no im not saying where it is go run into corners for it

#####

1010 would walk into every wall and under every waterfall again

#####

the ilegitimate child of zelda and outer wilds thus  great game

#####

absolutely brilliant tunic does an immaculate job of making each new discovery feel interesting especially moments of wait this was here the whole time the designer said something along the lines of this world doesnt care about you and it exists without you and its the embrace of this design that lets the player uncover mysteries organically without being railroaded into them then in a game full of surprise after surprise tunics final puzzle sequences stands as one of the best i can remember experiencing in any game the game is a visual treat with memorable locations  gorgeous animations and a feast for the ears with tight sound design partnered with a pictureperfect ost by lifeformed tunic totally captures the imagination and if you find yourself thinking about it long after shutting the game off know that youre in good company highly recommended

h1bfantastic mr linkbh1

while i try to be as honest and fair about the games i evaluate i am but one little dictator writing these reviews and thus i am prone to biases one of the main preferences i have in particular is my love for games that place an emphasis on exploration iskyrim elden ringi and ilegend of zelda breath of the wildi are all comfortably near or at the top of my list of favorite games with that in mind i walked into this game knowing fully well that id enjoy it what i did not expect however was ihow muchi i was going to enjoy it itunici is a brilliant gem with a fascinating and mysterious world that slowly unfolds itself with each button you press

h1graphicsh1

itunici utilizes a minimalist art style reminiscent of last years ideaths doori in particular the standout is how well it uses color initially it adds to the dreamlike feeling of the game but eventually i picked up on the brilliantly subtle ways color is utilized to guide you in the right direction the character designs are also topnotch your playable fox hero is absolutely adorable and i really liked the extra touch of seeing them look at things and react to them as i passed by 

my only criticism here is a minor one and its that the final boss was obnoxiously hard to follow at times because the game went a little too overboard with the effects and all of the attacks kind of blended together as a result however this didnt significantly ruin my enjoyment by any stretch and was only noticeable because of how welldone the rest of the game was visually

h1gameplayh1

since ibreath of the wildi i think games have started to embrace a less is more approach with open worlds where youre thrown into the thick of things and youre forced to learn and adapt on your own often coupled with a minimal or nonexistent hud itunici is one such game but takes this philosophy in a very unique direction 

on top of the aforementioned staples of these games itunici adds an additional layer of complexity by making most of the game in a foreign language you cant easily translate instead you need to find pieces of a manual to gradually piece together how to play and what exactly youre doing the manual mechanic is in my opinion probably the best thing about this game its such a creative way to ease you into the games mechanics and it keeps gameplay fresh because learning the controls iisi part of the mystery 

the game is pretty much what it looks like but the important thing to note is that it plays much more closely to a soulslike than a 2d zelda game youre mostly exploring and fighting monsters but theres enough environment variety that this never felt boring to me the combat is pretty simple though it takes some getting used to but it works well enough theres a handful of bosses and while they were cool i did find it very annoying how frequently they would move just out of range or dodge your projectiles the stamina system was fine but i always felt like my attacks were just out of range and i couldnt really do anything about it besides try to get lucky with my positioning the bosses were all fair to fight but i felt they were slightly overtuned since it felt like i barely ever got windows to attack them 

later in the game youll begin to encounter more puzzles and while these puzzles did feel pretty obtuse at times the final one was iextremelyi satisfying to pull off and one of my favorite puzzles ive ever seen in a game in regards to that yes i do think itunici gets a little bit too obtuse at times the game generally does a good job of keeping you on track with subtle cues but there were a couple of points where i had absolutely zero indication as to what to do next and had to consult a guide i cannot get more specific without story spoilers speaking of which

h1storyh1

itunicsi narrative is pretty basic its just ring the bell or get the thing but i honestly dont mind that the game is intentionally vague and mysterious but i think the developers were more concerned with nailing the feel of exploring an unfamiliar world rather than the why of it translating some of the language i found it kind of amusing just how surfacelevel a lot of the text was that said there definitely is some worldbuilding although a lot of it is left open to interpretation the world itself is quite fascinating and theres a lot to explore so i feel like the story is more about discovering whats going on in this enchanting little fox world while there isnt much to this story the devs seemed more concerned about the world and the feel both of which were handled quite well

h1audioh1

another major highlight of itunici is the surprisingly stellar soundtrack it plays a crucial part in setting the tone of the game and the best word i can use to describe it is ethereal for a game deadset on trying to sell you on the world you explore the music carries a lot of the weight in making that feeling work its otherworldly and emphasizes synths more than traditional instruments but at the same time entrancing enough to keep you focused on the game this very well could be one of the best indie game soundtracks in the last couple years

h1content valueh1

while my playtime seems low its important to note that i tend to finish games pretty quickly you can definitely get double the amount of playtime if not triple itunici has multiple endings and i was compelled enough to get all of them theres also a ton of secrets and it feels like i barely scratched the surface with that i think the game is most interested in the first playthrough but i do think the build variety is rather disappointing i wouldve liked to see one or two more weapons that you could use instead of the sword it hurts the replay value although i do think this game could be interesting to watch speedruns for 

h1verdicth1

itunici is an amazing labor of love that should be talked about more maybe its because ielden ringi released a few weeks prior to this and drowned out any gaming discussion for a solid month but this game was a constantly satisfying experience with some incredibly brilliant ideas and executed those ideas extremely well it didnt exceed in every front but it did so in most of the areas it needed to if you enjoy games that dont hold your hand this is absolutely a mustplay besides how can you say no to a face as adorable as that little fox

ahh kingsleys adventure 2 finally

the real star fox adventure weve all been waiting for the furry zelda game we didnt know we needed

this game resonated with me in a way that no game has for a very long time it spoke to my childhood self and it spoke to me as someone who has tried their hand at game development hoping to release sex with obama next year

the game communicates on a metalevel it bypasses the fox character to engage with the player directly and it speaks in a language of the shared experience of players

tunic is a brilliant example of being able to tell a rich emotional plot with minimal backstory and zero initial context at the same time there are several mechanisms built into the game for revealing the puzzles and story its not obtuse like ive seen some claim its brilliantly breadcrumbed and gives you exactly what you need exactly when you need it

to me the game sort of reads like playing games as a child that were too advanced for me but still enjoying them for what they were i loved watching my dad play games like ultima and pool of radiance even though i couldnt read so playing things like zelda final fantasy and metal gear without being able to read  were markedly different experiences than they are revisiting them as an adult 

the whole manual thing was exquisite and very cleverly designed the language made me feel like when i was a kid and i would not understand the text in games english is not my primary language and localization was rare in the 90s and had to figure out things by context and testing tunic does a disgustingly good job of recreating the magic of first discovering videogames as a young kid before you knew how any of it worked

another touch i also loved is when you pause the game to look at the manual you can clearly see an old crt screen in the background as if you were playing this game for the first time back then just chef kiss some great little touches

but one of the things i loved the most about the game is that it made me feel smart it sounds weird i know im usually not the brightest but figuring out this games puzzles and decyphering the language was incredibly satisfying which motivated me to keep going without looking up guides or anything the moment i finally solved the final puzzle was amazing and incredibly memorable

and yeah i agree that the games combat is not the best its very dark soulsesque but not anywhere near as challenging as dark souls itself but the creativity cleverness and charm of everything else made up for it

tunic at least for me duplicates the experience of enjoying a game without fully grasping what the game actually is and is the first time in a very very long time that a game actually took me back to the good old days of just playing for the sake of it

man everything about this games presentation is just incredible this is most likely to be my personal goty and im 100 sure itll end up winning a bunch of best indie awards i would say that i havent had this much fun and felt this much wonderment playing a game in forever and considering the state of aaa games is such sit right now its exceptional when you can find a game made by people that clearly care about what theyre making what the hell are you waiting for

1000000010

#####

the year is 1991 your uncle just came back from his overseas trip and bought you a japanese version of the legend of zelda for your eighth birthday despite the fact that none of the writing is in english you happily sit in front of your snes and slowly figure out the game through careful exploration and experimentation

you will never be this happy ever again

tunic manages to capture the essence of a simpler time where childhood wonder reigns supreme anyone that has fond memories of an older generation of games should get this

#####

it deconstructs the game and lays it wide open on your table allowing you to put your own soul in it

it also testifies to video games as wonder machines all games try to create wonder to the best of their resources even istarfieldi dont laugh but itunici seems to be more focused on the process than the output more interested in the clockwork behind the magic the machinery that makes the god appear rather than the god himself shifting the emphasis in the traditional ideus ex machinai device it even has the mechanics and the metanarration for it 

your main mission will be to piece together and figure out the manual that describes the game which is also a game guide a cheat book and your most important resource for puzzle solving all that because itunici is essentially a puzzle game masquerading as a topdown soulslike metroidvania only so that it can push the puzzles into the meta layer of its narrative hiding them in plan sight as it were and they are wonderful brilliant puzzles so great they totally overshadow the action mechanics the game relies on in its early stages to the point that it almost makes them irrelevant by the end game you can choose a greatly reduced difficulty for enemy encounters and boss fights spoilerand even activate a sort of godmode ifrom the game optionsi spoiler if you want to concentrate on the puzzles and the game will want you concentrated on those 

thats not to say its action mechanics are less accomplished of course but the gradual shift from action to puzzles as the game progresses is obvious and a great example of versatile and meaningful game design that ive not seen many games able to attempt so successfully therefore if you want to play it as a slick soulslike metroidvania in a colourful zeldalike setting you can totally tackle it like one of those but its truest nature is closer to the ascetic selfawareness of ithe witnessi and the game manual it has you put together while playing is hands down the most selfreferential statement ever made by a video game

#####

if you love mysteries cryptography guessing games being confused good art and topdown combat youll like this game a lot

i like the art and the combat but as it turns out i cant stand the rest  this isnt a game for everyone its a game for a certain kind of person which is how games ought to be designed  i am just not that person

#####

starts like zelda turns into a soulslike game with sprinkles of horror elements all while keeping you engaged with puzzles like the witness

also the shopkeeper is a cute anime girl who is too embarrassed to ask you out 1010

#####

dark souls  zelda  the witness

1010

#####

in more ways than one this game feels like an old game your older brother imported from japan back in the 90s

the game world is hostile to you you die a lot and you dont understand anything part of progressing is figuring out things other games would have told you from the start such as where to go and what your character can do i absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the thrill of discovery and figuring things out on their own

the game is best played blind however if you are stuck others may share with you their wisdom on your journey to becoming a secret legend

#####

i dont usually write reviews but boy do i recommend this game a true indie gem from the same shelf as outer wilds i wish i could play it again with my memory of it erased i just wish the default difficulty was a bit easier because it has and will put off many players luckily you can lower the difficulty in the options menu dont be ashamed to use it to fully enjoy the game

#####

tldr  a very likely nominee to indie of the year tunic revives the exploration formula brought by fez with more density and constant elements of surprise surrounded by a soulsesque combat approach and legend of zeldas aesthetic absolutely worth the price



tunic is exactly what you see on its store page and at the same time it is totally not this is one of those games that are hard to sell to you without giving a bare minimum of spoilers but ill do my best

this game feels like a hybrid between fezs worldbuilding classic legend of zelda titles aesthetics and some sparks of dark souls

iwhy dark soulsi
as soon as you press new game the game very intentionally starts providing no context no explanation no intro and not even explaining the controls even most of the textes in this game are an ingame language that we can not understand despite this level of obscurity tunic keeps introducing elements very smartly in a sense that you somehow keep progressing while still understanding very little of what surrounds you 

combat also feels inspired by the souls approach lockbased rolls with iframes bonfire checkpoint system methodical pattern recognition and encourages you to use more resources than simply swinging your sword 

it even resembles dark souls in a way that spoiler the first objective of the game is to ring two bells spoiler

iwhy fezi
tunic is one of those games with heavy attention to details around its world this is an explorationbased game where youll be passing through same areas several times yet many of them will feel different on many many occasions the game will eventually throw new information to you that will create those wait this was present the whole time moments 

you will end up taking actual notes and you will be seeing the same world youve crossed several times differently paying attention to things you didnt even consider 

like in fez solving secrets in this game feels extremely rewarding with added layers of complexity and obscurity

ihow does the game achieve iti
one interesting mechanic tunic has is its instruction manual during your adventure youll be finding manual pages that will help you in many more ways than simply explaining basic controls they explain how the world functions the manual is incredibly well thought and shaped in a way that will be crucial for you to progress i personally felt very engaged every time i found new pages what brand new info will i discover how much will it help me to stop being stuck in 100 of the occasions they provided new information that i could use even if they referred to something i already knew

ive mentioned that youll be backtracking and crossing the same areas several times this might sound problematic but the world is wellmade enough for it not being tedious since you keep discovering new secrets youll actually feel encouraged to revisit those areas to see if you find something you didnt notice before which will likely happen

if there is something i would critisize from the game is that it is unnecessarily difficult dont get me wrong it is far from being hardcore but the combat is surprisingly punishing for a game this focused on exploration on few situations the game has sudden short difficulty spikes that i personally think they negatively distracted from the real beauty of this game which is investigating this insanely wellcrafted world 

overall tunic has been a very special title to me and a clear nominee to indie of the year it is a gem that you will remember for a long time and youll recommend it to your relatives even way before you uncover everything it has to offer while having an aboveaverage price for an indie title it is well worth and youll do yourself a favor by purchasing it right now

#####

tunic is the type of game you did not know you needed until youve played it

this was by far the best soulslike ive ever played and at the same time had the most innovative gameplay
in the first hours of playing it felt like dark souls all over again but the more i played the more i discovered how wellmade and brandnew tunic is
the way that you can discover your abilities and the way that you find out about secrets in the game is genius youre like wow i could do that the whole time and didnt even know about it
i think not popping tutorial messages over and over again like most games was the best decision they made while making this game
 you will learn new things about the games world and your characters abilities even in the last hours of playing and just before the ending and in my case even after finishing the game once
the story is great if you follow it the puzzles are good and i didnt see anything like them before the gameplay is ok dodging can be a pain in the ass but you can get over it the soundtracks are good and the art and level designs were good too
i dont usually play a game that uses an isometric camera but playing this one was the right choice

#####

ive never played a game that so consistently delighted me and rewarded me for my curiosity i wish i could forget everything about this game and play it again knowing nothing

#####

i want to preface this by saying read the instruction manual this games feels like a combination of dark souls but easier links awakening zelda 2 nes and zelda 1 nes combined the game also has great ambiance with one standout example being the forest themes sounding like the guardia forest from chrono trigger snes everything about this game feels great but i want to make it understood that you must read the instruction manual pieces that you pick up other than that the game is a great title to explore and just get lost in

#####

play this game blind pls

#####

although i enjoyed tunic overall if someone who normally loves actionadventure games told me that they hated it id be completely unsurprised this game prides itself in being cryptic youre playing a game where the manual is in gibberish the isometric viewpoint purposefully obscures your next destination and your characters most basic goals are shrouded in mystery tunic tries to make everything difficult from its item descriptions to its environmental design 

thats also the fun of it everything about tunic is a mystery for you to solve 

i had many moments where i finally pieced something together in tunic that completely changed how i interacted with the world those moments of satisfaction where some new mechanic clicked into place were the highlight of the game and tunic was full of them the best part of the puzzles in the first part of the game were how they would interact with and progress all the other pillars of gameplay correctly interpreting manual pages would teach you core combat mechanics learning tunics style of cryptic breadcrumbs would reveal hidden paths to explore engaging with the games riddles would feed you pieces of lore 

while i adored this portion of the gamewhere i kept learning new secrets about the worldi will admit that my interest started to wane by the end by the last third of the game youve exhausted all of those other pillars of gameplay theres far less combat far less exploration and far more puzzles all thats left is puzzle after puzzleand i dont mean zelda shrine puzzles i mean the type of puzzles where youre pulling out a paper and pencil to frantically scribble down solutions these puzzles were also distinctly more meta than most of the ones sprinkled earlier throughout the game i wasnt naturally stumbling across mysteries that were cleverly integrated into an existing world and narrative instead i was just walking from riddle a to riddle b to riddle c if you love mindboggling puzzles then this section of the game will feel like getting served free dessert after a fullcourse meal if you picked up tunic because you were told it was a cute adventure game with zelda vibes then you may feel somewhat tricked by its transformation into a pure puzzle game

i loved tunics purposefully obtuse way of presenting its combat environment and lore it was rewarding to have to piece everything together myself and if you like games that dont hold your hand then youll enjoy that aspect too thats truly the appeal of tunic and the continual sense of wonder and discovery that permeated the first half of the game was more than enough to push me through the somewhat repetitive final sprint


#####

videogame manuals are becoming a lost art with the convenience of online distribution developers have transitioned these former staples into digital formats if the game even comes with one those who grew up playing the fifth generation of consoles understand that manuals are essential to enriching ones experience many provide lore and backstory while teaching you how to play in an age where they are a dying breed tunic takes the manual to the next level and incorporates it directly into the game encouraging players to pay attention and use its clues to decipher puzzles ironic considering that players control an illiterate fox 

tunic combines legend of zelda gameplay with soulslike combat to create an exploration focused adventure this is a game that absolutely refuses to hold your hand getting lost is common but dont be discouraged as most of the obstacles are reasonable its only when you attempt a completionist run that the game rears an ugly head some puzzles including the one needed for the true end are so obscure they border on perplexing the manual also sorely lacks a way to bookmark pages for quick access rifling through just to return to the overworld map gets tedious fast 

despite these complaints tunic is a brilliant experience that comes off both nostalgic and fresh its a meticulously crafted time capsule thatll take you back to the days where you wrote down secret codes and inputs where every discovery felt like uncovering ancient treasure the devs buried and piecing together clues made you feel every bit as smart as those grownups

#####

as you might expect tunic is indeed like zelda  but not necessarily the one youre thinking of to me its like zelda in its oldest incarnations the legend of zelda and the adventure of link these were games that explained little of themselves their world was a mystery and youd scour the manual and included maps for hints youd take notes of bizarre riddles and shreds of information that may be of use in the future thats the kind of zelda game tunic is most like to me much more than a link to the past but youre a cute fox in other words 

and it takes this concept of unguided pure adventure and mystery to wowing lengths you get the feeling that the developers truly understand mystery and its transportative effect to a childlike state of wonder if this is something you crave tunic will delight and surprise even when you think you understand it  let the game work its magic on you give it time to sink in and you will get an experience that is engrossing and  rewarding treat it with care because games like these are very rarely found and their magic is easy to dispel by impatience

tunic is my favorite game of 2022 and among my favorites in general it isnt perfect  its combat design and map layout are occasionally frustrating for example  but it is a game wellworth the time and effort and its designed ingeniously where it matters most to me

#####

this game is stellar every nook and cranny of the map is filled with little puzzles and secrets the combat is super satisfying and keeps you on your toes without usually overwhelming you the games theme shifts from cute to mysterious to downright terrifying the music sets the tone of each environment perfectly and slaps super hard as youre slicing the baddies the game manual which you collect the pages of as you explore is filled to the brim with adorable artwork and game info as well as the maps for each area and pointers to where to go and how to deal with troublesome enemies the environment and visuals are a sight to behold there are little moments where the camera will change its normal focus for you to take in some majestic scenery or to frame an event that is about to blow your mind its good its so good everything is fun or pretty or absolutely crazy 

play this game

#####

a game in the style of old school zelda with tons and tons of hidden secrets progression is a mix of traditional completionitem based and the far more interesting knowledge based progression akin to outer wilds it even has options in the menu to trivialize the combat so you dont have to get good at it to explore the game this game has more depth than it appears at first glance go into it blind if you can since some of the mechanics are spoilers which will change your experience if known early

#####

really enjoyable and worth the wait the game is being frequently described as a soulslike link to the past which i feel is unfair while there are very immediate and central connections to lttp i wouldnt describe soulslike as very apt there is a death mechanic a parry and an upgrade system but the vibe isnt at all like dark souls and outside of the parry the other two similarities dont feel all that similar either the difficulty isnt nearly as high or feel as punishing id describe as slightly more difficult than casual 

this game is very responsive intuitive and holds a incredible amount of character i had been following this games development for maybe 6 or 7 years and in that span of time there have been a huge amount of games modeled on the link to the past format i was worried that my experience would suffer from the markets oversaturation but this game does an exceptional job of keeping you engaged and interested the primary storytelling and mechanicsexplaining vehicle is based on an ingame instruction manual that you pick up pieces of bitbybit and i love everything about it there is so much attention to detail a plethora of subtleenticing hints and puzzles that are legitimately difficult and frustrating that feel genuinely rewarding

this is probably the best game in the genre that ive played since hyper light drifter id suggest playing blind and really keeping yourself from looking up solutions when you are stuck there are loads of ahha moments that i wouldnt want you to spoil for yourself

#####

as someone who has loved a link to the past since childhood i was skeptical of all of the praise of this being a good successor after playing it through and eating every puzzle it has to offer the praise is quite warranted the puzzles are more mature and complicated and there is less item progression compared to alttp however i do not feel the game suffers for it it is not totally similar to alttp and similar games but i feel that it really scratched the same itch of a million secrets and things to explore

the combat is enjoyable and the bosses feel the right amount of difficult however on keyboard refocusing is a little cumbersome but there is only one fight which benefits from doing it so it isnt a huge problem

the story is the weak point of the game however that doesnt mean it is unenjoyable it is merely a little simplistic compared to similar titles like hollow knight and i was never particularly drawn by the story but then again i wasnt much drawn by alttps story either i dont feel the lack of a great story detracts from the game experience and the story still has a couple of oh wow or aww cute moments which will stick with me

the game is extremely rewarding for someone who loves devouring puzzles returning to areas noting little things that dont quite seem right and watching everything come together in the end you are given no direction no instruction and no goals by the game this game will not hold your hand not in the hardcore way but in a way that makes you feel like you are able to do all things at your own pace and really makes you feel special each time you discover something new entirely on your own

there is a lot going on in the puzzle department and a lot of areas to return to so this game might be a bit tricky to come back to after putting it down for a month or something you know its a good puzzle game when you get out the pencil and paper notebook and this is one of those so dont be afraid to write down stuff

the manual adds a ton of charm to the game and everything feels lovingly crafted i cannot recommend the game highly enough i hope they will make something similar in the future thank you tunic team for your hard work and love

if you think you may like this game you will buy it my greatest recommendation is to absolutely not look up anything about this game if you are really stuck have a friend look something up for you and tell you the piece you are missing you can spoil so many good puzzles with the smallest idea or spoiler and there are so many layers

#####

extremely good game but i would 100 suggest you dont look up any videos of it it is best consumed knowing nothing

h1 not just a cute foxh1

btunicb is drawing clear inspirations from the legend of zelda and is featuring extensive fighting that got me dying much more than my elden ring run thanks to the strength of different elements of the game that make tunic the gem that it is

graphically speaking tunic is a 3d isometric game that is both extremely pretty and polished this gave the artistic direction the luxury to be able to hide things in plain sight to make tons of hidden paths not so obvious roads hidden items ropes and so on that will have you both forever running in circles and hunting for chests and other collectibles

tunics unique atmosphere is partly being reinforced by the strength of its graphics because of what we explained earlier you will have to explore the world to make sense of it our little fox character just appears on the map with not a single idea of what is happening and neither do you the more you play and keep on exploring the more the journey will start to make sense and you will be able to find the answers to most of your questions should you be unable to answer some you can always go back and figure it out this adds an entire layer of replayability to tunic the game wants you to experience it fully and the only way to do so is to dive into its world and figure it out by yourself through exhaustive exploration

one addon that felt more than welcome to alleviate the lack of ingame information both the strength and weakness of the game was the interactive living document that acts as your map guide tutorial and instruction book without serving all of it in an interactive menu and calling it a day you will have to hunt for its numerous pages hidden throughout the world and in return you will get enough content to keep going and wanting more 

in terms of gameplay tunics level design shines through the pathing and exploring you get to do and what at first looks like a cute fox exploring a really beautiful world is really a brutal game that will leave you to your own demise and will be both tough and challenging it is by no mean an easy experience you will have to carefully consider each fight your dodges your stamina management and so on a few elements of tunic that will remind you of the soulslike games are the resting points while cutting the grass with your sword will immediately send you back to the legend of zelda another similarity happens when you die and lose some of your coins you will then get the opportunity to get them back by picking up what appears to be your soul at the exact location of your death

the difficulty scales up but isnt frustrating enough to make you stop on top of that should you just want to experience the story the accessibility menu offers you the chance to never run out of stamina or to be invincible

finally i wouldnt say that the game innovates much but it manages to incorporate elements of what made other games successful as its own it is more than just a zeldalike or soulslike game it is simply put tunic a game that will both charm you and challenge you

#####

i have a lot of mixed feelings about this game  if i could give it a meh recommendation i would  if you read the reviews on this game youll notice a trend often there are complaints of puzzles or directions being cryptic or obtuse  id agree that this is true but this game is so perfectly crafted in that way that it buhasu b to be a very intentional design choice  the creator of this game very much intended this game to be the way it is  for better or for worse

i think ultimately that is what makes this game hard to recommend for me  this is not a game for everyone  there were at least two points in this game where i understood what the game wanted me to do and i knew what obtaining the solution was going to require  the problem is i just actively didnt want to do it  it wasnt going to be fun for me  i pushed through anyway to see if i was underestimating the fun factor for these roadblocks but sadly i was not getting the good ending was neat but im not sure i enjoyed myself the whole way through

theres a lot of really neat ideas in this game  i so very desperately wanted to like it more than i did  but when im actively debating just googling the answer to a puzzle because the act of actually going about finding the parts to solve it not understanding how to solve it but the actual part where you put the footwork in to find what you need well im not sure im having fun at that point  i think thats when youve lost me

fox

#####

what it looks like zelda lite what it plays like dark souls lite what it ends up being my favorite game of 2022 go in blind allow yourself a break when stuck or lost and youll probably have a really good time oh and i heard the speedruns are pretty good

#####

go in blind if you can theres some very good aha moments

#####

h1tunic is a beautifully crafted love letter to gaming itself it wears its inspirations proudly on its sleeve while simultaneously being an utterly unique experienceh1


bhighly recommendedb people often compare it to the legend of zelda particularly links awakening link to the past etc combined with the combat difficulty of dark souls and fezlike puzzles but while all that is true it must be emphasised that the game has oodles of unique spins features and charms all of its own

rarely have i played a game as enrapturing as this one the wanderlust the game instils in you is addictive the combat is challenging but highly highly rewarding the puzzles are tough but make you feel like sherlock holmes when you finally do solve them

its best played with an xbox controller and going in as blind as possible its very easy to be spoiled on the game theres secrets and hidden things everywhere all over the place

the care and attention to detail in this game is astounding and is truly a tour de force from the sole developer behind it as someone whos been waiting for the game for all seven years of its developmentsomeone who signed up for the mailing list back when it was still called secret legend someone who played the demo of tunic all the way back at twitchcon 2017i can say that the wait was worth it

the soundtrack is fantastic the art is beautiful the gameplay is refined

btreat yourself to tunicb


side note if youre a vtuber this is an excellent game to use dynamic vtube lighting on the beautiful lighting of various areas lends itself very well to that effect

zelda for foxes

hats off to the devs  

simply a masterpiece in every aspects 1110

tunic is an actionadventure game inspired by zelda and fez

you play as a fox who wakes up on a ruined island with no context and nothing else to do but to explore
youll quickly find the bare minimum to fight the enemies wandering around and a few pages of what appears to be the game manual  this manual is the core of tunic
the twist is that it is ciphered written in a language you cant understand some words are still readable though and the game revolves around that  making you guess and guiding you with your senses of observation and deduction nothing is directly told to you  everything whether it is a minor or major thing is in the manual and youll have to study it

it has a strong nostalgic vibe game manuals are not a thing anymore and anyone who grew up with them probably miss them too i always read them before playing a new game and i remember i had to put tape on my super mario sunshine and sonic adventure 2 manuals due to reading them too much

the world of tunic is extremely well crafted exploring it is very pleasant the game is beautiful cute and has a nice soundtrack and very rewarding there are tons of secrets hidden everywhere once you get that this is this type of game youll start searching any corner you can find and sure youll probably get a lot of treasures
but what makes the level design of tunic so good and truly genius is not only the secrets youll find its all the things hidden in plain sight that youll still miss the game doesnt even try to misdirect you they are just so cleverly hidden that you wont see or find them

tunic has two major sides

 the first one is the adventure the main game it strongly reminds of zelda but harder and im not just talking about the bosses common enemies are also threats and some areas can be very challenging the combat is punishing if you just brainlessly rush into the enemies if you take your time and properly dodgeparry you wont have much trouble going through the game except for an area near the end you even have some consumables you can use if you really struggle
the bosses are still the highlights of course being fun varied very strong and usually forcing you to use different items depending on which one you face

 the second one is the fezlike side that youll discover near the end full of clever puzzles including mindblowing ones that youll remember for a long time some people can find that part too difficult but its not it just requires patience and as always a thorough study of the holy manual
i unfortunately cant go into details without spoiling anything but if you like puzzles its heaven

at this point you probably wonder why i didnt talk about the story at all well like anything else in the game the story is also cryptic
youll guess a few things and probably end up understanding what youre doing on the island but the real story the context of the game is locked behind the ciphered language and youre not supposed to decipher it at least not until the very end of the game and you probably wont anyway because its absurdly hard
thats the only little sad thing i can say about the game i wouldve loved more hints about that to really try to decipher myself

anyway tunic is a masterpiece in case it wasnt clear
and we need more games like that games crafted with a lot of love and time put into it games that dont hold your hand and recognize players are not devoid of brain games that are unique and memorable experiences

ill just end with a small message to the devs  thank you

h1bprosbh1

h1bieven when in the menu i was constantly engagedibh1



h1puzzlesh1

bia breath of fresh airib

games usually go for the same kinds of puzzles 
1hit this go thereuse this combination of items to traverseget the key from there then come back etc ex zelda

2 minigame puzzles something like connecting pipes or drawing lines ex the witness

3 break the 4th wall and require irl stuff get a pen a paper open a specific website decipher stuff open the files go to irl coordinates etc

some games try to have a mixture of these but it almost always fails as it is disjointed tunic mixes all three of these concepts together in varying degrees in every single puzzle making a very original enjoyable and cohesive experience

the final puzzle specifically is a culmination of all the collecting puzzle solving and exploring you have done the whole game only then will you able to piece the puzzle using a pen and paper of course after you figure out what youre looking for this was the most fun i had in the game and the game was paused

the game does this by giving you a manual ingame which will serve as your map objective pointer puzzle solver and sometimes the puzzle itself you will live and die by this manual it is the single most important and unique thing in tunic

h1level designh1

biit flows gracefullyib

instead of zeldas disjointed dungeon setup with a connecting world tunics whole map is the dungeon you will constantly go back and forth exploring finding secrets doing puzzles opening new areas with new items etc 

from the beginning of the game you can go to almost 34 of the whole map with new game keeping your items it is even greater the only thing stopping you in the beginning of the game is knowledge 

you dont know the objective you dont know the map you dont know the mechanics of the game you dont know the full extent of your abilities and you dont know all the things that your items can do unless you learn it from the manual or have prior knowledge

the game is able to do this by using the manual guiding the player to the correct sequence of the game but once you already beat it and know what you need to do and where to go and how you can do certain things you can do it in any sequence you like for the most part


h1itemsh1

bisome classics and some originalsib

some classics are present like the sword and shield they feel good to use have hidden mechanics ingame and the overall basic combat is adequate

some original items are also present like a wand hookshot an icy dagger and an hourglass and a certain something else which i wont spoil these are all very unique and are very fun to use some work synergistically some have hidden mechanics and some add new ways to traverse the world

of course all of these hidden mechanics and synergism are there from the start the only thing stopping you is you and the manual is the key


h1bconsbh1

h1bimildly irritating but can be overlookedibh1



 location of some pages of the manual

for example so youll understand a manual page explaining how to open doors is sitting behind a door once you have it there is no point in explaining it 

this only happens a couple of times though but it will either make you open a guide  or you will sit there for hours trying and get it either way it means the gamedesign has failed in its mission

 the fixed camera 

even though the game uses this to hide certain things and im okay with this i enjoyed it but not being able to see what im doing once i already found the secret entrance is infuriating to me especially sometimes when i need to interact with something when i cant even see where i am or where it is

 3 item limit

i dont understand this mechanic zelda links awakening also does this limiting the players moveset to three buttons in reality 2 buttons because you will almost always have your sword

it adds nothing to games mechanics or combat just tediousness there is no strategy it is literally only more buttons to press and menu hopping if the reason is no buttons on a controller  you can easily assign a button as a shift button that changes the set youre using

h1tldrh1

bithis is one of the most unique enjoyable breathtaking video games i have played a masterpieceib

#####

you gotta play it blind and before you ask yes the puzzles made me cry im not smart enough

#####

great metroidvania with interesting exploration wellcrafted secrets and good combat system

#####

honestly this game feels like it was made for me
quoting iron pineapplethis guy the dev just gets it and he really does the level design is great and the areas are cool and unique and a real joy to explore a really slick zeldalike soulslikeish game 
but thats not all
the gimmick of this game and the thing that really sets it apart and makes it go above the rest is the manual the whole gimmick is that the game is written mostly in an unknown runic language forcing the player to figure out game mechanics progression and puzzles on their own you have only one thing to help you as you progress you collect pages of a manual in the style of those old console games which gives you again pseudocryptic hints because its also mostly in the other language
the way the manual and the knowledge based progression flow into the design of the game is nothing short of genius its hard to gosh about just how amazing it is because that would be spoiling it but its completely genius 
games a masterpiece for me a strange mesh of hollow knight  meets  outer wildsbased knowledge progression 
definitely a mustbuy dont even worry about it going on a sale its an easy indie goty for me

#####

recapture what it was like to come home with a new game that you knew nothing about
tunic is a mystery wrapped in an enigma just waiting to be uncovered
please please play this game with no spoilers
it was about 15 hours of straight revelations for me and it was amazing

#####

from the first moment i looked at tunic i got a little zelda dejavu a cute little fox with green clothes and weapons that are very close to the looks and style that link did
the start of the tunic can also be compared to the start of links awakening as both games start with your character standing up on the beach and where you take your first steps in a new world full of secrets surprises and dangers

check out my first tunic gameplay here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuccaq65vu2u

shortly after you start in the game you will notice that the ingame language is an unintelligible language at least for us
for the life thats in the game everything will be clear except for you
you will have to maintain an hp and stamina meter and you do this through items that you can find after solving puzzles or by finding hidden places where these items can also be hidden it is also important to walk around everywhere and look around especially since there are many shortcuts to use in the world and these shortcuts are not exactly marked
the world is quite big but not completely open world
you will have to follow routes to reach other areas and you will also always have to figure out things to regularly clear the route of obstacles

although the game world looks cute it is indeed dangerous tunic therefore has different enemies which are connected to different areas some of them suddenly pop up you will also encounter bosses that you have to defeat to progress in the game the dark souls influences such as the bonfire mechanic are also reflected in the gameplay the game has shrines that come back when you die once you die you will have to go back to where you were defeated to retrieve your collected items previously defeated enemies will also return when you rest at a statue

tunic has a steep learning curve and therefore knows almost no explanation about what is actually going on you do see some elements that are interesting shapes and colors that grab your attention but it is you will find several pages from a small booklet containing information that you do not understand for the most part because the text is incomprehensible you will also find various maps sometimes with interesting markings which can help you achieve certain goals

tunic is a sweet game at first glance but it is very challenging for the average gamer both the puzzles and the enemies require a lot of tactical thinking and it is not always clear where to go and what to do
all in all a very nice recommendation for those who like a spicy game

#####

an incredible game thats both a work of art and a great experience beautiful art music with fun exploration and mindtwisting puzzles  tunic is easily worth its full price

#####

the only game that i enjoy reading the manual

#####

h1the joy lies not within combat but in exploration and puzzlesolvingh1

tunic is an isometric adventure game as a little fox wearing tunic players need to navigate through the vibrant cartoony world unravel the mystery via the manual pages you collect and finally have a grasp of the story behind everything tunic is quite different on the surface people may easily regard it as another zeldalike games with a tinge of soulslike element but upon actually playing it the game leans more towards the oldschool zelda games for a long time i think combat is always important in these kinds of games after playing tunic it really makes me reconsider this opinion it heavily focuses on puzzlesolving and world exploration requiring you to look through all the nooks and crannies combat is just an addition if you want to experience a interesting puzzle adventure with a cute artstyle and great soundtrack i highly recommend tunic for you

h1things i like about tunich1

b1 the nostalgia of not knowing everythingb
the first time i read through the manual in tunic it reminds me of the first  time i played final fantasy ix my uncle bought the game as well as a guide book in japanese i couldnt read the text in that book so i had to resort to the pictures and the arrows within them it took a while but eventually i semiunderstood context it was fun tunic right here evokes the same feeling for me as you collect more pages more information are revealed to you the context may still be alien language but the pictures and the foxs doodles offer you ample guidance

b2 the world itself is both puzzles and cluesb
i especially adore this the world in tunic is wonderful in both visual and gameplaywise almost everywhere is a puzzle from macroscale like clue pieces scattered around to microscale like the treasure chests placed at seemly unreachable places the game rewards you for being thorough of your exploration every nooks and crannies can lead you to unexpected shortcuts or aforementioned treasure chests so next time you walk into a new room try walking between gaps of your surrounding or try changing your perspective by locking on you will be surprise how pacted this beautiful world is

b3 combat is essential and not essentialb
while deaths doors combat fails at its simplicity tunic quite the contrary wins it because of the simplicity combat is the main focus of deaths door players will spend most of the time fighting things in tunic like i said before combat is just an addition a nice change of pace it serves mostly as a distraction for your brain to temporally shut off after doing some of the most obscure and hard puzzles 

b4 minor complimentsb
great bgm
very cute artstyle hiding some horrible things
boss fights is interesting in both design and encounter
credit for good ending is really sweet
testing what each of the items does is a fun experiment
using bombs more often rewards you with more bombs that restore when you reset

h1things i dislike about tunich1

b1 the last two big line puzzlesb
this section is dedicated to the mountain door puzzle and glyph tower these are two of the hardest and most frustrating puzzle to piece together not only this but solution sequence requires you to input in a rather rapid succession otherwise the game will not register i spend a whole ten minute trying to input the answer and half of the time i am questioning myself whether i get the right answer or not

b2 minor complaintsb
theres need to be a way to heal the permanentlyreduced max health instead of resetting
i wish i could turn on the lantern manually
parry is just a gimmick
really wish running and dodging can be separate inputs

i rarely 100 a game but tunic deserves it i was told it has puzzles and a hint of knowledgebased progression which i love i didnt expect the combat to have the depth it has so that was a pleasant surprise too i only learned about a certain shield mechanic towards the end 

combined with pleasant visuals and amazing soundtrack i highly recommend it if youre into solving puzzles and finding secrets some of them can be real headscratchers but itll be totally worth it

#####

tunic is a very good little game if you squint your eyes and try to blur your vision a bit you will realize how much this game looks like a zelda game from the mechanics of cutting grass and smashing vases to some classic enemies if you have nostalgia and like the old style zelda games this game is definitely for you or is it
there is a reason this game is not sitting above 95 good reviews the difficulty level while it is cute and well polished it is also very challenging you will die a lot if you dont you should definitely rethink starting that twitch channel this game is very challenging and can get frustrating some times it has save points across the world but even with them you will eventually have to traverse the same area a few times
therefore if you love zelda can put up with a high difficulty level or if you are a bit of a boomer whose has tasted the ruthless of games from the last century this game is a certain purchase 


#####

heres a game im rather conflicted about it does a lot right a few things not so much and despite having good mechanics some of them eventually wear out their welcome
as a throwback to the zeldas of yesteryear tunic gets a full score with its lush graphics combat and exploration and initial setting and atmosphere fighting offers all the trappings we have come to expect in this current games industry where everyone seems compelled to copy dark souls for good or ill theres stamina healing flasks and bosses that hit like a truck they even included the corpserun which i find particularly unnecessary
the game world is really pretty and inviting with its soft lighting and simple kinda squarish angular artstyle exploration is done by nosing through every nook and cranny employing gadgets and unlocking shortcuts curiosity is very much rewarded one neat feature inherent in the birdseyeview lockedcamera setup is that many secret passages are hidden behind the topography in crevices and around corners and such the downside is that you spend quite some time fumbling your way through these paths with nothing but a silhouette to guide you by and the rather stiff movement controls doesnt exactly help matters and as fun as the exploration is the backtracking you have to do at the end is rather tiresome although i suppose its optional
the standout feature is obviously the ingame instruction manual richly illustrated informative and immersive it even have coffecup stains this booklet fleshes out the game world teaches you how to play the game and solve puzzles and on top of it all provides a serious nostalgia kick some puzzles and features are quite brilliantly hidden in plain sight until you find the correct manual page telling what you can do and since its mostly written in a madeup tongue you still have to piece together the clues yourself however if youre planning on 100percenting tunic i wish you good luck because some of those secrets are so goddamn obscure i have no idea how youre supposed to find them without a guide
part of the plot is also revealed in the manual and in true soulslike fashion its an obscure affair and frankly not terribly involving
my biggest complaint though is the tonal shift tunic undergoes partway through the game it starts off with a more lighthearted setting and premise but then takes a noticably darker turn and i find it quite jarring subjective as it may be it feels almost like the game wants to be subversive because thats what youre supposed to do these days i really would have preferred if the developers would have stuck to the initial impression
so there it is despite some design choices i dont agree with i cant deny tunic is solid craftmanship with a lot of heart and it therefore receives my recommendation

#####

deserves every praise you already heard one of the greatest exploration puzzle games of our time with a touch of retro zelda 1010

the boss battles are a bit tough but there are settings for accessibility most of the time you will sneak around and learn step by step new things till the very end since its a knowledge based game be careful about spoilers you will get handed everything you need to solve this game all by yourself and you will probably feel a little bit proud about yourself after you did the experience is worth full price if you can afford it highly recommend

#####

i know my playtime is short but thats because i played this on game pass got all but 2 achievements and then bought it anyways because it felt criminal to love a game this much without paying for it also bought the soundtrack the plush fox the physical manual i might be a little obsessed

tunics one of my favorite games of all time rounding out a puzzle adventure trifecta of alltime greats with fez which it resembles in a lot of ways and outer wilds which it doesnt the arts lovely and sweet the music is gorgeous its my goto background soundtrack for games with bad music the puzzles are incredibly clever and the combat is great 

the story has a light touch personally thats the one thing id probably consider a flaw  i prefer a story that gets into a bit more depth maybe one with a few characters to get to know but whats there is good and meaningful 

but the one thing that really really stands out for me is the ingame manual i grew up on snes games which all came with these lovely illustrated manuals that felt like they held all the games secrets tunics manual is nostalgic but its also better than the original  those old game manuals mostly just felt like they were full of secret wisdom tunics manual genuinely is for me nothing beats the feeling of discovering the solution to a puzzle through a mix of clever hints and genuine breakthroughs and tunic layers those on top of each other like its effortless

anyhow i love this little fox game you should check it out

#####

tunic is a love letter to the legend of zelda and fez but its more than that it isnt a copy but a homage its unique and stands for itself its a classic with modern standards

it made me feel the joy of playing as a kid not knowing exactly what to do or where to go it pushes you to explore discover imagine think and try to solve each enigma by your own personally i love when a game doesnt underestimate you and instead believes in your ability and mind

whenever playing it i lost the sense of time and i was in awe with my mouth opened for how beautiful and unexpected it is

the music is so beautiful emotional captivating and immersive and so well selected for each environment and situation it even reminded me of donkey kong country soundtracks a few times

ironically tunic made me wanna try the original zeldas as i never had the chance to play those games before and im loving them too i discovered a new genre and the origins of dungeon design

about the manual apart from the fact that is very detailed well design its impressive how crafted it is you gotta keep in mind its an analogy for when a kid had to read all the instructions in a foreign language and thats the reason its meant to feel that way at least its my interpretation of it

recently the team added new options you can enable in the menu that may help you so its more inviting to people that dont like certain difficult things

id say you need a little knowledge about perspective spatially at least the isometric one it will help you understand things better

the little fox is the sweetest cutest fluffiest thing in the world w its animations are full of life and personality

id like to finish by saying that tunic is my game of the year and a special to my heart 

ps thank you for making this game andrew and team

#####

one of the best games ive played all year every secret draws you deeper in the one drawback i found is that if you dont get everything in one go youll have to play through the game all over again in order to get what you need to collect everything else

#####

robbed for indie goty 2022 im saying that as a cat owner who loved stray for all its charm tunic is the new traditional style zelda you wish nintendo would make blended with inspirations from fez and dark souls this game is about mystery exploration and discovery and a couple of the late game puzzles are among my all time favorites tunic rewards your careful attention in a way few games match continually revealing new sides of itself as you piece things together jumping from one aha moment to the next be prepared to think outside the box and to put the game down and come back to it with a fresh perspective every once in awhile

#####

every discovery in this game makes you feel so accomplished its really best to go in blind so thats about all i can say 

#####

b2 hours inb

what do you mean this isnt an official zelda game

b9 hours inb

a link to the past was one of the key reasons i learned to read as a child there was so many words i had never seen before so many daunting paragraphs of text that i slowly slowly began to understand as i also slowly began to understand the world and story of hyrule zeldas plight and links journey 

it wasnt until i started up tunic that i realized how incredibly important that was to my experience and probably the experience of so many other people who fell in love with that game this feeling combined with the games magical presentation makes it a imo masterpiece 

bif you interested enough in tunic to read the reviews then yes you want this gameb

#####

ive never wanted to like a game more than tunic i was actively anticipating its release and i bought it minutes after it unlocked on steam that said this game is a cryptic slog that will never make any sense while youre playing it i tend to like when languages are invented for a game as long as theres some way of translating it fez with the rosetta stone ffx with the unlockable letters etc there is no such mechanism for that in this game talking to npcs is more useless than ever item names will remain unknown hints on how to do things are so esoteric and convoluted that its more annoying than fun

much of the difficulty comes from the controls being sloppy lots of animation locking and sluggishness that makes combat feel very awkward i experienced a few bosses hitting me through the invulnerability period of the roll forcing me to just cheese them with the shotgun and a ton of mana berries

the game starts off on the right foot but it quickly just devolves into a lot of where do i even go type of gameplay that is filled with more questions than answers and overall left me with a bad taste in my mouth i wouldnt recommend this game unfortunately too rough around the edges and its desperately in need of a way to translate the ingame language at some point it feels like a ton of energy went into developing a language that youll never understand i just dont get it

#####

at the beginning i enjoyed playing a fun little zeldalike that reminded me of hyperlight drifter

by the time i finished i had a notebook full of diagrams and translations and i felt like i was playing the witness endgame

1010 would have my genre expectations thrown profoundly on their head

also the combat is not as bad as people say but there are accessibility options to make it easier if you want to focus on the puzzles

remember manuals they were nice huh where youd buy a brand new game with your hard earned cash and on the trip home before you even booted up the game for the first time the instruction manual would be there offering you a wealth of information about the game ranging from ostensibly useless to explanations of crucial mechanics maybe even some stuff thats not in the game itself

see the thing about manuals is  and this isnt a criticism of people who love them a whole bunch its totally understandable nor the concept themselves  they do kinda spoil the experience in a way not in a way that totally ruins the experience that would be an absurd suggestion but you could argue a manual written in a certain way with certain content can rob the player of the discovery that comes with the experience of playing the game they almost create a difficult relationship between the game designer and the player  the designer can spend all this effort making sure the mechanics are the game are explained via their gameplay but the player might just be reading the manual to get the full understanding themselves so its a bit of a weird standoff

tunic is a game which clearly draws a lot of its design from the sheer love of instruction manuals but transforms that love into one of the freshest and most interesting mechanics ive seen in a game in years quick explainer for the uninitiated tunics manual is an ingame encyclopedia which is slowly put together over the course of the game by collecting its pages you can think of it like say the collectible diaries in bayonetta but rather than offering supplemental information which leans harder on narrative than gameplay tunics collectible pages are the games manual

theres an interesting dynamic at play thanks to this setup obviously a game designer always has control over how and when you collect new items learn new abilities encounter new enemies and even the pace and order of tutorials given to the player if any the game designer reaching past the player character to speak directly to you the player and explain mechanics is nothing new but theres something unique and charming about the implementation in tunic and how it ties into your experience of the game over the course of your first playthrough your understanding of the game will develop through a tandem of your own exploration and experimentation and gentle nudges along by the manual written in a foreign language but for the odd keyword intended to use your existing understanding of how a video game works to lead you to conclusions about how this one works

even with this arrangement  being given a literal handbook to reference within the game at your command  its a game of real depth which only opens up more and more with enticing secrets and insisting nudges you might be forgiven if this is the only review you read for thinking tunic is just a game about walking around and finding stuff it does have combat multiple weapons spells boss fights everything you expect from a game wearing its legend of zelda influence on its sleeve so proudly but honestly its probably the least interesting part of the entire experience for me not that this makes me knock any points off of it and really its probably essential  what good are swords and spells without a plethora of beasties to use them against  its just that well the game features an entire suite of accessibility features intending to make combat less of a thing and i think that was a really wise decision it makes a lot of sense to use combat as the bone but this is a game with some really impressive meat on it

#####

i really want to love this game but the last third really drags it down for me the visuals music and world are all excellent but the combat leaves a lot to be desired and some of the later puzzles feel almost impossible without using a guide

maybe im too dumb for this game but i find it really hard to recommend this one running around almost aimlessly trying to solve the later puzzles is more frustrating than fun and the lack of any real reward from most of them leaves me ultimately unsatisfied there are amazing ideas here and the instruction manual element of the game is really neat but the core experience was just frustrating

i originally thought this game was just going to be some cute and goofy homage to zelda but in reality it ended up becoming one of my favorite games i have ever played in my entire life and with some of the best and most engaging puzzles i have ever seen in a game from the most basic puzzle to everything leading back to the path for the true ending which to achieve includes everything that you have learned through the entire game in order to solve it making us the player go back to taking notes writing and drawing with a pencil on a piece of paper like when we used when we were kids playing an old game 

and the game is not just about puzzles though as there is a lot of good and meaningful exploration through out this bizarre and strange world in tunic that just keeps evoking you with feeling of wonder that constantly pulls you towards its mysteries and secrets that it hides and all of that accompanied with a very strong art direction very good music and with a surprisingly deep combat system for a puzzlefocused game once you learn every secret and hidden mechanic tho the combat can be turned off in the options for people who just want to focus on the puzzles

i specially loved how you have to find pages of the longlost manual of the game and how even though it is incomplete at first you can kinda follow along what it is trying to tell you on a language that you cant possible understand in your first playthrough that part in particular really meant a lot to me because even though i am a 2000s kid i was born in a desert in méxico where we couldnt just get new games so we were kinda stuck with no internet and only old games entirely on english a language completely different from my own

i mean we had the manuals for those games at home and even though they really helped a lot in the games at the time i only knew a few words on that language so i had to solve what it was trying to tell me page by page turning the manual of the game into its own mystery and puzzle to solve so that i can tackle what those games needed from me and now that i have learned to speak english alongside a few other languages after all these years i always thought that i would never get to experience all these feelings and sense of wonder and mystery towards a game just like a did when i was a kid until i played tunic the game that sent me back to that time

seriously i cant thank you enough for giving me and probably many others one of the best experiences i have had with a game in a very long time so from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you very much at this point i wish i could just erase my memories from this game so that i could experience it for the first time all over again

tunic sat in my wishlist from its release until the summer sale of 22 and then occupied my backlog from then until now i initially got pulled into the game from the marketing material  it certainly looks and sounds like a game that i would enjoy tugging on those nostalgia cords in just the right way as to pull you in regardless of what the gameplay is like graphically the game is stunning the indie scene is dominated by games like this with simple lowpoly designs with incredible lighting and tunic does not disappoint the world is deceptively simple with arguably basic designs that punch way above their weight class the music and sound design of the game is impeccable remaining wholly original without failing to pay homage to the classic adventure titles that the game is trying to evoke performance is strong with very little technical complaints coming from me  

gameplay wise tunic is much more than the sum of its parts coming in carefully avoiding any spoilers i was tricked by the devs into thinking that tunic was just a modern take on the legend of zelda  a simple retelling of a hack and slash adventure through some technicolor environments i could not have been more wrong tunic is part legend of zelda part soulslike and part deathloop the gameplay of tunic is where nintendos level character and sound design intersects with fromsofts combat and deathloops importance of player knowledge at face value tunic is just a clone of loz but upon closer inspection it is much much more combat wise the game is challenging but not impossible soulslike sweaties will find the combat to be more familiar than would be expected at first glance the real heart and soul of the game is in its puzzles and the ever present allure of the holy cross and the vast secrets of the games manual the primary dev has stated in the past that tunic was meant to evoke the feeling of playing a game as a child where one has minimal if any reading skills and what it felt like at the time to blindly play through a game discovering deep into ones playthrough features and abilities that have been present since the start of the game the constant dripfeed of information lore and actual game mechanics puts tunic in a world of its own in terms of complexity and world building i have no complaints any where while i certainly struggled with the decidedly challenging bosses i was able to figure out most of the puzzles without having to follow any guides or look anything up which arguably is one of the hallmarks of this games ingenuity 

do yourself a favor and give into your inner child and play tunic it is easily one of the most innovative heartfelt games that i have played in years while remaining technically and mechanically sound indie titles do not always hit as well as tunic does and you will find yourself engrossed in the game hours having gone by feeling like when you played ps1 and gcn games before you could hold the controller correctly tunic is an experience that you do not want to miss

       one of the flaws of the game imo is the enemy character design very poor creativity is just zelda monsters
      solving the manual puzzle for a non native english it was impossible for me i put a lot of effort on it just couldnt get how it was made i had to ask to someone and even knowing how to decipher that puzzle i wasnt able to read the manual xd dont get me wrong the puzzle is great as it is its a personal con
      the story could have more development
list

unoteubfantastic indie no one can deny this just give it a trybh1h1

#####

tunic gave me the same brainscratchy feeling that fez did but with the combat challenge of a litesoulsborne game  clever game design good 10 hours of fun super cute

#####

love a game that gets me so hooked on exploring every last nook and cranny that i pull an all nighter because i cant put it down

incredibly fun designed the sense of childlike wonder and exploration with nothing but the games manual and some notes that feel like a friend left his thoughts and theories on the pages is something i didnt know i deeply longed for all this time
i felt like i was playing an old zelda game without access to the internet in the best possible way
loved the freedom the game provides you can go pretty much everywhere and do things in any order youd like if you want to the amount of mechanics i was taught that i was technically able to always do from the getgo is an incredibly fun concept too

the only qualm i do have is that the achievement for the first ending is locked once you get what you need for the second ending perhaps binding the achievements to the choice you make would be a better option

#####

this is more that just another zelda inspired game or another dark souls like game please play it great game

#####

the legend of zelda foxy breath

#####

everything about this game is relentless charming it gave me the feeling of being a child playing a videogame for the first time and exploring a strange new world in a way that other games just havent done in years combat is fast and fun the music is understated while complimenting tone perfectly and the visuals are a treat dont look up anything about this game go in as blind as you can and lose yourself in it you wont regret it

#####

wow cute fox

#####

this game is a masterpiece if you like that feeling of finding a secret in a game or solving a mystery you have to try it but do yourself a favor and go in knowing as little as possible about the game

#####

itunici is unashamed of its inspirations ithe legend of zeldai and ifezi in particular but its more than simply a love letter to either one it builds on the best aspects of these and other classics and gradually reveals a rich world thick with lore and secrets with the end result perfectly recreating the childlike wonder of being a little bit lost in a very big world but finding adventure whichever way you travel

itunici isnt everything i hoped it would be its so much more thoroughly gorgeous surprisingly challenging and an absolute delight from start to finish

#####

what is it a spiritual sequel to links awakening that takes lessons from breath of the wild mixes in soulslike mechanics and colours it with a solid streak of fez
why play it if the above isnt enough  ive never played a game since links awakening that filled me with the same sense of wonder and mystery that felt so rewarding to explore and filled every single minute of play with joy and glee
my goty 2022

#####

its like zelda meets dark souls lite

#####

somehow this game nostalgia baits better than almost any game i have played despite being a new ip it perfectly captures the feeling of learning a game in the late 90s i would recommend this game to anyone but especially 90s kids

#####

i could have done these things the whole time

#####

i remember seeing the announcement trailer back in 2017 thinking this could be neat little game and damn did it exceed all my expectations world is amazing and i love how connected everything is and the hunt for the manual pages to reveal something about the game is just wonderful only thing that could be minus for the game its the language puzzles itself albeit i think its a plus even if my small brains were not enough for them and i had to resort for a guide 910

#####

thank you for having an accessibility mode so i could play and finish this absolutely beautiful game

#####

i have complicated feelings about this game i loved collecting the manual pages and gradually solving all the various mysteries and puzzles along the way however the combat especially the boss fights were a real drag overall the huge emphasis on iframing through screenfilling aoes and managing your stamina really felt out of place in this game to me also why on earth does the camera need to rotate around so much during boss fights i assume it was to make things feel more cinematic but i nearly got motion sick a couple times from it moving the camera around that much without any player control over it mind you seemed like a really weird choice to me

regarding the puzzles while many of them were really satisfying and fun to figure out many of the lategame optional puzzles reminded me a little too much of fezs lategame puzzles in more ways than one that ended up feeling like a bit of a letdown because i just felt like id done this kind of thing before id normally recommend not worrying about going for 100 completion but if you dont want to be stuck with the bad ending you basically have to sodont be afraid to look up hints when necessary i suppose

overall i had a great time for most of it but these things took some of the shine off by the end for me

#####

utterly charming tunic doesnt just capture the feel of oldschool zeldastyle adventures and cash in on nostalgiait gets icleveri with the tropes in some beautiful ways

the game isnt very hard to completefor the bad ending that is some of the extra optional puzzlesincluding some for the good endingare incredibly challenging provided you resist the urge to just google the answer having broken down and looked up a few hints here and there id suggest that you often know more than you think you do the hints can be very subtle and sometimes when youre thinking no that icanti be it it actually is but the hints are all thereits refreshing for a game to trust you to figure them out you should trust yourself too

#####

spoiler free review

i finished this game half a year ago and i still think about it sometimes

recreates the vibe of playing games as a young kidyou can barely understand one in ten words fighting anything is super hard and you desperately want someone to give you hints

the combat is incredibly frustrating because it handles like a much older game it fits the vibe but it made me want to tear my hair out its totally unforgiving and jank as hell in all honesty i found that aspect charming whenever i wasnt getting beaten to death by a boss for the fifth time

quick tip note down or take a picture of anything weird you never know when it might come in handy

#####

h1 a masterpiece of exploration go in fully blind h1
now that is how you do exploration this is the best combination of puzzle solving and exploration with combat ive ever seen the way it cryptically reveals things to the player through the pages is really fun has my favorite puzzle in a game ever
has very few but very good bosses

#####

it is dangerous to go alone spoilerin a furry costumespoiler

#####

tunic is an absolutely amazing game that i just dont enjoy it delivers exactly what it wants to a classic zeldastyled adventure that leaves the player to figure out things for themselves if you want a game like that youll fall in love with it even if you dont its worth giving a go its not the game for me but it might be for you

#####

tldr  its a fun combo of zelda  dark souls if you like that i recommend it if you played video games in the 90s i really recommend it

im not entirely sure how to rate this game because the thing i love about it most is something that might only appeal to old people like me 

at face value its a pretty neat zeldadark souls mashup of a game it has some key components of each although its not quite as good as either at doing the things those games do well the thing that really makes me love it is the powerful sense of nostalgia i get from the ingame manual mechanic

when i was a kid the internet wasnt widely used there are a lot of ways that made everyday life different but the one thats relevant to this game is that if you were a kid that played video games it was pretty difficult to look up guides or secrets if you got stuck you just kept playing and banging your head against a wall until you figured something out i have vivid memories of sleepovers with friends doing this with zelda 2 star tropics zelda a link to the past and super metroid  we would get to a point where we were stuck and all we could do was stay up all night reexploring areas wed been to trying our different weapons on weird looking walls and consulting the instruction manual for any tips we could hope to use to progress 

this game is excellent at conjuring that same feeling instead of having a physical copy of the manual you locate the pages of it in game as you play the art in the manual brought back strong flashbacks to old nes and snes manuals  if you zoom in you can see the dots from the print there are things written in the manual in pencil and you can even see the game being played  behind it adjusted to look like its on an old crt screen there are a lot of moments where i got stuck in the game went to the manual dug through it and figured out what to do next it was an exciting feeling that i had forgotten about  most current games make your objectives clear and if youre stumped theres a website ready to tell you what to do next playing this game cold with nothing but the ingame instruction booklet really took me back to the basement of a friends house at 2 am trying to figure out what came next 

so heres the thing  i really enjoyed that experience but im not entirely sure if that would be an enjoyable experience for someone who it didnt trigger the nostalgia that i felt if you dont like that experience its a pretty cute zeldadark souls hybrid  not quite as good as either but its neat to see the two combined

#####

i really do think this game is amazing my top game of 2022 for sure i havent had this kind of experience since i first played super metroid as a kid for the first time if youre even considering buying do not look up a guide walkthrough or playthrough of the game as there are things that are better discovered while playing it yourself although do so if youre 100 stuck but i believe in you you got this also i know it says soulslike in the tags but dont expect this to be a hardcore sweatfest of perfecting every single thing in the combat cause it definitely isnt

#####

hes just a little guy

#####

really a fantastic game brings back the wonder and mystery of being a kid in those early nintendo games pre widely adopted internet and even pre being able to read you dont know why anything happens at first but piece together the larger picture bit by bit through exploration and experimentation

really an amazing concept and excellent execution

#####

when i first played fez in 2012 the world of indie games opened my eyes fez was one of those rare games that had everything from built in ancient languages numerical systems and otherworldly puzzles to figure out

tunic has since reminded me of these days by just having pure fun i was giggling throughout the first couple of hours the genius of tunic is that it tells you absolutely nothing discovering how to play the game how the world and mechanics work and solving puzzles is really really fresh

phenomenal so far especially since i didnt expect it to be a lite soulslike try to go in as blind as possible you wont be disappointed

#####

at first glance tunic is just a very nice and cozy looking topdown action rpg with metroidvania and soulslike elements that doesnt want to tell you much is not very hard to play and it reminds you of isometric iterations of the legend of zelda and of bastion but the further you proceed the more curious you may become about what that game really is and it turns out to be an excelent example of how videogame may provide its narratives with a lore instead of a plot
at start of this journey you wake up trying to comprehend whats going on what does the game want from you and what do you want from the game gradually finding pages of a manualbook in which not much is clear right away you finish no spoilers either being too lazy to solve all the riddles of the game and watching an ending that would not have been canonical or youre trying to get the hang of everything trying to translate made up language searching for visual patterns like in the game the witness which is fully consists only of puzzles and exploration disclose a lot of other secrets that are veryvery far from obvious or using guides and getting the true ending
i guess that people who played on a release had an exciting time trying to figure out all that stuff theres really big amount of what to discover and some things are left uncertain or unrevealed even after a year since the release so that game turned out to be a real hardcore but not as a soulslike but as a puzzlegame
ps macosversion is brilliant there were 2 crashes but other from that the port is awesome  at 4k resolution m1 pro chip managed to provide an average of 70 fps

#####

when she dark souls on my legend of zelda till i tunic

#####

if dark souls is zelda for adults then this is dark souls for kids also i couldnt solve the final set of secret puzzles on my own

#####

an excellent game that brought me back in my teenage i had a good and similar feeling than the one when i was playing a link to the past truly a gem

#####

this game is a very challenging puzzle if you go in blindfirst impression i was very cluelessno infono tutorial no anything first spawnbut as you dive in more and more into the game it gets more interesting in terms of lore and storylove it reminds of a certain game in the past spoiler fez spoiler

#####

i feel smarter now

#####

i am too dumb for this game
1010  one of my favorites

#####

i was lucky enough to play through this prerelease and let me just say tunic is a phenomenal experience 

you can play through the main story in probably around 1012 hours but as you may have noticed my clock currently sits at 52 thats because this game is an absolute joy to just sit with work at and discover the layers of secrets buried throughout this wondrous world nothing is handed to you you need to come to it learn it adapt to it and make the effort yourself if you do tunic will reward you handsomely 

tunic is finely tuned well balanced mysterious awe inspiring and beautiful to behold but the best part of tunic without a doubt is the way it handles discovery my piece on the game is still on its way and i might update this review with a link when its live but suffice it to say that unlocking the mysteries of tunic has been a top gaming experience of my 30 or so years of gaming fantastic job finji

edit heres my piece on the way tunic uses secrets so effectively no spoilers httpswwwgameshubcomnewsfeaturestunicandtheanatomyofavideogamesecret15659

#####

the marketing and reviews for this game are intentionally vague because its one of those everything is a spoiler exploration games thats not entirely true while obviously gameplay mechanics are best kept a secret to keep learning them fun there are some things worth knowing before you purchase this game
 it is indeed similar to fez but with much much greater focus on combat  and combat here is insanely difficult unforgiving brutal and often simply unfair if you have the patience reflexes and habits of a soulslike veteran you may enjoy it but otherwise expect all the frequent enemy engagements to feel incredibly frustrating you never truly lose your progress but do expect to get stuck for hours in the same place because you cant quite land a sequence of 100 dodges in a row
 however the game has a builtin godmode you can enable in options menu for complete invulnerability and i thank the developers for including it because theres more to this game than just the tricky combat and i would not be able to enjoy it otherwise
 almost all text in the game uses a complex madeup but welldesigned and coherent writing system and the game does not teach the player how to read it you do not need to comprehend it to 100 the game but if you also want to understand the entire lore all npcs and instructions then youll have to find your rosetta stone and decipher the texts on your own  and it is not just a simple cipher up to you whether that sounds appealing
 there isnt much of a story in the game yes it is thematic and there is a bit of lore you get to learn and explore but expect zero interactions with characters or evolving plot the world just is there dont expect any narrative to that cute foxs adventures
 while the game does offer a lot of fun metapuzzles they dont exactly scratch that the witness itch as some of the marketing tries to promise your progress isnt ever blocked by your lack of understanding but simply lack of information
 but more often than not your progress will be blocked by your combat skills you will often think these enemies are far too strong maybe im supposed to complete a different route first to which the game responds with a firm nope git gud

#####

this is a game id give my highest recommendation it is soulsy zeldalike and has a strange amount of outer wilds in terms of piecing together story and puzzles

#####

i wanted to play legend of zelda but then it turned me into a raving conspiracy theorist where every theory i had was absolutely correct excellent excellent game

#####

the combat of darksouls meets the exploration of zelda with no actual puzzles

the combat is dodge roll attacks attack with your slaprange sword and spam attack until it dies
bosses will be constantly moving so youre trying to reach the boss more often than actually attacking
alongside that endgame enemies reduce your max health whenever you get hit by them and the only way to regain that lost hp is by resting at the games version of a bonfire

you run around and explore you can two tools good for unlocking new areas to explore in one midgame the other late game

i only played through the main game no super secret ending or anything of the sort
i saw zero puzzles i can think of you kill enemies flip switches and proceed
any puzzles would be from figuring out what the hell the guidebook means translating text and spoiler using a fucking save file that gets added in as a meta puzzle piece for another puzzle spoiler

the art is great the music is great the story would be great for someone who actually wanted to translate whatever the fuck is being saidwritten the gameplay has much to be desired i suggest anyone wanting to experience the gameplay anyway to enable no fail mode after spoiler reaching the ziggaraut spoiler

#####

highly recommended try not to spoil yourself discovery and puzzle solving are the most important aspects of the game

#####

brilliant a game that gradually unravels itself but is always prompting you to tug at the threads thoroughly enjoyed it and had a blast feeling like a dummy for long intervals

#####

beautiful game especially the audio the comparisons to soulsborne and zelda are there but what came to mind most readily while i was playing tunic was that feeling of discovery and wonder i remember from fez

#####

its a strange mix of legend of zelda with dark souls cute art and good combat system and the controls are tight

if you jsut want to experience the story i recoment it for everyone on the other hand if you like smashing your head with puzzles secret hints and cryptic messages and marks then go nuts and try to get the 100

#####

great blend of loz and dark souls the entire game is an enigma leading you on just enough to make you smile in anticipation for the next puzzle

edit after 24 hrs of gameplay first review was after around 4 my roommate and i played this game 2 days straight while tripping we beat it together floor around us littered with sheets of scrap paper with strange glyphs drawn all over we refused to look at any guides and basically locked ourselves in a room to finish it this game is 1110 best game ive played in terms of art styledirection gameplay and story now i look at everything different this game warped reality i literally almost caught my house on fire because i was so absorbed into the puzzles that i left my food burning on the stove

im almost angry that the bar this game set for me is so high i suspect it will be a l o n g time before i play anything remotely close to this level of video game perfection

#####

thus far tunic has been an absolute delight and i must say it absolutely benefits from blind play 

if you havent had the chance to enjoy it read with the in mind ʲᵘˢᵗ ʳᵉᵐᵉᵐᵇᵉʳ ʰᵒˡᵈ ᵃ 



tunic reaches into the depths of my memories and pulls to the surface tiny me sat in front of a terrible crt with the ocarina of time game guide and plenty of wanderlust to explore a new world it brings to mind the intrigue and delight of super mario 64 or a link to the past even the character design menus and items call back to games like zelda 1 or final fantasy with a spectacular modern twist

 the trickle of manual pages found within the world are illustrated in a wonderfully accurate to memory 90s guide style complete with stains and pen scribbles the souls like combat is a nice balance of difficulty and strategy without making you feel like a naked baby lost in a forest infested with rabid bears even the fixed camera lends itself to the very creative map design which encourages you to touch every wall search every nook and poke your little fox snoot into every corner with deeply rewarding treasures hidden away in clever secret locations

i even found satisfying difficulty in the boss battles despite the soulslike combat matched up against agile foes with dangerously high speed and damage the game truly leaves you feeling that the odds are against you all the better for the reward when you beat them if you ask me compared to the handholding style of more modern games tunic allows you to learn the game and fail where you may without punishing you too harshly for learning

with very few flaws tunic has manage to capture all the delights of a retro game augmented by the polish and intrigue of a modern open world rpg if your only doubt in the game is the soulslike combat then i highly recommend grabbing it as even that can be disabled in the menu

though ive only just beaten the second main bossat the time of writing this i adore this game and would happily recommend it to friends

#####

ive been keeping an eye on this game for a few years now and im so glad it turned out to be this great even better than i had hoped in fact a fun satisfying zeldalike with outer wilds style elements where progressing through the game reveals things that you didnt know were there all along while the combat can be a little tough in the beginning you can get better equipment and a feel for it quickly solving puzzles and finding hidden paths is super satisfying and discovering the secrets buried deep in this game gave me many moments of wonder and awe i love this game absolutely worth ever dollar and i cant wait to play it through a few more times

#####

im 39 and this game brought me back to the feelings from my childhood
love the isometric view and low poly aesthetics
its even got some hard core ciphers in it that you dont need to complete to get through it
will probably come back and play this game every few years for that dopamine drip

so you think youre a cute little fox who wakes up on the beach of a mysterious new land ready for a delightful little zeldalike adventure well thats not exactly what youre going to get 

right at the beginning something feels off  both about the world itself and about the way the game feeds you information about what youre supposed to do next why does it feel so confusing just to find a sword and get out of the starting area why does the world feel so empty whos that spirit trapped in the hexagon prison why is the village abandoned and inhabited by moblins where the heck is your minimap what the heck is this weird language on the signposts are you supposed to be able to read this does it ever get translated 

most importantly why does it feel like the game is already beaten by someone else the grand adventure is already over and done and youre just following in some heros footsteps seriously whats going on why is the game designed like this

not even ten minutes into the game youll have so many hanging questions and guess what the game isnt going to tell you any of the answers theyre for you to figure out yeah its ithati kind of a game

if you want some answers maybe you can take a look at the games instruction booklet theres some valuable info in there about basic game controls like how to use certain items or lock onto enemies in combat just one problem  the instruction booklet is torn up into individual pages and scattered around the world good luck with that not even the games basic controls and mechanics are free info 

see this is no zeldalike its a puzzle game disguised as a zeldalike ive heard some people also call this a soulslike and while im not entirely sure i agree it does strongly remind me a lot of lamulana in the way it forces you to look at the world differently when youre desperate for answers its quite satisfying to slowly absorb and internalize the way the game hides its secrets and communicates its ideas and once you learn something theres a special kind of joy in realizing that it was ialwaysi true and its a lot of fun to imagine what you could do with certain information on a new playthrough if you knew it from the very start

the games artistry is what id call perfect the graphics are cute when they want to be hauntingly powerful when they want to be i especially liked the instruction booklet artwork a perfect parody of what its referencing the soundtrack is expansive and masterful though it leans more towards ambience than catchiness so there are only a few tracks that will actually get stuck in your head theres a deep story to unravel here too i dare not spoil anything but ill simply say that its got moments thatll strike hard its absolutely not what youre expecting and its a lot more than you bargained for

as for criticisms 

list
its obvious the designers put a lot of effort into keeping the combat system simple and unintrusive and while that works perfectly fine for exploring the world and solving the games ridiculous puzzles i find the combat a bit itooi uninteresting when its placed front and center like for certain boss battles 

its not faroff to say that every copy of tunic is personalized the game is built around letting you progress surprisingly far without having found key items or knowing basic information and while this imostlyi works i feel it sometimes goes a bit too far in withholding information from the player depending on certain paths taken its not always reasonable to expect the player to infer knowledge they were supposed to find ten hours ago it works a lot just not always

while i didnt encounter any intrusive bugs ingame the ui has some very strange bugs ranging from showing incorrect item counts on the pause menu to sometimes even loading the wrong file on the file select screen baffling 
list 

itunici obviously wanted to be a masterpiece and it came iso closei to being one though i feel it stumbles a little at the finish line its absolutely still worth experiencing if this looks the least bit interesting to you i invite you to dive right in it lasts about 20 hours and is guaranteed to blow your mind more than once just go in with the right expectations this is a puzzle game not a zelda clone if you want some toptier bragging rights see if you can get all the pages fairies and secret items without looking at a guide tip while you can get through the main story on your own better grab a pen and a notebook if youre going for any of the games bonus collectables youll need it

im very happy to have played this i know this ones going to stick with me for a while

pretty cool old school zelda game

h1 review tunic h1 

tunic is one of those games where theres more than meets the eye its full of mystery and intrigue and will have you sketching out puzzle solutions until youre swimming in random bits of paper while its a singleplayer game theres more fun to be had when sharing your experience with others so do just that work with friends and share your discoveries and help each other unlock the secrets hidden within the game 

its hard to refer to tunic as anything but a zeldalike so lets just get that out of the way it is immediately apparent that the game is heavily influenced by the zelda series and that same level of game design is the very core of tunic to call tunic a zelda clone however would be very unfair as the game goes so far beyond what a simple clone could ever hope to achieve 

like classic zelda games tunic doesnt offer much in the way of guidance its the players role to explore the world and find the secrets it holds a big part of that journey is hunting down pages to a manual thats largely made up of an unknown language but holds many tips and hints think back to the preearly internet when youd pour over a games manual looking for any clue the manual then is packed with secrets just waiting to be found leave no page unturned is my advice

the world of tunic is also filled with enemies and bosses that may have you thinking youve mistakenly loaded up elden ring bosses in particular always have a pattern learn it quick or youll be looking defeat dead in the eyes again and again thankfully theres an array of purchasable items and unlockable weapons to help you deal with stubborn enemies not to mention their uses when it comes to reaching chests you couldnt by normal means

a large amount of players time will be spent contemplating anything that looks like a pattern the level of complexity of the puzzles in this game knows no bound while a lot of the solutions may be simple the time it takes to reach that point can be torturous in a good way its been some time that i have been quite literally swimming in bits of paper with random puzzle thoughts and solutions doodled everywhere this aspect of the game is easily my favourite the sense of achievement you feel when something clicks and you have that aha moment 

one of the most important aspects of the game is that players work together to unlock the secrets within this game as part of the review process finji specially prepared a discord server exclusively for press for this very reason the discussion and collaboration with other people working together sharing bits of information and things that have been discovered made every second playing tunic all the more exciting im sure the majority of outlets would agree we never would have made it as far as we did without the help of everyone in that discord server i hope players will look for ways to help one other work out solutions rather than looking up the solutions outright youll only be robbing yourself of the experience

initial impressions of the graphics were a bit of a letdown the starting area felt rather dull with very little vibrancy to the world this is very quickly turned around as you begin to explore the various areas the game has to offer i was left in awe at some of the level design you experience further in theres a charm to the world it looks like its a diorama made of crafting foam and youre controlling a character moving about a physical model aesthetically it reminds me of a stopmotion animation short by mikey please called the eagleman stag which is definitely worth a watch

the soundtrack by lifeformed is perhaps the most forgettable part of the whole experience and thats a shame not because its bad in any way but in that the other elements of the game take on more of a focus in fact the soothing melodies really help to put you at ease while you agonise over how to solve the many secrets the game has to offer

h1 verdict h1

tunic is perhaps the most fun ive had with a game in a long time the depth within the puzzle design and the overall world has kept my brain whirring away whenever im not playing the collaborative effort of working out the more difficult puzzles has been a highlight ill probably not experience again for a long time this is matched wonderfully by the solid gameplay while i cant easily wipe my memory and start the game fresh what a joy that would be i can take comfort in the knowledge that tunic definitely holds more secrets than ive discovered during my time with it and that only makes me want to explore it more

this game gave me a headache

i love it 




in all seriousness this game is filled to the brim with secrets some that you probably cant even solve by yourself its extremely creative and even more insane the manual is extremely cool and was very fun to use it this game is a must if you enjoy puzzles and treasure hunting

#####

so far i can say that tunic is really a one of a kind experience it combines some classic zeldalike gameplay and exploration with the kind of 4thwall breaking mechanic of just looking it up in the manual

what makes it even better is that appart from a few sparse words the whole manual is written in a fantasy runelike language it really harkens back to the days where us as young gamers were looking through the manual trying to consume every little bit of the game we so very much enjoy without even being able to read in the first place but hey at least the pictures were nice i think the developer of this game knew exactly that feeling and designed a whole game around it and it just works out perfectly for that

tunic might be one of the most oneofakind games out there at least for a while for sure i highly recommend it to anyone who loves the feeling of exploration and renewing that sense of childlike wonder

#####

game is good

filled with some glorious aha moments via the unique way of presenting information super creative fun game with hints of nostalgia

#####

after gaining all achievements i can say that i really liked this game to the point that i think its one of the best games for me that ive played in recent years i found game design elements in it that i already enjoyed in fez and the witness but handled even better here

all the environmental puzzles and discovery aspects i found extremely satisfying but there are a couple of points id like to address

of the 36 achievements i managed to get 32 by myself and without any guidance or solution this to me is extraordinary since the game has many metatextualenvironmental puzzles that in other games are generally done in a worse way or that depend more on moon logic things that in other games would have me searching on google in no time here kept me ingame tunic is exceptional in giving you everything you need

of the other 4 achievements instead
 one took me almost 3 empty hours because i knew where it was but a very stupid detail and a red herring cryptic reference to understand which one im referring to alarmed birds distracted me
 i found one too demanding in the sense that it is the only one that requires understanding of the language that tunic uses i reached half of what was needed but for the last part i looked online for the translation cryptic reference to understand which one im referring to wet letters
 one i found just free hate on the player its something that is extremely missable in the first playthrough and asked me for an adhoc new game just to do it cryptic reference to understand which one i mean pew pew
 one is feasible as long as you play conservative cryptic reference to understand which one im referring to piggy bank the problem i have with this achievement is that i already play conservative in these games by default but the game at one point pushes you not to to the point that another achievement is achieved by partially letting go it pissed me off that i had to recover it in the adhoc run for the previous achievement since i was almost there in the main run but reached a point where it wasnt achievable anymore

these last two achievements go so much against what in my opinion is the spirit of tunic that it would have been a better game without them

apart from these small negative points imho as i said above this has been an amazing experience without making too many spoilers the yellow page has been one of the most satisfying videogame things in recent years the click in my brain when i realized what i had to do was cathartic i felt invested with otherworldly knowledge

tldr i consider this game an amazing experience

#####

like outerwilds mixed with dark souls

this might be the saddest negative review i have ever had to give this game is fantastic on so many levels the games visuals are absolutely fantastic the music is extremely relaxing and nice there are a lot of clever gimmicks and map design that are a ton of fun to explore and just the amount of surprises and genuine adventure feel is incredible

my main disappointment with the game comes from 3 problems

 combat can feel extremely simplistic until the game decides to throw massive hp pools and enemy counts at you at that point it starts feeling awkward and clunky those moments really showcase just how incomplete the combat can be and some enemy designs as a result feel infuriating to fight against

 do you want to experience what it is like to go on vacation to a foreign country without barely any guidance at all yes then this is the game for you a lot of the game is told in some weird in game language and the game developers put a ton of trust in the player to find their way through it all most of the time this actually works out and its a ton of fun but like 33  of my playtime was just spent running around trying to figure out what was the next place i had to go not only that but there are so many items that i still have no clue what they do those moments are super boring and it feels like a major interesting part of the game is just forever locked behind the gimmick of everything being unreadable

 my last main complaint is related to the ending some late game spoilers spoiler when you reach the end of the game you will notice that the game hasnt really ended yet the game heavily pushes you to look through the world and finish multiple puzzles to try and get some of the last central collectibles from this point onward the game is almost purely a puzzle game i personally really didnt enjoy this part of the game and this part also took a big chunk of my in game time and your reward for going through all of that didnt feel worth it at all for a game that constantly manages to reward the player in unique ways this was a huge slap in the face the same can be said for another special type of collectible the treasures i never would have finished either of the late game rewards if i didnt get help from a guide and even then i felt like all the genuine work i did put in just wasnt rewarded at all its extremely sad to see spoiler

in the end tunic is not what i looked for its not the 2d zelda like that i was expecting and the central gameplay kept pulling me in just to disappoint me right afterwards it is a fantastic game and i think many people will find enjoyment in it but i also think many players will come out the other side with a sour after taste it is the type of game where i wish i could give it a neutral review because i absolutely dont believe it deserves a negative review i just wouldnt actively recommend it either i think if you go into it expecting a bumpy ride you will find an absolutely adorable unique and very fun experience its just an experience that didnt manage to completely grab me

#####

atrocious combat completely spoils what is otherwise a gorgeous and actually quite interesting explorationbased puzzler but even the puzzling elements are made needlessly obtuse by the games refusal to actually tell you what the things in your inventory are 

it puts forward dark soulsstyle what if you lost all your moneyxp when you die combat as a key design element but then doesnt actually let you directly buy stat improvements with it instead hiding those behind a doubleconfirm where you can only upgrade if youve found a corresponding coupon to a given stat imagine if legend of zelda made you spend 200 rupees every time you want another heart container but also you still have to find the heart container combining that with staminabased rolling and blockingassuming you even can block the game actively hides the shield behind several challenges to actually get and a healing system so obviously inspired by estus flasks that it may as well have just called them that results in a player progression that doesnt just feel wonky it feels actively bent boss design feels overlypunitive with combos that punish you for failing to avoid the first hit by making it impossible to dodge any others and the gating of upgrades means you cant even grind past a challenging foe your own attacks feel unresponsive difficult to properly range and theres shockingly little variety to the point the only way the game can make nonboss enemies challenging is throwing big clots of them at you

theres some genuinely good ideas in here like the main collectible being pages of an actual game manual that give you additional context on the world and mechanics but its tied down and ultimately draggedunder by an unnecessary overfocus on combat that isnt rewarding to play and isnt satisfying to beat it wants to be zelda fez souls but in trying to serve multiple masters it ends up serving none of them very well at all

#####

a great game if you fondly recall memories of internetless age playing oldschool action adventure games learning tricks and secrets by reading signs recognising few words and analysing pictures within an enclosed intruction book of foreign language or you wish to experience such thrills then tunic is a game for you challenging but not unfair with subtle environmental story telling and fantastic atmospheric soundtrack
it also has those clever moments of wait i could do that since the very beginning which makes for an interesting more varied second playthrough

btw the complaints in latest reviews are ridiculous
especially about combat and exploration  in a game inspired by souls series and nes zelda with metroidvania type world
i do agree the game bwillb seem shallow and simple if youre gonna abandon it after first 2040 minutes which goes for most games with this stupid attitude

i never once heard complaints like this in hollow knight or straight up dark souls iwhat were people expecting devil may cryi

#####

it gives me a sense of my childhood while i couldnt even read i was playing games with curiosity ignorance and clumsiness after years experiencing the same feeling is quite nostalgic and happy

#####

ive spent the last few hours just translating the instruction booklet

#####

the legend of zelda 1 but even better do not look for walkthroughs at any point because the game tells you everything you need to know all the time even if it seems like it doesnt

#####

underrated gem

#####

best experienced completely blind phenomenal game

#####

this game is absolutely incredible  its a love child of zelda and soulslike games but dont let the soulslike tag turn you away  it is not nearly as hard and punishing it just emulates some of the features and a portion of the difficulty while still retaining the joy and wonder of games like link to the past

this game is truly about exploration  if you get stuck in a particular area you may have missed something before and you gotta find it  it doesnt hold your hand at all right from the beginning you are thrust into the world with no instructions no quest markers no dialogue nothing  you have to just explore everything just like an old school game  once you get the hang of the combat system and get some upgrades it really becomes an absolute blast  1010

#####

tunic is a great game that had a truly unique and amazing idea to the point i could call it revolutionary but the thing is its far from perfect

i did love it but i wont lie the combat is this ones achilles heel they try to make it punishing and slightly hardcore but it only ends up detracting from an amazing experience this games strong suit is how it deals with puzzles and game structure and such ideas are the reason i will recommend this game regardless of the issues

8510

#####

on the surface it is what it looks like
a charming fox zelda game with lots and lots and lots of puzzles demanding but still simple combat and an aesthetic that is just absolutely amazing
then you start to realise there is way more to this game and once that pandoras box is opened 
you will probably be busy for a while
and if you get everything in this game without looking anything up  you earn my respect 
or you are a dev p

tunic is well worth your time if you like the trailer  just go in with an open mind

#####

amazing game it is essentially an isometric soulslike with cool metroidvania elements and exploration the atmosphere the music the picture  all this is done very beautifully i really liked the journal and the info given by pieces combat system is a little lame due to poor autotargeting but you get used to it towards the end the game really challenges but this is its main disadvantage i almost quit because of the dumb enemies that reduce max hp and the tough arena near the end defeating the last boss without learning his moves perfectly is almost impossible you need to sweat a lot
also the game allows you to collect everything for platinum before the end without a guide by the way it is very difficult

#####

when you think adventure game tunic is the poster child its not just about the cute visuals but the whole experience of wandering around finding hidden gems and getting lost in the music its like the game version of a cozy sunday afternoon  immersive laidback and just a joy to play if youre into adventures that feel like a warm hug tunics got your back

#####

tunic is one of the best games in the genre that i have played when you think you get the gimmick you discover something new and remind yourself why you are playing several moments in this game are as profound as kicking down the ladder in dark souls

edit

tunic is in the top 2 games of all time

#####

zelda  fez  dark souls  amazing game

a love letter to games of old wrapped in modern mechanics and beautiful artstyle
if you like any of that youll love tunic its worth every penny

#####

just do yourself a favour and play this 

i think at least a decade had passed since a game made me eider grab the notepad or paint or anything to write or draw and solve puzzles with it where the puzzles were great and worth doing them i should recommend it just based on that but it has a lot more but i wont spoil it

#####

ive enjoyed this game way more than i expected such a beautiful game i really hope this game will get a sequel someday

#####

its like link but with a slower version of hollow knights progression system and maybe more depth i cant say much without spoiling but if you like puzzles zelda and hollow knight just play it its a bit grindy for the first few hours as you figure everything out because the game is the opposite of handholdy but once you start piecing things together it gets easier but the draw is definitely figuring out how to play i cant recommend it enough

h1the gist of ith1
this year has been very dry in terms of big triple a games but indies come and go by the dozens with a lot of average ones and some small good ones but every once in a while there is a surprise one you did not expect but hoped it would be good tunic is not only good but its probably the best indie game released this year a fantastic and mysterious zeldalike game that will hold your grip until the end 

 uthe good partsu
fantastic level design
gameplay mechanics are being revealed progressively in a fun and smart way
great atmosphere

uthe bad partsu
a bit short
true ending is unrewarding tedious and pointless unless youre a completionist

h1storyh1
alright this will probably be the shortest proper review i ever made for a finished game the gist of the whole game story and gameplaywise is discovery if youve played any soulslike games or games like hobrecommended u play that as well the story is presented in a very obfuscated way you wake up on a beach you walk to a temple and you kinda sorta figure out what you have to do that is it 

the more you progress the more things get revealed to you and even as you reach the end some things remain unclear its not something you havent seen before like i said if youve played soulslike games its similar it wont blow your mind nor will it make you cry none of that is found in tunic however it is nice to see on rare occasions games telling stories through the environment rather than directly in your face tunic excels at that its a shame that the endings are not that great at least in my opinion i watched the true ending on youtube and i still felt unsatisfied still sometimes the journey matters more than the destination 

story rating 7510

h1gameplayh1
this is the part where i cannot tell you anything because the entire gameplay and its mechanics are based on you finding out how and what to do 

all i can say is the combat is pretty basic you hit stuff you dodge stuff and you block stuff its staminabased combat like any soullike game and dying makes you lose some of your currency which you can spend on upgrades and stuff puzzles bosses secret paths and so on and so forth are all in there that is all i can say the rest is up to you to discover and i can tell you it was very impressive how they designed the reveal of said gameplay mechanics 

its not an easy game do not let the looks fool you it will feel incredibly overwhelming at first but the game will always find a way to ease you in its brilliant gameplay you find something and then youre like aha and then more stuff gets revealed and it just becomes more natural to you you evolve with the gameplay  

gameplay rating 910

h1audioh1
not much to say here either no voice acting so the game revolves around its sound effects and music and they are quite as good as everything else it does the music feels charming yet scary it has this synthish vibe to it that fits so well with the whole mystery everything here feels well designed with no cut corners which is rare to see in an indie game

audio rating 8510

h1graphics performance and tech analysish1
once you start playing the game youll feel overwhelmed and that is due to its insane level design and how masterfully crafted it is its a topdown metroidvaniazeldalike kind of map which are rare these days youll find tons of secrets and shortcuts and paths that will make you question how the hell did they create all of this 

the atmosphere is varied with lots of unique locations from charming to dreadful zones nothing is ever the same in tunic techwise the game is very pretty for an indie game its nothing super fancy but it does its job very well and it also runs smoothly i had no bugs or issues except maybe a crash or two 

graphics performance and tech analysis score 910

h1conclusionh1
dont look up videos besides the official trailer dont read too much about the game just get it and start experiencing its difficult beauty its a short experience wish it had more zones more mechanics and whatnot but despite that its still an amazing game and so far my indie of the year 

h1final score 8510h1

this game is awesome simple as that

ive been waiting for this game for the past couple years and it didnt disappoint at all its been a long time since ive been so drawn into a single experience that i simply dropped everything else i was playing at the time to solely focus on this one game this brings back the sense of wonder exploration and mystery one would find on early zelda titles such as link to the past

the map slowly reveals itself to be much bigger and connected than what youd expect even after you think you explored everything once you visited every single area you still find nooks and crannies that hide either secrets or secret passages to seemingly unrelated areas you then realize that many of the locations can be accessed much earlier in the game if youd just new where those passages were speedrunners will have a blast trying to optimize this run over and over

i admit the soulslike description might be slightly misleading i also went in with the thought that dying would have dire consequences and git gud would be the way to go however dying causes you to lose a fixed amount of only 20 coinsrupeesmunies whatever one can call those xd and you can get them back the same way as in souls game by returning to your last death location 

the thing i can call very soulslike are the bosses their fights surely stand out when compared to the regular mobs and few high level mobs you may encounter the only shame is the small amount of boss fights this certainly marks the games exploration and puzzle solving as its high points which is great dont get me wrong the only thing i want to make clear with these last two paragraphs is that if youre looking for a cute dark souls this is not it 

in the end the combat is fairly straight forward and controls are very reliable theres certainly room for customization to adapt to different play styles there dodging blocking magic consumables and even passive abilities that you can find hidden away you can definitely play the game in more than one way however different mechanics are introduced at different times most magic are unlocked mid game so the early game is very simple combat

as the highlight of my review i definitely want to talk about the puzzles but not only that as how the world houses so many secrets in plain sight so when you find them youre in for some great mind blows the booklet you unlock pages for throughout the game is one of the most amusing mechanics there is you get everything out of order but mostly in the way you need to move things along after you get most of the pages youll feel like a conspiracy theorist xd going back and forth finding more and more connections personal recommendation keep a notepad or some sheets of paper close youll likely need to take notes yourself if i am to compare the quality of exploration and puzzle solving of this game i would put it on par with the witness or even fez maybe this game is what fez ii could have been still sad about it to this day d 

closing remarks i want to thank everyone at tunic team and finji for the great experience this game provided i definitely recommend it 

#####

this game grows as you play it it starts simple and i mean simple but as you go it keeps growing into more and more

for example i really love the instruction manual when you find the first page of the thing its in another language you can work a couple things out but not much as you find more pages you learn new things some older parts of the manual get translated maybe you figure some stuff out on your own it really feels natural to me and i like that

visually the game is excellent again simple but beautifully done

this game has surprised me i was deceived by it its like it started as a few seeds but grew up around me into a wild forest while i wasnt noticing

#####

this game delivers a journey this journey youll only go through once every other time youll see not a journey but a reminiscent path youve already lit familiar and bittersweet yet devoid of any more mystique or doubt youll see your previous footsteps the ones that brought you to the end of it before youll wish you could wipe them away and try to find your way again

it is a wonderful personal journey lovingly put together thoughtfully tailored and laid out for you to get lost into yet ultimately surmount it is a journey made with you in mind and only you

you owe it to yourself to go through this journey alone itll seem like theres no way out be patient youll make it through find your way at your own pace youve got every answer you need right there already take your time dont let it intimidate you make each step your own again this is a chance youll only get once

#####

on the surface i would describe it as a links awakening soulslike the art and music is all great and the gameplay is tight and familiar

i really enjoyed the way the game opens its secrets to you by way of collecting pages of the instruction manual which details everything from the basics of how to play the game up to including hints and details on how to solve some mind melting puzzles

i will say that the game also includes some largely optional puzzles that approach obtuse and esoteric puzzles that would not be at home in a zelda game but rather in something like the witness  if that sounds great to you then you will enjoy it all the more if not you can more or less skip all or most of it

outside of being a bit turned off by those kinds of puzzle mechanics and what i perceived as balance issues around certain bosses and areas which led to more frustration than fun at times its a great little 1015 hour adventure

#####

a true gem tunic is a delightfully clever title that doesnt just pay homage to the golden games of years gone by but manages to transcend them and stand on its own

from the moment you drop into the world to the moment you end the game tunic manages to delight every step of  the way in the beginning it feels like a true homage to those games of the past with some clever ways of bringing some ancient concepts into contemporary times one of the most nostalgic and important concepts the game introduces is the game manual on your adventure youll come across various pages to the games manual that you will stitch together at first blush the manual is novel but doesnt seem like it will teach you much you couldnt figure out for yourself it seems like it will be this games version of collectibles its a really nifty spin on the concept but as you progress further you start to realize that without the manual you are doomed to just feel your way around the world and _hope_ you figure things out very unlikely in this game and just so its said and noted somewhere the developers very clearly put a nod to this manual concept in their own store page for the game when they mention rebuild a sacred book and introduce the manual concept they foreshadow the good ending by imploring you to find all the pages nicely done devs

but thats one of the most interesting things about tunic it reminds you of those days gone by when you were a kid and couldnt fully understand the game you were playing maybe you were too young to read or maybe too proud to consult the manual maybe you just didnt have the attention span to be bothered to read what you were supposed to do tunic manages to capture that feeling you had as a kid playing games that you didnt really fully understand but enjoyed anyway tunic manages to achieve this in a variety of ways including the use of a made up language that makes it next to impossible to fully read the manual or even the dialogue and signage in the game you might get a key word here and there in isolation but you dont have the context to make that much sense of it it really lends itself to that feeling of being a kid trying to make sense of the game you really wanna play and beat hell even just pausing the game and seeing the game shift to a crt effect helps add to the nostalgic effect

beyond just tugging on heart strings and relying on nostalgia tunic manages to stand on its own its a unique game in the modern age that doesnt hold your hand at all and if anything pushes you away to figure it out on your own exploration is extremely rewarding and you feel exceedingly clever as you figure the game out every discovery you make feels important from items to locations and even the enemies you feel a sense of danger as you work your way through the world and you never truly feel all that safe even after you feel like you know the game and its mechanics this is further relayed through the games excellent use of environmental storytelling

tunics use of environmental storytelling is top notch in the beginning you are washed up on a beach and wander into familiar adventure game settings like meadows and forests with some basic enemies that arent all that threatening as the game progresses the mood takes on more sinister tones of course most games do this but what makes tunic stand out here is how the mood matches the increasing sense of danger that the world presents that and how it manages to use this sinister progression to tell a story about the world itself without going into too much detail as you progress through the game it manages to put a clever twist on what is really going on under the adventurethemed veneer what initially might be chocked up to as just the magic of the world is explained in an unexpected way

tunic is a topnotch indie gem that achieves that sense of adventure that games used to give you youll need to explore youll need to pay attention youll need to backtrack experiment and figure things out for people who just want to play a game that takes you from atob i think it will be frustrating  there is a bit of struggle throughout the game as you try to make sense of everything  but thats the point and overcoming the challenges presented is extremely satisfying if youre someone who looks things up regularly for games like this youre only robbing yourself of the experience by doing so tunic is at its best when youre piecing it together one page at a time

#####

started to play it right after elden ring the same day looking to relax a little bit bad idea

#####

7 years in the making and it shows beautiful game perfect music and incredible gameplay a zelda for adults

#####

tunic is an impeccably made puzzle box of a game most unlocks come in the form of knowledge  moments of holy shit i can do that that make you look at the whole game world in a new way its a joy to unpick and the pacing of discovery is perfectly done

#####

while charming tunic suffers from being too repetitive the first 2 hours great i was enjoying it and even started to recommend it to friends since i wanted to show them a hidden gem seeing as this only has about 100 reviews atm not sure about how many when you read this 

after 2 hours well it started to go downhill

everything started to look more as a copy of other zones and while i do really appreciate the way the game drops small hints about whats going on and whats happening as you explore it wasnt nearly enough to justify the monotonous and extremely dull combat loop almost to add insult to injury the game is extremly linear which makes the previously mentioned dull combat loop more and more noticable every minute you play 

ive a been playing for almost 7 hours and its just been getting less and less fun its gotten to a point where i only feel the need to play as a means to justify this very overpriced purchase 

of course this is all very negative and i do want to shine a light to some pretty good points that stuck with me the music is really good even with it just looping until you switch to an area with a different track also the gamebook menachic is very original and charming something that i now wish would be implemented to a bunch of other games as a sort of challenge mode 

but sadly none of this really matters as the game utlimatly fails at being the most important thing

fun

#####

fox of the year this game means everything to me

#####

spoiler free

im liking this game a lot so far very nicely polished the controls are responsive everything has a nice calm relaxing ambiance
the music is good too hints of undertale and night in the woods but definitely doing its own thing

ive never played a single zelda game but im enjoying helping this brave fox around the world

1010 am happy to pick up that stick again

edit the more i play this game the more im drawn in by its cute cleverness i dont want to give away almost anything about the game discovery is part of the fun 

i feel like this is an instant classic i like it so much im going to also buy a copy for a friend because of how strongly i want to support this type of game

edit 2 explore explore explore    i also really really love the manual

edit 3 this game is way more extensive than i was expecting between the polish and the fun and the beauty and how much there is to see i feel its well more than worth the asking cost too

#####

amazing game if you liked fez you are going to love this one as well
some riddles are almost impossible i would recommend you to pay attention to as many details as you can during the game it will help you solve the riddles faster

#####

fox

#####

absolutely astonishing game i fell in love with it instantly and it was really hard to put down the music level design and beautiful animations made this game an amazing and fun experience plus theres challenging combat great boss battles and enjoyable puzzlefilled exploration

one of the best games ive played on my steamdeck

#####

tunic is an experiance your tl dr is 

pro  
phenomenal atmosphere
interresting worldbuilding
fun puzzles

con 
terrible camera
bad combat
ultimately falls flat on its own ideas

spoilers ahead

i walk away from tunic with two very important things 

 a better understanding of my own taste in storytelling and world building

 an appreciation of how easy it is to take a good idea too far and ruin everything

i loved the day i spent with this game initially the game felt charming the world fun and interresting as i progressed and found more pages of the game manual and observed various elements in the world i slowly began to piece together more and more of what was going on i felt vindicated when things i felt were wrong proved themselves to be impossibly fucked i felt smart as i pieced out the events that were to unfold and used tools in ways the game didnt expect me to before i was supposed to getting glimpse of the world and information ahead of when i should have

and this is where i stop being nice because thats the best this game has to offer and everything else is a display of failing to payoff the setups youve put down the main issue with the game is the camera for an isometric view locked camera game this game moves toouch during combat which causes loss of proper control at times and makes cinematic boss fight impossible to follow properly its control with target swapping is inaccurate at best and will kill you at worst this lead me to encounter design basic enemies will follow you so long as they can and you do not cross load screen which will lead you to fight some in tight hallways and with unfavorable elements of decor blocking your view you will fight ranged mobs and be unable to reach them because a melee mobs body has yet to despawn and has full colision you will fight bosses that you do not target properly because your main focus is too far and the game will lock you on to a small flying enemy keaving you open to said bosss hit you were planning your defense against you will get tricked by perspective a lot and none of it felt fun or fair the twists and turns of this camera system was the main cause of death up until the end and never stopped being an issue

but not the main issue spoilers ahead for the endgame

tunic ultimately falls impossibly flat for me because it makes the cardinal sin of wanting you to recontextualize the entire game at the end but does so by giving you a new tool youve never used for the entire game and giving it an impossibly annoying use  the dpad the final strech of this game is an easter egg hunts where you are now armed with knowledge of what the dpad does for the final pages of the games manual to tell you the full story and what you are supposed to do the issue this meccannic was never even remotly used and this idea of contextualizing something in a new light was used with praying early in the game not once during the entire game were you shown or asked to use the dpad and yet by the end imputs of both small and unreasonably long chains of up up down down left right left right style imput will become the main gameplay because the devs reduces your stats to 23 the starting values and expect you to power back up to fight the final boss you will stumble around for more and more codes to put in more and more places for pages and restoring your powerups for the final showdown and this sucks impossibly so the game did this better earlier by recontextualizing the action button with prayer telling you it affect pillars then you notice the pillars are basically fuzes for those cool magic lines and they power your save points and these other devices so your pray at those and find the teleportation system new context for something you had since the start but didnt knew about and praying also enbales other interractions you figure out naturally based purely on observation and knowing you can pray so why does the dpad gimmick feels so shoedin because its indeed there for the entire game and yet is only used for the last hunt and maybe speedrunning as you will find item duplicates behind secret doors with the reward of  already own one and leaving without anything 

overall id say tunic has an interresting idea its fun to piece out a world you literrally cannot understand for the longest time and understand what is going on and what everything truly is but its camera makes fights an annoyance or horrendously frustrating its puzzle rely on introducing a stupid gimmick at the end that makes little sense it has charm but difficulty reaches the levels of simply ignoring enemies and going from checkpoint to checkpoints at times wouldi reccomand tunic no if the difficulty by the end was tuned down a smidge the camera issues were fixed and the last strech of puzzles werent just more and more dpads imput until you reach the 50some code for the final door or if the last powerup that restore your attack power and made the final fight not take forwver wasnt locked behind the true ending path then maybe but as is great first half terrible stumble downhill past the artillery boss

#####

i bought this game with the expectation that i was getting into an experience like deaths door another fantastic isometric adventure game that takes cues from the souls genre however while i was right i was also very wrong tunic is a very well tuned experience from the combat thats hard enough to keep  your attention to some of the best puzzle solving ive done in years tunic will serve as a reminder to what games can be if you only expect unforgiving combat youll be disappointed as other games will have much more punishing combat but if the atmosphere and storytelling of souls games gets you this will still be a very enjoyable game the big puzzle a lot of reviews mention is very much worth your time itll take a moment but once the pieces start coming together it is an awesome feeling and worth doing without guides hard recommend

#####

from a design standpoint i already see a lot of interesting and unique game mechanics in tunic at the time of writing this review i have only put about 2 hours into this game i look forward to finding more hidden mechanics and design elements as it stands i feel as though i can safely recommend tunic for its game design if nothing else the game also sports beautiful visuals and good music it works in its setting and succeeds at what it tries to do this is truly a passion project i feel it is also worth mentioning that this seems like the kind of game that works best if you go in blind i wont say why i wont say more i wont say less just go in blind

#####

tunic is one of the best indigames lately as an old school gamer that close to her 40s and grew up with the very first zelda game i can tell that tunic is really recapturing the magic of these old games and even improves on it

the game is amusingly adorable very pretty undeniably clever and also extremly difficult i am glad there is ingame options to make battle for everyone manageable i enjoyed every moment of this game the puzzles the manualmechanic the world and the sometimes dark places you go the dreamlike graphics and the adorable characters you meet and not to forget the amazing secret ending

doing my second playthrough while writing this  this game needs to be a new genre which i call singleplaywithfriends 3

#####

this reminds me of the first ever zelda game on nes its beautiful game that is recommended for explores and people that what a true challenge this game does spoon feed you any tutorials and its up to you to figure out the clues and find amazing secret locations but this game is also brutally hard but there are settings that can help those that dont have lightning reflexes just stop reading this and play this game now

#####

you owe it to yourself to play this  its a masterpiece

#####

1010

its fantastic do yourself a favor play it and stick with it you can do it its pretty clearly designed to be done without outside help take your time theres no rush if you get stuck feel free to break off and explore elsewhere you will eventually find what you need to go forward whether you need an item or info this is the kind of game where you should definitely break out a notepad to help you along though 

exactly what you hope for in a game where it teaches without lengthy tutorials you can very easily get lost and forget what your doing but the objectives are so simple that remembering what you need to do and where you need to go is painless pins difficulty at not too hard but not too easy either its big but not empty feeling filled but not so much it bogs you down its a game with appealing visuals that doesnt distract from exploration and doesnt make you second guess where boundaries are the biggest challenge is probably trying to find every item and treasure in the game good luck if you try though its for sure doable

#####

a love letter to old games developers and dedicated players
this game is hard like really hard the combat can be frustrating the puzzles can take multiple hours and some bosses will make you scream but the game is even more rewarding an extremely well designed game that makes you figure everything out by yourself while giving you the help you need 
i had to look up a lot of this game and i know that hindered my experience but it may have taken me 34x the amount of time to figure some of things out the only thing i dont like about this game is that you can feel so lost at times and have almost nothing to help you out in the game having to open the map every single time and flip to the right page is annoying at times but the pages of the guide are amazingly done 
get this game if you love puzzles fighting zelda and a challenge

#####

went from good to insanely good

#####

this game does a lot right and a lot wrong the art the atmosphere the way the world unfolds and the puzzles are all great but the combat is beyond awful all the animations lock you in for too long the dodging blocking and swinging are all at odds with eachother making them feel like you are wrestling the character to get it to do what you want while bosses spam attacks with almost no downtime sometimes i got to the second phase of the last boss which was a slog just to get there and i gave up i want nothing more to do with the game until they tweek the combat

#####

one of the best games that i have played in quite some time

#####

dont be fooled by this cute little fox tunic is  clearly not what it looks like 

behind its zeldalike aesthetic its a ruthless game that takes its inspiration from the souls games while i would say its not at the same level of precision the gameplay is unforgiving and rewarding

when you progress in the game youll discover a lot of mysteries and secrets and they clearly are what make this game shine
the game manual system that helps your progress is  a wonderful idea it clearly involves the player and contributes a lot to the sensation of reward and progression i highly suggest that you do not spoil yourself 

played entirely on the steam deck it runs perfectly

a pleasure to sink hours in i recommend 

#####

absolutely stunning game in every aspect its hard for me to find a game that catches my attention so much that i cant wait to keep playing it as soon as i get off work or wake up but this game has done it for me its seriously a masterpiece best game ive played the past several years

#####

top tier puzzle platformer if you enjoy the slow burn of discovery and very challenging bossfights

#####

i dont usually have a top favorite from a group of something but i can 100 say that this hit the top of the list for the best game i have ever experienced and played

 ost genuinely magical
 graphics stunning
 gameplay difficulty hits just right
 encryption one of a kind
 puzzles all with maybe 12 endgame exceptions are very much possible without looking anything up
 feature of an old manual brilliant with epic art and clever secrets

simply unforgettable take my life savings a true 1110

#####

dont let its cutesy aesthetic fool you this is a damned souls game with a zelda inspired flair

#####

its basically legend of hyper light souls fez

with lots of puzzles too

1010

#####

tunic deserves all the praise it has received

the puzzles introduced later in the game gave me entire new perspectives on the game in a way i never thought i could have tunic also engages with game manuals in a way that felt new and interesting something i havent seen since startropics and turned up to the absolute extreme

#####

not my cup of tea  they mashed together your first time playing the original legend of zelda and dark souls at once  i get the concept of discovering manual pages and figuring things out eventually but the fact the item names never fill in sucks  i beat the game and still have no clue what all my ability cards do or what half my items are for  tunic wants a soulslike feel but the combat feels clunky and the parry mechanic is terrible  bosses are forgettable and late game just swarms you with mobs of enemies that dont separate

#####

ive waited for this game ever since its first e3 showing and man the wait was worth it

the game is cute charming and most of all fun the puzzles feel rewarding to solve and the combat is tough but fair i dont want to go too deep into it because the magic is in the discovery if you love zelda type games please give this game a shot you wont be disappointed

#####

very nice and charming mix of zelda and dark souls a bit cryptic  maybe a bit too cryptic for its own good but still doable

just a bit short for the 30 get it on sale

#####

do you know the feeling of this game was made for me 
to realize that everyone else also feels that way
thats when you know you have made something truly special
a masterpiece and the best game i have played all year

#####

codetunic might look like a cutesy zeldaclone but dont let the screenshots fool you tunic does not only offer more than enough original ideas on its own its also surprisingly challenging to the point of frustration at timescode

itunici might be described as a combination of ilegend of zeldai which early titles were named an inspiration by the games creator and idark soulsi but that wouldnt do the game justice itunici is way more than just a simple copy it understands what makes its inspirations great and isnt afraid to add its own elements resulting in an experience that captures the wonders as well as the risk of exploration

youll start the game with nothing your fox protagonist is waking up on a strange island and its up to you where to take it from there little by little youll explore the world solve riddles face enemies and boss fights collect items and so on those familiar with the videogames inspiring itunici might quickly have a hunch of what to do and where to go at least in the beginning but youll quickly discover that you need more than that youll need the games manual

they have become incredibly rare nowadays but most of us probably remember that physical videogames used to come with manuals while the boring ones only showed off controls and whatnot the better ones provided a look into the games world and lore as well as giving tips and hints as to how to beat the game similarly many solutions to itunicis puzzles can also only be found by reading through the games manual which explains how certain mechanics work for example however in a great twist the ingame manual is completely empty  its pages scattered across the virtual world of itunici only found by exploring every nook and cranny

its a great idea and easily what i like most about itunici while you might be able to technically do most things from the start its only by piercing together the ingame manual that you learn about what your protagonist is truly capable of or where an entirely new area might be hidden its a joy to find new manual pages and figure out how they cryptically tell you what to do next the manual is lovingly created even featuring small notes someone scribbled on pages using a pen  just like you might have done in the past

of course itunici isnt easily beaten by simply finding the right manual pages first of all most of the manual is using a fantasy language with unique characters  english words are only used here and there second the manual pages are found out of order and only offer a clear path at the beginning of the game and third itunici can be incredibly challenging

this refers to both the exploration  puzzles as well as the combat in terms of puzzles  exploration while i managed to get to the normal end of the game just fine i admit to consulting a wiki to get to the true end  i simply never found some of the required hidden places but even just getting to the normal end didnt always go as well as i hope it would while i had a general idea of where to head next throughout most of the game i unfortunately got stuck a few times i guess this might be the nature of itunici which is about thorough exploring but having to check entire areas to see if you have missed a single critical path might not be fun for everyone all the time

what might biggest obstacle in itunici for many though is the combat reminiscent of idark soulsi  a stamina bar potions to restore your health bonfires as well as losing your spirit upon death giving you a chance to recollect your lost souls while itunici goes easy on new players in the beginning the difficulty quickly ramps up and especially boss fights can be quite demanding while there are accessibility options to help those struggling with the combat itunici unfortunately doesnt offer any difficulty settings for those who want to set up their experience from the beginning of the game

while the combat is snappy and works most of the time its easily the most uneven part of itunici the difficulty curve is really uneven towards the end of the game making me wonder sometimes if i really was in the right area i was or if i had overlooked an easier area to head to first i didnt and while you might find new items throughout your journey combat resiliently relies on quick reflexes and the same few weapons up to the end many helpful items are also onetime use only making a failed boss fight attempt even worse as youll have to get by with even less help during the next attempt alternatively you could grind currency to resupply yourself at shops but thats more work than fun

furthermore while you get access to three quick buttons x y and b on an xbox controller for example one of them will usually be blocked by your sword for close quarter combat and while you might be able to change those quick items even during combat doing so a takes some time and b doesnt pause the game so if you used up all your bombs and quickly want to put health items on the same slot youll risk getting hit  or well considering how relentless some bosses are you will get hit even if youre incredibly fast at changing items making the game slowdown or even pause while changing items wouldve been great  or simply go full idark soulsi and offer quick access to multiple items instead of three

lastly the enemy ai sometimes bugs out this sometimes works in favor of the player like a boss not attacking and merely moving for some time but it can also work the other way around shots of enemies hitting you through walls or enemies only attacking you from afar instead of ever coming close considering itunici doesnt offer a far range weapon thats not limited by mana this can prove quite troublesome

but really apart from the combat woes phew that last boss  and minor exploration hiccups why was getting here to incredibly obtuse i really enjoyed my time with itunici it looks great even if the cute art style is slightly misleading exploration is really rewarding and though its not on the same level as metroidvaniagames checking every corner usually does come with some benefits piercing together the manual and then figuring out whats next is really fun and a feature id love to see in other games as well

overall itunici is a great game for people who love exploring  both the rewards and the obstacles enemies puzzles considering its surprising difficulty though make sure that youre up for the task as well  or else especially the final stretch of this 10h adventure might prove very frustrating

#####

im having a blast so far have you enjoyed zelda fez deaths door maybe even dark souls this game scratches all of those itches and the love that went into making this game my word polished challenging rewarding fun

#####

tl dr  
beautiful visuals 
smooth game play 
no hand holding or way points 
very good and well worth the money

been waiting for this game a long while where to start

visually the game is great simple and smooth vibrant and intriguing everything from the world to the amazing old school game informer style game manual that has a level of polish that is just so endearing the world building is phenomenal with a strong focus on show dont tell with text being mostly made up of odd runes that seemingly make no sense i loved this in the early game trying to uncover the mystery text in the later game i found it annoying not because it was bad but because id become so interested in the world that i just wanted to read everything i really hope that the text is actually readable and not just some random runes someone smarter than me can hopefully figure it out i need to know more 

speaking of more the game is on the shorter side took me 11 hours with some stumbles at 4 am i really wish there had been 1 more act in the middle i have so many more questions then answers but it is a very polished and fun experience a great 10 hours is worth more to me then a drawnout 60 hour game

the sound design is also good music going from whimsical to soothing all the way down to some downright chilling scores in certain areas the monsters are fine too with a few stand outs that remind me of horizon zero dawn

while the game itself isnt super hard some difficulty comes from the lack of hand holding youre in a new world figure it out here are some clues and some basics now put it all together most things are easy enough to piece together with the ingame manual as a visual aid at least to get you through the story there are some that will challenge the more dedicated controls are simple and smooth i played with an xbox controller everything responds well and just works ok well the parry can be a bit finicky to me but other than that its great

over all its a great game that is well worth the price its sadly hard to find a wellpolished game like this nowadays
please make a second one dlc or prequal

#####

im just a few hours in past the beginning area

tunic is the first game since the legend of zelda a link to the past that has made me feel a childs sense of wonder and joy in exploring a world and the secrets within the ingame instruction booklet collected pagebypage as you explore is the keystone of the experience it is charming mysterious and full of secrets the guidance it provides is just enough to force the player to pay attention and to thus feel ownership when overcoming challenges large and small

1010 highly recommend

#####

there seems to be a new genre of game that has popped up recently where part of the gameplay is figuring out how to play the game so far i have been enjoying the trend especially with this game  im guessing the game was purposefully designed like this but the first few hours felt like a mediocre zelda game maybe its to throw off the players once you get far enough you realize that its not just another zelda clone

the mysterious booklet is the most important part of making any sense of the game it would be great if the booklet automatically marked sections as solved as you play through the game or something else similar to the outer wilds logs that said the feeling of deciphering what each hint means in the instruction booklet was incredibly satisfying

most puzzles were genuinely enjoyable to solve while a few did feel a bit repetitive one of my main critiques was that for the longer puzzles it would have been helpful to receive some indication of whether i was making progress or not 

i did have a significantly hard time with the spoilersoundspoiler puzzle despite understanding the steps needed i couldnt seem to make sense of the different spoilertonesspoiler and ultimately couldnt solve it it would have been helpful if there had been clearer distinctions between each spoilertonespoiler 

i recommend this game to zelda or puzzle game fans who want a new gaming experience

#####

deceptively simple finishing the game is simple enough but uncovering the secrets can range from satisfying to rather ridiculous graphics gameplay and soundtrack are all fantastic i thought the price was steep at first but ive got my moneys worth if you are looking for a mix of zelda and other puzzle games this game is for you

#####

a solid action game that also glues on one of the most unique and immaculate puzzle experiences ive played in a long time if either one of those interests you this is worth a go if those both sound great this could be one of your new favorite experiences

#####

edit this game deserved an award in 2022 and got nothing unbelievable

from what i have played so far its been really good this game might look cute and charming but is not easy this isnt exactly a follow the story kind of game you need to explore figure out what you need to do and deal with enemies that might overwhelm you i guess there are some menu options to make the game easier but i havent tried them i like to play how the game is meant to be played

for me it feels like an old game especially the first zelda game where you had to find out stuff on your own unlike most new games this one doesnt really teach you on how to play right away you need to learn and seek out the pieces yourself to complete the guide book to understand how some mechanics work

the movement is very nice to control the combat is a bit heavy feel on my side cant cancel an action once u are performing it just need to get used to it
my only complaint so far was the enemy ai they will chase you no matter where you are i was struggling with 3 enemies so i threw a fire bomb over the edge which hit them and they chased me all the way around which resulted in my death lol i keep restraining myself from using some items because i always think i will need them later but i feel like i should honestly use them more often
using statues will heal you but also revive every enemy you have defeated which basically means that no matter what happens you will have to go through whatever challenge is ahead without going back or you will have to do it all again

i honestly missed playing something like this will see how far i will be able to go haha

 updated review 

now that i have played further into the game i can say that the first impression of mine was kinda wrong
i have way more hours into it most of it was because i was running around place to place and trying to think how to solve the puzzles

the first part of the game will probably be the most peoples playthrough an adventure game defeating enemies exploring the map for items conquer the challenges and beat the final boss which if you know what you are doing unlike me who gets lost every so often it shouldnt take you that long to beat the game besides the heir i did not spend so much time on the other bosses the only reason i struggled with the first one was due not realizing you could increase your stats if you strategize your equipment cards and further explore areas for the sweet bonuses you should be fine 

i believe the money spent on the game comes mostly from the 2nd part the holy cross puzzles i will reccomend using a pen and paper for this part of the game since some of them can be very long to remember

the games manual is a very important tool if not the most important item of the whole game try spending some time to figure out what its trying to tell you without it you will not go far
i like the weird language made up for the game it gives it a really nice touch however i would appreciate if it would be possible to have some better hints  indications in certain cases because this game is at its best when you can solve it on your own with the information the game provides
im aware that the games language is made that way on purpose its one of the things that makes the puzzles work by translating the text the answers would probably be given to you if the character could collect  learn the alphabet maybe it could help other people understand it better

spoilerthe whole time i thought the holy cross was an item to defeat the heir i thought that i was working towards it but in reality is an item that everyone has the dpad or keyboard directional key is the holy cross
at first i was able to figure out some on my own and i got really proud that i was able to understand the concept even though i solved most of it on my own some stuff was just to hard for me to understand so i had to look up guides or further hints online which honestly made me really sad i really wanted to try solve everything on my own i still tried on my own once i understood what i was supposed to dospoiler

im afraid when people bought this game they expected a more adventure experience and not about the puzzles dont get me wrong i still had a great time with this game thinking of it before i go sleep to come up with solutions was great opening the mountain door was one of the most emotional moments for me just makes me sad when you get stumped being unable to figure out what the game is trying to tell you its like when you were a kid and you got stuck in a level but then you grow up and you are able to beat it
come to think of it the game has infinite stamina and no fail options maybe their plan was the puzzles and not so much the combat

if you bought the game just for the adventure combat story part i would reccomend waiting for a good sale or not buying it if you dont plan putting extra effort for the puzzle part the games price is worth if you can bring yourself to accept both parts even though i felt like the puzzle has the higher regard here especially at the end of the game

#####

tunic was a bit of a disappointment for me maybe i was a bit too hyped for it because as it is it is still an ok game and i had fun playing it it however doesnt innovate in any meaningful way and compared to the games it got inspired from namely zelda and darksouls it feels shallow even though its basically a combination of those two games it doesnt borrow their strongest elements and doesnt manage to get the same level of excitement as either of these two titles while playing 

as i eluded before tunic is an isometric dungeon crawler type of game the likes of zelda with many elements borrowed from dark souls such as the bonfiresystem the estusflask the mysterious barely explained narrative and maybe some small empathies on boss fights using a dodge and parry mechanic the aesthetic of it really make it seem like its a zeldatype game which has elements borrowed from dark souls which was what i was expecting however it more feels like a soulslike game that has elements borrowed from zelda what do i mean by that

well for a game like that i expected something similar to the templesdungeons found in zelda with some kind of puzzles and keys and new items with which to fight the bosses of said temples well some of tunics levels can be thought of as dungeons or temples but there are basically no puzzles or keyriddles in them neither are there any new items tunics levels boil down to elongated hallways with a bunch of monsters to fight the treasures found mainly elude to upgrading your characters base stats instead of giving a different ability or fighting style one level i found particularly disappointing there was one lair which totally gave me the vibe of an assassin hideout so enemies sneaking up on me and traps and those sorts of things was what i expected but what i got was the same as any other level i am all for subverting expectations but you have to at least do something with it and not subvert it by doing nothing i think no level in tunic is really memorable or unique they all kinda feel samey and not really interesting they look nice so the level design is nicely done but they play very repetitively without any soul in them 

the only thing uniquely interesting about tunic is probably its darker world building in the second half of the game and the game journal you use to make sense of the world the game journal however also includes the maps of dungeons which in my opinion gave away too much if you got them before even entering the specific area  

all the riddles in the game kinda came at the end and after figuring out how they work you have to go through every area again searching for them its a very tedious job and since those riddles mostly use the same mechanic there is not much variety in them overall i would say that a lot of the mysterioussolving elements of tunic basically boil down to going over the same area over and over again until you find something new it was not very fun to do so which is why i didnt finish off all the optional puzzles 

to conclude tunic was a fine game with some nice level design and the bosses very fun to fight however it doesnt manage to stick out of the many forgettable 2d indie souls like games or the 2d indie zelda like games

#####

i love this game and think it was absolutely worth the money spent
lots of puzzles combat has good balance world is beautiful story is solid 
this feels like fez with combat and i had a great time playing

i only have three complaints
#1 the camera constantly following the bosses can make certain fights incredibly nauseating
#2 the music is pretty forgettable and the game doesnt appear to have a musical motif
#3 got stuck for awhile because of where the east forests golden pad is placed in the far shore

tunic wasnt as hard as i was led to believe being a lamulana veteran might have helped here but it certainly wasnt a walk in the park either and kept me challenged for its whole course

basically youre thrown in a fantasy world you know nothing about and you have to understand how to engage with it you will be helped by a cryptic but partly translated booklet that you will be recovering page by page with just enough information about how to progress and find a few more pages that may cue you further
the world is pretty open from the get go but without the needed knowledge a lot of places will be out of reach some curiosity might help getting in some place earlier than intended but it probably wont carry you very far without the important information contained in the booklet

as such the booklet and its interpretation is a central piece of tunic and i loved how it sometimes conceal important information that may help recontextualise a lot of things youve already seen there must have been two or three big realisations that completely changed how i looked at the game and made me scour many places or the booklet again
understanding and deciphering the booklet was a real treat and nostalgic in a way 

shootout for the soundtrack too i started noticing how good it is when i got in the first underground area and it didnt let me down once until the end of the game good enough to get me to stop playing at times and enjoy the ambiances for a while

i loved tunic and i cant recommend it enough

#####

this game really just didnt land with me the way that i wanted it to so i came into the game because i heard that this was zelda  fez and i said cool i just came off of god of war ragnarok and wanted something more chill and puzzley because i played case of the golden idol recently highly recommend and i wanted a slower puzzle game this was not that

first off the combat is bhardb i would say in the first few hours its alright and pretty zelday but at one point in the game there is a huge difficulty spike i banged my head into the wall for a while until there was a mandatory combat gauntlet and i eventually turned on no death mode in accessibility to finish out the last hour to finish out the exploration and story 

second i think what i really wanted was more of the obra dinn style deductive reasoning style puzzles which is on my taste not the games fault and truly the fez dna is there instead lol a lot of the puzzlyness comes from learning new things about the world and new things you can do through collecting the pages of the manual which are mostly in the ingame language sometimes these puzzles are basically solved when the manual is intact and sometimes they are still very obtuse but learning new things from the manual never felt that satisfying to me as it often felt that i was not piecing clues together to find solutions but more interpreting solutions being given to me

the language barrier is also rough i got a rough idea of how the language worked on my own but definitely didnt want to take the time to translate the whole manual let alone character dialogue in the end i also just dont have enough time to play games that i can spend that much time translating

i certainly understand why people like this game and to the right person looking for difficult isometric combat and obtuse puzzles i would recommend this game but for people like me who wanted something more chill in terms of difficulty and with more deductive reasoning type puzzles i would say consider other games first 

return of the obra dinn and case of the golden idol are both fantastic for deduction puzzles and outer wilds has great puzzles exploration and story all of these do the only thing keeping you from going forward is player knowledge in a more satisfying way for my money

i hope you like this game it is obviously a labor of love and a lot of care went into the game but in the end it just isnt the game for me

#####

one of the greatest games i have ever played

#####

best game i could ever play and enjoy
it has great music atmosphere secrets and more 
would recommend this game 100

#####

ive played literally thousands of games and i do not say this lightly when i say this is one of the best designed games ever

as i played it it evolved three times first i thought it was a cute modern take on zelda 1 it is z1 is handsoff at its most classic but its a very where the heck do i go kinda game in tunic you can get lost but theres always hints theres always a way to figure out where to go no matter how obscure and after you find it you may even go oh god thats what the manual meant

then it became very hard i then thought it was also a fun take on dark souls i actually dont care for dark souls but this i enjoyed the combat and gameplay is fluid and fast paced also ds has boring aesthetic design and this game is freakin gorgeous sorry to any ds fans please dont flay me alive for my bad opinions 3

and then i found out the third game this reminds me of lamulana now if you havent played lamulana what i mean is this game has puzzles it has some amazing mind bending puzzles they blew my mind if thats not a thing for you its not even neccesary but trust me you should experience those puzzles

i loved this game do yourself a favor and check it out

#####

was expecting zelda vibes which i was hype for but was not expecting it to feel like deaths door which is another favourite of mine really love how they get you already know how to play video games and do not bog it down with a tutorial so far excellent and cannot wait to keep playing

#####

itunici is an actionadventure game that takes place in a visually appealing world filled to the brim with secrets the art music and sound design are all top notch it has everything someone like me isaysi they want in a game yet why was the experience so unenjoyable

this is a very subjective review im posting it with the understanding that steam users generally read multiple reviews and then judge based on the aggregate and i think the majority view that itunici is a good game is correct but i also want to highlight the things that made it unfun specifically for a player like me and why i was muttering cryptic bs the game between clenched teeth by the end

i was attracted to itunici when i heard of the game mechanic of collecting pages of a manual that would gradually reveal secrets it sounded fun and satisfying and there iarei tons of secrets in the manualbut its written in a idifferent languagei and the game doesnt give you any clues to deciphering it until youve collected most of the pages meaning youre stuck for most of the playthrough with a booklet of frustrating gibberish the temptation for someone like me is then to look up an alphabet online taking me out of the immediate gaming experience i wasted a lot of time painstakingly translating the manual pages going back and forth with the alphabet key and not even gaining any hidden information by it since whats written are mostly vague hints eventually i just looked up a guide that translated the pages for me which further undermined the experience of figuring things out for myself at that point the whole game is kind of spoiled for me and i may as well use walkthroughs for everything

the game has way too many puzzles and most of them are frustratingly difficult the difficulty curve of these headscratchers is out of whack it isorti of starts small but the puzzles quickly become way too elaborate and theres not a clear idea of which puzzles are necessary to progress the game or get stronger item upgrades and which are just for novelty items that do nothing there just arent enough stepping stones for the average player who is left feeling stupid rather than smart

with the proliferation of enemies that respawn every time you save and the abundance of mindbending puzzles the world feels cruel and confusing major spoilers spoilerat one point when you finally gather three keys from three difficult bosses and naturally expect to be rewarded in some way the game instead throws you into an unwinnable boss battle kills you and banishes you to the realm of the dead where all the upgrades youve thus far acquired are taken awayspoiler
 
theres nothing particularly interesting about the games story the fact that everything is wrapped in layers of secrecy may make you think therell be an aha moment when youll care about the lore but its just the usual fantasy fare travelling around the world is annoying for while there are some warps you have to keep referring to the corresponding manual page to figure out which of the identical squares in the warp zone lead where even with the warps there are some areas that just arent easy to get to or back from which if youre roaming round the overworld trying to uncover secrets adds another layer of frustration 

clearly this isnt a game for someone like me and i dont blame it for that but i know im not the only person that responded to itunici this way theres enough puzzles here for three far less frustrating games the unglamorous dungeon spelunking aspects are actually pretty enjoyable though ive grown to hate the old treasure chests hidden from the camera bit and the combat while very tough can be overcome with judicious item use and practice overall however i was outfoxed and thats not a fun feeling recommended to those who worked at bletchley park in a previous life

#####

wow
i cannot recommend this game enough
if you are a fan of metroidvania games buy it
if you are a fan of soulslike games buy it
if you are a fan of puzzle games buy it and disable combat damage so you can just solve the puzzles
if you are a fan of 90s super nintendo games buy it

#####

acabo de terminarlo con todas las hojitas del manual y no tengo palabras estoy muy sorprendido con este juego empezó siendo un soulslike zeldesco furrito y terminó siendo una obra maestra de los puzzles el manual es todo amo este juego es el indie del año

#####

this amazing game just clicks for some people if you love a mystery and that feeling of eureka this game is for you itll not hold your hand itll not help you and you need to discover everything by yourself not even the games language is known to you just be warned its not for everyone its for people who enjoy a good adventure and mystery and lack of hand holding or simplistic game design its not an easy game at all but so rewarding and full of secrets those who have solved the golden path puzzle can relate

if that sounds good to you get it if not be warned its not for everyone its very specific for those who like it

#####

the glorious bastard child of zelda and outer wilds aaaand since it shares some mechanicsdesigns with outer wilds the less you know the better

play it

i doubt there will be a sequel not since it is a bad game far from it but it is unique and capitalizes on novelty value and you can only pull that stunt once every decade

#####

brilliant game avoid all spoilers for maximum enjoyment much of the joy is the hunt for secrets the discovery of deeper mysteries
a world map and abilities like zelda
obscure hints to unravel the mystery like fez or outer wilds or the witness
combat like dark souls

main advice from me is to begin taking notes right from the start of the game
itll help later when trying to remember where you found things and what you saw

#####

legend of zelda a link to the past meets dark souls

#####

this is a very unique game if you want to try something different its definitely worth checking out though i dont think its a game for everyone

if you know nothing about it itd be good to know upfront that this is not a zeldalike though the aesthetic obviously takes inspiration from it i believe its mostly a nod to old japanese games that were hard to figure out for westeners the game is built from that idea written in a madeup language with an ingame foreign instructions manual to boot and it captures that feeling perfectly

as for the gampeplay itself it honestly feels more like a soulslike as there is a big focus on combat and map explorationmemorization though it isnt as hard as that may lead you to think its simply challenging

to end the review spoilerfree ill just say that figuring out the mechanics and making sense of the manual has been one of the most fulfilling experiences in recent memory theres plenty of content and surprises here and if its your thing its definitely worth the price

#####

one of my favorite games ive played recently  
nice music good story and fun puzzles
i thought it would be a bit more zelda knockoff than it was and i think thats a good thing
it did well to find its own niche and it did it in a fun way

its not a terribly long game but i enjoyed it the whole way through
thanks dev keep it up 

#####

absolutely perfect steamdeck title runs beautifully gorgeous aesthetic

1010 like zelda but with foxes

edit

this game deserves a lot of love and attention it should be gold standard for steam deck verified as it ran beautifully and controls feel so perfect

#####

i dont want to give away too much as this game is best played going in blind but it is a fantastic and memorable little journey

i recommend reducing the combat difficulty as it is the weakest aspect of the game  the puzzles and sense of discovery are where this game shine





#####

 

#####

you know its a good puzzle game when you need a pen and paper tunic is one of the best if not the best  puzzle games ive played since fez the legend of zelda homage pulls you in and you stay for the incredibly challenging puzzles and decryption my buddy and i spent several hours looking up information on linguistics and writing down different ciphers i love this game and more importantly i respect this game the music is 1010 reminds me of chrono trigger the combat is a bit basic but i dont think this game was meant to be about combat its a hardcore puzzle game do not look up anything on this game solve the puzzles yourself trust yourself

#####

first of i am not a furry i swear i am not identifying as this fox character

however if i ididi consider myself a furry and even if i iwasi identifying as the fox this masterpiece would istilli be an absolute b1010b

the game looks cute and childish but do not let that deceive you  stumbling into the dark tomb for the first time without the lantern is bispookyib and the lore of the game is kinda messed up if i was a furry i would probably also tell you that the game strikes a perfect balance between openworld and preplanned experience where the map usually opens up in digestible steps but you can also always choose to do things in your own order and the game will make sure to make you feel it when you are entering territory where you really are not supposed to be yet the world contains close to no filler space so exploring felt really rewarding there comes the point where the sudden realization kicks in that everything ieverythingi in this game world is spoilerpart of some kind of puzzlespoiler and that every little thing has purpose the game wants you to decrypt a whole fantasy language and if you want to 100 understand the game it even wants you to translate a whole book i didnt really care for the fox character since im not a furry but as you can guess from the trailer the game also looks gorgeous some landsights even stunning there is not a huge quantity of bosses sadly but the boss fights are really fun eg you fight a gigantic golem that shoots a fat beam from its face no one can hate that and they are pretty different from one another if you want to solve the final puzzle you will have to do some sherlock holmes type shit and really really spoilerthink outside the boundaries of a gamespoiler

my final verdict is

it was perfect ip e r f e c t i everythingdown to the last minute details

#####

this is the most fun game i have played in a long long time this game made me fall in love again with a challenging single player game this is one of the smartest games i have played in a long time game design wise the way you discover more about the world naturally makes this game a serious masterpiece 1010

#####

a very cool mixture of the original nes the legend of zelda and dark souls the mechanic of understanding the game through the cryptic manual was really cool unfortunately the endgame starts to veer away from that original design and more towards another game spoiler the witness and that drastic shift was welcomed at first but became very frustrating fast it was to the point where you are playing a completely different game spoiler however i still need to recommend game just off the concept alone

#####

absolutely amazing its legend of zelda if dark souls and hyper light drifter raised it

graphics game play story soundtrack and unique elements this game has got it all very worth your time i promise


#####

just a wonderful game with many layers
even without secrets just pleasant to play

#####

bought tunic it was fun the gimmick of finding manual pages and stuff was cute and then i started noticing patterns and it turned into a wild puzzle game as i scoured the map looking for pieces
it was cute sweet and clever with a parry that forever annoyed me then it suddenly got deep and facinating and then it blew my mind pulling psycho mantis stuff
if you liked the vibe of hollow night this is that but more zelday

#####

great gameplay great art style great music  but most impressive is the way that access to new areas and abilities is blocked only sometimes by item acquisition and the rest of the time by information  delivered cleverly and nostalgically too this means that on repeat playthroughs you can route wildly different paths through the game  i imagine this must be a speedrunners dream not to mention that the golden path is one of the most clever endgame urpuzzles since riven

tunic is a game which i have enjoyed although i do think most of its charm resides in the manual while everything else is okay

while i think this is definitely better i cant keep myself from seeing some resemblance to deaths door since it also has an isometric point of view and has a similar gameplay apart from the manual of course 

as ive already said in that review i think that these kind of games are mostly educational meaning that if you consider them in every way theyre made they get everything right absolutely right

but same as deaths door although tunic does better i think that theres not that spark that makes my brain say this is the one i think it may have to do with the hype surrounding the game and my expectations being too high although im not one to judge based on that

the thing that makes tunic stand out of course is its manual and mechanics connected to it which im not going to describe to avoid any spoilers how you encounter enemies and discover things is definitely another interesting point even though its dark soulsy

the thing with tunic is that it doesnt really feel new im not saying this in a negative way since you can enjoy something while also not praising it as the best thing theres is but it takes many things from different games and tries to tie them together succeeding in doing so but making you get that dejavu feeling again the only thing that did that is the manual which fortunately takes a good amount of your time and is the main focus

i think that tunic should have been a different kind of game without its combat elements maybe i dont know i wasnt convinced with the overall structure

i have appreciated the narration too but again it is a simple story told in a nondirect way i have loved the soundtrack too it has a foamy and warm atmosphere

personal thoughts aside i definitely think you should play this

#####

i have decided to redo my review after ive been able to 100 the game and i must say this game is wonderful
so good that it has become one of the few games where ive obtained all the achievements out of love for the game

so now im gonna describe the game as spoiler friendly as possible
this game is like a zelda with some dark souls elements but with a twist you dont know the controls and the guide manual you collect is mostly written in a different language so youll have to find out about places and actions with the few legible words present in the manual and the cute drawings in it yes gentlemen this game wants you to use your brain to find out almost everything and exploration is required and rewarded
as the game goes on it will make your mind swell ache wrinkle and then explode as you encounter more complex problems 

i like the artstyle along with the lighting and presentation of many of the areas the same praise goes for the manuals drawing and ilustrations

really nice relaxing music except for specific combat encounters then they stop being relaxing

the combat isnt great nor bad plus some of the complex techniques are quite fun to perform most of the enemies are quite simple with certain exceptions including bosses

the only buggy thing ive encountered is a certain plank bridge in a certain zone where if run past to fast you might end up falling into the water and dying other than that theres no negative bugs and glitches to speak off unless you really go out of your way in some cases

i recommend that you really thoroughly explore each nook and cranny of each area as important and essential items are easy to miss thanks to this games cryptic nature

#####

its been quite some time since ive found a difficult game i enjoyed since hollow knightspelunkykatana zeroceleste im not very fond of soulslike games but this is a nice introductory course id say lol although soulslike and a little difficult its truly not as bad as other soulslike games ive tried the game presents a challenge but still enjoyable and its filled with little puzzles the animation music and graphics are very pretty mechanics are great and although i have no idea what the story is even about 2 hours in and im already completely hooked im sure i havent even found the real bosses yet but the mini bosses have already been quite entertaining

#####

this game is pure gold you could think its just going to be one of those cute exploration games with an ok gamplay and not much else but boy would you be wrong

it still is cute but the gameplay is truly where it shines the game has a way to subtly guide you to whats the right course of action while never really blocking you and the more you play it the more you realize its depth and brilliance elements reveal themselves in a way that amaze you because most of the time they were right under your nose 
i love this game and i feel most people would as well

#####

not quite fox souls not quite fox zelda closer in actuality to outer wilds does that pique your interest good now i shant say another word because spoilers abound look nothing up play this as if youre in the 80s and the internet was barely a thing yet no guides no hints and have plenty of paper onhand for notes

yes its beautiful and fun  i like that its so cute and just the right amount of challenging exploring the world makes me feel so good so many secrets and hidden things makes the world feel so alive im so lazy but working through the puzzles and learning how to play makes me feel less lazy

fox game

#####

ui wanted to wait until i completed the final 3 achievements until i posted this but my schedule is picking up again so i will do so nowu

i loved this game i was obsessed with this game i feel so foolish that i didnt enjoy it at first haha i went into it only having played a demo at furry weekend atlanta blind otherwise i initially had trouble enjoying it because i felt unsure what i was supposed to be doing or where to go once i eventually installed it on my steam deckithat all changedi

i was captivated by the broad mystery of it all and became obsessed once i realized i was surrounded by puzzles without any sort of handholding i realized that this was a true exploration adventure i became obsessed

i finished it without looking up any sort of hints or guides though towards the end i decided to bring my boyfriend along as he enjoys puzzles we beat the game together in a waythen we looked up hints for the bonus stuff x3

overall i will say this is the best game ive played all year best game ive played in a while ultimately the music the visuals the challenge and the sense of exploration i loved it and will be a game i cherish and recommend forever

itldr this is a true adventure game no handholding use your brain and pay attention great music visuals and overall fantastic experiencei

thank you shinskii for getting this for me im sorry i took so long to actually play it x3

#####

best game to feel like a child again

#####

a lotta zelda a little dark souls and a killer sound track and art style amazing game

#####

you like zelda you enjoy solving puzzles you miss games coming with instruction manuals that contain cool art and tips about the game
this game is made for you
it gives you a great feeling of discovery and adventure that i havent felt in years presentation is stellar and the level design with all the hidden shortcuts  secrets to discover is a treat to explore
while you do get to upgrade your stats and find more equipment to empower you the game does a much better job empowering your brain as you play the game with every riddle you solve and every manual page you find you start to understand more about the world  the game opening up new secrets and giving you that satisfying ahamoment youll run past so many riddles and hints only to understand their meaning later and its great naturally the game will make you backtrack quite a bit because of that but it never feels like a waste of time or tedious as things get mixed up to keep it fresh and the clever shortcuts allow fast traversal of most spaces once found
solving the puzzles is the most interesting and rewarding experience of tunic do yourself the favor and refrain from looking up solutions


#####

never before has a game felt so hypertargeted at me and my interests


#####

     tunic is an isometric adventure game inspired by the likes of early zelda and even dark souls its design heavily surrounds its instruction manual which is scattered and lost to the corners of the world requiring you to piece it back together the manual reads like one youd find for an old nes game explaining the plot and most of the gameplay systems because the games didnt have enough space on the cartridge for such formalities tunic uses this to hide abilities and secrets not behind traditional upgrades but rather information at any point you are lost if you have the manual page for a given area or topic there is almost always a secret hidden in plain sight it is this mechanic that makes tunic one of the most brilliant games i have ever played 

     the game features combat reminiscent of the careful timing and stamina conservation the souls games had popularized years prior though it puts its own unique spins on the formula its not perfect and can get a bit stale by the end it almost disappears by the end as the game focuses more on its puzzles and the grander mystery at play but its serviceable until that point and the boss fights more than make up for the repetitive enemies the visuals are truly stunning and evocative every new area feels new and fresh from the last a distinct color palette making them memorable the camera is often used to disguise secrets and paths in plain sight and is probably one of the most impressive technical feats of this game the music manages to instill a feeling of wonder and awe feeling like youve stepped into a strange world and are simply stuck observing it and piecing together what happened it is also flexible enough to move into suitable battle themes for boss fights and haunting ambiance when uncovering the deeper mysteries at play the story is pretty hidden for most of the adventure and even to its conclusion but while its no writing masterpiece it does exactly what it sets out to do and without spoiling anything enacts the premise of figuring out what happened to a strange land perfectly for its story i was always kept wondering and pondering the meanings of what i had found and the answers were no less cryptic but equally rewarding 

     its not a particularly long game and lands on the pricier side of indies of its peers not going on sale as often  its late game is built heavily on the foundation of a particular kind of puzzle and the swap can be a bit jarring  though it was probably my favorite part of the game and where i felt the game reached its peak design wise i can understand that its not for everyone finally the game features super secret puzzles to unravel separate from the main quest and the reward is a bit anticlimactic it would have been a shame to hide a fun gameplay feature behind it but a new outfit or some tangible reward could have gone a long way 

     all that said however tunic is one of those games where you can feel the passion put into it it wears its inspirations on its sleeves yet never stays content being in the shadows of them pushing ahead to forge its own unique direction and tying everything back to its main mechanic the manual that single mechanic elevates tunic to something wholly its own and while i couldnt imagine how you could improve upon it its something to be remembered and expanded upon in the future

     thank you to andrew shouldice for creating something so inspiring i cant wait to see what comes next and i hope one day i could ever create something that lights up someones face and inspires them the way your little game about a fox did for me 

tunic is absolutely worth completing

#####

very enjoyable little game like a mashup of dark souls and links awakening

pros
 great graphics and art direction
 fun variety in skills and items gives you some options to customize your build
 jampacked with secrets and things to do
 the game manual mechanics are super original and fun its pages are spread around the world so you need to find them and pick them up the manual itself is written in a cipher that youre gonna have to crack to get the most out of the game but it should give you enough hints that youll never feel stuck that being said you miss out a lot on the plot of the game if you dont try to read it

cons
 low skill ceiling  i struggled a lot in 3 parts of the game until i realized i was not using my inventory to its full potential then it became a breeze
 some puzzles can be very obtuse i had to use a guide to get some of the lategame secrets

as you can see the pros far outweigh the cons highly recommended

#####

i have never had a gaming experience this incredible i have dreamed of a game like this as long as i can remember 

please try your best to 100 the game i have not done so yet but ive completed nearly everything and if you rush to the end without trying to figure out things for yourself you will be missing out on one of the coolest experiences you can have 

1010 
buy this game

#####

absolutely amazing game gorgeous and fun

highly suggest b especially b on the steam deck

#####

10 hours into this game and were absolutely loving it a lovely blend of zelda vibes and challenging combat with an excellent soundtrack and genius selfoverlapping world design with a ton of little details that make it an absolute joy to play

if you like oldstyle 2d zelda dark souls games or like idk hollow knight youd probably enjoy this a lot

#####


h1 blast from a halfremembered past h1 

im starting to think of games like this as found games retro games that are oblique about their rules but use retro tropes or careful golden path level design to signal their intentions these games borrow heavily from older games but usually with a lot of modern minimalist design  

there is a whole genre of nostalgic pixelart games that buff ancient and wellworn mechanics to a mirror sheen shovel knight comes immediately to mind this game is like that but they want to evoke the unexpected and the halfremembered

other reviewers have mentioned souls and zelda in reference to combat fez or the witness in regards to puzzles these are decent touch points but it doesnt convey what the experience actually is  this game is zelda if it was made for seasoned gamers who wanted the joy of not having their hand held but rather coyly slapped away  its meant to be dreamy and nostalgic but also enigmatic and impenetrable its also super cute and looks deceptively simple

the combat is slower paced and deliberate more so than zelda or more recently deaths door the puzzles arent signposted  they break sequence with the typical heros journey video game progression to toy with expectations

a lot of games try to be nostalgic games that shine ancient but excellent mechanics to a mirror sheen shovel knight comes immediately to mind this game is like that but they want the feel to evoke the unexpected and the halfremembered

hard zelda clones with difficult lightly signposted puzzles is not going to be for everyone honestly the first zelda game wasnt for everyone when it came out either mario was for everyone or for those who wanted a quick game of skill zelda was for those who wanted to tease secrets slowly out of a game world  it was weird and back then and had a kind of dream logic weve long since accepted and even come to expect tunic has literal dream logic happening from its opening moments 

tunic just wants to tease you i suggest you let it

#####

insanely fun adventure game i had a lot of fun figuring things on my own with the journal they give you to assist you on your adventure however this game can be difficult at times and there are a some puzzles that will make you want to scream i wish i was joking


#####

if you enjoy puzzle solving youll enjoy it
if youre a completionist like me thats twice the fun
highly recommend playing as much of the game as you can without a guide it feels so rewarding figuring stuff out on your own

#####

an incredible game that contains both puzzles that are mindtwisting and challenging combat 
beautiful art and music that ensures fun exploration

#####

got it as a present and didnt even watch the trailer beforehand was pleasantly entertained by all the plot twists weaving the game manual to the mechanics and the plot itself was a genius move really smooth gameplay

#####

nothing needs to be said play it

#####

i love difficult games i like contra super c and ninja gaiden on nes finished dark souls 1 and elden ring enjoyed darkest dungeon cuphead hollow knight 

despite the praise for accessibility features this game has received i would not recommend it combat is not difficult its unfair and the challenge spikes quite early navigation is confusing and you only gain access to map parts after quite a bit of wandering around after many many headaches i took screenshots of the manual printed them and tried to make a list in order to sort what the heck the mystery was sadly these elements this abstract list of phonetic alphabetic symbols of the game made me not only stop having fun but actively start to hate it i have a very slight case of dyslexia and this felt like punishment i know that this is a me problem and a lot of people might find this fun but it was never implied when i made my purchase that this would be a major part of the game and the fact that so much content was locked behind quite a difficult cipher makes it unfair

its not that i wanted an easy mode a constant guide or a tutorial to master the basics just that the game would not require outside assistance to make any progress on it

#####

as a huge fan of zelda less so souls games but to be honest the combat isnt where this game is hard i can safely say its a fun little experience full of mystery and intrigue this review was made after successfully finishing the game with the completed guide 

pros
lovely relaxing soundtrack that just feels good to listen to

adorable protagonist yes this is a selling point

surprisingly deep combat you have plenty of tools to tackle different situations and later abilities make it a very fun experience

a neatly designed compact world with plenty of secrets to find some harder to find than others it feels rewarding too thanks to the stat upgrade items

some rather surprising elements that arent particularly explained but makes for some interesting world building and looks fantastic

some extremely clever puzzles at a cost see cons

the guide book is a great idea for the game and had me looking at it a lot be it for secrets or clues on where to go

cons

working out where to go is one of the hardest parts of the game youll feel like youre aimlessly wandering a lot

the puzzles while clever are extremely obnoxious some of which i have no idea how theyd expect you to figure them out i do hope you enjoy directional input commands because theres a lot of it here

the audio mixing seems to be a bit off during important scenes and approaching the miasma the volume for these events are not adjusted by the ingame audio settings so i was made deaf numerous times

#####

i ended up refunding this game shortly after buying it on steam because i decided to get gamepass and play it on there

there have been some great isometric topdown zelda clones releasing over the past few years and tunic is one of the best the number one feature that separates tunic from say  deaths door for example is the genuine sense of wonder and discovery deeply embedded into the gameplay mechanics you get the most out of this game by going in blind highly recommend this gem to all my friends

#####

tunic has one of the best exploration element in any game ive played and is also a great game all around with good story gameplay graphics and music too

#####

i love this game its very good but towards the end of the game the puzzles began to feel incredibly repetitive especially the holy cross puzzles honestly though its a good play and translating the manual is fun

#####

it hurts my heart to write this review tunic is such a beautiful and unique game it excels in its incredible world building exploration and puzzling  but ultimately fails when it comes to combat which is not only way too difficult but simply frustrating particularly in boss fights

in the beginning you get put into this new world knowing nothing really  not about the map the story not even about the menus or controls

you start exploring quickly finding pages of a manual which mysteriously guides you not only through the game mechanics but also the world and your own purpose within it some pages contain parts of the map but vastly abstracted and artistically different each time sometimes new enemy types are being hinted at yet never fully explained other times little icons and handdrawn scribbles  notes give you clues about what to find here or what to avoid other pages tell the story usually with big beautiful images early on though with large gaps in between weapons stats abilities and items are revealed by more and more pages and even the set and behaviour of controls is constantly expanded this way as you progress in a time where many games right out tell you the tiniest and most obvious steps this game felt different refreshing even the visuals are beautiful the soundtrack amazing loving it

during this time i strongly believe that this is going to end up as one of my alltime favourite games

about halfway in things suddenly take a turn

now in order to proceed you need to discover paths that are nonobvious the forced perspective often hides additional pathways usually to many of the optional chests  but now also to the only way forward goodold google is the only way to be able to proceed here without wasting hours randomly figuring it out on your own

the biggest issues however is boss fights getting completely out of hand so far they have been challenging but fair and managable now bosses just constantly spam all kinds of attacks short and long range without any hints or pattern without pauses in between them the only way your character can really make good and consistent damage is melee attacks with your sword as magic items that would allow for longrange fights are really limited but the range of your sword is short you literally have to stand right next the enemy some bosses are able to constantly evade your attacks and even kick you back eating up your stamina parrying or dodging feels like a matter of luck whether you get the timings right the special attack impossible to do consistenly blocking attacks with your shield way too slow and again too inconsistent there simply is neither time to properly land an attack nor regenerate stamina  heal yourself if you finally get a hit the enemy too often gets a hit too which of course ends up way worse for your small health bar than your enemies huge one using your consumable resources like the bombs sure they are fun and work but they are just gone should you die and respawn its frustrating it feels impossible maybe i am just not good enough who knows during the late game you even temporarily loose all your stat upgrades as well making the situation even worse using the extra option of reduced difficulty ends up beeing the only way for me to somehow even reach the end of the game without throwing my controller out of the window

so yeah i am fascinated by this game but also very very frustrated too frustrated sadly in its current state  and it hurts me to say this it really does  i cannot recommend this game

#####

absolutely worth the money very cute fun and difficult enough game i love it peepohappy

#####

dope game

#####

a game of three genres but the genre you will end up playing the most is puzzles
this is not a zelda game where every puzzle is communicated well and uses a linear progression of difficulty and complexity 
well the majority of the game is youll playthrough figuring things out at a regular clip some boss fights are considered difficult and the combat is not tight enough to warrant such a punishing system but it has an accessibility mode for those that would rather skip those parts
there is no accessibility mode for the final of the game the final puzzels the game requires you to solve require jumps in logic trail and error and figuring out scribbles in the ingame manual with audio and environmental puzzles that have little to no build up you will be stuck and if you find that fun this is the game for you
if you are like me you will waste an hour or two of your life trying to make sense of the end game puzzles sigh deeply and just google it i dont find in game puzzles like this fun or engaging in fact it deflated a otherwise enjoyable experience 
tunic is one third of a good game i enjoyed the adventurezelda elements for most of the game the dark soulsesque combat left me lacking for a camera that didnt swing so much and obscure the battles and a more consistent boss move set the final portion of puzzles were so unenjoyable i had to write this review

#####

想学习魂系的高难度战斗但是战斗方式单一手感稀烂boss设计也很普通打了3个boss完全感觉不到史诗感
想学习魂系的晦涩谜语人剧情但是又做不到魂系那种把故事的细节藏在游戏的各个角落
想学习魂系的箱庭地图设计但是整了个25d锁视角导致探索中有一半时间是在视野外蹭墙看能不能走过去
我是真的很想喜欢这个游戏但是在4个小时游戏时间里除了刚拿到剑的时候之外没有一次给到我惊喜
唯一亮点大概就是实体手绘风的地图说明书很有以前买游戏附赠一本说明书的感觉


#####

this game is kinda incredible the attention to detail in almost all aspects of this game is a marvel to behold its just also infuriatingly hard in places both in combat and in its puzzles that makes it hard to recommend for everyone if you are experienced with games or have played them since you were little this game may still give you a run for your money if that doesnt scare you away though this game is a must grab its one of those games that makes you feel like a kid again

#####

truly amazing the best parts of elden rings a link to the past and your favorite lofi beats dont skip this one for real

#####

link wears a tunic and so does this fox 
this is a 1010 must play

#####

reading the manual is the best part of the game

#####

this game is like the legend of zelda the ones before breath of the wild but there are many more things that make it fun and original if you are a speedrunner this game is very fun because of its wide variety of gamebreaking glitches but you almost never encounter them is you are not trying to in all if you are a fan of nintendo games you will most certainly like this game it is a very fun game and i strongly reccomend this

#####

edit 2 months later and im still thinking about this game really standing the test of time

edit have now finished tunic what an excellent game and im just scratching the surface with the puzzles too because there are alternate endings secrets within secrets and more not sure if i have the time to keep digging but i want to

original have you ever looked at a puzzle game and though hmm needs more dark souls well this game might be for you because it is most definitely for me if you can go in cold please do because the joy of discovery here is amazing im 6 hours in feels like im about halfway through the game but i wanted to get this review out there for people who are on the fence

without trying to spoil ill try to explain what makes this game so good this game is first and foremost a puzzle adventure game you dont know whats going on instructions and signs are in an unknown language an you have to piece together everything through contextual clues the world might seem locked away behind abilities like a metroidvania but you actually have hidden abilities and skills you can do right from the start that unlock parts of the world it will be interesting to see if  how speedrunners try to exploit these techniques

this adventure puzzle style would be fun on its own but then you have the combat which is not much more than sword shield dodge roll magic grapple hook and items but the enemies design is tough making you truly master the mechanics to beat each boss very much like dark souls but probably closer to deaths door 

it is difficult so im not sure i would recommend it for pure puzzle game fans but definitely recommend to anyone who loves souls games and especially the hidden lore aspects of souls games

#####

game gave my smooth brain wrinkles 

#####

tunic is a work of art in all possible ways and my new favorite metroidvania

it has a gorgeous atmosphere and environments the soundtrack fits really well its a good take on the metroidvania genre its difficulty is on point it can get hard but will never be tiresome and its story was way more deep than what i could have imagined if you like metroidvanias go play it right now you wont regret it

#####

note that due to the way information isnt given to the player in this game it is best experienced as blind as possible

this game slaps and is basically a souls ripoff combined with a zelda ripoff but only the good parts of each
i sometimes wish some things were a bit more intuitive like the wells and some story beats but overall its a really unique experience piecing together this world

#####

you must play this game now and you must play it blind   you are depriving yourself if you do not do these things

#####

ill just keep it brief as possible i liked a lot of the game but overall grew to dislike other sections of the game more as it went on

the world looks great sounds great and everything amongst those lines is solid early exploration is really fun too at first i even enjoyed the combat plenty of fun mystery to go around too just generally a really great vibe

but then theres the bosses and the lategame the former i liked one of the rest i genuinly despised and simply turned godmode on for a part of it is me being bad at the game yes but the combat also failed to grab me and was generally just boring also doesnt help that im not a huge fan of soulslike stuff 

the lategame is cool initially and when seeing how all of it clicks together it seems really cool but i was already tired of just running around the map at that stage to the point where i gave up

maybe get it on a salein a bundle

this game feels like elden ring meets zelda the combat is challenging but satisfying and the exploration is top notch much like the other games mentioned you have to explore the world around you to find items that will improve your character  the souls you collect are used to increase your level and buy things and you also lose some when you die and have to go back to that spot to claim them sound familiar 

still its all done really well and i love the mystery surrounding the game and what to do next you find a pages of a user manual thats mostly written in an unknown language and have to figure out what to do from the pictures and the little bit of english thats there its been a fun and satisfying experience so far

sometimes when writing a review one wonders whether to press the thumbs up or thumbs down button that goes along with the text this is not one of those cases instead i want more than one thumbs up because this game breaks expectations

if this had been released last november wed have been able to cancel all award sections because itd be over tunic would win everything hell other than in the music department it wipes the floor with the loz links awakening remake it makes deaths door look like just a decent effort if elden ring hadnt come out right before this is all the gaming press would be talking about

i am not talking a lot about how the game works because yes its better played unspoiled not because of a story full of turns but more like how an old snes game might be made worse by reading the guide first the combat mechanics are spectacular again making deaths door and links awakening look bad the world is beautiful and intricate it makes a link to the pasts overworld seem uninteractive in comparison if theres any sense in the industry out there the developer is now too busy deciding which giant check to accept to get a timed exclusive for whatever they want to do next

this game turned from a cute little adventure zeldalike to something much more substantial that surprised me and i had to keep going till i completed it because it was that fun to discover things and explore the one quirk i have is the difficulty can be a lil surprising at times wish there was a difficulty option for other folks but aside from that this game was really beautiful worth the 7 year wait for an amazing indie title

#####

excellent puzzle solving

#####

a bit of souls mechanics nothing all that much punishing you can take it easy looks nice runs good full of things to find and figure out and seeing how im at 3h at the moment that might just turn out to be the defining thing about it combat might not blow you away or it might be good enough if you liked deaths door you will most likely like tunic try it out enjoy

#####

cutesy game
no hidden stuff pretty straightforward

#####

playing this game blind is fun i fully recommend it if you love these kind of games furry or not this game art style and music are on point the hole game is fun the combat is smooth i wont spoil it for anyone reading but its worth playing

#####

if zelda and dark souls had a baby it would be tunic great game

#####

great mix of zelda and dark souls cute and difficult just like women

i really enjoy the exploration and puzzle aspects of the game  its also cute at least for most of the 8 hours ive played so far  it also runs very well on linux with the current default proton compatibility tool  software and the rolling release distribution arch linux

ive also gifted a copy of the game to a friend who couldnt afford it but i figured would also love it

i am thankful it has many baccessibility optionsb at launch but id appreciate some extras


h1negative aspectsh1

this is the first game in many years ive played with a controller i happened to buy an older xbox controller at the start of the pandemic which i hoping to use it with a different game but never did

i spent probably all 8 hours so far __holding the controller wrong__ i didnt even realize this until i had enough items that i was using the lower bumper buttons  my hands still get sore from trying two different controller styles  my muscles have never had to use a controller with extra buttons let alone hold them down for so long  after some search engine use it seems im isupposed to use my pointer finger along the seam of the lblt and rbrt buttons then kind of roll it either direction to hit one of the buttonsi which is absolutely counterintuitive to how my finger muscles know to move

the bboss battles are really hardb probably too hard for my experience level with controllers and the type of games i normally play  usually keyboard and mouse very forgiving time constraints

h1improvementsh1

a difficulty adjustment aside from disabling the sp and hp systems
list
 item menu behavior options time passes while in inventory inventory disabled and autoclosed when in combat time frozen in inventory
 longer telegraphs from enemies
 longer player iframes etc
 adjustable enemies attack strength hp change probably havent used this mode expands the current accessibility option from disabled  on to an enemy attack scalar
 adjustable sp is use for actions expands the current accessibility option from disabled  on to a cost range  
list
im not exactly sure where super casual gamer difficulty is and i suspect that people even older and maybe much younger than i would need even more forgiving settings

the accessibility options outlined above could be simplified and examples shown but preset profiles that explain the intended audience  individual settings should be customizable and fork to a custom profile  it would also be nice to support multiple players eg kids  parents  etc by saving profile names

i still brecommend the gameb because even if its too hard right now those baccessibility optionsb exist to use after the player gets stuck
