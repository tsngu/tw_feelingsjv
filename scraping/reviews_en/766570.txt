been fishing in this game for over 8 hours now and havent caught a single russian

name is potentially misleading

#####

ive fished 6000 hours on rf4 so i think ive earned an opinion  the game has gotten steadily worse since the release of tunguska the devs have gotten more greedy the prices are always increasing while reducing your chances of catching any decent fish when i say greedy here is an example with the recent patch the bite rate increased at norway where by pirking it only took less than 10 pirks to hook a fish when before the patch it was up to 100 or more the devs quickly realized this and returned it to its insane amount of pirking per fish via the last restart and if you were lucky enough to last thru all that pirking 98 of the time it was a worthless fish in silver and xp they also included in the sea expansion ticket killer fish even with the crazy overpriced gold reels 45k120k and a 50k silver rod these worthless fish ie greenlands and halibuts burned up a considerable amount of your ridiculously priced boat tickets  the only people i see catching any decent fish are youtubers or some other social media sponsored person now all that said this game was once a really good game and was fun to play and it could be again if the devs would open their eyes and ears to the community spending money on their game  ill continue to play the new expansions for the first two weeks the reason ill only play two weeks is because after 2 weeks or less the devs will nerf the game play and the catch rate will decline 80 or more percent as it has on all the expansions in the last few years

the devs dont want you to catch any fish that will let you buy the highend gear with silver they want to keep you broke from overpriced gear boat tickets repairs etc they want you to buy their overpriced gold and by now youd think the prices would decrease with all the money theyve made from this shady game  there are plenty of other good fishing games that dont use shady practices and put out great content  

apparently the shallow devs cant handle a review that is getting a lot of attention and have lowered my bite rate to nearly zero 

the bite rate for most others ive talked to gets lower by the week this is how you run a game into the ground intentionally its all about forcing people into buying gold by the shady means i mentioned 

remember when you could carp fish and make nearly 1 million xp in a few hoursgood luck gaining that much xp carp fishing in a week now nobody hardly fishing for sturg or beluga anymore as the devs have lowered the catch rate to nearly zero have you noticed in chat late in the week the weeklys  are such low weights  which would normally be 100kg fish now if someone is lucky its 2530kg  non sea fish

fished the last 3 happy hoursafter the overpriced boat costi lost silver all 3 days game is sinking faster than the titanic

last 4 days the same hour happy catch4 crappy sub 8kg cusk with the payout of less than 140 silver

ill remove this review when the game becomes fun to play the prices are lowered and they put decent fish back into the lakes rivers and the sea 

has anyone read the q and a section for devsheres a typical q and a for the devs

what percent more does the skill points give you towards a trophy if you completely fill it with points

devs uhm well uhmwellat this point we dont want to give an answer to that question or any other question in regards to any boost or help towards catching trophies or any fish  thats dev code talk for fu go buy our gold and like it 

its the same with the super top secret upcoming updates you have to wait until you can install them to find out the new ways theyre goofing you over and expect you to keep playing

it takes months of saving silver to buy the nice sea gear100000 silver for the decent stuff and 200000 for the top of the line gear now does  that give you any type of boost in regards to catching the big trophies

heck no it doesnt but you sure can reel in those crappy cusk and saithe a little faster 

sea fishing ratio       90 crappy or time killer fish 7 fish got away 2 somewhat decent fish and 1 decent fish 

have you seen the weak devs answer to people like me rofl

this topic has been locked by a moderator no replies can be made

just shut the game off as 1000 restarts arent going to help this sinking raft

avoid at all costs rf4 staff bans innocent players
the game has great potential but rf4 staff members act abusive when facing criticism it is well known that they abuse their power regarding forum activity yesterday i reported a bug that remained unfixed although they were told about it before christmas events patches the bug led to my reel being heavily damaged thus leading further to a loss of silver due to a lack of interest in fixing that bug i reported it the tone was ferm no offensive language has been used i can prove it with screenshots they deleted my report and gave me a warning for aggresive behaviour they did not address the bug they ignored it i am a paying player i invested in this game i support their shitty attitude so i wont take warnings from lazy devs i wrote again in the criticism section funny they have one they are unable to take any kind of criticism no offensive language same ferm tone next thing they issue an ip ban for my game account not for my forum account however i am not the only rf4 player in my house so 2 other players found themselves banned without doing anything game ban for forum criticism abusive that is exactly what lazy game devs do are they lazy yup they could easily find out that the two other players had other connections in the past with different ips and i was the only one to write and play from the same ip constantly yet they were too lazy to research that resulting in a banning of innocent players this is the end of rf4 for me i will not support childish developers who had some unity tutorials on yt and believe they now own their game they dont paying players do i am not saying you should stop playing rf4 that is your choice but i would be really careful where i invest my money since rf4 has delivered nothing but bugs and aggressive attitude lately

before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

been fishing in this game for over 20 hours now and havent caught a single russian

name is potentially misleading

#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review on russian fishing 4 and it gets 350 likes and 150 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here


#####

ah russian fishing 4

an amazing game but yet one that i advice you as a player to stay away from even after having played it for nearly 700 hours myself however the reason may not be what you would immediately expect so let us not get ahead of ourselves and instead first examine the pros and cons of the game

pros

 very realistic in most aspects probably the most realistic fishing simulator on the market at the moment
 a long progression path that will keep you busy for a very long time i did not reach the end game although i came close
 a large selection of gear and fishing specialization paths for you to work towards and explore
 pleasantly and beautifully made lake maps
 overall gives a feeling of actually fishing rather than playing a game
 a highly complex system of variables to take into account when catching fish among them the standard weather temperature and time but also things like line type line size leader size attachment visibility gear and tackle qualities fish migration bait preference changes and much more

that all sounds great doesnt it so why the negative review well let us move on to the cons

cons

 in several instances the lake progression path does not make sense this will often leave new players frustrated with broken gear fishing at places they do not have the correct gear for yet or simply no or few fish
 in several instances the crafting progression does not make sense in rf4 you learn to harvest baits as well as making groundbait and lures however often in those progressions what you learn does not match the actual lakefish availability
 in several instances the store stock system especially will leave new players frustrated every lake has a certain set of stores in which many items will say out of stock for most items that actually means will never be in stock but the game does not explain this furthermore crafting requirements often need components from particular lakes that do not fit with general player progression in some cases when the player finally reaches a checkpoint in crafting they have passed the need for that craft in the first place
 bugs although this is an early access game there is a large list of bugs many of which are not recognized by the game management even though every old player know that they are present these bugs include but are not limited to chat lag ids appearing instead of player names store lag selling lag ghost bites strange fish got away streaks that sometimes do not make any sense at all and much more

so those were the general pros and cons of the game but wait there is more to be said about the game you see the game includes a place called the penalty pond or popularly called the prison pond this place is a specific lake map players are sent to if they for some reason have a falling out with the management of the game having a falling out with the management can entail everything from what you normally see moderated in other games by a profanity filter to posting something on the forum or discord that is not the the general liking of the management

when you are sent to the prison pond you will get a notification that you have to catch x amount of weight of fish to get out again mind you the fish in the prison pond i am told are all small so having to f ex catch 10 kilos of fish may very well take a very long time not exactly a fun prospect in a game which a player originally decides to play for just that  fun

the philosophy behind the prison pond isnt all that bad though in my opinion however you may suddenly find yourself on the receiving end of the stick for a supposed violation that you do not understand or agree with and at this point you will have no choice but to bow down and catch your small penalty fish effectively wasting your time and metaphorically speaking agreeing that you were rightfully penalized or quit the game it does not matter if you have played 10 hours 100 hours or 1000 hours the management are generally not open for debate

this leads me to one such example that happened to me yesterday after having happily played the game for 675 hours we were several people chatting in a private channel and the debate was about the prison pond and what got you sent there it was generally agreed that profane words were a sure way to get sent to prison pond but that you could get away with misspelling or abbrevations of such words

myself having never gotten sent to prison pond and considering myself a loyal player at some point replied with a harmless personal opinion which included a four letter foul word i did not think anything of it until about an hour later i found myself being teleported to prison pond

after this i stated my case on the forum as a technical issue since i felt that the issue must have been a wrongly automated action i was abruptly shut down and told that i violated the terms of service with a blacklisted word in my sentence i then read through the whole of russian fishing 4s eula yeah i had not read it beforehand these days how many actually read these very large agreements written in legal speak to my large surprise i found nothing in the eula stating that the sentence i wrote was in violation of it

i then posted about this highlighting the parts of the eula that could have had relevance but did not in my case however instead of having an adult conversation with the moderators my post was deleted i then reposted it it got deleted this repeated itself 45 times until an administrator posted a reply stating that i asked for an explanation of the ban and i got it ofcourse the administrator posted one of my earlier posts instead of the post where i was pointing out that i was not in violation of the eula which is terribly convenient at the same time my posts were marked for moderation approval which in other words meant that i was cut off

so there you have it russian fishing 4 is a great game in many aspects but it comes with a serious flipside to the coin in its current state i can not recommend it as you as a player might get hit with the same misfortune as i did effectively wasting very many hours of otherwise enjoyable play

but do not just take my word for it here plenty of review have complaints like mine but nothing to back it up with luckily i saw the direction things were headed in and captured screenshots of the conversations so that you as a potential new player will know what you will be up against before deciding to play

httpsimgurcoma8opva6f

some of the screenshots may be in the wrong order or overlapping slightly and i apologize for that regardless should you decide to play anyway you may want to have the above in mind good luck and have fun 

#####

this game is a korean grinder but in russian style why let me start 
first of all you can say hey its a free game what do you expect but no believe me  this game only looks free be preared that without golden coins bought for real money and premium pass you will acheve i wanted to use four letter word used for stool first few hours of game are pretty fun  quite good leveling tempo but when you will get to level around 20 poof you join an elite group of russian fishermen who goes fishing just to drink vodka you stil cath the fish like before but you realize that they are worth again a word for stool prices for gear are ridiculous and i mean ridiculous after 180 hours of grinding for best gear you can make like 100150 siver per real time 152 hours and good medium class rod is like 15002000 reel is the same and line plus bait another 300 then you realize that you must have the skill to get more fish and guess what  skill goes quite fast for first few levels you want to use ground bait sure prepare couple of thousand silver coins to level the groundbait making and clisk on crafting for few hours i have houndreds of groundbaits made and still have around 50 of skill tree  be also aware that with certain percent of skill you unlock another ingredients the same goes for all other skill trees you want to catch a fish with good price to sell forget it without a proper groundbait you will only catch some trash species not worth catching on low levels you can only catch certain species of fish which are
1 ruining your gear and worth  prepare for repair costs of a 100 worth reel like 200 silver
2 small common and worth 

be also aware that most of the server resets and patches are ruining most of the water bodies bite rates and your spots if you will find a spot where you can get decent fish for farming silver be sure that devs will show you their middle finger and reset it very soon

im really trying to give that game a chance but this is just too frustrating 

another thing  no ingame market you have a friend who has better stuff and want to share with you he have to get premium for real cash to get the option to give you something but does not matter  in most cases if you dont have enough leve or skill you will not be able to use it anyway that is so well designed  no shortcuts grind or pay

i can continue with such stories but this does not make any sense

concluding  if you have some time to waste and strong nerves go on waste your time maybe you will end like me thinking maybe this was all a bad joke and now ill start to get some good fish i can tell you straight away  no never

alright i got 160 hours into this game made it to high level to play all the maps and now i feel i can give my honest review of the game

it needs a lot of work it is not pay to win meaning there is at no point of the game you need to purchase anything to continue playing except that it is and i will explain how

the concept of this game is great you start out as a character that has never fished before has a limited amount of money and is trying to start out as you go to enter the tackleshop you see reels and rods in the thousands of silver cost and you started out with a measely 50 silver so you think shouldnt be too hard to save up wrong each fish you catch will average about 005 silver if you catch a nice size fish it will jump up to about 120ish at low levels if you catch a trophy it will be around 1020 silver for the fish but a trophy fish is extremely rare only 1 caught out of the 160 hours of fishing i have put into this game by the time you make it to level 12 you might have enough silver to buy a level 5 set up and at this lake are fish that will literally destroy it or take 45 minutes of your time away trying to land a fish worth 5 silver 

the money can start coming in at level 16 when you hit kouri lake but the thing is now you need level 16 gear at least to land these fish and these reels and rods will be about 9001400 silver each 

even at kouri one of the best silver per hour maps you will make on average 100200 silver an hour a decent reel at level 20 costs 2000 silver so you will be looking at 1020 hours of grinding and not spending any of it just to get a reel then as your usin that reel to save for a better rod or say even another you will start to notice it just doesnt have the stopping power it use to oh guess what you got to repair it repair costs for the reel will be anywhere from 3070 of the cost of the reel to just repair 

so in the long run no this game does not have a pay to win wall where you cannot advance anymore it has one discretely giving you the option to continue the game for free and literally not get anywhere or buy gold and premium time to repair your rod and reels without spending insane amount of silver along with no wait time i would much rather pay 60 for a game than a free to play game with microtransactions 

also if it was not for some people to pass down there gear to me at lower level i wouldnt of even commited 10 hours into this game extremely difficult to get started all the shops are out of low level gear no intention of a fix

more info on the game can be found on their websiteforums

i only recommend this game if you dont mind a grind cant get out fishing and just simply love to fish but today i cannot recommend the game for anyone to try given its current state

for me it was fun while it lasted but the grind isnt fun to me anymore

#####

fish

#####

good

amazing selection of gear and tackle this is the only game i have found that implements bfs
nice implementation of fishing techniques
good models
graphics

bad

prices of gear and tackle in both in game currency and real currency the prices way to high they need to cut it one of the best ultralight low profile reels is 200 real money in game currency 20k coins but good luck achieving that
making money and leveling and skill progression is the worst i have ever seen in any game its so slow you will have grandchildren before you will master this game unless you fork over real cash
fish pathing  animations when fighting fish it doesnt look or feel like a fight no swimming animation no head shaking at least they jump but it looks like your fighting a cardboard cutout
in game time moves too fast
no restwait to change time
tackle repairs take real time and it doesnt count down while logged out whhhhhhyyy

so after playing 110 hours i really want to like it im putting this game down because the things that are in the bad list i find critical for the game to be good the crazy thing is these changes are not hard to implement yet they havent if these changes are made i will play your game ill even change my review until then i wont play another hour of this

#####

this game once was the best fishing simulator there was offered but has fell far from grace over the past year  i seen hints on how this game and the dev team is behind the scenes let me explain when i first started playing this game and watching the guides on youtube i heard about this long time player named bigwrm i was on the forums one night and seen that he had been posting concerns about the game and he got black listed on the site where no one could see his post just because he was giving rightful criticism lately this game has went the route of cutting the amount of fish actively caught by players to near nothing in the hopes of players spending real money to buy premium items people are leaving this game in droves i post this review knowing full well that it could result in my account being banned for a negative review but i no longer care about a game that at one time brought my inner fisherman so much joy i cant recommend this game to anyone anywhere at anytime

#####

before i played russian fishing 4 i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

fish

#####

my wife wont let me go fishing in the middle of covid19 so im testing the waters here so far this is an okay replacement to fishing in real life the water looks as smooth as i remember it the fish still cause a ruckus and my wife still yells at me to spend time with the kids there is a nice variety of fish and locations ive caught a few fish here that i havent yet in the real world the one thing i wish it had was proper multiplayer theres a chat but thats about it you cant actually see other players my good friend lloyd and i have been playing this together and i do wish we could cast our lines side by side like we used to overall this isnt a real replacement to fishing but it is a darn fine one for the time being cant wait to be back out catchin carp in the old rowboat

#####

tldr  fishing is good grind is awful

the good
the fishing is mostly fun fighting decent sized fish isnt all that fun really probably because of the lack of physical feedback that youd get in real life  its still satisfying when you land them but im not sure it is worth the chore of the fight 

graphics are fine they get the job done 

lots of different fish species to catch including things not normally seen in fishing games like frogs crayfish mussels etc 


the bad
the more i play the more i see how so much of the game is designed to be such a grind that it makes people want to pay real money to speed up their progress  its the perfect simulation of being a part time worker on a 1995  425 an hour minimum wage with high inflation 2022 prices  

you make so little money from your caught fish compared to the prices of even basic items  there are things in the game that seem to exist only to drain money like having to eat  thats literally the only reason the need to eat exists is to drain your money  im surprised the devs dont charge us a daily rate for rent on a virtual house or camp site too

youll also drain your money replacing lost lures due to snags which is fairly realistic but annoying especially when you snag 3 times in 5 minutes because youre an idiot and didnt learn from the first two   traveling to maps after the 3rd map also costs money i dont know how much because i havent made it to a high enough level to go there yet which leads me to my next point

most of the game is locked behind levels skills etc  want to go the next map because youre tired of spending 20 hours on the first 23 maps too bad you need to be level 12 before you can go   want to use certain gear too bad you need to advance your skill up to a certain percentage before you can   lets say you needed 25 in a skill to unlock something whenever you catch a fish you might advance your skill by 02    and i dont think every fish you catch actually counts toward that but not sure  but it takes hours

this wouldnt be a bad thing if the grind wasnt so outrageous i like progression and unlocking things but this is annoyingly slow and more so when its part of the f2p business model  i would have rather paid 3040 for a pay to play game with much less of a grind 

if you like the gameplay and just want to fish casually for an indefinite amount of time and dont really care much about progressing through the game this is probably perfect for you if youre the kind of gamer that likes to blitz through a game and see all there is to the game in as little time as possible  then this is definitely not for you 


could go either way
its russian fishing so youll be fishing for european species on russian maps  if youre american and are used to bass fishing for example this might count as a bad thing for you  

conclusion
theres a lot of negative in the review but the game itself is pretty good there are a lot of fishing games out there worse than this one and arguably few that are really better  a lot depends on the style of fishing game youre after  this is probably more on the sim side than an arcade type game   most of my complaints are inherent to the f2p business model  had this been a reasonably priced pay to play game i think my review would have been a lot more positive 

take this as a review in between positive and negative  its free so if youre curious give it a try like me you might get 20 hours of fun out of it or maybe more who knows

#####

over zealous moderators
ridiculous damage system and cost
massively overpriced gold
massively overpowered fish causing untold damage to equipment which is expensive to repair
devs that refuse to listen
good fishing spots being constantly nerfed making it difficult to earn enough money for better gear thereby trying to push players to buy gold
ridiculous fanboys who constantly slag off anyone with a negative view
players constantly being banned for stating their views
overpriced premium
can only trade with other players if you get premium

welcome to russia of the early 80s

having said all of this the game could be awesome if the devs sorted out the ridiculous economy overpowered fish repair costs and nerfing the waters

some moderators really need to get a grip as well and stop playing god i think most of us can guess who im talking about

310    dont say you havent been warned

#####

i cant stop fishing this is not a problem dont worry about me the servers are down i cant fish please send help

#####

best fishing game but need multiplayer you can drink vodka or beer however drink alone is very sad  d

#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review and it gets 250 likes and 100 awards that he will buy me a case of beer some vodka and 1 kg of lemon so im just gonna leave this here

#####

player here with multiple account and  4k hours

do not touch this game

1 economy is nonexistent you will grind endless hours for levels skills and equipment and nothing will change only gives you an ability to catch bigger fish the bite rate of the fish is horrendous especially when were talking about good fish with every new release they make stocks limited so if youre late you have no way to receive new items unless you
pay cash or wait for 2 weeks the amount of damage your gear takes and the repair costs vs the amount of silver you earn for that could make a grown man cry

2 premium  will give you nothing other than experience boost a bit bigger keep net and submarine in norway premium also allows you to send items to other players but as a premium function its useless perk since you cant send anything
significant unless you pay for it with cash even without premium youre out leveling your gear faster than you can gather silver so paying for premium is a double edged sword you get to new maps faster but cannot afford the gear open your wallet again

3 inflation  they randomly set prices of popular equipment higher without increasing your ability to earn more

4 meta gaming  there is no experimentation in this game well you can but if you want to at least break even you have to join some community like discord facebook vk  to find spots baits etc

5 youre pawn any critique you have to say might get you banned especially when youre writing your post out of frustration admins are extremely sensitive and even when you have anything good to suggest or critique it will not be heard unless its a money grab how the game should work you have absolutely no say in the matter

6 there is not enough reward for progression you just can go to new maps and catch bigger fish but beyond some beginner maps youll earn 500 silverh at any map on average no matter how many hours youve spent or how good your gear is

7 game is developed in a way like they hate their player base and they want to get rid of them it has been just patch after patch restrictions on how and how much fish you can catch back in the day you could fill 100 net with an hour or two now few years later youre lucky to get 30 in an hour unless youre catching complete trash theyve lowered average weight of fish over the years so now you mostly catch tiny specimens game has ingame quest system that got reworked in a way that now restricts heavily how much extra silver you can earn from it and adding more and more systems to get money out of your pocket

8 is your energy bill high no problem you have to have a game open while your repairs are in progress so you can pay even more

9 game has an extremely invasive anticheat which will scan through your computer without your consent so you can get banned for running running your everyday applications like autohotkey and many more undocumented list of applications nobody really knows the depth of the list and so forth 

10 game gathers statistics and information off of your computer including personal identifiable information without your consent even their crash handler will send full report of your pc to them without asking you if your game ever
happens to crash all the information that has been gathered about you is being sent to russia and is processed there


game is a bad you should not invest any time into this especially when it means youre putting your sensitive data to risk by doing that

#####

russian fishing is the best fishing sim out there i have played it since before it was translated way before the steam release the amount of available tackle feed and bait are jaw dropping unfortunately i still would not recommend it to anyone in its current state

 the xp grind makes a korean mmo blush for example to reach lv20 i need around 150k xp the average fish on the map old burg nets me 200xp right now and thats rounding up
 same for gear a somewhat decent rod  reel will cost you 1000 silver expect your fish to sell for less than one silver each
 buying gear for rl cash gold is insanely expensive a midlevel rod  reel and assorted baits will easily set you back 50 its actually cheaper to go fishing irl
 if you decide to bite the bullet and invest rl money in gear youll find that this is a beta and rules can change one day rods can be repaired suddenly rules change and your expensive rod can become permabroken and not through hundreds of hours of play just getting your line stuck will do it ooops hahah beta and there goes your money

this game has everything to be awesome instead it got mired in its punishing economy play it if youre content with tossing out a float but expect to never see most of the xplocked content

#####

its about fishing

#####

avoid if you know what is good for your wallet

the devs continually decrease prices in gold but increase prices for silver for in game gear in order to try to extort players for money on top of this top end reels in game can cost as much as 200 if not more update i just checked the most expensive reel which is around 120 gold in game this would cost 24000 according to their website completely absurd 

i have been a paying customer from july 4th 2019 until march 2020 i sincerely wish i never spent a cent on this stupid piece of crap not to mention what my added up total came up to which i am totally not proud of 

on top of this the devs will ban anyone whom they see fit does not matter if they already made money off them or not they are just shady and greedy bastards whom care for nothing else but profiting off of naive player base whom continue to pay them 

i have  had enough of their greed and general mistreatment of longtime supporters which is why i feel it is necessary to report their behavior 

they also completely destroy any legitimate ways to actually make in game money thus forcing players to spend real money to be able to buy gear on top of all this their prices for gold and gear are absolutely absurd considering that for one single reel in game bought for gold one could easily buy a legitimate starter fishing kit irl for less than what they charge for virtual gear also the game encourages spending gold which is purchased for money and the prices are downright absurd i wish i could post a screenshot here but for comparisons sake just look at their website and convert the gold prices for top end gear to real money if you truly want to give yourself a heart attack this game should be abolished from existence greedy developers like these guys should not be allowed to operate on this scale 

just as an example you can buy 500 gold for 800 where i live that is more than enough to cover what i already mentioned in my rand above and what can you buy for 500 gold you might ask the answer is not that much good luck grinding you life away if you do not want to spend real life money

tldr
the devs are really in it just for the money and also this game will never be out of the beta stage as has been the case for last 2 years 

i would not recommend this game to anyone with any common sense left if you really want to play it set up a new free to play account and do not support these greedy bastards  and for the players who contribute by paying for their premium subscription heed this warning add up the amount of money you have spent on premium alone and you may just become shocked just like i was 

on top of the premium the promises they give you are about 20 fulfilled when you do have premium crafting and harvesting baits does not count in this case 

if they truly cared about the game they would not have reskinned mosquito lake they would have developed a new map but their laziness and greed definitely got the better of them heed this warning

this is the worst f2p game on the market currently the team managing this game are the greediest most incompetent and shady the admin elwoodiath2 runs all communication like a dictatorhitler there is absolutely no tolerance for criticism or even a hint of negative tone imagine you are frustrated you go on to discord and ask a question while saying something like is this seriously meant to be a fun mechanism as soon as the admin or a mod sees your post it will be deleted andor you being banned the admin has threatened to ban me or worseim not kidding thats exactly what he said so the level of professionalism doesnt exist 

the game it is extremely grindy in the 7 months ive played this game so far all i have seen are nerfs addition of bugs accidental addition of content thats broken and not ready for public release yet and a new map for high level players that is littered with bugs the team is so incompetent that i have not seen a single patch note that fixes the many bugs of the game i dont know if they dont care or if they just dont know how to fix the game to give you an example at night in the tunguska map the moon will appear in front of the tree box its a joke and people have mentioned several times over the months and its still not been fixed

early access its a complete lie all they are doing is adding grindnerfs and more content so people buy premium and  no bug fixes and 0 communication with the players no one knows when the next content patch is or if its a bug fix patch there is 0 communication btw the devs and the players how is this ea then

dictatorship ive already talked about how unprofessional the admin is and how they do not communicate and silence people who question them i wanted to mention a case study about paul he was an rf4 streamer and he was the most helpful player this game has ever seen if you google paul rf4 megasheet the first result is his excel sheet that just about everyone uses for this game he reasearched and made an excel sheet on the best ways to grind the game what happened was one day there was a quick patch and it was brought to the teams attention that a secret nerf took place after stating the facts and questioning the devs why the patch notes didnt mention them paul was warned and later on banned he was a good guy and geniunly helped the community his last words are over in his sheet

im mistah1n1 and i have streamed and made videos totalling several hundreds of hours and have tens of thousands of views total i have advertised and brought a positive light even the devs couldnt dream of but after noticing their actions i just cant recommend this game and support it anymore if you spend money on this game you are supporting the greediest dictators joke of a f2p game is this what you want to see all f2p gaming companies do i wouldnt be surprised if this was posted on discord or foum and a moddevadmin saw it and banned me on the forum and ingame right away

#####

it is a good game probably the best in terms of mechanics but once you start to progress in the game you realize it is impossible without constantly paying dont get fooled by the videos on the front page 

you have little to no room for experimentation because everything is so goddamn expensive thats half the fun gone progression is hard without paying for vip and this will be true once you reach level 28 and level 40 which is a soft capif you even make it that far 

the crafting and skills have also been changed throughout the years to require more resources to level up thus making it hard for p2w let alone f2p take the new update for example they have reduced the amount of bites you get from fishes mindblown they dont even hide it anymore

if i got this game for free i would send it back because its made to suck wallet your dry being addicted to this game is worst than being addicted to gambling this game only makes you lose

#####

a streamer sponsored by the game got caught scamming his viewers on video and admins and devs decided to witch hunt the people who showed the proof instead
they dont really care about their playerbase they just wanna make money and thats why the game is a grindfest

dont waste your time

biwhats goodib

 the most realistically portrayed fish of the popular sims out there
 a good variety of species to go at even at the beginner lake
 lots of viable tactics to suit any desired playstyle
 the best configuration of tackle lots of freedom and choice

these are definitely some of the best aspects of the game and it does them better than other popular fishing sims by quite a long way especially the fish seeing smaller up to the larger trophy sized versions of the species represented more realistically this is particularly true for the carp which in real life come in many shapes and sizes and this is reflected in game extensively 

the tackle setups are vast and flexible allowing the player to configure what rig and components they can use without much restriction on combinations even to the degree that you can make your own components such as leaders and lures 

unfortunately this doesnt outweigh the bad which really drags this game into the ground

biwhats badib

 excessively grindy
 plenty of unrealistic aspects of fish behaviour
 poor portrayal of tackle strength relative to fish strength
 slow and restrictive pace
 aggressive monetisation
 a poorly implemented talent system

im no stranger to grinding in fact i quite enjoy a lengthy grind this however borders on insanity catching a fish rewards the player with very very little which means you need to do it a lot of times to gather a meaningful amount of experience and currency silver in rf4 the fish youre targeting in the earlier levels are very easy to catch and pose no issue yet the unintended fish you occasionally hook on light tackle absolutely destroy you which feels punishing this leads to a very unrewarding and repetitive gameplay loop for many hours it also means meaningful progression is virtually non existent due to the price of equipment being staggeringly high ive upgraded my rods once in 111 hours and im on the cusp of getting to upgrade to my first set of carp gear just for something more interesting to do despite being advised against

like most fishing games they unrealistically represent the strength of tackle vs fish i fish a lot irl mostly targeting carp i use 55kg rated line to land carp to upwards of 15kg without fear however using a similar line in rs4 leaves 5kg carp to spool me this is most likely to serve the grindy progression curve rather than trying to be a realistic representation if i had to guess

every game has a meta and this is no different there is a best fish to target for experience and silver at different stages of the game and the difference between following the meta vs not is enough that it feels restrictive but not the end of the world this is mostly discovered through content creators online and through the rs4 discord this had led me to spend the majority of those 111 hours doing 3 different grinds which is a lot of time to sit doing one thing whilst feeling like youre not making any progress also the game makes 0 effort to put you anywhere close to the meta and its almost exclusively externally sourced information which is also a massive thumbs down this is mainly due to hotspots which are locations that popup and disappear at random if youre not fishing on a hotspot its basically not worth your time and its virtually impossible to find them yourself

as i got towards level 20 i realised that my skills and skill points were overtaking my silver and the thing holding me back was simply having the money to buy new equipment to make use of the skills and new locations i was unlocking within the skill treestalent system is crafting specifically crafting baits and groundbait which are strangely restrictive for such tasks as mixing some ingredients in a bucket or making dough however they also take a lot of your time and silver as fish require certain baits to be caught efficiently 

this together with the previous points sums up to feel like a sluggish and unpolished experience as theres just nothing rewarding about progressing in this system simply punishing the player for not having certain things and milestones instead feel like breadcrumbs to a starving man just not enough for the time ive invested this follows into the aggressive monetisation its likely the game is supposed to feel this horrid to get you to both subscribe with premium to gain more experience and skillups which exacerbates the pacing disparity and purchase large quantities of gold coins to catchup with gear both of which are vastly overpriced for the quality of game development present in this product for context this many hours into fishing planet i had an extensive range of tackle and were almost at the endgame

biimprovement suggestionsib

like a lot of games this really is only some tuning knobs away from being really quite good developers need to make money and im not opposed to simply making premium solve a lot of these problems which it doesnt right now 

 vast reduction in upfront tackle cost like rods and reels slight increase in consumable costs this would allow players to access higher level content whilst also still needing to spend a fair bit to keep fishing in these areas
 fish signs fizzers jumps rolls shows and such over hotspots to guide the player to the fish without them having to watch a youtube video these can be subtle but ingame indication is key and is more realistic
 premium increases silver earned by a considerable amount 50 this stops the progression disparity
 narrow the gap in fish strength to make tackle more versatile you shouldnt be able to catch catfish on light float gear but you should certainly be able to catch 5kg carp on the first feeder rods

right now im approximately 35 hours off of finishing my first basic carp setup which is just insane considering ive basically blined to it despite this being a suboptimal route i will likely play sparingly to try and achieve this just to see whats next and adjust the review accordingly if it happens to be better than thought 

as of writing this i cant recommend this game to a new player there are better overall experiences out there that simply respect your time more whilst they dont peak in the same aspects their lows are nowhere near as drastic as rf4s

#####

makes me forget about my mother and my father divorce 
1010 would recommend

#####

going to keep this review as simple as possible

pros

 good graphics
 good ambient sound
 great game play fighting fish is a fun experience
 large variety of rigs and customisation of those rigs note if you like the finicky side of rigs ie alteration of your leader depth off float etc you will love the endless customisation this game gives you
 large variety of baits
 quiver tip mechanics are very satisfying as someone that fishes this method a lot in the real world when the float goes under its also very realistic so all bite mechanics are really good


cons
 extremely slow in progression most will agree that its really bad when trying to progress even a little in this game
 everything is a grind and this paired with the slow progress is a real turn off
 when leveling bait you end up with more than you can use and youve only leveled it by 1
 the best rods and gear cost a lot of real world money which are 100s of pounds dollars etc so unless you own an oil company or have shares in banking youll never get the high end gear
 not enough info when targeting a certain species


overall i dont understand the direction in which this game is going it has all the ingredients to be fabulous but its such a slow grind it becomes not worth it compared to other fishing titles

dont be me and spend 285 hours hoping it will get easier because it doesnt

#####

after 42k hours i can say its the best fishing game by a long shot
its grindy yes but even at level 10 you can have an amazing time

and a big thumbs up for the devs who make an awesome job

#####

i hate my wife

#####

as for physics this is the only fishing game that got it right the only issue i have with this game is they botched the economy of the game you can spend real money but it gets you little to nothing you cannot avoid the grind

#####

needs more sex

#####

do not even try you get banned for silly reasons then they tell you that you can only get unbanned if you use their standalone version

#####

i think this game has the best fundamentals for the fishing game but its just terrible at execution

developers really catched and created pretty real atmosphere of fishing there are plenty o fish species each one has different habits and actually bites differently each one also fights differently  this is very important for a fish game you have authentic feeling that youve gone fishing

but execution of game progress is just terrible you are forced to spent countless hours people have several thousand hours in this game to actually get gear there are many choices for rod and reels but game forces you to actually buy several of them because ingame currency is so limited that you actually cant really experiment

also the problem with the game limitation of ingame currency for players created a spot metagaming that actually you have to participate if you want to succeed in this game and the funny thing is that developers seems really against sharing the spots  they want players to experiment in the game but the economy they created forces players to actually limit experimentation to low as possible because you are punished by the game for experimentation and this plays into microtransactions because player frustration is creating incentive for buying the gear for real money like 100200 euro for a piece

which actually brings me to the next point  developers are acting like theyre mad at the players d this is really funny to see but actually dev qa posts are pretty agressive towards the players that are using the game not as intended which is also really childish

this game lacks direction and is currently stagnating and game developers are forcing their vision without actually working with the game and community it seems like somebody from the outside plans features for this game

#####

please reconsider joining this game and do not spend even a single dollar on this game the developers does not deserve this money

the game developer needs to be aware of the chaos created by the chinese agent which himself hacks in the game and is now being a dictator and banning everyone who questions his actions in addition the server of the game had been terrible over the past month and the updates did not fix the problem but created more bugs that makes the game unplayable the compensation for all of this is only 7 days premium or 21 days if you have premium which is extremely low compared to how long the chaos has been lasting over a month the game developers should give players more respect give compensations that actually match the damage caused to your players fix all the bugs and replace the chinese agent with people who actually help run the game not parasites that suck away money from players and banning them you would only lose more and more players if any of these problems continue to persist in your game 
i would not suggest playing this game or buying gold coins in this game until all of these problems had been fixed

#####

after playing the game for half a year the game company has reduced the probability of catching fish time and time again and changed the size and price of the fish these days it feels that the strength and endurance of some fish have been obviously strengthened this is not stated in the update announcement after making a profit by selling new fishing rods and wheels the game company secretly modifies the genus of the fish without informing the players its a shameless act to achieve a compulsory balance of sexuality and now big fish are using gold coins to buy bait ordinary game coins to buy bait does not work this is really a greedy game company no integrity remind players to join cautiously

you can fish in water

i have 700h before steam release and it will become more but here is why i dont recomend it

russian fishing 4 probably is the best fihsing sim together with euro fishing but it still has some issues

first and key why i dont recomend it is their community team if you play just dont take part in the forum or you will get mad the team handling the community are with one of the new ones being an exception in my eyes a group of amateurs who are new to this kind of work 

one response to a complaint about making groundbait by a fed up social media worker on twitter looked like this thank you given how many times you were fucked were sure you must be a happy fellow wed love to get fucked as well unfortunately were tired and have a huge headache for being yelled at have a nice day 
other posts proofing that the community was given false informations were just deleted and the posters blocked thats not very professional
another example for the lack of professionalism is when they decide everything on a topic has been said they just delete every post with further comments on said topic also they dont communicate very well with each other cause after a server crash where people lost their fish the first people to complain got the silver for the fish after some time they decided that this would be too much and just stopped giving people the silver as comepensation they gave everyone 10 days of prem but regarless if you lost anything or not
when you ask for the exact amount the skillpoints buff your chances on a trophy you get no answer cause they know that those numbers are stupidly low which brings me to the things that are still going wrong in game

1 still no exact numbers of how much skill points buff your skills for all of them

2 skill progression for harvesting groundbait and lures is way too slow even with premium to get 100 in harvesting for example you need 1000h of normal skilling or invest an abnormal amount of silver
skill progression of the fishing techniques is ok if you have premium cause it doesnt limit your gaming experience that much

3 leaders and live baitsexcept for frogs they are op since the introduction of fluoro leaders the steel ones are basically useless cause you get 1 fishh and with fluro you just get snapped by the first bigger pike i dont get how this is considered real by the devs i fish with steel leaders exclusively when spinning cause there are pike in my water and never had any trouble hooking said pikes zander or catfish
the problem with live bait is similar even with fully skilled live bait you still catch only small fish my record is a pike that was smaller than the bait the whole reason to fish with live bait is to get bigger fish at the cost of bite rates i wouldnt mind low bite rates if i have a decent sized fish guaranteed my guess is that the devs who claim to be fishermen only fish for carps and the likes cause predator fishing is still not close to realism

4 hook sizes dont matter for the size of fish that bites i trust my 700h of gametime more than what the mods in forum say from my experience the only thing influenced by the size of the hook is the probability of losing the fish if the hook is too smallbig 100g fish biting continously on 10 hooks is very far from the so often stated realism

5 groundbait has too less of an impact

for me the rest is fine i cant really judge the shops being out of stock cause this stops being an issue at level 20 and i never minded the grind which also gets better as you reach volkhovlvl20 this takes a fairly long time tho with low gear if you dont like grinding tho dont pick up the game you wont catch a lot of different fish until later in the game

#####

incredibly slow without paying for stuff free to play players get almost nothing

#####

too much grinding too much donating oriented 
developers are lacking the understanding of players concerns

#####

fish

#####

been fishing in this game for over 500 hours now and havent caught a single russian
name is potentially misleading

#####

before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

the game is fun at start but later on turns into f2p money milking machine cleverly disguised as fishing game people are complaining on forums but threads are getting deleted just subscribe to steam forums and look how many times youll see the item was moved or deleted notification the same was done on external forums before steam release but it couldnt be tracked so easily

edit
i kept coming back from time to time and i can only say that it got worse game itself would do for players who dont mind a huge long grind but the community management and attitude towards players is outrageous
community is broken up into several regions everyone sits in some closed channels and ingame chat is basically dead forums and discord are ran and moderated by company staff and any complaints will result sooner or later in a ban if there is no real reason to ban you then they will take some word out of context and ban you for that even while they themselves know thats ridiculous and doesnt add up

for example few days ago a streamer who was very helpful to the community was banned just for complaining that there was clear nerf of new venue after server restart while there were no patch notes at all thats how it looks like youve been warned when you buy new 350 irl money worth reel to catch the new big fish thats on fire on newly released venue be aware that week later there might be nothing to catch on it after restart and when you complain you will get banned and your voice will not be heard

most crooked devs ive seen in 20 years of online gaming currently this game is aspiring to be rightfully called fraud

#####

i have 920 hours in this game and with time i will have more i believe 
but people dont play this game its fcking grinding non stop all the time you just have to grind to buy something or buy it with real money but prices for everything with gold are way too high and stupid
just dont ruin your life  dont download but if you allready did  delete it

#####

avoid this game staff rf4 act very abusive and are very rude at least polish region staff last weekend i took part of fish of the week quest in the game the goal was to catch a white bream close to 555 grams im new starter at lvl 20 so i bought bolognese rod and after few hours ive caught white bream 554g i was sure that i won to get price i had to provide screenshot name of the map coordinates bait and my ingame name on forum  ive provided all those data but by mistake i did it from my second account on monday ive notice that my name is not among the winners ive asked moderator why he ignored my post because my white bream was 554g and i should get the prize hes answered that my forum nick isnt the same as ingame name and he has to ignore my application ive informed him that in the rules there is no word that my forum name must be the same as ingame name so i should get my prize he has edited post with challenge rules and added requirement about the names took a screenshot and sent to me as a proof lol ive decided to inform administrator about this unfair behavior the answer was shocking because admin was very rude and informed that having two accounts is a violation of the license agreement he is going to ban me and he did it ive checked english eula and i havent found anything about multi accounts but in polish version it is illegal to own more than one account i didnt know about it because ive transferred my accounts from steam and no one warned me if i have other accounts i have to delete them i had lvl 20 and ive spent over 50 euro and im not going to play this game anymore avoid rf4 and do not spend money in this game

#####

good fishing simulator but spoiled by its revenue model

i have no problem spending some money on a game to help support and sustain it the people working on it need to make a living after all

but when in game items cost more than the real item on amazon you start to wonder why on earth that would be an acceptable revenue model yes i am looking at you 2 lures or 1 bait

i am enjoying the game but i refuse to pay the 15 for premium status because the cash shop pricing is simply outrageous

if you plan on getting into this game ensure to get familiar with how their revenue model works also know you can exchange  for gold and gold for silver which is the in game currency so basically you can purchase in game currency from the developer using a gold to silver exchange as an in between step

i also think the game should have been called korean fishing 4 instead of russian fishing 4 since this game has a cash shop and a grind that makes some korean cash shop games look like amateurs



650 hours still going strong on the challenge not to spend any money on this game i am hoping i get an achievement at 1000 hours for not spending any money on the game

hey 750 hours now nothing but server problems and extended server outages for 2024 going by the past several weeks i feel very good that i never got premium or gold for this game it feels good to have money in your pockets

and although they banned me from their steam forums for speaking my mind it does not matter to me since i can speak my mind in this review likely to be seen by many more viewers than the steam forum for the game
and hey karma will always come and get you

looks like karma really got them eh the overwhelming negative reviews on the store page speaks volumes to the current state of the game unfortunately the game developer seems to be more interested in throwing gasoline on the fire than actually listening to often paying customers speaks volumes about the future of this game

#####

its boring to play sober but it comes with a beer

#####

the creators just need to grab you in the beginning and give you the impression that it isnt so bad to spend a little money on it over and over again  solid business strategy but not one where the customer satisfaction is required

spend long hours to get anywhere in the gameafter 1000 hours you can afford some of the late game items when the fishing becomes a little fun but the cost of everything gets increased every update  you can pay to win to get around this 1000 hours of game time for hundreds of dollars

if you ask questions they dont want to answer they ban you

the game was fun once and you will need to constantly check web sites for the latest fishing spots before they go dry  but after playing for long hours it seems more like a scheme from a company  give a little bit and slowly take it away with the impression that if you spend money or more time it will get back to how it was it doesnt  i would suggest a different game from a creator not as money hungry but this is just a review from someone with 1400 hours of play time i may be wrong

#####

if you are new and are looking for a semi realistic fishing experience russian fishing was and probably still is on of the best out there on the f2p market however over the years of being on an off this game the devs made some poor decisions regarding gameplay lakes used to be well stocked communities would gather in spots and chat for hours but after a few updates people noticed they wasnt catching much at all if anything specifically bear lake and old burg both lakes had specific famous spots communities of players would gather to catch and have fun chatting away this all stopped once the devs completely slammed the spawnfinding rates of the fish and without any explanation this alone killed off a vast majority of the community they had growing and without any addresses at all on why and if they would revert these changes to catch rates people just stopped playing i hope this wasnt too much effort to read but i was a very passionate russian fishing 4 player and thought a review was needed

#####

the time i spent playing this game couldve been spent
studying
applying for jobs
making friends irl
getting a gf
spending time with my family
working out
becoming a better man in general

from the time i spent in this game i got
free russian lessons
anger management issues
sleep deprivation

1010 would never uninstall this game and correct my life

#####

so over games with micro trans and sub fees 
just let us buy the game and play it

review from a 2600hours player level 42

well started as a great game good graphics real looking fishing experience but over the few years the game economy is going out of control due to what i think is being too greedy

here are some of my opinions

1 being extremely grindy is completely fine but it does not give sufficient amount of rewards vs time invested in the game the core item costs way too much in real money and if you want to grind for particular end game item it will cost you weeks and months if not any less

2 zero trade  absolutely no economy unless you buy the gears in gold which is real money silverin game currency gears are nontradable and the cost of good silver items are just unthinkable

3 constant inflation on the good gears that people prefer tagara 10000 and venga 10000 prices have been increased continuously and guess what expect further inflated price if this is how they manage the game

4 premium is always forced if you want to stay in the trend

5 some fishing mechanism are left broken for years and not effective at all to use them as grinding method ex some fishing skills such as texas rig carolina rig and so many others

6 skill stats are not transparent enough it doesnt show how they exactly work and how much they will benefit your fishing experience investing in skill points on fishing skills have no general impacts groundbait skill and crafting skills definitely have noticeable boost from skill points

7 there is a server discrimination between steam server and rf4s own standalone server if you are on steam you cant join competitions hosted by the standalone server the servers are actually the same you can talk people regardless of their choices on the server

#####

who needs chat anyways i just want to fish

#####

in my opinion after tons of hours in the game and tons of money spent i can easily say people just have to migrate on other fishing games which are better fisher online first of all the gear you buy cost too much like one reel in the game is like you buy a reel in real life you letarally dont earn money and most of them you spent to repair gear fishing fights are just too much staying with a 200kg fish with best gear in game and fought it for more then 34 hours not even in real life you struggle like that with fishes water physics and fish physics in game doesnt exist you literally fish in a blue block that simulate water developers are slow to release updates and dont listen to comunity and also be frustrated if you report bugs or staff like that they aim to realism and tons of people think this is a simulation or a great fishing game it is not just a money grabber if you want to advance and if i could ask for money back i would do it till last dollar by the way try it for yourself and you will see if im saying bad things or just reality

#####

it doensnt matter if the game is good or bad if things like this happen
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1444200213
this is from the rf4 official forum where their customers are supposed to receive support
ps im not the banned guy im the one who was and still is worried about the money and the huge amount of time spent in their game

i was shocked to read that you can get your account banned simply by writing a joke in chat so i politely asked for a clarification but all i got was the post deleted and no further reply nor public or private
this is how they treat who pay their bills

i did hearread about people getting their posts deleted and their forum account banned simply for reporting bugs and saying what they dont like about the game
i thought they were just urban legends but now i know its all real they really handle every kind of criticism in the north korean style

god only knows how much they need to hear the criticism from their players to improve the game and get rid of stupid things like this
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1444201299
and this
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1444201874
yes some genius developer thought that making the ingame stores run out of stock was a good idea its like in real life they said
but in real life if something is out of stock its a few items not half the store
irl most of the time the items are in stock and when they run out of stock its for a couple of days here you have the items in stock for a couple of hours before they are out of stock again for weeks
irl if what you need is not in stock you can travel 200m more and find another shop with what you need in stock or you can order online and have what you need at home 2 days later
but not here so most of the time your progress in game gets stuck and you are tempted to uninstall the game

seriously this is the most idiotic feature i ever seen in my 20 years gaming experience but i cannot tell them i dont like it because i will get banned

in conclusion the game is a good fishing sim but due to the reasons above i cannot recommend this game to anyone

edit
another reason not to spend money in this game
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1463522968
this is all i got fishing with gold real money baits and the largest hook of the game size 40
the biggest fish is 18 cm long the smallest 7 cm
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1463524217
and they all ate a 25 cm large hook
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid1463525585

this is not a bug this is an intended mechanic of the game made to waste gold baits and milk more money out of the players
the proof is that the devs know about this since the russian only version and they never fixed it and all the complaints on their forums about this problem are promptly deleted

#####

please add vodka balalaika and putin

fish

#####

this game whenever i first started playing it was great and realistic i loved this game until the started to nerf everything and the devs denie it the devs will just say that the game is working as intended do not spend any money on this game because better rods dont improve the catch or the bit rate dont by premium because it really gives you nothing but xp and trade no xtra silver so you stay with bad rods at a higher level 6 months ago i would give this game a 5 star rating now i give it a no star rating because the devs destroyed their own game on perpose there is no real way to make silver anymore so they force you to us money to by stuff rip rf4 you had something great and you hurt yourself by greed hopefully you guys will learn that the players feed you

#####

i installed this as a joke
i have now sunk 23 hours into it and i dream of it at night
please help me

#####

people who rate this game as bad dont know how to fish or lazy to ask for help
i started as a noob and i learned and now im fine
its true that you need premium sometimes for a little push but not neccessary if you just want to enjoy
this is the most realistic fishing game ever made i played all kinds of fishing games and this is the one that i come back to every time

people who leave bad reviews here should delete them and go play some arcade fishing this game is good its not devs fault that its not your type of game

this game is the best fishing game out and its not even close i started earlier this week and i love it i left the other ftp game to try this and i wont be going back to the other game this game has micro transactions but unless you are in some hurry for no reason you dont need them although i do suggest the subscription because it gives you happy hour once per day which doubles your doubled experience points for 1 hour reviewers talking about breaking starting rods and getting snagged and having to spend money thats bs you get free starter rods once per hour and you get bait to go with it aswell you can eat for free to gain energy if you get snagged just log out and back in before you break anything and you will be un snagged check the cafe constantly and do your best to fill as many orders as you can the currency will come save up 149 silver and buy a starter fishing rod pack and then you have a rod and reel that will help you gain currency a little quicker dont be in a hurry to level ita fishing not a race go to yt and watch the beginner series that mdawggaming is doing right now he started it in december and its up to date he teaches you everything in this series that a new player needs to know and he is doing it as a ftp plyer spending no money 
this is a fishing simulation and not an arcade game like the other pft fishing game on here that means  people on yt cant tell you where to find the biggest fish in the lake like the other game it also means that  like real fishing you never know what is going to bite or how big it will be try the game for a few days and i think you will find it quite enjoyable its free after all

final edit this scummy developer not surprisingly refused to back up their claim that i cheated they knowingly falsely accused me of cheating and that is well established at this point youre out of your mind if you give these dirt bags your money

edit 2 weeks later and still they wont tell me what ive done ive reported them to steam though i know that wont accomplish anything

i last played this game around august or so of 2021 a few days ago i reinstalled the game and went to play for a bit i was met with a screen that said my account was blocked because of third party software that gave me an unfair advantage the only third party software i have thats even remotely tied to gaming is reshade i contacted this company through their forum and their website acknowledged i use reshade to remove blur from games that give me a headache

this morning i received their reply telling me that im a liar and that i didnt use only reshade interestingly they refused to tell me what i used why is this because i didnt use anything and their comically bad anticheat detected reshade and they refuse to acknowledge it if someone truly cheated playing your game something ive never done in this game or any other in my 43 years of life would you not say hey heres what you did heres the program we caught you using of course youd say that everyone would say that

but when youre a morally bankrupt studio one that designs a horrible anticheat program you dont do that you accuse the player of lying you absolutely refuse to prove your claim and you move on as if youre some kind of hero for falsely banning someone i gave them multiple opportunities to tell me what i did i was convinced it was reshade because it could only have been that their claim is that it was not and that im simply lying about the other program the other program they refuse to even name how very interesting

not once not one single time in my life have i cheated in a video game and ive played thousands starting in the mid 80s my steam account is more than a decade old hundreds of games played zero bans zero problems with any of them i even played this game for 73 hours with reshade installed you know the program that falsely triggered their anticheat which they refuse to admit with no problems

be warned this company will absolutely ban your account with a false claim of cheating attached ive never experienced this with a game in my life their ingame currency is very expensive im forever grateful that i never bought any understand that if you buy this currency if you play this game the odds of logging in and finding that youve been falsely banned is not zero its absolutely possible and maybe even probable look at my steam account tell me thats the account of a cheater tell me thats the account of someone who is going to start cheating for the first time in their entire life in a fishing video game tell me that makes any sense combine that with the fact that they refuse to even name which program they claim i was using do those things and tell me this is a company you want to support one that you trust to responsibly use their anticheat and acknowledge when it falsely detects a program like reshade and identifies it as a cheat

one of two things happened

1 reshade was detected as a cheat and they refuse to admit it which is why they completely made up the lie that theres another program without naming it

or

2 they periodically review accounts to see who has given them money for their premium currency and ban those who have not


me cheating is not one of them i have never and will never cheat in a video game wont happen im completely against it and anyone who knows me especially my gaming friends knows this avoid this company at all costs you are truly taking a massive gamble they will not act responsibly and they cannot be trusted they have no issue accusing you of being literally a lying cheat and wont for a second support their claim theyre scum plain and simple youve been warned if you decide to play this game and this happens to you you have nobody to blame but yourself understand you do not have to cheat to be banned for cheating and if you were foolish enough to give them money then again thats all on you if you read this review please dont believe this is an isolated case you very well may be next

edit one last thing i wanted to mention if i truly cheated which i objectively did not would they allow me to continue playing the game of course not but i can go to their website and download the game and login via the website and continue to playjust not on steam is this the behavior of a studio that genuinely believes you cheated nope not in the slightest if someone was cheating in your game you would never allow them to continue playing it why would you theyre a cheat after all right they refuse to prove their claim against me and they will continue to allow me to play the game via their website download both of these facts are completely inconsistent with a developer that believes you actually cheated they simply would not behave in this way if they truly believe i cheated this is their admission that their anticheat falsely detected a program without actually owning up to the fact that it happened

fish makes it worth a gillion dollars

on several occasions i purchased items with silver that i paid real usd for never received those items the last time i decided to file a support ticket i get an email back saying they refunded me 300 silver and then proceeded to accuse me of lying while at the same time telling me there was no way for them to track it then verbally threaten me with banning my account because they went through my chat history and found some naughty things i had said all of which were taken out of context accused me of making racist comments sent email back telling them not to threaten me an that their are no posted rules anywhere in game on what language is acceptable and is not acceptable along with the fact if they believe i made a racist comment that they were misunderstanding something as i am married to someone of color  i get email back saying due to threats racist remarks and threats against others my account was banned they had copied and highlighted several comments i had made in game all of which were not in their entirety they had only taken parts a few words out of conversations and tried to make like i was saying something i wasnt real dangerous company this is i am filing a complaint with the attorney general bit steam paypal and the consumer protection agency they also use the claim they are an american company even tho the only part of their company is the holding company who controls their money
edit 53019 1130pm
go read other negative reviews look at devs reply below  this should answer any questions you might have about investing time and money in this game devs and admins accuse you of things now just today accuse me of lying about everything in an attempt to steal money  goods from them and trying to scam them 
i might add the initial request started on steam was simply asking them where i could find my in game transaction history a steam forum admin replied asking me what the problem was and told me there is no way to see my in game transaction history then told me to go to their website and submit a support ticket he asked me what it was i didnt think i had gotten i explained that i had purchased many things but i know for a fact i did not get 2 of the hooks i had just bought one of the admins i dont remember if it was in the email or steam says to me well it is kinda hard for us to see what you didnt get if you dont know what your missing 
dumbfounded i explained to him if there is no way for me to view my in game transaction history it is kinda hard for me to tell what i didnt get with not being able to view your own transaction history you are left that their word you get no way for you yourself to see whether an item was purchased whether coin was deducted or your item received which is illegal it would be like going to a store and purchasing something and demanding a receipt and them refusing to give you one an claiming well if you end up needing a receipt you can just call and trust us 
now today i get this email from them 
you were given benefit of a doubt and given silver for items you did get after further review it became obvious you lied and lost the items in question as well as you sent threats tried to abuse the support team and the game as well as broke many rules on many occasions

glad i only gave them around 4000 of my money devs also abuse dev follow up review privileges to harass people who leave negative reviews reporting that as well
notice how they say in light of us trying to help you out i would be glad to show anyone upon request copies of all correspondence from them including the verbally abusive email i received from them as a solution
53119 7pm  again still sending me threatening emails making false accusations 
the only person making false statements is you starting from your first email about items you didnt get you clearly lied we have a record of that as well after that you tried tried to send threats posted private information defamatory deceptive information as well

you got ingame currency from us based on your deception and you still decided to break even more rules and regulations

all of this clearly falls under eula

at this point you are not only broke in game rules but lawful agreement as well and posting clearly provable defamatory and deceptive information that is illegal by law of any country

#####

so  i started playing this game like 5 months ago  at the beginning it was nice but once you keep getting higher in level you need gear and this game its made in a way that you wont make any silver at all  you need to spend real money to buy gold and get better gear  admins are not friendly at all and they are not helping or care what the community has to saythe giveaways made by the sponsored streamers and admins are won by theyr friends and the acolytes when you go on the forums and complain about this you are getting shut and posts deletedi literally cant save the silver to buy better gear unless i spend real money  lets say you make in a week 3k silver  12k silver to repair reels800 silver for lines500 silver for baitslures  how much silver i got left that week 500 a reel now is 28k silverwhen i am gonna save that silver what should i do i am gonna quit the game now  no point in keep playing it without spending money and i am not gonna spend money


this game its all about  real money  dont play it if you dont wanna spend money simple as that

i know that after posting this i wont get any fish anymoreadmins will take care of this be aware peeps 


best of luck and i hope my review is helpful


#####

was good at first clearly the game has turned into pay2win definitely not worth your time

#####

a game of patience 
willing to learn to fully understand the waters fish type spots equipment in order to perform well
singleplayer fishing game but with a multiplayer chat global statistics and hosting competition system

enjoying the relaxing non race or chase fishing as and when i pleased
crafting and simulating fishing
fishing and selling to fulfill cafe orders
hosting small competitions to keep my attention and knowledge of the lakes sharp

fully playable free
some small and short premium purchase to help with pushing  crafting  and certain  skill  progress and for 
making  skill reset  changes if required

still a long game of achievement chasing patience in accumulating capital to slowing gain equipment gear in each fishing field
taking detail notes of map locations fish types hooks and bait type could make life easier understanding what to use where and when to fish


having a great time

#####

the name for this game probably puts quite a few people off that imagine its a meme game or some kind of fishing specific to russia really the game is a simulation of european style coarse fishing but with venues that feature some of the especially huge fish that are only found in russa and nearby countries

#####

after 100 hours got banned with no repercussions

ill warn you right now do not say anything in chat keep the chat light like hello gratz and asking for information anything else will pretty much get you sent to prison island or banned

adminsmoderators are probably the worst thing about this game absolutely disgusting how they treat you and they wont give a shit if you sunk money in to this game or not

heres a gameplay review  

game itself is still in alpha and i suggest for now just staying away from it its only about 40 finished and so far updates have been coming out very scarcely

new players need to sink a lot of time and i mean a lot of time to figure out how everything works theres no real guides they just throw you into the game and you fight for yourself

what others have been saying this game is insane in terms of pay 2 win it will take you hundreds and hundreds of hours just to get a decent setup so you can be competent

biggest problem equipment if you dont get high star equipment reel etc your gear will break a lot and you will have to spend a lot of money on repairs so progression is going to be extremely slow

the best thing about this game is probably the community everyone is extra nice nobody fights but thats the only thing


in total 410 game is ruined by shitty money hungry devs abusive admins and moderators

dont bother honestly

#####

after a bit more than 400 hours i suppose i can finally feel confident i know enough to review this game ill focus on the questions you might have when you see a free fishing game and the tags it has or at least the questions i had when i first saw it so without any more delay heres my thoughts on russian fishing 4

the big one free how free is it i have not paid for over 400 hours now and ive enjoyed my time fishing so i would say it is very viable to play for free the price for premium is roughly on par with a normal mmos subscription at 12 euromonth  you get a few perks out of it but mostly its just extra exp so you get to level up faster and get to unlock other areas and skills easier

as for the multiplayer aspect i find this one just straight up weird only a few parts of this game appear to have any multiplayer to it aside from those parts it is essentially a single player game these parts are a leaderboard and chat function that one explains itself and makes sense a competition system but it isone that ive never found a use for since all the contests are in chinese or russian so i have no idea what theyre asking and they seem to be limited to higher level players anyway so for about 300 hours i never qualified to get in even if i could read it
the ability to send items to other players only if you have paid for premium and lastly the shop inventory can be sold out if other players buy a lot of it in a short time period
you do not get to sit next to a friend when fishing see others fishing or even really see what other people do at all your only interaction with others is through the chat window and the occasional message in chat when someone catches a sizable fish

the gameplay its fishing you cast lines and reel in fish you can fish with bait both by float fishing and bottom fishing and with lures both from the shore and by trolling the way you fish seems to have an effect on how well you catch things while time temperature and weather matter as well the detail is better than any ive seen before and it feels like you can actually control what you catch and whether youre successful by paying attention to the circumstances the gameplay itself is good you sell fish youve caught for money or can release them for bonus experience but thats not really an option you need the money

the progression however is less good ive spent a lot of time on it and i still use some of the beginner gear and ive still not unlocked most of the areas you never get enough money to buy anything and i know youre thinking they want you to buy the premium currency for it to skip the grind but they dont really support that if you buy premium currency to get gear you will need to spend around the price of an actual physical fishing rod to get early to mid level gear and that gear will deteriorate very quickly requiring that you pay even more to get it repaired
it is honestly cheaper to just buy a fishing rod and go do actual fishing than it is to try to spend money on gear in this game
your progression is limited mostly by money you can unlock new places by leveling up but what use do you have for a place known for fishing large carp if theyll destroy your gear with ease and then just swim away progression is very rough and there is no way to get around it you will always be struggling for money and be limited by your gear

in conclusion while i find it very strange how they handled balancing just about anything i have enjoyed my time playing russian fishing 4 and would recommend giving it a try if you enjoy the gameplay and just want to sit down and fish you might enjoy it too but dont expect to reel in huge fish or even just somewhat big fish youre going to be fishing in the same waters with your small rods for a very long time before you can unlock anything else

#####

tldr its 2000 two thousand us dollars for a lifetime premium subscription 250 for a fishing pole 150 reels

want to know a little more  okay so as a basic fishing game its not too bad at all really its actually kind of fun the problem is that its a sickening money grab thats hardly been rivaled on steam and ive seen some some real nasty development companies come at you with all theyve got this one guy though has managed to work his way into the hall of shame with his behavior i puke on his future residence in hell

at first blush it seems kind of innocent you can play for free etc but your best catches and best fish will always break your line your reel or your pole if you upgrade a bigger fish will be programmatically sent to break it my daughter and i noticed this pattern while we played wed both get a broken piece and lose a big fish wed upgrade get a decent fish then wed both get another pole breaker it happened within like 5 or 10 minutes of eachother every time so you know its in the code

you can save your hardearned ingame money for weeks to get a decent beginner fishing pole or you can pay him between 20 and 40 bucks and yes you can easily spend 250 on a single pole but no single pole does everything the weights and measures of the poles have been carefully set so that you need at least 3 poles to cover all your bases just for spinner fishing alone

anyway i suggest we find a better place to spend our time you cant spend time in bad company and expect good results leave now

#####

multiplayer means playing on a server but by yourself it is basically chat and leaderboards  why does it list multiplayer if you cant even play with friends  you cant see each other or sit in the same boat  never mind more complicated things like landing a friends fish  

three of us installed it for nothing  i was even dumb enough to pay for the weekend of premium   what a waste

#####

for the value  i would rate this one of the best games on steam  i originally picked it up as a free game that i expected to play for 15 or so minutes  i like fishing irl and thought it may be fun to tinker around with an rng based fishing  coin toss  

russian fishing 4 is so much more than that  

pros 
 theres a pretty diverse fishing spots you can explore the whole zone at your leisure very reminiscent of bass pro fishing games  walk or take a boat the exploration alone in rf4 is something to behold
 the fishing is miles deeper than i expected it to be  plenty of species to catch and more styles of fishing than i knew existed  theres 3 main types of fishing  bottom fishing  spin fishing  float fishing  of these three type each type has a multitude of different rig setups that you can use  im 163 hrs in and it has been keeping it interesting thus far  i have really only scratched the surface of what you can catch and i am still hyped about the m a s s i v e fish you can catch in this game  
 the selection of gear from fishing shops is very expansive  it can be pricey but i think it contributes to the gameplay loop  theres companies that produce lines of products that can be purchased at the various shops 
 like fishing the community can be hit or miss however the people that i have had the opportunity to communicateplay with have been super cool  i may have just been lucky but i found some nice anglers who helped set me up with some nice baits  if you read this review and decide to get rf4 hit me up  id be more than happy to pay it forward in the form of bait gear or tips 

cons
 rf4 is a bit of a time sink and its pretty slow going at first  i have seen people describe it as a free to play pay to win game i have played both as a freeplayer and as a subscribed player and can agree that the experience is more pleasant as a paid member  that being said the game doesnt change much when you subscribe  you gain experience at an increased rate which helps the game feel less grindy  at the moment i am pretty satisfied with my selection of lakes and gear so i am probably going to be on a free account for a while  
 multiplayer is a strong word for what you can find in rf4  everyone is instanced to their own lake so youre never going to run into another angler on the water  i enjoy that other players cant tarnish the good fishing holes but i would like to be able to invite another player to my instance so we could angle together  despite being instanced there is a chat log that shows the notable actions of the other players in your area or updates to global records so you can communicatecompare notes with other players  


all in all i really enjoy this game  i understand it is not for everyone but what the hell its free  give it a try

cant sex the fish

#####

i have played this game for 490 hours and was level 21 an thoroughly enjoying the grind until

one week ago a major update which has totally changed the game dynamics in the 490 hours of fishing previously i had caught 15k fish i would normally average 3050 in one hour real time 

since this update our skills trees have been altered and points reset so basically had to restart and add points to skills which hasnt helped in the slightest i am catching roughly 5 fish in two real hours
i keep crashing when visiting old burg lake

why fix something that wasnt broke rf4

i wont be playing any longer the whole game has changed and it is not enjoyable anymore

 updated review  771 hours played

id still recommend this game but only because it is f2p and it is quite impressive for a f2p game if you are considering putting real money into the game then i do not recommend the game if you feel that you need to put money into the game then stop playing it immediately it is just not worth it and it will be a waste of your hard earned cash

ive had a lot of fun in this game in the hours i have put in however when i first started playing when it was first released on steam it was a better game to play since its release the bite rates of fish seem to have plummeted to the point where even with three rods in the water you can sit there waiting for a bite that may not come for too long of a time

in terms of realism then its probably the best fishing sim available the feeling of fishing and the methods available to you to utilise are fantastic however the issue is that you have to level up to use all the different methods and leveling up even after paying for premium takes a very very long time an unfeasible amount of time

if bite rates in the game increased to the point that its no longer frustrating then it would be a very fun game but as it is at the moment its more frustrating 

if you just want a chill free fishing game and dont want to reach any sort of end game then i would recommend trying this game if you want to fish and feel like you are progressing towards bigger and better things catching a lot of fish along the way then avoid this game or at least try it but do not put really money into it 

positives 
 realistic apart from the bite rate
 choice of baits
 available methods of fishing

negatives
 extreme grind even if you invest real money
 the different methods of fishing are locked behind a progression system you will have to invest 1000s of hours to unlock them all if you pay premium it would be near impossible to unlock them all without paying real money for premium
 bite rate decreases this has happened over time and the player base has started to abandon the game as a result

there is a market for selling the in game fish which is affected by what is being caught and sold in the game at the time i quite like this feature but other do not

the ingame shops are stocked with a certain amount of items and sell out when people buy them in the game as it is all online again this is a feature which i quite liked but some other players did not

id recommend giving the game a go as its f2p but i would not recommend putting any real money into the game

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review on russian fishing 4 and it gets 350 likes and 150 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here

#####

the game is very realistic i did not catch anything in 5 minutes

#####

youll like it for the first 57 days or so once you understand prices of equipment and prices of fish get snagged and stuck in the middle of nowhere unable to move while your bottom fishing rod bells ring youll start to slowly change your mind overall it is relaxing with nice graphics and all that but the devs are definitely money hungry and you start to feel it a lot by the time you reach mid game if i could give this game some stars id give 3 of 5 i do still recommend it since i find the simulation itself done pretty well much superior to fishing planet yet the game needs to be polished a lot

i enjoyed this game before it came to steam started over when it came out on steam i have more hours than whats listed
i previously gave this game a hearty thumbs up

i have a mixed view on this at present
the pros are that it has a lot of aspects other fishing games do not have or cover from the feeder fishing etc
the negative has mostly been the grind especially the silver in game currency
its been the last few patches that have altered the game
and if they ever alter it back id alter my opinion

to sum it up quickly your better off making a screenshot of the game to stare at
this will just save you time and hassle go play a different fishing title you will thank me

they added this new thing apparently called migration apparently they didnt like people camping areas on bodys of water they found to work for them you know they overcame and  learned how to catch fish using the right bait time temp weather gear etc

the problem is its not actually migration 

migration would mean the fish would still be there just at a new spot
however in the game its actually like a switch thats been turned on or off
if you target a species you know likes edge of lillys for example you can go to every single one and still never get the bites not till some random number of real days pass and they turn it back on
this makes it so you have to jump lake to lake to see what you can get
the problem with that is the time it takes to find out whats biting and where
were not talking casual amount of time were talking way to much time
were talking waste your entire day on this game and get nowhere time
this is also problematic at lower levels where places to travel are limited

some think this is more realistic even though its not even actual migration becuase they say they like the difficulty these people are the minorty 
everyone ive spoke to hates it several have quit several others say they are going to take a break till its fixed if its fixed the family and friends i tried to get to play this game refuse to becuase of the grind before this change 
again you want to stare at a screen where nothing happens make a wallpaper of it and play something else

this game is not worthwhile to play at this time the grind went from over the top to out right demented imagine playing a game where they randomly made it so some areas didnt give you xp or loot every other day at random and made you find out where it was
some sick roleplayer with no life might enjoy that everyone else wont

i honestly hope they fix this so i and others can come back and enjoy it then again they might go the route other games have so cocky they just dont care and leave it as it is
only time will tell
till then avoid this game like the plauge

#####

love the game but seriously i may regret those first 3 words by the time im finished with this review iv got over 1100 hours in this game and am not one for complaining about a game that iv put so much time into all disconnects aside because those are all minor  but if i were to tell you that the support for the game is terrible it would be a discraseful  understatment all of the admin for this game will tell you that they can not answer your questions and that you should send in a request email to the adminrf4gameru  however coincidentally this request line turns into a never ending loop passed from 1 admin to another but in quick terms you will probbly never get a legitimate answer my next point is player base in polite terms if it were not for the players that the game draws in i would not play we work together and get along great in game and in the discord but lately it would seem that the discord managment and the game developers are trying there darndest to flush these lakes down the toilet because they are doing everything in there power to urinate on the player base and take away all vantage points that the game currently needs to keep there player base a massive one is the used gear mkt on the official discord we cant have that anymore and the admin cant tell us why we just cant have it it is a necessary page because there is currently no in game trade system to find used gear at a discounted price i know of a player who i play with daily that was banned for asking about this ordeal another point i have is related to the gear trading page and its necessity the gold prices are unreal upper level reels cost 50 and up each thats not counting rods line and lures its a free game to play and you can play without paying but your gonna have just as many if not more hours than me tied up in the game to have gear that will never make you any silver and last but not least pay to stream licences and ripping off the player base for premium and gold purchases if there servers go down for any time at all theres rarely any compensation has only been once in the history of the game and servers have been down alot it is now official that you can no longer stream the game in most countries unless you apply for and pay for a streaming licence through the game this is new dont know how it works you know honestly at this point i dont care because there trashing there advertisment upsetting there players and honestly i see the game developers going bankrupt in the near future with gear that is cheaper in real life and premium that has no benefits except for extra xp  its just bad and sad to see dont buy it on to the next game

#####

the best game ever playing for over 2 years on 3 accounts 1 for floating one for spinning and one for feeders  282623 levels need brains and patience to progress

#####

710 needs more vodka and bears

#####

the game is beautiful but it was the quickest uninstall ever dont be fooled by the multiplayer tag you cant actually fish with your friends its all about leaderboards stupid in my honest opinion it feels like false advertisement

#####

as most of you are probably wondering is this play to win game and the answer is both yes and no i played russian fishing 4 for about three weeks before i invested 20 this game is perfectly playable without paying a dime and some of the global world records for catching fish are done by new players with the most basic gear while others by veteran players with some really really expensive stuff 

this game is a time killer if you are looking for objective based linear gaming this is the wrong kind of game for you there are 10000 different lures and baits and a single degree in the weather can cause fish to stop biting a spot that was hot a day ago could go dry for the next week or month irl time 

pros
time consuming
relaxing
insane variety
russian video game feel

cons 
russian video game feel
not beginner friendly
time consuming
its hard to find help and guides for catching certain fish because the hot spots and hot baits are always changing

new player tips
better expensive lures and baits dont always mean morebigger fish
stronger fish that require hundreds of hours of gear to catch sell for less than some small fish
save money and invest in feeder fishing at lvl 6
save your skill reset until you are atleast level 15
fishing a few meters from shore is often better than casting far out 
sometimes moving just a yard or three left or right can cause no fish to become lots of fish


#####

55 game to all this game is a simulation which means its realistic at times u will find it hard to make silver other times the fish are popping to those with minimal time it may be a struggle but its worth it if u looking for a fish every cast u in the wrong game rate this 2110 over any fishing game remember this game is early acess less than 50 done

#####

best realistic fishing game from all fishing games i tried dont expect it to be a throw and catch game its a simulator not an arcade fishing  show skill and you will be rewarded   very nice nature and a lot of things to do from cooking to making baits etc flyfishing would be an awesome plus to this game and being able to make different flies like you can make the lures and the other fish baits the equipment in the shops is massive and you can chooose a lot the fish could bring a bit more silver but ok the game is still in development so the balance will come along  everyone who loves fishing will also like this fishing simulator d from me thumbs up d

#####

bear

#####

at lower levels easy to find fishgood quality fish it was fun to play during lower levels

once you hit level 2430 that is where the real game starts 1 fish per hour occasionally even with the right setups

i rather call this wasting time simulator too many bugs have to keep altf4 when all my rods have fish on due to my character is stuck

the developer dont bother listening to feedbacks or suggestion from the players instead they increase the prices of the reelsin silver to make the pay gold currency looks more attractive

there are many better fishing game out there

#####

imagine this 
its a dark night and the rain is pouring down outside youre stuck in a deadend job that youre completely unhappy with but you have to pay for your overpriced college somehow right youre piled up with stress from life and youre just looking for some bright side to your life you boot up russian fishing 4 now youre sitting in your trusty boat on a crystalclear river youre waiting patiently for a bite while being soothed by the sounds of the water the sunrise on the horizon and the soothing soundtrack of the game you catch a fish you feel so proud and from this digital environment you find yourself in a moment of tranquility no more student loans no more working no more pressure just beautiful landscapes and the pride of your catch

#####

this is literally the best free game ive ever played in my life im not speaking about just fishing games i mean all games this is the best free game ever

#####

russian fishing 4 as a fishing simulation game should have provided a relaxing and enjoyable fishing experience however the game planners actions of cheating monopolizing resources selling items and limiting the number of fish caught per hour have severely damaged fairness and gameplay experience

the planners manipulation of resources makes it difficult for average players to enjoy the game and destroys equitable competition the excessive sale of items overly commercializes the experience exploiting player enthusiasm the arbitrary limit on fishing undermines player freedom and the games playability

furthermore banning players on steam for negative reviews or feedback highlights the planners poor attitude towards criticism these actions not only infringe on players rights but also harm the development of a healthy game community

i like fishing

#####

i prefer to save my time by paying for a game once and enjoying all its details than wasting my time for a game that is called free  so beware of falling into the trap your time is more important than the free play trick

#####

before this game i did not even know that i liked vodka now very much  the fishing is pretty good too

#####

if you accidentally clicked on russian region at the start of the game  congraz  now everything is in russian language and you cannot change it you cannot change your region either 
oh yes  writing to support to change your language or region as advised on the official developers forum  you will receive a message  sorry we cant change your region from ru to other beware the support also writes in russian too so arm yourself with google translator
why should be simple when it can be hard

#####

grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to grind one fish species for hours so you can get enough money to be able to catch carp

#####

without a chinese agency team your game may receive more positive reviews think about when your negative reviews started

#####

realy enjoyed the game when i first started playing probably over a year ago have bought quite a bit ingame gold and premium quite a few times to help the devs out the game mechanics and the rpg element to the game was good for a while but once you hit a certain lvl the game just becomes a grindfest and the economy is just so rirdiculous and expensive if they even reduced some of the top tier stuff by 50 it would still be too expensive but more people would buy gold and premium if they did this

in my many years of gaming i have always said a happy player is a paying player but if you nickle and dime us it will only go for so long before people say screw this and thats exactly what ive said so after more than a year ive gone back to fishing planet and just waiting for the 5 new european lakes to come out and also feeder fishing rf4 has something great here if the devs can get the heads out of there as and listen to the community

#####

before this game i was experiencing extreme erectile disfunction after playing for just one day i now have constant unwanted erections but i couldnt be happier after experiencing depression for 10 years i feel cured and couldnt be happier with life after having pro at russian fishing 4 in my tinder profile for just one day i am now recieving more pumtang than i could ever handle i am now able to settle my payday loan debts by sending virtual fish to the bailiffs if you want to get your willy wet you should definitely get this game  1010 would definitely recommend

#####

a wonderful fishing game

#####

great game but censorship on forums is beyond a joke  everything added to the game lately is for the sole purpose of slowing you down

#####

warning the company russianforfishing are scammers

i played the game since 7 august 2020

on 30 december 2020 i received the following message when logging in

account blocks   the creation of a fake accounts 
httpswwwbilderuploadeubilda939cb1609390719pnghtml

i dont know what that means i only have a steam account
i spent about 150 euro on items there so i can only warn against the criminal company rf4

im a primordial gamer my first game was pong i was cheated for the first time by a gaming company

why does steam not delete scammers

#####

developers are simply too greedy you cant get ahead in the game without using real money the would be a decent game graphics and playability wise even now in beta but the fact that you can get nowhere in this game if you play free is just maddening usually ingame purchase economy based games have at least some playability when playing free but in this game its just hopeless waste of time to even try 
also the skills and crafting are very unclear and you cant really see what you need to do to reach a certain required skill even though it doesnt matter unless youre ready to fork some serious real money in this game
such a shame

#####

fishe

#####

nice game but developers are too greedy soo they massively incrised ingame silver price of items and decrease fish price that if the player want to buy high end items need to buy gold and buy with gold not silver back in the days i played this game 5h a day now i only play mybe for 2h in a week cose of that

#####

4 stars would be 5 but needs multiplayer players should be able to join eachother and fish together on the same bodys of water rather than sometimes seeing a fish that they catch in chat alltho  even that doesnt work for me half of the time

#####

this game will block players account who pay for membership but transfer items to other people even transferred very low value items this game will also block your account such game should not be placed on steam as this is much like a robbery activity

#####

fish

#####

i spend 45 mins for playing this game1 min for install43 mins 49 sec for connecting to the server
1 sec for disconnecting to the server and 10 sec for uninstall
good game

#####

it was better in 2019 but it is still enjoyable
if you are dedicated and independent plus have much time it is a almost perfect game to sink several thousand hours into it

if you only wanna have fun and rather quickly get to your goal or simply want brain afk catch and release gameplay then fishing planet is a better alternative for you

#####

fish

#####

for a free game this gets 1010 

the goods

regular updates and bug fixes new maps added regularly for no extra 
decent graphics not mindblowing but for a free game yeah it looks good
fluid gameplay ie walking around looks seamless enough fishing animations look good
fun mechanics satisfying when you reel in a real lunker
helpful and friendly community join lokidoki they helped me a ton with free items and tips to avoid grinding

the bads

pay to sort of win the game is grindy without a little premium time
the early game prepare to grind early to make in game money until you have more than one rod
the late game it will take a looooooooooooong time to get there
cant trade without premium  i cant stress enough how stupid this is
cant sell items yes you cannot sell items just fish

pro tips

feeder fish right away its the best money at the start
fish the bridge on old burg lake its the best money in the early game
troll kuori lake when you get there and spin fish yourself to death its the best mid game money

#####

first of all remember this is mobile games developer in our country all what they wants  your money first levels you will be very appriciated with catching fullhands of fish i played about year and can say about mid and highend content 
everything that makes profit will be nerfed every fish or bait that players found to make some reasonable profit already nerfed and they wont stop to bait you on donate so do not listen peoples with high level cuz they already farmed everything before nerfes and do not need money for new equipment
in second they think that they are unique smartass developers with own anticheat system but if some devs like  dice always communicate with players and community can make changes all remember bans from dice for using wolf overlay for teamspeak this freak never listen community
their unique migration of fish its just an shadowban for some time they never told details of this system but after few hours of good fishing u will be banned and will catch very small fish or even no fish at all 5 real hours without fish with place and lkes changing at 30 lvl  easy its like an energy bar in mobile games 
useless craft cuz all highen craft can be bought in shops  boilers in huge assortments
idiotic system with sizes of hooks u can catch 30g gibel and 22kg catfish on one hook 
there is no database and guides nerf and shadowbans i never can repeat any info from friends or forum about baits or places

dont waste ur time



#####

bad game cant sex with fish

#####

this game is about fishing and when i started played i got borried of mosquito and winding but when i got old burg i start grinding that game this is the best game when you up a level you get more and more interested in this game i will recommendend this game go fishing and go fun

#####

such a great game my favorite thing to do is shrink the resolution and play it at work in the corner

#####

absolute trash game over zealous admins a very poor business model and a constant feeling of being ripped off every time you log in the premium package for the game is scandalous at best with the only benefit being a slight increase in xp which is pointless after level 30 anyway the game has a great community but the community is constantly being let down with very odd choices being made to game play and features  the in game purchases for real money are very much geared around the russian player base whom are able to buy things for real money at a reduced rate to the rest of the player base  the catch rate and quality of the catches are also skewed towards the russian player base the game has also become awash with hackers which makes competing on the leader boards a pointless exercise the tutorial to the game is pretty much non existent as is the end game content avoid at all costs

#####

i went fishing in different russian areas but i couldnt go with a bear or even have some vodka the only thing i left with is a fish

#####

an amazing game that i have been playing since august 2017 the developers and admins are nice and are willing to answer question give it a try if you enjoy realistic fishing and developers that have a history with prvious games

#####

no actaull multiplayer kinda sucks why would i sit there alone instead of cracking a cold one with the boys

#####

da

#####

russian fishing 4 is the best fishing game in the market right now after spending 800 hours in game i have enjoyed my experience a lot

positives
 beautiful graphics
 almost endless grinding potential hunting for rare fish or collecting the trophies across multiple maps
 different play styles from bottom fishing to carping to float to spinning to marine fishing
 good progression system you can choose yourself which type of fishing you want to progress your account with

negatives
 premium is almost a must without it the progression could be slow at times and maps start to become a bit stale
 no multiplayer
 game could be a bit unforgiving

#####

do not play this game they keep turning the bite rates down in game currency cost is insane if you criticize them in discord you get banned they are money hungry devs that took a game with such amazing potential and turned it into a scam i have put a lot on time money and effort into this game and everyday it gets worse save yourself a lot of pain and do not play this game

#####

steam page says it has multiplayer from what i can tell there isnt

#####

this game is gods greatest creation prior to playing life was drab and meaningless but i have gained a new lease on life the serenity has grounded me and i feel as tho everything will be ok i love this game and i will sing praises for it till the day i am lowered 6 feet under 

1010

#####

in this game you can fish in your house i know its not the same as outside but its still very fun to play


#####

butldrub the best fishing game on the market with one of the worst grinds of any game ever made

if you prefer a video review urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvar9_apxoclu ive made one here url

i have about 10 hours on the steam version and a couple hundred hours on the nonsteam version if i didnt switch off the steam version my family shared library would be locked for most of the day every day not because the game is that good but because of the grind

dont get me wrong the game bcanb be enjoyable its probably the best fishing game on steam or elsewhere but the grind is so bad byoull be grinding for several hours a day for monthsb to finally be able start catching moderately large 510 kg fish this is like the black desert online of fishing games

to do this grind youll have to sit through large periods of time where the fish will not bite no matter what you try they will straight up stop existing for half an hour or more of real time then when they do show up chances are youre going to catch something you cant handle and your equipment will break this is extra bad because it costs ingame money that youve done hours of grinding to get just to repair your items that the fish can break at any point bought a 30 silver lure too bad the first fish that got hooked snapped the line before you could react go get another one

once you get past the first couple of items things start costing ihundreds or thousands of silver per single itemi buthis is absolutely insaneub you can fish for actual real life days just to afford a new reel then you have to go do even more grinding for the line and rod to match

i havent even gotten into the skill system and were already talking about dozens of hours of tedious boring gameplay the skill system is just the exact same grind but now with a chance to fail and get nothing for it

you may notice that im not mentioning the rest of the game at all thats because when it comes down to it the grind is such a devastatingly huge problem for the game that paying attention to any other aspect is really useless

#####

underestimated the cash grab was fun until you realize how much the devs force the grind

#####

the right way to relax your mind

#####

waste of time but a good waste of time if you got nothing to do 
pretty fun

#####

really grindy

#####

the game is wonderful but the business model is way way too greedy its essentially a p2w game where you will hit a wall and either grind for days on end for something or buy it this keeps looping

#####

too grindy its a fishing game yet you spend almost the first 60 ish hours barely catching bait and then yay you get excited cause you catch your first non bait fishand surprise all your gear broke and you cant repair it without grinding so guess what either pay or grind another 60 hours to repair your pole thatll get broken in 1 fish smdh i wanted to love it so badly but they dont want you to progress they just want you to grind

#####

fun game but a lot of grinding and hard to progress without buying stuff with real money

#####

if you are not in special list for admins  better dont play this game because only special people can catch a trophy normal players sit without a trophy 3050 hours and special people catch trophys everyday


#####

farm farm farm

#####

at first the game was fun but with all my hours im still only lvl 23 and the bite rate has gone to absolute st 
i really dont reccomend this game anymore because it has crearly devolved to a pay to have fun game
and the prices for ingame gold and premium are absolutely over the top

#####

catching ruski fish

#####

450hours by the time i am writting this review

this game is amazingly interresting but horribly managed i am playing it for years now alongside of all the others fishing game available in the market 

update after update they add lakes fish species equipment and add even more complexity in terms of different tackle you can setup  

but here comes the catch as i call it the fishing method and not the fisherman way the hacker way the more product you can purchase in game the more chance you spend real life money to get them because alongside of every update they are nerfing the fish spawnrate

in short for anyone not used to this game a good amount of silver  money ig  is 100200 silverh currently and it still a lot the endgame gear is around 30 000 silver for one reel a complete endgame feeder setup will cost you around 80 000 silver yes you understand right if you plane yourself on doing constantly 200 silverhours it will take you 400 hours to get one endgame rod and to make money you need 3 of them

but its not the end on your way grinding endgame you will have to repair your reel you can pay with real money and have it ready instantly or you can pay with silver  cost a lot  and you will have to wait hours real life to be able to use it again

another things is the skill system and currently the way they nerfed for the last 2 years constantly update after update fish biterate is  you have different three float bottom spinning in each three you have a  each fish you caught have a chance to increase ur skill by 0102 in 450hours im still at 832 bottom fishing

today ive spend 9 hours in front of my computer and ive caught a wopping total of 11 fish wich result into 85silver

thats what you get with this game do not play it ive tried to come back again to see if they fixed the things but no its even worst than before you will be amazed by the depth of the game but soon as you are hooked you know youre f you know the dice are rigged

i hope i save you sometimes


this game is only for the people who have a lot of real life money or the one that can play 18hday

#####

a potentially good game ruined by the baboons that call themselves devs all they care about is money theyre also going away from steam support and trying to force players onto their standaloneforums so they can control what they post free speech doesnt exist in russia you would have a better time putting lipstick on a goat and then sticking a lightbulb up your butt

#####

ye

#####

 well from 1 fishermen to the next  i have tried a few fishing games over the years the mechanics on how the line and reel work  as well as the fight with the fish works  it is 1 of the best out there there are so many things for you to do as well as fishing theres crafting  crafting lures  baits  food ect ect good progression as well there is ways to improve the game sure but hands down for a free game it is very good  for us fishermen it may not be what your use too as far as baits  and rig setups but you will work passed that because it really is good for a fishing game found myself going back to the game a few times enjoy 

#####

great game my wife recently left me and this helped me get through it all

#####

great game if you have endless time and real money to put in

#####

immense grind

#####

everything in game is so expensive and takes hundred of hours to grind out all the equipment

#####

is a really nice game but the devs transform this game in pay to win also if you pay to have good items you will not have a bite rate you will lose 6  8 hours in game to make 200  300 coins and a good reels is about 10k  30k devs wake up you guys  what is this bait rate 

#####

best fishing simulation available cant go wrong if you have patience and love fishing

#####

horrible dev staff cash grab only small fish if you catch any at all best bet go play the fisher online awesome dev and you actually catch fish premium is actually worth something biggest thing if you criticize rf4 on the steam forums you will get banned for some stupid excuse like spam which is what they did to me they use bots to give the game positive reviews and positive threads on the forums also avoid this game like the plague

#####

played dis game while drunk wanted to sexually asault a fish family 1010 would play again

#####

bannana

#####

really nice and chill game very complex for a free game worth a top spot in my steam list

#####

game is pretty solid tbh i really enjoy the mechanics of the game only thing i can say thats insane is the price of premium and gold absolutely insane pricing on the extra features of the game 810

#####

fun game but a lot of grinding and hard to progress without buying stuff with real money

#####

i really enjoy this game i have found it to be the best fishing game i have played
it has such good variety in types of fishing even though its just based in russia
the in game micro transactions are on the more expensive side but compared to other similar games much less needed to advance in the game i have over 250 hours and have not spent a cent yet  i feel a bit guilty because i really do enjoy this game and have not felt it to be a grind as the mechanics and the variety in this game are very good 
the multiplayer is a bit misleading as it is server based but the only interaction you have with others is through a chat box
all in all would recommend to give it a try

this is the best fishing game ive ever played
and i have been playing fishing games since the amiga 500

but this is a grind this is no fishing planet i have 1400 hours in the game so far and i still dont have all the gear i need
so if youre looking for a casual fishing game this might not be it but if ur ok with a grind with actually having to figure out how to catch each species and being ok with some days being slower than others this will be the best experience you have ever had on the computer
yes there are still things that arent balanced there are still things that are a bit klonky and some things are just plain stupid and yes the moderators has been doing some really counterproductive stuff on forums
but i must say that with the new mods coming in and with the more open dialog with the players the community and the dev team has never been closer
and just to get it out of the way
yes it is using the metric system most of the world uses it
yes you can buy items with real money  but gear is gated behind levels so you will never be able to buy youre way to success

at the end of the day this is a fun fun game but also super demanding and a bit of a time sink 

really its free so what do u have to lose 

#####

this game is by far the best fishing simulator on the market 10 thumbs up well done devs congrats on the steam release tight lines

#####

alright so i think ive waited long enough to review this game 

so i found this game on twitch a few months ago and put it on my list of things to try the day i finally went to go and try it wasnt expecting much cause i mean fishing as game 

wow just wow i was blown away immediately by everything this game has to offer it is very immersive with a lot to do its been almost three weeks to a month now and i am still not bored

i will say this i think a lot of people are being a bit hard on the game when it comes to certain aspects like leveling for example i didnt even really notice levels as a new player they just happened because in all honesty they dont mean everything you dont need to level watch there is so much to do right off the start yes it could feel a bit grindy but honestly i never noticed cause of the fun im level 24 now and i still dont notice

you have to learn the lakesrivers take your time sure there are spots that are well known for certain fish but youd be surprised how many arent even talked about most youtube information is dated so you kind of have to play around with different baits and things i have found a few fishing holes that i have never seen on youtube or a website

now i will say this the game isnt without flaw and im sure the dev team knows what they need to fixadd the only thing i found very annoying as a new player was the stock system sometimes items will be out of stock and its frustrating but in all honesty you dont need anything besides basic stuff to catch fish and at level 20 you unlock volkov which always has everything in stock i was around level 16 or 18 as a free to play player before i really needed to invest in a descent rig the stock system needs a bit of a rework but like i said its not as bad as people make it out to be

the discorddev team is kind of amazing they take time to respond to anyone who asks for help you can truly tell they care about their game if you need help the devsmods are there and they are fast to respond my hats off to these guys

the community is very nice and helpful there are no smug answers or disrespect i have encountered 0 of that so far

i think silver income for newbies could be increased but honestly again its kind of perfect the way it is because you have to take your time if your trying to rush you are playing the game wrong you wont know what to do

the repair system is somewhat silly but at the same time you shouldnt be blowing out your gear if you know what you are doing i think ive done 4 repairs in all this time and thats because honestly i believe its just cause one of my reels is very cheap i think it just needs a small rework not much

premium membership i really wanted to cover this because i see a lot of people who say dont get it till 20 i disagree i finally invested in premium at level 16 and it was so worth it i wish i would have had it the whole time i mean for what you pay to go to the movies or whatever the hours of enjoyment you get out of this game its very worth it im at 280 hours and spent around 15 bucks i call that a steal do you need to buy it no you could play this game and break records and everything else without ever paying a nickle 

gold i bought a small amount cause i had some steam wallet buildup from pubg i think i only bought like 5 dollars worth but honestly you dont need to buy gold sure you can but you dont need to i feel gold is a tad overpriced but not like people make it seem if it was just a little cheaper i could do it but i live on a tight budget but i do not feel hindered because i cant buy gold

btw there are daily tournaments hosted by adminsdevsmodsstreamers which pay out in gold premium items i have participated in one and won one it was 7 days of premium and it was awesome i didnt think i had a chance in the world cause a lot of those guys were level 35 but i managed to place 7th it was awesome and it proves that level again doesnt matter as much as you would think 

the fact the staff cares enough to run daily tournaments is awesome 

this game is just off the charts even if you hate fishing and your like on the fence about it give it a try its free and i think you will find many hours of enjoyment the devs are still working on the game and honestly its one of the best games ive played in a few years just bravo to the rf4 team for creating something so immersive and fun hands down one of the best games i have played in years


#####

ive been playing this during any available free time over the past few days and am really enjoying it all the possible gear combinations bait options weather effects and rpg elements involved in crafting your own groundbaits etc make for a genuine fishing experience i do wish though that it was a standalone version that i could pay a one time fee option for id happily pay 50 for a quality fishing simulation

#####

it  takes ages to get precentages so you can unlock rods reels etc

#####

you can get a fish


#####

the game itself is awesome and i mean it
it gives you a lot of fun athough its a bit grindy economy in the game sucks a bit getting top gear requires much time to get
but
the worst part about this title is admins unfortunately eula is badly written lacks of some rules you may get banned for breaking a rule that doesnt exist may be shocking in 2k18 but shows that russian in the name is there for a reason
game is really good admins can take you out for whatever they like choice is yours


#####

as someone who poured 1000 hours and close to 1000 bucks into this game i can tell you avoid it go play thefisher online instead hell even fishing planet if you want

game as it is ist solid grindy as fuck but solid biggest issue with this game are the devs ruling their forums and their game with an iron fist making absolute stupid choices for the game and cant take any sort of criticism without taking it personally

ive not played this in about 15 years since i got fed up about the behavior of the devs but now with the latest change to the mailsystem i cant stay silent anymore gotta show alteast some support for the community that i loved so much back in the day

if you want a game like this play thefisher online instead its cheap the premium ist 5 bucks per month and theres no stupid gold shop or whatever 
theres not as much content yet but whats there is much more enjoyable than what rf4 has to offer at this point but it willt grow and surpass rf4 eventually on all categories
also a big bonus you dont have to watch out at every corner to be shot by the adminteam 

kind regards a former supporter of this game

gg

#####

i wasnt sure what i was getting myself into with this game when i downloaded it it was a free game so i gave it a shot i love fishing and fishing games and after trying it i was hooked pun intended this game is a real grind and takes a lot to get far but if you love to grind it out in games as i do then you will love this one the whole community of players is great and willing to help you out just dont beg cause no one likes that in any game graphics are good and game play is smooth it does have bugs which sucks but thats how it goes with early access dev team is active in working out the kinks and adding new content
recommended

#####

the grind is real most of the time you will only catch small fish that barely gives you any exp doesnt matter how many lakes you unlock alot of activities only give you 01  02 xp sometimes you dont even get any experience at all it gets frustrating real quick

#####

you looking for an easy then this game is not for you it takes quite some time to get through the levels but at the same time its realistic you wont catch fish every day in the same spots but with the helping hand of the community spots arent hard to come by lake selection is pretty good considering you get 8 lakes which you unlock by leveling your fishermanwoman fish selection is pretty good and the rf4 team used actual names of lakesrivers with actual species from those waterbodies 

as said the grind is real but it never feels like a real grind to me i also stream the game and just love the fact that it is a relaxing game that gives me as a streamer the opportunity to interact with my viewers the best thing about the game is the diversity the game has something for everyone you like to spin fish they got you covered you love carp theres a spot for that

the 3 main ways of fishing are float spin bottom within them a broad selection of options
float bolognese telestick match rod
spin spinning baitcasting jerk bait
bottom feeder carp 
and even within those categories there is a broad variety of things u can pick from

on the side you get the options to make your own baits groundbaits and lures as well bit expensive for the starting players but as you lvl more and more affordable 

baits are available at the shop if they go into almost out of stock they will become available for gold until out of stock and you will have to wait for the restock during lower levels this is frustrating as some baits are not always available for lower lvls but be nice about it and people are always willing to help out the baits you will always see for gold are mostly baits you are or will be able to craft 

groundbait is needed for the feeders as a rod with a feeder but without food is less likely to get bites yeah thats how realistic this game is groundbait is pretty easy to lvl until lvl 30 then it starts to become a bit harder 

i myself have not ventured into making lures but from what i hear its expensive and something if you want to do maybe reserve it for later 

are there some faults yeah no game in early access is without faults but with your help things can made right so if u run into issues be so kind to report the issue on the rf4 forums or on steam overall im very happy to have found this game and for a good 45 months ive had a blast hope it will last for a long time 

if you want to check the game out or want to see a rf4 competition feel free to join in my stream at httptwitchtvdreamtrip 
we are an open community and love to help you guys out with all your questions for new players but also for the players that have been around

#####

i have been enjoying the game a lot to be fair though i hop on infrequently when i just want to  kick back and relax the look and sounds of the game are amazing if you are wanting to be competitive and try to be the best of the best then i can see where the grind is real and you will probably need to spend some real money to get to upper tier if like me you just wanted a game to relax and do some fishing and dont worry about being best of the best any time soon then this game is great i recommend playing with a nice set of headphones on so as to really enjoy the ambiance

#####

after playing more than 400 hours i cannot recommend this game although the idea and graphics are nice the first steps are fun but after all the whole game went to an endless grind  without a fish 
before nerfing the fish catching probaility it was hard like a korean mmo style to grind for better equipment but after the nerf it is almost impossible to get a decent top equipment unless you pay cash for it the economy of this game are horrible sometimes you should pay more money for pixel rodsreels like in real life
otherwise if you are not a time millionaire it could happen that after 34 hours of playing youd dont catch anything else like small trash ones yes like in real life but noone wants to burst his spare time for nothing and i think we players are thinking different as the developers about what reality simulator should look like
otherwise it didnt seem that the developers are listening to their customers if you dont mind you are a cash cow give a try otherwise look for another fishing simulator

#####

this is typical paytowin game you will need 23 years to play end content if you are not willing to spend a lot of real money the game as game is really nice fishing game

#####

you have to make sure everyone gets the fish the same and not just the russians and the chinese

#####

i play this game way too much and i love it

yeah still same thing but i do beluga fish now 

#####

you can fish in this game

stay away from this gameat start its goodbut once u hit level 25 u will understand that they are switching fish for u offthat happens to most playersu will get 10 fish in one hour that worth 60 silver on level 33 like meadmins are disasterthey banned half high level people for telling truth that game is a scam on forums and just milking moneydont even start to play itat least at the moment until they fix silver gain to x3 from this point

#####

it is a fishing simulator it is a fairly good one too which means sometimes you catch a fish most of the times you do not at the same time you may end up breaking your first rod as i did in the first 20 minutes of the actual game play because a big stupid fish took my bait and i did not know the game mechanics well enough   i have not spent a dime of real money yet and am not planning to either it is a gentle fun and if you want to get a fish every time go play a fish shop simulator

#####

i love fishing

#####

i have decided that i have played enough to properly judge this game
vvv__please read further__ vvv
what is russian fishing 4
rf4 is a fishing simulator with a free to play pay to avoid grind system the game is about the most realistic fishing game on steam at the moment 
is it payto win
	kindoflet me explain you can buy baiscally everything in game except fish duh with real curreny but that really does not help one any you are playing vs a random number generatorplayer knowlege is so much a greater factor to catching fish than tackle also the game is primarily singleplayer you only play in comps if you want to also comps are levelrestricted so any player who throws money at the game will be catapulted so high in level that he has to play vs pros
doi really have to wait a real 4 hrs to catch a fish
	sometimes but depends largely on your patience with the spot you are at and your bait if you set out to catch any fish you will catch any fish in a minute or less
is it really multiplayer 
more of a locationbased chatroom you can enter competitions but you see nobody else and if you mute chat you can feel like you are truely alone in the wilderness
pros
rodline phisics are the best that there is you are not looking at a line made of little rods
fish fights are realistic and feel like actual fish you can get fingerfatiuged fighting big ones
graphics are excellent
great community always ready to give adviceencouragement
large fish and location variety always a different thing to do glad its not luxemburg fishing
bait choices matter
craftable groundbaits with 100s of combinations
play tabbed out great for multitasking whlie doing work papers or watching your favorite youtuber
cons
large grind for good equipment i have 1k hrs ingame and still cant land fish bigger than 30 kg
a food system that you have to keep track of
it is not worth buying gold ingame currency with real money 1 gold is worth 250
and equivelent can be earned in 3 hrs ingame ingame reels bought with gold can cost 48000
online servers only no offline mode
fish fights take too long and fish tire unreasonably slowly to large tackle
metric stats only________________________________________
overall the game is very fun and is a great way to unwind from more intense games you will not catch as much fish as other games but planning the time and bait and finding that one secret spot and catching that one trophy is worth it also great game to play with friendsfamily


#####

best game ever

#####

i like fishing good game

#####

cant sex the fish 

#####

amazin fishing simulator very realistic you dont have to spend any money as long as you are willing to do bit of a grind

#####

this is the best fishing sim on the market but its let down by a frankly disgusting business model play it enjoy it but for gods sake dont spend money on it

i feel like this game would be enormously popular if it wasnt freemium and had properly paced progression as it stands you just have to accept the fact that youre not going anywhere fast 

alternatively you can spend huge amounts of money on premium gear to speed things along dont do that  there are much better ways to spend your money in life

#####

almost better than sex

#####

great fishing simulator i would rather to say the best one on the market full of options and accessibility beautiful graphics and physics good luck to everyone 


#####

this game is really fun and chill at the same time when u are catching a big fish it gets intesive and its hard to catch it my record for now is 25kg fish and i am a level 8 it took me minutes to catch it

#####

i didnt get far to be honest when i first registered in the game it asked me in which region am i playing i pressed russia and cis countries because russia is the closest to me being the neighbor of russia i thought that way the servers would be closer but it changed the language automatically to russian after that i was unable to change the language or region anymore also i tried signing out and reinstalled the game but it still doesnt matter now the game is in russian forever and makes it unplayable for me

#####

it could be a nice game but developers make it impossible to enjoy fish dont earn as much as cost of products and you need to grind many hours to gather some money it is not balanced at all

#####

the best fishing game ive played

#####


march 2024
i changed my review to recommended but be warned this is not a fishing game that you can just hop into and expect to max out everything in a week
it is grindy as hell and at times you will be frustrated by low bite rates generally all it takes is switching up your baitlure to get a better bite rate but sometimes you have to travel to another lakeriver
but when you get a trophy or even just a good sized fish on light gear the fun factor hits a high note
premium currency is still stupidly overpriced but it is totally optional
premium time is somewhat reasonably priced and can really help those just starting out but by level 20 you shouldnt need the xp boost anymore
premium time is also xp boost only it will not help you earn money
devs have been good about reimbursing players for lost premium time during the recent unexpected server problems
i lost about 8 hours premplay time and received 21 days prem time in compensation so they get a big thumbs up for that
there is  more gear in this game than most major sporting goods store carry irl
from easy to use float rods to complex carp and bottom fishing setups as well as the new map that is all salt water gear
hundreds of lures and more baits than anyone can master
community is pretty helpful 
there is both a discord and website that have hotspot sections so you can see where others are catching fish and what gear they are using

its not for everyone but if you like a chill fishing game with the odd wtf did i hook into moments you may enjoy rf4

#####

score  910 fishing category

#####

decent be better if you could see people in the lobbys

#####

fishing in russia simple as that

#####

not actually multiplayer it just has a leaderboard and a chat so they can slap the tags on it avoid if youre looking for a game to actually play with your mates the whole thing has the air of an elbourate scheme to milk as much money out of its playerbase as possible

cyka  10

one of the best fishing games and i am the generation that was playing games when they were on cassette tapes so i have seen them all i absolutely adore this game and am addicted to it

so let me give you some pros and cons

cons first but please read pros also
 no in depth tutorial learning curve is harsh for someone that knows nothing about fishing but there is a written guide on line
 not for people without patience and persistence you can grind and grind and set a new fishing rig just for it to be torn in a second by an eager pull and a big fish on
 fish is cheap gear is expensive not easy for new players

now what are the pros
 actually no in depth tutorial i also see as pros for some people people like me you learn and you feel you achieved something by starting from a rod flailing idiot to a fishermen that knows where you can find and what size fish
 the fact that it requires patience and persistence i am level 10 and i have broken 3 rods 2 reels and i dont know how many lines this is because i just wanted to progress as fast as possible but there are no shortcuts in this game you have to know your equipment and start from small to big you will not purchase a rod just to toss it aside in few days you will name and love that rod and that rig
 beautiful game dynamic surrounding great sound effects weather changes
 realistic game very close to real life fishing
 addictive game providing adrenaline rush and relaxing moments
 free game and not pushing you to invest real money
 so much content beside fishing  food drinks competitions challenges lure making bait finding you can share thing with other fishermen including hand made lures
 small details to provide atmosphere and life to the places you fish

now some advice for new players that will make this game very enjoyable and less frustrating at the very begging
1 you can eat at food trucks for free
2 do not underestimate free stuff you can get from the cabin
3 you can fish with 3 rods at the time that bamboo rod just landed me a 2 kg carp it was like that guy cleaning snow and slipping all over the place but i got it at the end so use the low level rods at a side as a way to get easy buck
4 spinning will get you harder earned money and xp than float fishing 
5 feeder rod is your friend to get fish hands off
6 do not be discouraged by how expensive everything is once you get three rigs going money will be flowing in
7 do not just speed trough locations starter locations are great to earn money to upgrade your rigs
8 do not be discouraged if you break or loose your equipment some days you will have bad luck others you will have good luck that will pay off for all that you lost
pssssst if you get a snag quit  you get back in no snag

at the end i would like to say that i had a very nice experience with i believe a staff member thank you 

i give this game 5010


#####

edit this game has been in early access for years now with no end in sight just a long money grabbing scheme and people still get drawn in its incredible  c

review date 30 december 2018 over 700 hours spent reviewing the game massive potential being wasted

review update 2 september 2019 only 1 thing changed in that time and that is servers became unstable and laggy due to poor maintenace even with such a low player base otherwise its exactly what i wrote below just a really bad scam be warned  and just btw nothing that the community asked for has been added in that time

warning non guaranteed pay2win with hellish developer feedbacksupport or any proper form of listening to the community

its p2w because you can buy a premium account which doubles your experience gain and you can buy gold and exchange it at an atm ingame for silver with which anything can be bought ingame except a few highend baits which can only be bought with real money or you spend 2000 hours or more grinding your skill to 100 just doing the same thing like a machine 
its non guaranteed because even when you level double as fast and get the best gear you will eventually have to spend hundreds of hours waiting for a fish to bite which can actually give you a fight and give you a fun experience as it stands right now it is faster and cheaper to buy real fishing gear and go fishing rather than waiting like a fool in this game 

every patch update or server restart in this game severely reduces the bite rate and size of the fish that bite many absolute records are still from 2017 since after that the devs must have gone greedy and the game completely went down the drain

the developers response and general approach to the community is extremely defensive negative and even aggresive in certain cases which caused 80 of the community to stay quiet leave or simply ignore the games downfall there is a penalty pond in the game for cheating or swearing however most players end up there because they have had some sort of disagreement with the devs in some cases over points that the developers themselves were clearly wrong of that doesnt matter though whatever the case 999 of the time youre gonna loose and sent to penalty pond or if you really annoy the devs they just lock your account for any reason they like

the game itself tries to lure and completely confuse the player at the start so when you have a fish got away or rig cut off by fish teeth you have no idea why or what and you think you have bad gear or little skill or low skill so you get into leveling and spend time just to find out its all irrelevant 
every single aspect like time weather gear skills baits place which you fish at or whatever else you want to imagine in your head is all just made to reduce the fish bite rate 
there is a simple fish algorythm which generates a fish every 49 minutes only when its sunny and can go down to like 1030 mins for 1 fish even small fish 90 of the time ingame you will actually be waiting for the fish rather than fighting them any kind of bait that the fish eats can hook you one making real money only baits seem like a joke because you can catch better fish on free baits since the algorythm doesnt really distinguish between them but rather just has a higher  chance of a certain fish biting on a certain bait however all those  in general are extremely low as it stands today

big fish bitingfightinggetting away would be another huge game stomper the way it is now developers say that if you fight a fish for long enough time and keep the line at the right tension the chances of fish escaping would be reduced to 0 despite that countless players are experiencing their big fish getting away although the conditons told by the developers are actually met the devs choose to simply ignore such facts and respond by blaming the player not taking the right actions

i have personally spent over 700 hours in this game from which 90 were spentcrafting and digging and drinking my crafted drinks and ofcoursewaiting  the game would be much more attractive to players if the name would be changed to russian waiting drinking crafting chatting or digging 4 because that is what you are going to do most of your time ingame leveling skills thinking that there going to bring in the bigger fish just to find out its all for nothing and that the algorythm doesnt differenciate between skills and is simply set for the biggest fish to bite on the lowest gear that could reel that fish in which is just completely irrational and tedious 

the only high level players left in the game are either devs streamers or old school players who dont want to give up the money and thousands of hour of their time spent ingame when it was still good everyone else comes for a little while and then leaves never to return because devs are simply acting like money grabbers

this game really has an immense potential and i will gladly rereview it in case the devs start listening to the community and make this a fishing game again but as it is right now i recommend everyone to stay away from this game and try out something else because in the end all you will get from this game a big slap in the face and your time gone for nothing

#####

its very goodthe fish is real

#####

i have played this game since the english version was released and it has always been a bit of a grind plus the costs of repairing your equiptment was ridiculously expensive but if you found a good fishing spot you could make a small profit on the fish that you caught and cover your costs for things like groundbaitbaitstravel costs and repair costs
the game is still in early access and although a lot of new content has been added new fishing venues equiptmentbaits ect the game is now a total grindfest the fish biterate has been really cut and the amount of fish has been drastically reduced as well as the sizes of the fish that you catch it used to be common to catch bream or tench over 3kg now you are extremely lucky to catch one over 2kg i used to fish the sura river and catch lots of bream i fished it the other day for 5 hours and caught one bream weighing 19kg i tried kuori lake which was a good place for bream fished for over 6 hours never caught one just roachsilver bream and white bream oh and the odd perch
anyone thinking of playing this game had better prepare for one long hard slog the devs have totally nerfed it to try and get the players to buy the premium access but if you arent catching anything whats the point 

#####

decent game but ruined by fakes

full of sponsored streamers that pretend its the best game ever so they can fill their pockets with free gear if youre good at being fake then play this game and youll never need to grind youll be lavished with freebies  not to mention the amount of boosted accounts they allow on public servers 

devs can do better with listening to the non fake community the game is far from the best ever and does need a lot of improvements 

been playing since it was even converted to english almost 1700 hours played  100 hours on steam 

before all the sponsored idiots and free gear being given out left right and center it was good now its just a case of who can sell themselves out the most

stop the sponsored omg best game ever idiots and go back to the games roots except the fakes everyone would be very happy with that decision 

also want to say something on the forums that may make the game look bad dont bother your post will be deleted faster than you typed it

and if youd like to facepalm at their customer service check this out lmao httpsimgurcomamnaztqd and to think that person wasnt even fired lol

#makerf4greatagain

#####

it is fun but after it is confusing and hard to know what to do after a while because they do not tell you what to do after the first part of the game there are a lot of shops and things to do and see a bit stressful need some one to help you and tell you what to do to  move further in the game but other than that it is a pretty looking game and a bit fun just need more help with the explaining of the game

#####

more chalenging than fishing planet

#####

it is a good game if you just wanna relax and fish

but if you are a minmaxer type or competitive beware because everything is ridiculously expensive you will either grind like  a mofo just to afford better gear or spend thousands of real dollars the prices and greed in this game put ea ubi and the rest to shame

oh and i have so few hours why they banned me because i have a memory scanning tool on my work pc
so instead of spending time in gamejail fishing 50kg fish in a stupid penitentiary lake i just created another account nonsteam and started over after 2 weeks i got bored because after you reach level 20 i swear they nerf the catching rate by 90 and it becomes extremely grindy so i uninstalled it with my other account too

#####

in a game where freedom of speech is nonexistent and game developers show no respect for players offering suggestions to improve the game falls on deaf ears criticizing the game results in immediate account suspension there is no freedom of speech in this game players risk being banned at any moment furthermore as a fishing game it fails to deliver the experience of actually catching fish theres no opportunity for exploration because despite spending significant time searching for specific fish species players find themselves unable to catch any instead they are confined to predefined locations where fish can be found feeling more like robots than adventurers the gap between the game world and reality is vast and i deeply regret playing this game

#####

give it a try if you have nothing to do

#####

nice

#####

grinding is toooooooooooo much

#####

every fish in this game down to a mussel is stronger than all my past relationships combined

#####

i like fish

#####

really cool game should try but would be even better if they make multiplayer

#####

very gud very nice

#####

devs are still putting in work give it a shot it is a great game

#####

it is a fun game to relax after a working day

#####

it seems the servers are always down or being restarted at the most active times

#####

quite a realistic fishing experience the weights of caught fishes are perfectly recreated loads of fishing supplies and custom baits
the only downside is  well its a russian fishing simulator so i assume when i use 3 bottles of vodka i should be having a nice shaking screen with some cccp national anthem vibes playing in the background 

i recommend




#####

where to start  a real injustice to one of the great pastimes to indulge in this game has been made by a team who really lack any basic knowledge in fishing or in the tackle needed the items in the shop get more expensive but are less robust as in you can buy a 26kg test rod for 2000 silver but the next upgrade  3600 silver the test drops to 15kg seriously what use is that when there are 100kg fish swimming around it is exactly the same for the reels and 99 of those are early game game reels with a max bs of between 510kg  the middle tier which are still ineffective are 1022kg  an 8kg wild carp will strip it unless you run after it half mile down the bankside you have no control over the fish they are just torpedos that run for hours and hours without tiring drag is a word not a setting it just fails these mid range reels will cost you 18009000 silver and dont really do much as most of the big fish will spool you anyway so it is a real waste of silver and to amass that amount is the biggest grindfest you are likely to undertake in any game you have played before hand
    i am level 28 the maximum reel is 22kg  and it is pretty much useless they have a condition bar that starts off 34 full and during the so called fight you lose condition so you constantly have to drink and eat to stay alive long enough to land your fish which is also harder to reel in once it stops fighting if it rains your condition will plumet or happiness level as its called nobody thought to add waterproofs to a fishing game or a catapult 
 you will hear various reviews from absolute amatures who are hobby anglers or fished once in their lives and call this a sim and the greatest of its kind i did this for a living and trust me its as close to a sim as elvis is to being donald trump in disguise there are rivers and lakes yet the only floats they have are pole floats and canal mini wagglers no river floats
when and if you open the skills which incidently do absolutely nothing you can use a waggler rod but you cant use the float until you skill another 10 and that takes months the day comes to use your waggler rod and float and you almost feel a sense of acheivement until you cast the 4 foot torpedo looking waggler into the dark murky depths as it surfaces you are left either falling about laughing or in total melt down for the time you wasted getting to this point the float sits above the water about 3 feet and looks more like a periscope from a uboat than a float  it is an utter failure  at this point i had to reskill and go the feeder fishing route as waggler fishing is broken beyond belief
 do not post your catches on the forum  do not suggest hotspots either as these will be nerfed and the fish will suddenly become smaller or disappear altogether in the cycle known as migration just remember nothing goes anywhere or eats different food sources unless they are specifically programmed to do so open your eyes and dont buy the lies
  the out od stock canundrum has been here since the beginning and is just a total farce you are told they get restocked but everybody buys it all so its out of stock again lies and that is how this game is generally put together as has been said by others stay away from the forums the admins are more toxic than the players anything you post that has the backing of the community will be deleted and you will be banned from the forum you will be accused of all manor of things except the truth that you know more than they do so the easiest solution is to silence you
   i would say this has to be the worse fishing game as a sim that is on the market incredibly punative and just belies the laws of physics all the while big brother is watching you in silence from the side bar it could of been a brilliant sim but the develpment team are not interested in anything you have to say they think they know best  i wish they did but they are sending this project to an early grave ignore the fanboishackersexploiters and staff they litter every game review
 trust me you need to be made of strong stuff to accept the premise of the gmae if you are not an angler then you might find somewhere in your heart for it but if fishing is your life and number 1 hobby dont even get started it will drive you insane please wake up devs and make the game properly success brings  going for  doesnt bring success
           so scared of my opinion i have been banned from every forum and hub to do with rf4 in an attempt to stop the truth of the game being told and the childish mentality of its admin staff namely lady of games who should be removed from steam altogether for being a bully and generally a toxic know nothing you people need to wise up it is not a simulator it is broken in more places than you realise dont bother posting on the forum seriously nothing will change all the bugs from a year ago on the russian server are all still there and on yours another greedy russian enterprise run by amateurs

#####

russian fishing 4 is by far the most realistic fishing game out there its fun challenging and bursting with potential flaws included hard not to judge even tho its an early acces game

positive points
 grafics are amazing 
 a true simulator yet not to hard to learn
 great great communitys around this game among the players 
 endless choice of gear bait rigs just anything you want and probably even more
 the learning curve urge to get bigger fish urge to be the one on the leaderboards
 competitve
 alot of fish species 
 mostly positive but the negative points will be a major turn down for most gamers

negative points
 economic system fails everybody knows it you will make thesame amount of money on level 8 compared to level 31 at the end of the day when you get to a high level and had to grind 500 hours just to get avarage gear you realise you might aswell grind for end game gear from the verry start there is no significant progress in making silver to improve your gear where is the fun in that 
 good stuff gets nerfed bad stuff gets boosted a never ending story of not having a clue how to bring balance a never ending story of trial and error wich leads fans who really believed in this game with passion to start hating it
 wasting so much time  researching googling comparing
 there is an ingame tutorial but its verry minimalistic if you really want to learn about the game you need to join the communitys and talk to people figure it out together write down stuff etc 
 service and support even tho i will allways support the team behind this game but it is well known and not a secret that the choice of mods sponsored streamers admins make no sense at all there are some really good staff members but overall we realize that the standards for assigning staff isnt really important to the devs feedback is not allways appreciated and you will not get consistant answers from some staff members some will help you like they should some will just blow you off or just ignore because they can 
 never ending grind for repairs groundbait gear 

overall
great game greatest potential ever seen in fishing games by far its worth to believe in this project as it is in early acces yet keep your feet on the ground making a great game is about feedback its up to developpers how to use it thousands and thousands of key feedback shouted from the roof its being heared not listened i really hope this game will step up rather sooner than later but im afraid the ppl who really care will never break the barrier of a stuborn and ignorant wall

i know the negative points are catching your eye in this review but overall i really love this game the frustration that basicly everyone feels is something we just have to deal with


additional review months after the first review i made

dont even botherthe unbearable and never rewarding grind in this game will never be gone 
if it wasnt for paying real money i would still be catching tench on oldbergdont spend money in rf4 because you will grind an unbearable amount of time just to lose everything you have earned to repair costs etc 
im playing this new fishing game and i meet old pals from rf4 everyday over here litteraly 8090 in this game put rf4 with the garbage where it belongsand the game is a succes and growing everyday so much for my endless tolerance i used to defend rf4 against all the complaints and all the hate no mather what and now i feel stupid for even believing rf4 is the worst pay to progress game ive ever seen they dont give a damn about you or reputation and imageworst marketing ever just read their social media and witness the most arrogant and narcistic mentality someone with an audience can possibly have

#####

there was no bear

#####

as i am posting this i have left and abandoned russian fishing 4 for several reasons which i will explaini already have about 275 hours spent in total on this game and have spent money on it multiple times

lately with the release of new small updates and patches russian fishing 4 has gotten very bland boring and deadthis was a pretty sudden change in the gamealmost every single riverlake in the game makes me spend hours just to catch small little fish that are hardly even worth anythingto explain a lttle better i will wxplain all of the problems that i have experienced with russian fishing 4
economy is horrible the price of equipment is far too high when compared to that of the price of fish that you catchbegginner rods that you would likely buy when starting the game cost around 200ish coins but you also have to then save up for a reel that is also worth a similar amount of and on top of that theres also the fishing lineleader and tackle wich are around 60ish coinsnow that we know the prices lets compare the money you receive for catching fish  2040 coins per irl hour on the begginner lakeand to make things worse if a big fish bites your bait it will likely break your rod or reel which to repair is 6070 of the price of the equipment in conclusion you earn less than you should to be able to afford better gear
for some reason fishsoft has decided to only focus on the new norwegian sea map making every other riverlake be almost completely deadthis means that you will likely spend 2030 minutes on catching a single fish this change has made me furious as i had already spent real money on this game for a resaonits become way too boring of a game that it isnt even worth your time or money
skill progression is very slow in the game you have to spend days maybe weeks to be able to buy a certain piece of equipment or use a different fishing methodit takes way too much time to unlock the most basic of skills like groundfishing for examplethe game feels way too tormenting and unrewarding and plain boring

i want to add that russian fishing 4 has some very great potential at being a more hardcore fishing gamethe problem is tha the developers are very lazy to fix even the easiest of issuesthey are very sensitive to any critique and simply ignore their playerbasefishsoft llc has pretty much thrown this game in the dumpster by ruining it with crappy updates and patchesi want more russianfishing 4 players and veterans to review bomb this game on steam on their forums so they would possibly listen and find out how bad the game really isfor now all we can do is post negative reviews and hope the developers change their minds for the better and finally fix the damn game 


these and various other obvious problems have caused me to no longer play russian fishing 4 and made my try some other fishing gamesi would rather have this game be a paid game so it wouldnt be entirely foscused on grinding day and night and having to spend real money on the gameits gotten to the point that it doesnt even feel relaxing anymore because in later levels russian fishing 4 will just drive you mad and make you impatienti advise you do not try and waste your time on russian fishing 4 and try some other free fishing game alternatives like fishing planet or maybe paid games like call of the wild the angler

#####

2 much p2w

#####

the gameplay is on point for something that is early access the game is a grindfest you dont need any rl cash to get started and progress ever in the game at level 14 i managed to place 2nd in my first tournament won a new spinning real for my level and free premium for 7 days the rig alone would have set me back at least 20hrs grinding the premium was just icing on the cake 

these devs i feel are heading in the right direction with the game its a niche title so it will be nice to see what they have planned in the future if you enjoy fishing rl and cannot get to the water all the time you will enjoy this game very much just remember if you enjoy the game its not a grind

i just started the game again 2 weeks ago after taking a break for 2 years  still no premium or gold purchased i managed to level up to 25 from level 18 and purchased 2 top line spinning reels for kouri at 24 with only the silver i grinded  2 beluga natora 8000s  at about 145k in silver 

i just needed to add this because of all the negative reviews about how there is no fish and you need to buy gold or purchase premium in order to enjoy the game which just isnt true the game is unforgiving and more of simulation if you dont do the research or have a plan before you spend any silver or take anytime to actually learn the mechanics of how the game works you wont make it passed level 10

2284 hours and counting

#####

best fishing game there is thats sure im a casual player and play once a while 

things i dont like
  water reflection feels like i have to play with sunglasses on 
  boat engine sounds is close to v8 forget about playing in terrible hangover
  grind is ridiculous atm if you dont use gold but you can enjoy playing without just forget those shiny new reels p
  lots of gears in shop that have no use whatsoever
  time  money sinks repairing items comeon i have to be logged in to watch mrrepairman fix my reels and rods you got to be kidding 
  i need now 3 new reels and grinding those would take about 150 to 400 hours or 300 euros 
  d d d

things i like
  lots of different fishes and they behave different some are like sunken russian submarines just dont want to surface
  can relax once in a while and get some fishes

well heres my toughts of the game its still in ea so who knows if it turns out to be awesome game

#####

great fishing game but tooo grindy it will take eternity to unlock new equipment if you are free player


#####

it literally took me an hour to catch a single fish which while realistic is still not fun

#####

freetoplay so theres a grind once you start figuring stuff out you hardly notice the grind anymore because youre busy pulling in fish

#####

too much of a cash grab and devs make changes so people would spend more money

#####

its great just hard to earn money

#####

this game is called russian fishing 4 i dont know if there are no fish in russia causing no fish in the game and the ingame chat channels are all promoting cheats and pornography the content causes strong discomfort the game official has left this matter unattended its really disappointing

#####

an excellent game ruined by an awful publisher

#####

fish

#####

for a free game this is fantastic so many fish varieties and locations it is a very indepth fishing experience with very cool mechanics my one complaint though is the slow progression i have 5 hours in the game and have only made it to level 5 new locations arent unlocked until level 12 so id imagine a minimum of 20 hours before you reach those areas however like i said best fishing game on the market and its free

#####

f is h

#####

dont waste time with this game comunity is enemy penalty is for everything for example if you have diferrent opinion as moderators atc game as it is is not so bad but behaveiour of comunity leaders is  ehm how to say it nice basicly its not nice if i would know before 2 months i wouldnt waste 500 hundreds hours of my life in this game and i didnt mention about grind its nearly impossible to get better gear which is rly expensive without gold so just dont play this

#####

hmm for most of the players i would not recommend this game i have to say aside from bad controls and some moderate disadvantages its quite simulative and that is the main reason  

imagine you are in the middle of nowhere in central russia on a small river or lake the grim and unpleasant forest around you with illkept houses rusty and rotten facilities some trash and no jokes empty bottles of vodka around its rainy you take your selfmade pitiful rod with float rig and simple bait its cold so you make a sip of strong and hot chai and munching hard piece of cheap bread go to take your fishing spot hour to an hour the only trophy youll achieve will be kinds of finger size fish or nothing the night will fall but there is no time to sleep you should fishing to feed your family seeing nothing in the darkness under a cold rain in the morning you have to sell taken fish before it had rotted for a few cents only if you are lucky after spending on your basic needs youll have some extra coins to buy vodka day after day day after day with no way to escape from this devils wheel be strong tovarisch that how the fishing goes on in wild russia

so if you want to feel true despair and depression of russian beggar fisherman on places devastated by poachers you should play

if not better dont waste your time

#####

its a decent fishing simulator but the cash shop is way overpriced im fine with spending money on free games but this game expects you to spend an extraordinary amount of money to get anywhere quickly it has potential and can be fun but be prepared to drop a lot of cash to a greedy developer to enjoy anything beyond the most basic of experiences

#####

russian fishing 4 has the largest assortments of food and beverages lures rods reels leaders lines and 500 different things and 1000s of variations of each i have never seen such level of realism and attention to detail in any game just wanted to get that out of the way first

the maps are incredibly well designed the physics and concept are life like i have not faced a single game breaking bug maybe snagging is an issue in low level players the concepts are hard to grasp and i recommend watching content creators like mdawg gaming and grozi fishing to learn how to pair rods and reels and leaders and techniques like jigging or knowing where and what clip to use for certain fish or when not to use a leader the official rf4 website also has a very detailed guide

if you have not used a store bought item it can be refunded for the same amount it was bought for is the best part of rf4 it has happened to me twice i bought a reel which i couldnt fit on a rod due to size restrictions and i refunded it instantly from the store i bought it

i have paid irl money for some rods and maps and it is well worth the price if you really want to spend do some research about what sort of equipment can go along or if you want to buy a map bypassing the level restriction and travel fee check out what rod and skill sets you need to fish there

theee best fishing simulatorrated by my friend who has played every fishing game ever and one of the finest games i played

#####

das is good

#####

it was so good that i uninstalled it

#####

pay to win

#####

very good

#####

very good fishing game

#####

this game was fun in the beta  then they started to ruin it with the updates
they incredible lower the biterate from the fishes the areas where fish bite are totally small now like a 2 m circle even the map is totaly big the whole crowd just have to sit in 1 place
in the beginning you could repair your rods now you have to buy new
u just have to wait to long to get a fish later in the game  it is not fun any more like before they patched it
i have 400 hours in the beta and the game became more garbage every patch  cause the devs making it a pay2win game
i stopped playing it  it not worth the time spending on it
even many players got blocked on the forum for criticizing the devs for the way the game is going

#####

the gameplay is great but the push for grinding and microtransactions is not  made more difficult by greedy devs id rather pay 20 for the game and not worry about needing to spend my hard earned coins on bread to survive

#####

heavy hip hop fashing

#####

very realistic

#####

at first game appears promising as you can wander around the fishery but soon you will see that it is far from 100 free roaming
invisible walls on random places succesfully stop your desire of discovering but still  it is better than in other sims where you can make only a few steps on the bank you discover fireplace with a cooking possibility and a fish smoker then you can also find a store a workshop a grocerie even a small bistro it gives promise for good atmosphere in game and some kind of role play
nothing more misleading

ingame tutorial is laughable if you want to learn something and find out how are things working you need to read one hundred page compendium of secret knowledge on www and you still dont know how to play xd

in the cafe you have quests for some particular fish species it is paid extra but only for species from this particular fishery you can skip it with premium p2w welcome to but you cannot even catch them because you dont have necessary eq and bait 
so the only way for you is to sell your catch on fish market for ludicrous pennies

basic fishing set is some kind of a nightmare you can buy better rod propably after a week or more of fishing hands down when you get 10 coins for your daily catch and new rod costs 300 before you buy something better you will spend many hoursdays trying not to throw your mouse on your lcd when again and again you see empty hook despite obvious bite

irl fish are not strategists they are skittish but dumb
tutorial explanation that this roach is biting this way and other is biting that way you just need to sense it is very handy when it comes to keep players in game without any catch in real life bite is usually just couple seconds  fish is tasting the bait and then takes it or not if you are an angler you know that the fishing bobber under the water is an obvious signal to strike considering  passage of time in the game bites can last even a quarter thats nonsense so if you see the bite just go and make some sandwich or watch episode of your favourite series when you come back fish propably will still be there or not because your waiting time was too short xd
today after an hour of fishing it was whole day in game i caught only 2 fish because a bite which looks like a bite was not a bite

russian fishing this fish is just braver and that fish is not yeah right why dont you make psychological profiles for them 
i think i dont have to mention that everything is easier with ingame currency which makes this sim another pay to win

game system is based on skill system how wonderful that you can learn how to make your own baits when on the start you can only make bread balls you can buy bread in grocerie and potato pieces i dont know where to find potatoes and what is the point of making all those baits if you simply cannot use it up because you dont catch that many fish
dont you even try to make a mistake with your skill selection because after one free skill change each another costs a lot of real money and it is so easy to make mistake because you dont know yet how the game works and what is worth to choose

other game nonsenses you cannot fish in the rain because your comfort level is going low and you can get sick so you need to wait in your home where you have absolutely nothing to do you cannot even use couch or armchair near the fireplace 
or you can risk your life fishing in the rain and then buy some medicine for 230 coins xd yeah those drugs will cost you an arm and a leg
you will not see other players at the fishery those are only nicknames on the chat and thats it you can see chat info about their actions but you cannot see them fishing thats how multiplayer in this game looks

so if you have nothing more reasonable to do with your time you could really enjoy this game or if you are a masochist and you like pain


#####

great game for killing time and catching all the fish broke my rod a few times trying to fish in the higher difficulty areas too early but fairly easy to gain the in game currency back

#####

tough but very nice fishing game 


#####

overpriced gold and premium pay 2 win

#####

i dont need to go outside to go fishing irl

#####

wonderful fishing game undermined by an extreme grind this game was definitely the best fishing game i had played very realistic a plethora of fish with different behaviors gear galore lovely graphics and many different ways to fish the game itself is enjoyable to play but the grind is absolutely unbearable early game you will make quick progress by the time you get to certain lakes you will not have the money or gear to fish even 50 of the species on the map when you do start making decent money it will be reduced due to buying things like expensive boat licenses that last for five hours or less smaller fish are worth so little you will catch many junk fish like perch chub and smaller carp species that will barely make you any silver perch will bite on hooks that are huge in lakes with much larger fish for some reason the prices on gear continue to go up i imagine some of the later gear items take hundreds of hours just to get one reel and rod ive played many grindy games like runescape wow ffxiv etc ive never quit one due to the grind this will be the first if you can accept that this game will soak up all your gaming time then i couldnt envision a more realistic game to fish on for everybody else  your time is better spent trying literally any other fishing game

#####

some time ago there was a free to play fishing game called fishing planet
it was the best fishing simulator out there it was completely free to play and very enjoyable the developers of the game were following the players feedback and the development of the game was going straight to the right direction
one day the developers made the bad decision to turn the development to another direction the game started to be more pay to win and less enjoyable and they started to ban everyone who tried to tell em wtf you doing
now you can find that game in the dictionary as the definition of the term pay to win only a bunch of fanboys are still playing it

russian fishing 4 replaced fishing planet taking the same development path and now its at the same turn

spending money on this game now is going to be a bad investment
if you want to play it you can do it for free for a while when the big grind kicks in just press the uninstall button and wait for the next fishing game

#####

basically ive never gotten a good fish theyre called trophies in this game there is a rariety even higher than that would recommend feels like a calm and relaxing game that you can do forever would love more content and more fish and more places to fishnot saying there is to few just saying that i want more d

some negs are maybe that the game isnt very well documented and its also pretty difficult to get the right stuff to find the fish you want there is documentation but its most of the time old and in a game where the fish changes locations and what lures they bite on its quite difficult at times also the beginning is a bit confusing with all the stores and things you can do beside fishing

#####

finally a realistic fishing simulator it is not  a catch fish simulator best fishing game ever  1500 hours played but you gotta spend a lot of time to grind it out 

#####

fishing i think

#####

worst support in all games ever i found a bug with a super fish and reported it mind you i was a bit rough in my language their response was its a feature and thats that i replied thanking them for nothing and i got ban ingame then i posted in steam forum what they have done and i got perm ban on the forum  so play the game and hope you dont need support

#####

most realstic fishing simulation you can get

#####

gud

#####

realistic fishing in an environment that is peaceful and almost hypnotic i really get lost n time playing this  game  so far no real money spent and i am enjoying the free to play without hassle or advertisement spamming  that you find in a lot of free to play games today if you like to fish and dont care about competition fishing this is the game for you  compete or not you will still have fun

#####

real fishing game very detailed equipment realistic artworks and gameplay leveling up is quite a challenge though but still doable too bad theres no controller set up it would be best chill experience to play this game with controller d

#####

this is a great game if you want to drink kvass and pump hard bass 

#####

its like fishing but in a russian way if you get what i mean

#####

i liked this game so much but after a while the more i know about the game the less i want to play it
the biggest 2 flaws are the p2w feature and trolling with a boat you attach the rod to the boat and just drive back and forth the fish catch themselves at least 10 times more often than in the regular way of fishing
p2v destroyed almost everything i liked in the game in less than 5 minutes and i played it for a long time

i understand that money is needed for the survival of this game but you could have found some less harmful way
no intention to insult but i think its better to spend time sitting and watching turkish soap series than to play this fishing unless there is a big change in the meantime
one suggestion split this game
1  where you would remove the purchase with real money or you can insert new looks of fishing rods etc as items in csgo dota2  where the real money purchase of items will not affect the players ingame performance
2  rearrange the trolling mode reduce the gold and experience of fish caught in this way or remove them completely so the game is at least a little balanced

then you can put it on the steam store under a different name and version with a price that suits you and i would buy it right away

#####

gud

#####

really realistic fishing game heres what i find annoying

1 controls feel way to smooth when rotating camera

2 legit most grindy game ever to actually get somewhere in this game you can either spend legit years
    or spend money which come on who does that for a fishing game

i do appreciate how realistic and how much their is in this game but you may as well make this game cost money then having to make spending money for digital money to get somewhere without spending years on a fishing game 

rating 410

#####

extremely pay to play  not just to win  in game economy is horrible  fights to land the fish if you even find them are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to long  devs are awkward to say it politely in regards to community requests 
basically  bcs there are almost no fish to catch  and bcs of prices for any decent gear this can just be called pro casting simulator 

not recommended at all 

#####

its a really nice game to play

#####

better than fishing planet

#####



#####

decent game russia i agree with america i dont very realistic sexy fishy sexy rod sexy water reminds me of when my dad died

#####

tldr  there is a survival aspect to the game that requires micromanaging and takes away from time spent actually fishing if you just want to get on and pull fish from the water this game is much more than that

i do recommend this game but it has what amounts to a fatal flaw for me survival mechanics i play several survival games and i love them especially the ones with fishing in them but there is a difference between a fishing game and a survival game with fishing when im in the mood for micromanaging my health thirst hunger stamina etc i play a survival game when im in the mood for pulling bucket mouths out of the salad so i can make the money to buy that next level rod and reel i play a fishing game

so for me the thought of having to micromanage survival aspects at the same time as all of the rest of the awesome mechanics the devs have executed so well makes me play less and less dynamic weather fish changing location short daynight cycle fish spoiling gear repair etc is all great and makes this game exceptional but the addition of survival plus only having 45 min to an hour to play on at a time on average means i spend most of my time micromanaging survival and side mechanics and very little time doing what i actually want to do fishing i turned it on this morning to do a little fishing but had to deal with getting comfortable first i turned it off and here i am

a if this were my game suggestion then it works as a survival element because it is a debuff and never a buff at least from what my lvl 12 experience has shown me maybe it could work better if the stats start at 0 and the foods you preparebuy buff one or all of the four stats giving you an edge according to what youre fishing for and where for example if you dont have the funds or foods to buff though you arent debuffed youre stats just fall to 0 and youre a basic fisherman if done correctly the devs can tie this to premium subs x amount of buff foods a month per sub and of course tie it to items bought in the shop for food prep and eating purchasable with silver or gold

sorry such a long post all of the crying and whining aside i love this game and would never not recommend it as it is better than a lot of other fishing games ive played consider this a constructive criticism idea and fyi not a complaint as it is a personal preference issue at the end of the day 



#####

best and most realistic fishing game ever made deep complex mechanics that require a lot of time in game to learn and master them tons of gear to choose from you never get bored because skill lines require massive ammount of time to unlock and theres always a lot to do in game good maps up to level 20 and above lvl 20 even better huge maps with a lot of features great crafting skills  very realistic long fights with big fish that can take even hour or more make this game the best fishing simulation ever made with no doubt i hope to see more and more things added to this game in the future only bad thing about it is russian in its name p

#####

too expensive to make any progress gets old real quick

#####

as everyone else said i love the game but its too money hungry i understand having to monetize a game but basically requiring a subscription to make any progress is a little rough on top of that the xp curve scales so fast that you need to buy gear with real money to stay at a decent progression pace i love the game but my pockets arent deep enough to continue playing

#####

a fishing game but no fish

#####

its like your fishing but your at home

#####

a wonderful fishing game i love the interactive parts of the game the boats shops and all of the other features bringing it to life i dont live where this simulator takes place but cheers to the developers

#####

best fishing game i have played in a long time the gold is way to much its 170 for all maps perma unlocked and it takes a long time to level and get money about 05 to 1 every fish need about 1k to 500 for stuff good to play but slow to get stuff and there is no multiplayer so kinda odd for a fishing game

#####

edit 1 month later turning this to a negative review until we get steam login back and bite rates are fixed

for now i will recommend this game due to the fact that i have spent a couple hundred of hours in the game before the steam release

but
a big but to start dont expect this game to be like other fishing games you have played you will sometimes go for hours catching very little fish and other times the fish are just flying onto your bait

the grind is intense and the little silver you make each day will be gobbled up by repair costs when you get to mid game lvl 20 and when you get end game reels you can kiss your silver goodbye forever thanks to the insane repair costs on the mayor and everest 

you will grind for weeksmonths just to get 1 basic feeder setup that can handle bigger fish like carp and sturgeon and you need 3 of them

as an extra bonus you get to wait hours real time hours without logging out of the game to repair a reel or rod or else the repair timer pauses

as for premium currency gold even with the current 75 off sale it is still ludicrously expensive and the sale on premium still costs more than playing the biggest pay to play mmos out there

the forums are also a serious mess and headache to navigate since everything is thrown into the same title and you need to sift for hours to find people who are ignored asking legitimate questions about changes that were not stated in the patch notes so rather just stick to steam discussion board

so after all the hoohaa about my opinion this game is still pretty enjoyable for loads of hours its only now thanks to the stupidly high repair costs on my big reels that i feel the fun is sucked out from constant stress about if i will be able to afford all the repairs and how long i need to grind for silver to pay my repairs instead of just logging in and enjoying the game i spent hundreds of hours in to buy my good equipment

#####

meh after over 100 hours of playing i can say that it is a good time killing game the price of the in game items in the currency that you get from selling fish are way over priced 95 of the silver you make in the game from selling your fish goes to repairing your gear what tiny bit that is left over you have to use for food and other provisions at the end of the day you really have to pay real money to make it enjoyable and to get better gear

as for the competitions until you have 500 hours in the game and you are level 40 i wouldnt even bother the guys doing the competitions and joining them have such insanely high level gear that they are pulling in fish in seconds that would take someone like me who is level 22 and has 100 hours in the game 20 minutes to pull in they do have some low level competitions every once in a great while but they are almost always restricted for float fishing or bottom fishing i personally love spin fishing so that is all i do in the game and i am never able to join those competitions

to conclude no i would not recommend this game as it currently is it is a fun way to kill time but there are plenty of other games out there that do that a lot better

update

as of today i have quit playing and uninstalled the game i made it up to 150 hours and just could not see wasting anymore of my time in the game from comparing playtime with close friends of mine just from my current level of 24 to get to level 28 to unlock the last 2 maps i would have to play another 300 hours it is insane to me that it takes 400500 hours in game just to unlock all of the different fishing locations of course though if you pay to play like they want you will get there faster maybe down the line once the game is out of early access i will give it another try but until then i doubt i will be playing it again keep in mind that it took me 150 hours to get to level 24 and 80 of that 150 hours i did pay for the premium subscription with the bonus xp

#####

best fishing game without doubt

#####

money grab game sucks you in early with fun and easy play soon devolves into pay to buy gear to not just win but to have any fun at all when the playerbase dips enough they add flashy new content to get people back and attract more new players and to compete with other fishing games but bet your bottom dollar the in game economy will never be worth a shit you will always be poor and grinding its sad because it approaches being the best fishing simulator there ever could be but then shits on itself with this bogus economy and their algorithms which make catch rates totally unrealistic
