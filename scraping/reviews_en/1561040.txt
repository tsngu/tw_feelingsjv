b great fun in the early game but tedious and tough in the late gameb

tldr in case you dont want to watch the video

1  this isnt your average cosy game  despite a beautifully drawn art style that resembles the genre

2 the base building and resource management are key elements in the game and micromanaging your  settlers in the early game is essential to surviving the storms

3 the variety of species and builds is also great

4  however towards the mid to late game the micromanaging starts to get tedious  i somehow wished there was a better way to scale into the late game instead of constantly having to repair and reinforce my structures before a random bout of bad rng luck sends 4 tidal waves my way ending an otherwise good run


i would recommend fans of base building colony survival games to keep an eye and wishlist diluvian winds  but wait for more updates to content and balance patches before committing to what  could potentially be a great game given some more development time

ps there is a free demo thats still available play that to get a sense of what this game is about

i am very sad to have to give this a thumbsdown i played the demo and really enjoyed it 

sadly the game is very poorly balanced one of your early goals is to store 120 units of wood to build something the wood cutter shed which takes up 2 squares stores 40 units building a second one adds 0 units of storage building a storage room which takes up 2 squares adds 15 units of storage now the storage rooms can store 3 different types of items but you cannot produce any of them in the beginning other than wood if you produce over your storage limit it is gone the next day so how are you supposed to store enough wood why wasnt the logistics of this thought through from the demo 

i specifically gave feedback on the balance issue early on in the demo version i addressed the issue of a lack of space how many people you need to have any chance at producing what you need and repairing after storms

as if in an attempt to make the game worse now if you build extra rooms you do not get extra travellers in the demo you had space for 2 and each extra room gave you space for one more i build 2 rooms and even waited until the coach left again after building the second room instead of getting 4 people my initial 4 left and i only ever got 3 afterward im not sure what has been done to the game i constantly lose 3 travellers and gain 3 travellers i cannot afford more wood for the fire because the storms sometimes come with only 1 day inbetween that means you have to fix the buildings and fix them again or let them go and hope they are not completely blown away

add to that that the repair costs can be completely mental you can use wood to reenforce to level 2 if a storm hits and damages a room back down to level 1 sometimes it costs 5 wood other times 2530 this is for rooms that have 2 squares they can be 5 wood or 2530 to repair i cannot see any logic to this if they were damaged to 0 level of reenforcement then they should cost 2530 wood okay but that is not what is happening the storage rooms are a waste of my resources because i have to have someone reenforce them after a storm however i cannot get more than 3 travellers at a time i have to produce wood to reenforce and i have to produce food plus they have to reenforce all rooms that were impacted by the storm 

this needs to be balanced also why use a trash can symbol for cleaning i thought it was to delete a room or a character this used to have a broom not every change is a good or sensible change not all change is progress

im very disappointed in the poor shape this game is in its in worse shape than the demo was because of the issue with the travellers the release got pushed off and pushed off and pushed off i was hoping that it was to get it into a decent shape for early release but that is not what happened

#####

absolutely dismal tutorial is so long and unskippable that by the time you realize the game is not even ready for early release youve busted the 2h refund window do not buy finished the entire early release in 5 hours

#####

b tldr worth buying butwould wait a bit for first playthrough or rather skip the tutorialcampaign and learn everything on my own in endlessmode  b

ucontents 260523u
1 4 campaigns 1hr ea which you cant continue in endlessmode and are forced to replay from scratch
2 with the missing content and lack of difficulty adjustment not that worthfun to play any longer than 4h

u prosu
 pixel graphic
 music and immersion
 chill game
 unique game dynamics
 tons of potential

u consu
 too easy no difficulty modifier yet
 lack of replayvalue since you have to do the exact same thing twice


u german indepth explanationu
spoiler
vorweg es ist ein early acess game das sollte jedem klar sein 
für alle die das game kaufen wollen 
finde es wichtig zu erwähnen dass man nach ca 45h intensiven spielens die bisherige hauptstory durchgespielt ist und man sich danach wieder ohne speicherstand im startmenü befindet 
der speicherstand wird nicht übernommen oder gar gespeichert und so beginnt man wieder bei null und dafür ist der inhalt finde ich nicht ausreichend motivierend um das freie spiel wirklich auszukosten 

es gibt momentan 4 campagnen a 1h die sind sehr gut wobei für fans von aufbausims und strategie das tutorial leider eher langweilt und man nur versagt weil man zu gut ist ich habe viel zu schnell dinge aus instinkt getan die erst viel später gewollt waren so musste ich zb gebäude wieder abreißen um sie an derselben stelle nochmal zu bauen  trotzdem ein sehr geiles game  

edit laut entwickler ist eine schwierigkeitsanpassung vorgesehen aber noch nicht umgesetzt ich würde denke das game noch etwas ruhen lassen bis die letzen schönheitsfehler rausgebügelt wurden um den meisten spaß zu haben
spoiler


#####

this game has a lot of potential for round based resource management game and it comes with great cute art style

but in current beta state the game is completely unplayable it crashes constantly especially on sandbox past day 50 i repeat the  game is unplayable in current state play against the storm instead best resource management game in history period

#####

desperately needs some rebalancing work starts off lenient and then becomes nearly impossible to prepare for storms even if you prioritize reinforcing your buildings also very repetitive but thats to be expected from this genre of game

#####

great game i finished the story in 5 hours so it is definitely still early access lots of fun and lots of potential for the game to grow

#####

i havent played for that long yet but im enyoing this immensely so far so i thought id leave a nice review to give it a boost because it really deserves it the gameplay is very fun great tutorial and the atmosphere is incredible
its only early access so im looking forward to whats to come in the future 

#####

i played the demo and loved it but im not enjoying the early release of the  game  its beautiful and its a quality management games but not for me  i find the game to be tedious theres not enough time between encounters to properly prepare for the storms i play a lot of managemenr and survival games but this ame is stressful and not in a good way

#####

the devs gifted me a key and i gotta say that im really looking forward to future updates the artstyle is cute and the building style is very reminiscent of spiritfarer there is a hint of an underlying story in the early access version and it has me curious as to what has happened to the world this may be more on the dark end of th spectrum not sure but i definitely plan to play more to find out once it releases

reading through some of the other reviews it sounds like they may have rebalanced things and listened to the community which would be awesome because some of the quests and grievences mentions are no longer in the game love to see devs listening to feedback 

if you like resource management and village builder sims then this game may just be for you

you can watch my livestream gameplay of the game over on my urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8eddn09kmlmlistpl0q93rkkmx_sx_r5w_o2kzf3nyu25rfppgaqbiaqbyoutube channelurl

#####

an adorable game with some glaring flaws this is only a soft thumbs down because a soft thumbs up doesnt get my point across

1 progression is currently very limited but also very vast you have many options at your disposal but your actual building space is barely enough to build the essentials when you buy higher tiered rooms youll often find you wont be able to fit them anywhere without demolishing your previous setup completely to make things worse rearranging buildings is a huge hassle that takes a lot of ingame days and rarely seems worth it

2 many options seem like theyre planned for a much larger layout and dont pay off currently why are dormitories even a thing when housing is much more flexible presumably it has to do with room level but seeing as thats not currently tied to anything they just seem like a subpar option

3 5ish hours of content at its current pricepoint isnt ihorriblei but its blatantly unfinished as is i was having a pretty good time until the game just kinda stonewalled me with thats it for now and suggested i try the score mode not really my thing

4 sure but what about sandbox mode without any goals the game is just survive without anything to strive towards i consistently overflowed my food and materials storage with nothing to spend them on making the survival bit not particularly threatening yes yes i can make it harder but the base difficulty is very low as is even at higher ones i cant imagine it being particularly rewarding

i wanna like it and ill keep it around for now until it gets updates but i think this one needed more time in the oven before any actual release even early access
heres to hoping the updates make it worthwhile

#####

finally got around to play the game and i have to say it is cozy calming and very cute just as i expected
great game to unwind on the end of the day for a few hours

#####

this is a fun game and im looking forward to the future of this game

#####

love it

#####

a very relaxing game about building and managing a small hamlet hosting travellers i enjoy it a lot so far the graphics are really cute i like all the different animals with their own specialties the story is nice i like the progression and the different possibilities you have for building spoilerabove and below waterspoiler and i love the many recipes you can discover

you have to play the story once in order to unlock the other game modes including sandbox which i guess makes sense since the story includes the tutorial but i think id still prefer to be able to play what i want right away it took me a bit over 25 hours to finish the story you can continue your game in sandbox mode afterwards
theres currently one difficulty available but the interface already shows that theres more to come in the future

be sure to check out the options because you can eg disable the cutscenes which repeat a lot and for me personally got annoying after a while

the free prologue is still available if youre not sure if this game is for you

update july 21
there are now 3 difficulties a photo mode and a useful help button where youll find the explanations again those are the biggest changes ive noticed so far i love the new challenge on hard 

#####

a cozy sit back and relax game for sure charming graphics and cute animal characters there i still more story being added with major updates but even without the story it is possible to sink hours into managing your little lighthouse settlement

#####

updatejan 2024 updating as developer released some content  well done 

i played prologue a lot and was counting days down until this was finally released into early access

pros
 very polished from start stuff just worked for me
 liked the idea of chapters though i had bad habit from prologue and tried to delay quests as much as possible which badly affected my first gameplay  then i learned and it all went as expected 
 

consideration points not necessarily cons to the game
strike missing feature roadmap  timeline studio said it will be added very soon so expecting they deliver  strike

 tough cataclysms i think the normal difficulty locked into hard one on release day as my newer gameplays were much easier  much less catastrophes there  lets see some challenged in apocalypse mode in future  
strike locked cataclysms seems the only bug i found so far  once you unlock underwater area it seems you only get geyser cataclysms from that point on tested for around 30 ingame days before giving upstrike
 sandbox is not really survival cataclysms dont get any tougher over time at least for first 5060 days or so which would mark end of scoring mode  consider adding that option to roadmap
 quicker cooking  choose recipe and the pot is immediately filled to minimum fulfilling that recipe also search in recipes with checkboxes what i need to increase metal production and morale oh that

cons
none real gamebreakers found so faralready almost 20h with bought version  only two minors
1 you cannot manage housinginhabitants freely which makes relocations problematic wait for disaster to destroy housing and then relocate  update moving houses is now doable but moving inhabitants is still tricky
2 escape opens menu and doesnt close existing popup windows actions etc  consider hotkeys example esc to just close what is opened until none is opened then its menu or maybe split it between q and f10 for immediate options

#####



#####

omg the characters are so cute xd i played it for an hour so far and im really enjoying it the gameplay feels very tight and varied it doesnt seem super complex so far i dont think this is a game that i will play for 100 hours but i think ill play it for 20 to 40 hours and love every bit of it and who knows the game is still early access so it might actually be more than that i had a great first impression so far

#####

im an enjoyer

review at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqseaja5i7eq
this game is amazing i love the artwork and the storyline interesting concept of the game on what choices you must make based on what you need for survival the concept of this game is a breath of fresh air and i cant wait to play more it is a well balanced game and gives you enough time for what you need to do ensure the survival of your buildings

#####

this game is a great concept that plays well and is already exciting even in early access i was eagerly awaiting the day it was released and bought it immediately

it plays like a worker placement board game which might be too predictable for some however it does have sudden weather events and other things that keep you guessing so i really cant recommend it enough

i love the art style and the weathercentric theme its hard to describe other than to say if you like board games such as fort or everdell then this will be right up your alley if youre not familiar with those basically they and diluvian winds have a nice variety of different animals to play and each has their own specialties and quirks you get each character for a limited amount of time so you have to optimize and make the most of each one as well as accommodating any individual wishes they might have which earn you research points the base building part of the game is really satisfying but it does force you to choose you dont have enough space to just build one of everything

the sound effects and animations are fantastic obvious effort went into polish and precision again it wont be for everybody but it knows exactly what its trying to be and it does that perfectly

#####

i want to start out with saying i did enjoy the first maybe hour the game play is cool to discover and interesting to think about it starts off by showing you the very basics but has a hard time explaining anything indepth until its a little too late to change anything after you discover all of the mechanics and fundamentals the game starts to have a repeating issue you seem to be pushing for one or two specific resources per day which makes the game seem like a chore the game has potential and im not sure what it needs to break the feeling of pushing through days to see the next story or new mechanic with all of this said id say the game is very interesting but not ready for purchase one of the worst things these games can do is release tons of little content patches so you feel like you constantly have to start over every patch for now i wont be recommending this game but in the next 6 months to a year i feel like this could be a gem

coming back to this review because they posted a few updates i really wanted to like and support this but the fact that they took maybe a month or two to post a road map is utterly ridiculous the first update is sandbox mode the story isnt even complete and the sky building which seemed like it would be at least half of the game is coming waaaaaaaaay down the road

i think im going to fully end this review by saying this game feels like a game made by good devs who dont play their game theres a few problems that they couldve fixed before it became playable that are easily noticed by someone wo a dev kit its slow to update but at least they seem to be listening to the player bases opinions on balance i originally said 6 months from my first review but i think id wait at least a year probably a year and a half to get this game maybe get it on sale and dont play until 10

#####

too early the demo was more promising 
25

#####

the tutorial is so boring that i will probably never get past it
click on the squirrel click on the space bar  repeat 30 times

#####

kinda not much content at all after the 4th chapter not much else to do

#####

so damn good reminds me of the ttbg everdale

#####

yes  currently missing sandbox mode difficulty settings and certain screen resolutions

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvupkkurx24ae

#####

画风很棒流程太短了虽然是early access但是内容很多都没出感觉是硬赶出来的时间线章节技能点模式都不完全的半成品之前试玩版用点数通关还更有意思写不出剧情没必要非做成故事模式

#####

sorry but no lack of proper 2k 2560x1440 resolution ruins everything and 2560x1080 is pretty my eyebleedfest for me for now im leaving negative review until devs will add proper 2k resolution

#####

a cute little management game 

#####

really fun game its cute cozy and has interesting mechanics 
ill definitely stay tuned for further updates cant wait 

#####

diluvian winds is a very relaxing and addictive game i never thought i would be so invested but i managed to play through over 30 days in one session and still feel like playing more theres some survival and strategy elements to it but it doesnt make you feel stressed out the art style is wonderful and the music is nice definitely recommend this to any wholesome gamers out there 

#####

i am really enjoying this game  very relaxing and fun  looks like they have added several different modes to fit different play styles  it is in early access right now so it should continue to see more updates over time  i love the art style and it has a very cozy board game like feel to it  i didnt find the tutorial super long or boring like some others found  i suggest watching a few playthroughs to see if its up your alley  

#####

i already played the demo for hours so when the full game came out i knew it would be a good time its a really cute and challenging management game that has been expanded upon in a great way its atmospheric intuitive and aesthetically pleasing great to play over and over again

#####

really like the game  please continue to add more features

#####

i really recommend this game it is cute and super fun

#####

its such a fun game even though its only in early access the current content is great the mechanics are fun and they arent too challenging while not feeling too repetitive either i am having and will continue to have a lot of fun for a good while
minor addition i am still having fun with this game played the next updates and still having a blast 

#####

absolutely love this game the design everything

#####

engaging gameplay

#####

fun game with great potential im sure the developers are going to make it better with time 
i must say i havent enjoyed a new game this much in a while so well done

#####

this game has a great story and is a fun management sim with a unique art style it has a lot of potential being it is still in early access

#####

this is adorable and i really enjoyed it so far my only concern is that there isnt much to do yet and the story is in its babyshoes so until its 10 release i wouldnt say too much about it all together

#####

really cool

#####

perfect cosy game it took a very long time for me to understand how to expand and then as soon as i got it i became unstoppable

#####

this game is so cozy and fun the music the art the rain sounds the cooking and unique recipes it reminds me of spirit farer without the sadness of collecting lost souls its so fun to manage the little village and get new travelers from the caravan every so often beautifully designed 1010

#####

very relaxing and cute game cant wait to see more content

#####

very charming game though i am really looking forward to the easy difficulty im at day 50something and it feels as if the ocean is trying to swallow me whole lol

other than that  game mechanics are quite easy to pick up on the story progresses a bit slowly for my taste though that may be a question of my resource management but is interesting enough pretty much exactly what it says on the tin looking forward to future updates  i favourited this one a long time ago and i dont regret my purchase at all keep it up

#####

atmospheric calming and addictive base management its simpler and more relaxing than other base builders where its easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of survival mechanics oxygen not included and is all round a lovely experience cant wait to see what they add during the early access period

#####

first play through i got to day 117 before i made a few mistakes and my fire went out second time i started on the chapter i died on and completed the beta its a really good mix of colony builder with some chill and some panic thrown in love the characters and the animation and art style
from sandbox mode and the road map there is a lot coming to this game and i cant wait neither can my son
 100 give it a try


#####

love this game


#####

so much fun had a little difficulty figuring out what to do to complete the questline as i got distracted building buildings i didnt need yet the art is so pretty and i loved the gameplay loop only bad thing was i finished the early access story just when it was clicking looking forward to more diluvian winds

#####

x3popcorn posted an excellent review and i would recommend checking theirs for detailed information 

ubin shortbu its definitely biworth buyingib but i would recommend waiting just a little for the first playthrough or skip the campaign story tutorial  and discover everything yourself in the sandbox endless mode

i finished the story in less than 3 hours not to say it wasnt good it was definitely fun but theres no real reason to rush back in for a second playthrough as theres nothing left to achieve uiyetiu

once the achievements and harder difficulties are released then therell be a real challenge to dive back into the game  but for now its just a wholesome few hour game with relaxing music cute aesthetics and a great artwork kudos to the artists

#####

game is fun while it lasts but very short 3 hours for me in all honesty not worth the full price unless you want to support the devs for early access still giving it a thumbs up however because i enjoyed it and want to see it completed successfully

#####

i think it is a fun base for a roguelike survival game really looking forward to seeing what long term progression looks like and what the end goals will be for this game when it develops more if you are looking for something more fully fleshed out for your money i would recommend waiting but if you just want a nice chill aesthetic game with choices that arent too crunchy give this a shot

#####

a really cute game that has a really refreshing while demanding gameplay
if you like management and turnbased games you might have some quality times an instant favorite for me and im really eager for the final version

#####

the game is really pretty and cute the gameplay is simple but complete we can feel its still early access but the game promise to be great

#####

i played the story mode for 35hrs to finish the early access part of it i liked the game but 4hrs is probably enough for me the loop was starting to feel repetitive for 26 im ok with it

#####

very pleasant experience graphic is lovely and i like the game mechanics after 6 hours of playing both story and sandbox mode i still enjoy it and willing to continue playing  which is good considering its ea looking forward to having difficulty modes as game on normal becomes quite easy after a while

#####

im willing to give this game a thumbs up despite it clearly being a work in progress  there is a definite level of love and attention given to the game mechanics and story  this game has some interesting ideas behind it which do generate an interesting gameplay loop

but its not ready for release  id actually say its probably way too early even for the kind of early release it was given  the game does not have any real flexibility in the early stages  its a tightly controlled gameplay loop that avoids the negative feedback of a rimworld game rimworld is a game where you are basically losing all the time but the frequent tidal waves generate a frustrating level of repair and restructuring that limits the creativity id like to use in building the base that my itinerant workers will be useing

this wont be for everyone but if you like base building this is definitely an interesting addition to your game library

#####

its  cutepunk

this game is all about resource management in the face of inclement weather frostpunk fans stop me if youve heard this one before but everything is very cute  i am marking it as recommended even though at this point early access there is not enough content to justify it quite yet 

 gameplay  solid basics needs quite a bit more depth and content some of the mechanics are fun but underutilized like the recipe book 
 graphics  adorable
 controls  fairly simple and easy to navigate ui need a couple of keyboard shortcuts for example to cancelgo back
 audio  tries to be atmospheric but ends up being atonal at times 



#####

gameplay is fun and promissing so far as the game is in early access alot of content is still missing and still being worked on will definetly be comming back to it as patches keep comming up

if i may have a suggestion for the developper  offer options for rehousing of inhabitants and restoring the default 3 tenthousing  its almost impossible to destroy a dormitory once made if you wanna move it

#####

a really nice wholesome game but with just enough pressure from resource management and random weather events to make it interesting as of writing it is still in early access but everything seems to work really well no bugs no crashes what they have currently feels polished there isnt a great deal of content up just yet but what is there is fun i cant wait to see what they add next

#####

good game is good

i really do like this game it is highly enjoyable and the early access offers a good glimpse as to whats to come i am looking forward to the sandbox mode once all the chapters are completed the game looks lovely and all the characters are super cute i absolutely love the art style i really cannot wait to keep following these developers as they continue their game

would recommend you give it a try

#####

i played almost two hours of the game in one run and i must say tha it is really neat  the conceptis really nice and for an ea it already has a ton of content no bugs for me and a polish level far into the skies would totally recommend it is a great game 

#####

i played the free demo till the end for few times so i knew the game is challenging and also keeps me focused
now as its early access if you want sandbox version theres no such yet i have played normal mode and it is really challenging to keep anything up other than few workshops i just got something fixed then another storm hit yet here i still play  i now started from chapter 3 which seems slightly easier but i assume you need to get there first 

what comes to playability all works great and graphics are awesome i love it just wish they finish more laid back mode one day 

#####

its a really fun city builder that just needs a few tweaks and more content its lacking in content right now seeing as ive reached the end of early access at 5 hours but im hopeful itll get fleshed out more

#####
