the people who make overwatch porn work harder than the people who make overwatch

alright lets actually provide a constructive review why are people review bombing overwatch 2

we paid for overwatch we supported it throughout its lifespan it was popular and liked by its community and turning a happy profit each year 

when blizzard announced overwatch 2 the big new feature they announced the entire premise that made it worth the sequel treatment was the pve campaign mode hero talent trees customizable abilities an expansive coop campaign that would add to the story and lore we were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldnt be putting out updates for overwatch any more they were reallocating the staff to work on this new project

with no updates and no content overwatch started to get stale people grew tired and bored spending less time in the game or moving on many of us stuck with the product playing a little each week just to keep fresh waiting for the new campaign mode for a lot of us playing became a chore something we were doing out of habit so wed be ready for the new campaign

but the new campaign wasnt the premise that established ow2 it was the pretext it was a lie blizzard abandoned the pve campaign a full year before ow2 launched  but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature its even in the announcement trailer for ow2 and on the roadmaps they knew theyd canned it 12 months earlier but they knew thats what people wanted so kept putting it front and centre to get peoples money to get people to buy into the project they took our trust and monetized it



what does ow2 actually offer then what did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldnt make content for ow1 the product people paid for and were supporting

1 they overhauled the graphical engine

before overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer and itd be smooth now it stutters and stammers in the menus theyve added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world heroes and environment alike  so where before heros would pop against the background and be easy to follow now everything has the same texture to it and it all merges together into visual noise  especially at longer ranges theyve compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos a pvp game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what youre looking at so you can react and compete and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled

the new engine also has a weird slippery feel to it reviewers whod played overwatch for 50 hours came into overwatch 2 and reported look its the same overwatch you love but its f2p now just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously feel like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing and they didnt understand why all the timings are messed up

2 they reworked most of the heroes

tldr they screwed up the game balance previously one of the biggest appeals of overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style and main them getting good at whatever suited you best some people like sniping or hitscan run and gun some people arent good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning tactics and strategy you could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy and paying attention to your surroundings and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference 

with overwatch 2 the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily now the one tank on the team is insanely chunky and its near impossible to kill them quickly  with healer support they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh everyone else dies almost immediately regardless of who their aggressor is 

teamfighting now is very onenote you have one tank whos immortal if they have support and you have four hitscan dps characters following them  theres not a lot of difference between supports and dps characters the teams try to pick off the other teams dpssupport characters and when they pick a few off they can finish the tank and take the objective repeat theres no room for variation in play style at all you either play a dps and try to kill the other team dps or you play a tank and try to position correctly  maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you

i understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights they wanted the game to feel more like other fps games  but for a large portion of overwatchs playerbase specifically the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter

3 they got incredibly greedy with the monetization

its a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming but overwatch was one of the few examples of lootboxes done right most of the longterm players of the game actually liked the system that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly i started playing ow1 with the first anniversary cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week and at the launch of ow2 i owned every single item in the game those who didnt have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted and lets be honest when you have your favourite skin how much do you care about unlocking other skins  and those who didnt want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it  if they wanted to

the new system puts almost everything behind a paywall the minute number of cosmetics on the free track are often insultingly lazy simple recolours or minor alterations while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for 20 the content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you even content from the first game that was originally free is now paid only

battlepass systems suck pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot if you dont you have to pay us more or lose the stuff you already paid for  limited time deals rotating shop offers fomo fomo fomo it reeks of manipulation and insincerity

4 occasional dlc packs of pve adventures

these are blizzards new approach to pve occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a pve mission you can pay in my uk currency 13 for the dlc pack or 35 the cost of a good indie game for the ultimate bundle

so heres the thing  this content is the same amount of content and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios  its just now instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up  now theyre paid dlc 

nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely it doesnt make anyone like adobe photoshop or microsoft office and it doesnt make anyone like blizzard



so this is why people are review bombing your game you took something we paid for supported and enjoyed for years lied to us about your plans and turned it into trash now youre telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for its greedy its cynical its manipulative and youve lost our trust

also you should fire bobby kotick

50 games of varying genres roughly around the same price range of the 15 dollar pve the more pricey games are in the range of the 40 dollar ultimate watchpoint pack in overwatch if you can afford the overwatch pve you can afford one of these great games 

if you are willing to drop 20 dollars for a skin for a single character they dont even have unique animations just slightly different voice lines you can drop 25 dollars for risk of rain 2

h1 overwatch 2 has no respect for you its an attempt to pry open your wallet while masquerading as the game it used to be h1

i picked up the game in 2016 and was instantly hooked like so many others overwatch remained my favourite shooter for years  even during the draught of content on the run up to ow2

while it retains its charming design wonderful cast of characters and some of the best multiplayer maps ive ever played on ow2 brought a few ienormous fundamental downgradesi that leave it critically flawed let me explain

b #1  heroes in battlepass b

the biggest change this alone put all the nails in the coffin 

overwatch is a game based around hero picks and team synergy every single character brings unique advantages pairing well with some and poorly with others overwatch used to have a few heroes introduced every year completely free for everyone to play overwatch 2 now expects you to either grind to unlock new characters or pony up cash for the battlepass to play them on release or 9 each for old characters

this doesnt sound game breaking at a first glance but now consider the fact byou can queue into competitive games without the full roster of charactersb

this is a core gameplay feature in a competitive game behind a paywall

how can there be fair competition if one team has more options than the other and purely because they paid for it sounds a bit like pay to win but ill let you decide for yourself

b #2  the battlepass itself and the new approach to cosmetics b

ive never really been opposed to the idea of battlepass systems but compared to other games ow2s passes are a joke each pass has 80 levels of stuff usually 8 skins with a very nice customisable one at the end and a bunch of other stuff to pad it out  as is the norm this filler stuff ranges from titles and nameplates to emotes i believe theyve recently added credits in there which is a great step forward but doesnt undo the aforementioned critical misstep of including core gameplay features behind a paywall

cosmetics have always been a huge part of overwatch the skins are designed by insanely talented artists with equally talented modellers these skins continue to be fantastic but the prices are insulting legendary skins ones that arent just recolours are on average around 20 each

these used to be obtained via lootboxes youd get one every level up which tends to be insanely frequent in my time playing i only bought boxes on a few occasions and still managed to get most skins for most characters most peoples argument for them bringing in the store was that the generous lootbox system was losing them money  this is simply wrong in 2019 3 years after launch overwatch had already made 1billion via lootboxes 

theres now essentially no free way to get skins unless you want to grind challenges for months on end for a single legendary

b #3  the pve b

i never had too much interest in the pve  but it was the driving point behind the whole idea of overwatch 2

thats what we were told anyway it ended up just being a bait and switch to implement all these new monetisation systems hell even after the cancellation of pve were still getting pve missions except theyre now being sold as individual packs just another way to squeeze your wallet

b in summary b

if you like competitive shooters  overwatch 2 has no competitive integrity

if you like collecting cosmetics  overwatch 2 expects you to hand over your entire wallet

the game is fun i still feel the experience i love so much in there its just damaged by such intrusive greed i cant recommend it to anyone

#####

according to the game director for this game being review bombed on steam isnt fun i have good news for him you are not being review bombed these are genuine honest reviews from your community whats not fun is when a developer promises a sequel to a game you love then proceeds to take the game you love offline then release the same game again with a 2 on the end and worse monetisation and none of the promised new features but you give the game ago because the dev persists in the lie that all those new features are coming for a few months then they announce that it was actually a lie the whole time and over watch 2 never existed it was always just a way to extract more money from rereleasing the same game then they spit in your face one more time by announcing an extremely watered down and diluted version of what was promised as paid dlc thats not a fun experience and that experience is why you are getting negative reviews if you want positive reviews give us overwatch 2 do that and il be the first to give you a positive review until then you get this

overwatch porn creators work harder than game developers

ibwhat were hoping to do with overwatch 2 is really redefine what a sequel meansbi
jeff kaplan 2019

iboverwatch is a team vs team u6v6u competitive experience and theres no way were losing that at allbi
jeff kaplan 2019

no wonder why papa jeff left the company
his vision of overwatch 2 has been completely destroyed

this is not boverwatch 2b this is just boverwatch 1 the crippled editionb

the main reason this game was called overwatch 2 was the announced and overly advertised pve missions with the new hero skill trees customizable abilities and hero progression and then after over 3 years of waiting basically everything pve related that was announced in this trailer was cancelled

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdzl1yguetji
iexcept the barebone story missions that are just 10 minutes long with no replayability at all and that you even have to pay 15 bucks to play themi

on top of that as an excuse for working for all the cancelled stuff they left in the dust the original game with 3 years of no content at all because they were focusing on making the sequel
so what they added in the new game after these 3 years of no content
list
a battle pass instead of loot boxes
the worst scummy monetization system ive ever seen literally everything has to be paid now including 7 year old skins that cost u19 eurosu each
5v5 instead of 6v6 which means a hero balance way more broken than before
only 3 new heroes a rate of 1 hero per year
6 new maps but they also bremovedb 5 maps
list
thats it what was the point of the 2 in the title then
is literally the same game as 2016 but with even less stuff than before
list
player levels gone
medals gone
end game cards gone
looking for group feature gone
onfire system gone initially and readded later as a new content lmfao
2cp mode they had no idea of how to balance it so they just removed it from the core game entirely
list
oh yeah almost forgot ubnew heroes are locked behind the battle passbu
imagine a game were switching heroes is part of his core gameplay but you cant pick a specific hero that may be useful in that moment because you havent unlocked it how stupid that sounds well blizzard thought it was a good idea

you want to play the new hero instantly buy the pass and youll unlock it right away
you dont want to buy the pass then be ready to grind like hell because you have to reach level 45 out of 80 of the bp to unlock the hero

as this wasnt enough who bought the original game in 2016 and spent thousands of hours like me has no choice but stop playing entirely or being stuck playing this hell of a mess with extremely predatory monetization because they ubshut downbu the original game despite saying that ow1 and ow2 were going to be playable together so theres no way back
hows that even fair

i httpstwittercomplayoverwatchstatus1190349407486529537 i

all those bad decisions led to this moment were they bcrawlb to steam and ask gaben to save their dying game and hoping something will change

company of clowns

h1 this company is not worth your money h1
they essentially scrapped everything they promised for pve and downgraded the game and are slowly reintroducing aspects of the first game and calling them updates
while the game play is still there the greed overshadows everything else

#####

love seeing the community working together so well

#####

bring back free loot boxes

#####

good game ruined by corporate greed and bad decision making

blizzard money method 
1 make a good game with an exciting esports scene
2 slowly ruin the game with shit updates
3 stop updating the game
4 announce a sequel that will add a new pve mode
5 dont update the game for years and let it die
6 finally revive it by releasing an uncomplete version of the sequel with the pve mode nowhere to be seen
7 add skins for 20 and make old skins 20 aswell you can get a skin for free every 7 months if you do all your challenges along with the worst battle pass ever created
8 disable multiple heroes on release because of some very easy to fix issues in how the game functioned but regularly release new skins instead of rolling a patch a few hours after the exploits were found
9 ruin the ranks system by replacing it with the worst ranking system ever created in video game history
10 playing the hero that you like and not sojourn roadhog soldier kiriko ana every match gg well played you have lost the game why bother somewhat equally balancing every hero
11 announce the death of overwatch league losing esports organizations millions in the process along with the millions that they lost when blizzard was simply refusing to update the game
12 announce the cancellation of the pve mode that made overwatch 2 have a 2 in the name
13 take what little pve content was ready and release it as a dlc for 15 so technically there is a new pve mode
14 become the #1 most negatively reviewed game on steam

instead of wasting your time and money on this game heres a recipe for a black forest cake or the portal cake

chocolate cake
 1 34 cups 250g allpurpose flour sifted
 23 cup 65g natural unsweetened cocoa powder sifted
 2 teaspoons baking soda
 1 teaspoon baking powder
 1 teaspoon salt
 2 cups 400g granulated sugar
 2 large eggs
 12 cup 120 ml neutral oil such as canola or vegetable oil
 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
 1 cup 240 ml buttermilk
 1 cup 240 ml hot water

cherries and cherry syrup
 1 cup drained canned cherries
 14 cup kirsch or another cherry liqueur
 cherry juice from canned cherries drain cherries and reserve the juice

whipped cream frosting
 3 cups 720 ml heavy cream cold
 12 cup 58g powdered sugar sifted

optional decorations
 200g7 oz chocolate shavings
 fresh whole cherries

instructions
 to make the chocolate cake preheat oven to 350f180c generously butter two 8inch cake pans that are at least 2inches high and dust with cocoa powder tapping the ramekins slightly to remove any excess
 in a large bowl place flour cocoa powder baking powder baking soda salt and sugar mix until combined set aside
 in a medium bowl mix together eggs oil vanilla buttermilk and water pour the water slowly so it wont cook the eggs whisk until smooth add egg mixture into flour mixture and mix until smooth dont overbeat  batter will be lumpy at first but mix gently and eventually stir with a whisk just until smooth the batter will be thin and liquid thats ok
 scrape batter into prepared pans bake cakes for 3035 minutes depending on your oven  this might take longer or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs allow to cool for 10 minutes in the pan before unmolding then let cakes cool completely on a wire rack i recommend wrapping the cakes in plastic wrap and refrigerate or freeze them for several hours before cutting them cut each cake layer in half horizontally

to make the syrup place drained cherries in a medium bowl and add to the bowl 14 cup kirsch and 12 cup cherry juice from can leave to soak at room temperature for 30 minutes or more then drain cherries in a sieve over a bowl keeping both the cherries and syrup add more cherry juice to the syrup to get 34 cup syrup you wont need the rest of the juice discard it or save for another use this will be the soaking syrup for the cake layers

they released overwatch 2 as a free to play business model which leans more heavily into microtransactions overpriced skins and predatory behaviour to make matters worse they shut down the first game making it unplayable for people who purchased it meaning the playerbase has to move over to this free to play business model to keep playing the game

but at least it will have a promised pve hero mode that would feature character progression which was a main part of the games selling point no that was cancelled but you can buy a lighter story mission for only 15 

dont support this predatory behaviour

#####

i dont know which blizzard treats worse its players or its female employees

#####

i have over 300 hours in battlenet 

i loved overwatch i think i still do love overwatch 1 the game i purchased which im no longer able to play 

blizzard stole my copy of overwatch 1 and replaced it with an altogether inferior product from its gameplay to its balancing to its microtransactions to its broken promises and outright lies 

dont spend any money on blizzard games they have demonstrated a willingness to lie and steal from their customers if you do give blizzard your money dont expect to be able to keep the product you enjoy forever like you would with any other product

big mistake coming to steam now you have the whole community critiquing your game accurately for all steam users to see

#####

#####

they forgot to add content for 3 years

#####

alright lets actually provide a constructive review why are people review bombing overwatch 2

we paid for overwatch we supported it throughout its lifespan it was popular and liked by its community and turning a happy profit each year

when blizzard announced overwatch 2 the big new feature they announced the entire premise that made it worth the sequel treatment was the pve campaign mode hero talent trees customizable abilities an expansive coop campaign that would add to the story and lore we were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldnt be putting out updates for overwatch any more they were reallocating the staff to work on this new project

with no updates and no content overwatch started to get stale people grew tired and bored spending less time in the game or moving on many of us stuck with the product playing a little each week just to keep fresh waiting for the new campaign mode for a lot of us playing became a chore something we were doing out of habit so wed be ready for the new campaign

but the new campaign wasnt the premise that established ow2 it was the pretext it was a lie blizzard abandoned the pve campaign a full year before ow2 launched  but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature its even in the announcement trailer for ow2 and on the roadmaps they knew theyd canned it 12 months earlier but they knew thats what people wanted so kept putting it front and centre to get peoples money to get people to buy into the project they took our trust and monetized it



what does ow2 actually offer then what did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldnt make content for ow1 the product people paid for and were supporting

1 they overhauled the graphical engine

before overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer and itd be smooth now it stutters and stammers in the menus theyve added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world heroes and environment alike  so where before heros would pop against the background and be easy to follow now everything has the same texture to it and it all merges together into visual noise  especially at longer ranges theyve compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos a pvp game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what youre looking at so you can react and compete and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled

the new engine also has a weird slippery feel to it reviewers whod played overwatch for 50 hours came into overwatch 2 and reported look its the same overwatch you love but its f2p now just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously feel like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing and they didnt understand why all the timings are messed up

2 they reworked most of the heroes

tldr they screwed up the game balance previously one of the biggest appeals of overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style and main them getting good at whatever suited you best some people like sniping or hitscan run and gun some people arent good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning tactics and strategy you could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy and paying attention to your surroundings and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference

with overwatch 2 the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily now the one tank on the team is insanely chunky and its near impossible to kill them quickly  with healer support they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh everyone else dies almost immediately regardless of who their aggressor is

teamfighting now is very onenote you have one tank whos immortal if they have support and you have four hitscan dps characters following them  theres not a lot of difference between supports and dps characters the teams try to pick off the other teams dpssupport characters and when they pick a few off they can finish the tank and take the objective repeat theres no room for variation in play style at all you either play a dps and try to kill the other team dps or you play a tank and try to position correctly  maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you

i understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights they wanted the game to feel more like other fps games  but for a large portion of overwatchs playerbase specifically the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter

3 they got incredibly greedy with the monetization

its a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming but overwatch was one of the few examples of lootboxes done right most of the longterm players of the game actually liked the system that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly i started playing ow1 with the first anniversary cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week and at the launch of ow2 i owned every single item in the game those who didnt have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted and lets be honest when you have your favourite skin how much do you care about unlocking other skins  and those who didnt want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it  if they wanted to

the new system puts almost everything behind a paywall the minute number of cosmetics on the free track are often insultingly lazy simple recolours or minor alterations while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for 20 the content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you even content from the first game that was originally free is now paid only

battlepass systems suck pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot if you dont you have to pay us more or lose the stuff you already paid for  limited time deals rotating shop offers fomo fomo fomo it reeks of manipulation and insincerity

4 occasional dlc packs of pve adventures

these are blizzards new approach to pve occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a pve mission you can pay in my uk currency 13 for the dlc pack or 35 the cost of a good indie game for the ultimate bundle

so heres the thing  this content is the same amount of content and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios  its just now instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up  now theyre paid dlc

nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely it doesnt make anyone like adobe photoshop or microsoft office and it doesnt make anyone like blizzard



so this is why people are review bombing your game you took something we paid for supported and enjoyed for years lied to us about your plans and turned it into trash now youre telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for its greedy its cynical its manipulative and youve lost our trust

also you should fire bobby kotick

urlhttpsoverwatchblizzardcomenusnews23988667directorstakelookingbeyondoverwatch2invasion overwatch 2 directors response to the negative steam reviews url

lets break this down

quote weve heard from many of our core players that the game is in the best state its ever been and many have told us that it feels like were really listening to their feedback and that this season is a culmination of that its so awesome to hear quote
leading with this in the opening paragraph in the same blog post that addresses widespread backlash are you joking
quote we also launched on steam last week and although being reviewbombed isnt a fun experience its been great to see lots of new players jump into overwatch 2 for the first time quote
youre painting yourself as the victim while dealing with valid deserved criticism
quote many of the reviews on steam mention the cancellation of the much larger component of pve that was announced in 2019 as one of their primary reasons for dissatisfaction with the game i get that that announcement was about an ambitious project that we ultimately couldnt deliver quote
you are deceiving people into believing that you are addressing peoples criticism when you arent even addressing the main problems
quote if we cant turn back the clock then what can we do quote
you can turn back the clock by going back to the original monetization model of overwatch 1 and giving the people who bought overwatch 1 the ability to turn the clock back themselves by giving back the game that they paid for
quote we can keep adding to and improving overwatch 2 that is how we move forward this means more maps heroes game modes missions stories events cool cosmetics and features  an everexpanding evolving and improving game quote
youre basically saying we can continue to improve the game by continuing to do what weve been doing and give people the bare minimum of what is expected
quote this is the future of overwatch one where we will continually create and innovate on what is making the game great now for the players who are playing now quote
the game isnt great now if it was we wouldnt see tons of backlash on steam and if youre only making it great for the players who are playing now i guess that means you only care about those that are loyal and not those that are leaving and criticizing the game

what a horrible tonedeaf response

hi a notsoshort review explaining what happened to overwatch 

ive been playing this game since 2016 almost since its original release the game was fun you could get everything for free if you played long enough and it cost 40 euros 
this game has been taken away so its safe to say they deleted a game made the sequel free and made it so that old accounts could still be used with all the skins and stuff we had on our accounts the problem is overwatch 2 is flooded with microtransactions shops are tricky to read and are expensive af 10 euro for a recolor cmon battle pass is kinda whack especially since every new character that appears in ow is locked behind a battle pass the formula is simple  buy bp you have said char at lvl 1 of bp no pressure straight out the box enjoy the either unpolished abomination or a hero with such power they have to instantly nerf it and its still unbalanced well played but if you do not pay for a bp you gotta grind 45 levels of battle pass yes 45 so that you are allowed to play the hero during that very season 
like wtf casual players might not be able to get the char in the season they were released 
but dont worry youll be able to unlock that hero off season by doing some silly tasks eg play 30 games as a tank or win i dunno i am a daily player so i usually unlock this shit in about a week or two 

they got rid of ow1 features like player frame rank shown during a ranked match sr system is now hidden and is broken ranks are inflated and totally do not match with the skill sets that were in ow1 i dare you a mere plat from ow1 could get to gm5 with good enough grind and im talking like platplat hard stuck in ow1 now suddenly gm 

and last but not least actually the biggest part of it all and the main reason the game would have a 2 in the name  the somuchpromised pve 
oh my oh my oh my not only they did not give us the stuff they promised throughout the years but they want the players who just wanted to chill in pve and have fun there looking at how cool that mode was supposed to be they want them to pay 15  for about 3045 minutes of really boring repetitive whackamole pve content matching the vibe with the 2016 or 17 junkensteins revenge 
like bro shooting robots is cool and stuff but borderlands did it better anyway  oh pripo but you cant compare the fully fledged game to the f2p indie game dev  yes yes i can they promised golden hills and we received rotten meat 

the game has been cut to the ground with unbalanced gameplay power creep insanely strong supports that cant be killed without oneshoting or hard focusing them with an organized team btw they are getting rid of one shots but the latest support can 2tap you from further than damage heroes do guess which one im talking about hitscan lady

like i could go on and on and on but this shit is whack
i am somehow addicted and am playing this crap out of habit at this point but please pretty please do not pay them any money for the crap they made 

sincerely

#####

rule 34 is what carries this game

#####

they should make a sequel that includes the whole pve experience we were promised with skill trees and call it overwatch 2

#####

im putting this game on my steam account so you dont have to

this game is a massive middle finger to everyone who supported overwatch 1 and blizzard over the years

i was a huge fan of overwatch 1 spent hundreds of hours ingame dozens of dollars on loot boxes bought merchandise met voice actors and supported the game through both good and bad decisions

overwatch 2 is a pale zombified husk of what made overwatch 1 good monetization went from bad to outright predatory game balance decisions are baffling and nobody in charge listens to the players new content is now locked behind multiple paywalls

the core gameplay is still there i guess but who cares anymore this is what blizzard is now 
buy the skins buy the underwhelming dlc buy our loweffort junk and like it
even though you already paid the price of a full game

what a waste of an amazing universe greed ruins everything

#####

the porn is better

#####

the only thing fun about this game is reading all its negative reviews

#####

in 2016 i bought overwatch 1 in its entirety for 40

in 2023 overwatch 2 is trying to get me to buy a skin for 40

you can pretty much infer everything you need to know about the direction of the game by this alone

edit because so many people dont seem to understand what is being said here i will write it out to be more straightforward overwatch 1 had to make the game good because what you were paying for was the game the money came from the game itself

overwatch 2 doesnt charge for the game they just charge an entire games price for every skin so they try to make the skins good they no longer work on the game because the game no longer matters only the skins so in overwatch 2 the game sucks since they no longer improve it in any way but they do spend tons of effort adding and improving skins

hopefully people can now understand the difference between developers who are focusing on making a good game and ones who are focusing on making a skin shop and that because overwatch 2 is trying to be a skin shop its gameplay sucks

the game is free to play yet i still want a refund

#####

i somehow purchased overwatch 1 for 40 which blizzard then deleted and created this predatory microtransaction simulator instead its the exact same game but they removed all the stuff you paid full price for in overwatch 1 if you played overwatch 1 at launch this is not only identical it is the exact same game

i will always have strong fond memories of overwatch 1 there was no reason whatsoever for ow2 other than greed i never thought id be saying this but i would much rather have lootboxes and ow1 monetisation over the mess that we currently have going free to play was a mistake and let us never forget that the pve missionseventsstory that was meant to be free has been scrapped for more garbage monetisation 

rip ow1 youll be missed but not forgotton

pros

 its free now 
 no battlenet launcher required still need an account
 truly a one of a kind game even 7 years later there is nothing quite like it 

cons

 genuinely the most garbage community i have ever had the displeasure of interacting with when trying to learn a new hero in quick play or just trying to chill with friends entire teams will counterpick you and trash talk you constantly when you struggle 
 clueless devs in charge of game balance they will gigabuff characters seemingly at random make several minor irrelevant tweaks to others all while characters that desperately need adjustment are ignored for multiple seasons 
 despite the devs stating that this is not their intention counterpicking is heavily rewarded over player skill many games are decided in the character select menu rather than on the battlefield expect frequent mirror matchups as a result especially as you climb in rank and for games to be held hostage by teammates who refuse to switch 
 once free content skins heroes pve missions is now either locked behind a paywall or made incredibly tedious to unlock without paying in the case of heroes it hurts the competitive integrity of the game when each team does not have equal access to resources this is also an insult to the people who have stuck by for years only to be told they now need to insert more cash to further enjoy the game
 the game is buggier than ever before the renowned blizzard polish is no longer present as they try to rush out as much content as possible regardless of the outcome it is incredibly rare to play a match without having at least one death or missed kill be attributed to a bug 

overwatch will always be special to me which is why its so heartbreaking to see it suffer through greed and mismanagement you might enjoy the game but its no secret that the good days of overwatch are long gone

#####

its an indie company guys give them a break

i have less shame in admitting to owning porn games in my library than i do with this game

this game has been review bombed and ive seen backlash from others saying how its unfair let me tell you firsthand no it is not in my opinion this is more than deserved for what blizzard has done as someone who has played hundreds of hours of both overwatch 1 and 2 i have a good idea of what is going on

this is the result of an extremely passionate group of people who have time and time again been let down by blizzard people who have committed countless hours to playing watching and consuming overwatch content over the years

overwatch 1 is looked back fondly from fans across all genres of games although it had points of low interest nobody can disagree that for a large part of its lifespan it was beloved and popular and no it is not just nostalgia blizzard has created some amazing games initially that dropped off hard after a certain point wow diablo hearthstone 

overwatch 2 under delivered on basically every front let me list some examples

 the new game mode push the robot and flashpoint are generally detested by the community 2cp wasnt the best but is still missed and preferred
 the matchmaking is clunky as ever prioritizing getting into games faster over game quality what this means is you get into a match faster  it is still pretty slow lmao  but the game quality is worse people have complained about this constantly you can literally search it up and see articles written about it 90 no this is not an exaggeration of games are one sided one team stomps the other and its a wrap win or lose this is just not fun or engaging
 they didnt even bother to change the training room from overwatch 1
 the scummy f2p model they use constantly shoving the battle pass down your throat it costs 20 dollars to buy a legendary skin remember how everyone loved lootboxes and it made that aspect of the game exciting completely removed
 most maps werent even changed from ow1 
 hey remember the pve content we promised yeah no how about 15 dollars for some lackluster missions that were free in ow1
 they are releasing new heroes on a schedule but if you dont buy the battlepass be prepared to sink a lot of time to upgrade your battlepass in order to play a new character in a team based shooter revolving around hero counter picks and strategy 
 lackluster seasonal events that for the most part are copy paste from ow1
 toxicity i have been told to kll myself multiple times reported these people and nothing happens to them very fun it is by far the most toxic multiplayer game i play on par with league 

oh noooo the shitty game got reviewbombed the one that constantly underdelivered and went back on their promises i understand that many people who work on this game arent in control of these things but this is just unbelievable at this point no this game is not the worst thing to exist you can get some fun out of it i play with my friend from time to time but over time you will begin to resent and loathe the game and the people who created it it is not worth any time investment this game will pressure you into their shitty overpriced microtransactions under deliver on everything they promise and squeeze every last drop of money they can out of you

h2b tldr overwatch died an undignified and instantaneous death all so overwatch 2 could stumble around drooling on itself bh2

overwatch 2 is a teambased pvp shooter where teams of 5 heroes each with entirely unique abilities compete against one another to win glory in the colourful and futuristic world of overwatch or something to that effect you see none of the lore behind why overwatchs pvp games happen is really explained whatsoever youre just supposed to roll with it even when unique heroes are somehow competing against the exact same unique heroes

for those unfamiliar overwatch 2 is the longawaited free to play sequel to the original overwatch released in 2016 as a paid game by longawaited i mainly mean that development on the original overwatch essentially grinded to a halt in its last few years with the development team claiming that they were instead working on the new sequel overwatch 2 including its brand new pve mode 

upon release of overwatch 2 players were told that the pve mode was still forthcoming and that the new pvp experience would deliver the changes fans didnt know they wanted specifically the change from a 6v6 format to a 5v5 format which would see the loss of one tank hero on each side more on this later in addition to the release of overwatch 2 not only were the official servers for the original overwatch taken down as is fairly common practice but indeed all access whatsoever to the original overwatch was completely removed from all players even despite this being a game that they had paid for furthermore the new overwatch 2 would release with greatly heightened monetization mechanics specifically with a fortnitestyle seasonal battlepass system alongside the introduction of substantially more paid and highly expensive skins

you see in the original overwatch players could earn the games currency by queuing for the least popular of the games 3 roles tank damage and support at that moment in time as well as through loot boxes earned on levelup equating to roughly every 45 minutes of gameplay overwatch 2 however features an entirely different model where players can earn a maximum of 60 socalled overwatch coins per week with the objectively good rare skins costing 1000 overwatch coins meaning a player would need to grind for almost 17 weeks straight to purchase a single skin that one could reasonably earn in the original overwatch assuming they queued the right roles within a week 

any new skins to the game now almost always included in a bundle with a bunch of random other items at a cost of 2000 coins cost approximately 30aud 20usd or a third of the price of a aaa game release these new skins much like fortnites are also each sold for a limited time only thereby utilising highlypredatory pressure selling techniques by artificially creating scarcity of infinitely replicable digital assets perhaps a common practice in the modern video game industry but an incredibly unethical practice nonetheless especially in a game that is also marketed directly or indirectly at children

many features already in the original overwatch were also absent at launch including overall account levels postgame chat and medals the onfire status effect when a player is playing well despite the voicelines still activating in the game and thus the triggers still being inengine the latter of which was later triumphantly returned into the game almost an entire year later with much fanfare from players and blizzard themselves strangely these are all relatively simple ui changes which should not take much development time yet are clearly not a priority for blizzard whatsoever

while i have ripped into overwatch 2 until this point not every change is necessarily a step backwards the 5v5 format while personally not my favourite change has undoubtedly sped games up considerably which is especially perfect for todays tiktokaddicted low attentionspan having mainstream video gaming fanbase myself included lets be honest with the loss of a tank player on each team all tank heroes have been significantly buffed as an advantage meaning that every game does not mandate a reinhardt as was often the case in the original game additionally i strongly feel that every new hero introduced with overwatch 2s launch and in the time since has been incredibly welldesigned to fit neatly into overwatch 2s gameplay with abilities that often provide interesting play with and counterplay against preexisting heroes from the original game

earlier this year blizzard announced that the longawaited pve mode for overwatch 2 was to be entirely scrapped despite this being constantly cited by blizzard themselves as the reason that overwatch 2 needed to be a separate game the overwatch fanbase was understandably incensed especially because even to those lesssceptical it seemed increasingly like the existence of overwatch 2 was purely as a way to redefine the monetization model of overwatch in order for activisionblizzard to profit more off the existing ip at the great expense of overwatchs fans this was not aided by the fact that some presumably cut from the previous dev work pve content was later released as extra dlc at a premium price rather than being included with the basegame which has recently resulted in article being released suggesting that very few players are using this content now whatsoever

h3 pros h3

list
b the new heroes in the game add significantly to the overwatch formula in unique and fun ways providing interesting play and counterplay mechanics to overwatchs existing hero rosterb

bthe change to a 5v5 format down from 6v6 with the loss of a tank on each side has significantly increased the flow of the game making matches feel much more decisive and less slugfestishb
list

h3 cons h3

list
bplayers have been completely locked out of the original overwatch despite this largely still being a superior experience even more than a year since overwatch 2s releaseb

boverwatch 2 is still missing features from the original overwatch that the majority of the playerbase enjoyed postgame chat and medals account levels and badges onlyrecently adding back onfire a seemingly simple ui changeb

boverwatch 2s monetization model has shifted to be significantly more predatory in following with current trends in the video game industryb

boverwatch 2s pve mode the justification for the need for a new game for many years is practically dead in the water and almost non existent with the exception of a pitiful dlc pve mission pack available to players for an extra costb
list

h2 conclusions h2

while overwatch 2 in some ways feels like a step in the right direction especially in terms of pvp gameplay mechanics everything else surrounding the game feels like an enormous step back missing gameplay features from the original overwatch a more predatory monetization model and nearcomplete cancellation of the pve mode that was promised are the features that significantly mark overwatch 2 damaging both its player experience and reputation hopefully in the near future blizzard can actually put some more love and care into overwatch 2 so that it can become a worthy sequel to the original but all recent action and financial incentives strongly suggest that this unfortunately will not happen

#####

played overwatch 1 for thousands of hours reached top 500 twice and enjoyed playing hitscan and offtank
while i do not especially approve of the review bombing from players who had no intentions of playing the actual game i feel like i have to also add to the hate train
i am obviously biased but to me ow2 represents everything wrong with the industry and activitionblizzardking
and thats without taking into account the fact that the changes for ow2 including the removal of a tank role as well as the rework of a few characters destroyed what i enjoyed about the original game
if some people can have fun with this game thats great for them but whenever i boot this up to play with friends i cannot help but get a llitle angry at the wasted potential
heres hoping that the overwatch ip doesnt die because of some greedy execs aholes

1 heroes locked behind battle pass or obnoxious grind the fact that you either pay to have a competitive advantage for your team or obnoxiously grind for the hero which is tier 45 of the bp if you missed the bp you have to win 35 games of a role you may not necessarily enjoy in order to unlock the hero not play x games wins grant double progress win only count towards unlock progress and you cant progress for more than 1 hero at the same time this means if you start playing overwatch in season 7 you need to win 210 games just to unlock the 6 new overwatch 2 heroes

2 solo tanking has been a miserable experience ever since the move from 6v6 to 5v5 and created a whole lot of problems with balance and powerful abilities see how sleep dart had to have lower duration on tanks discord and antinade remained a problem in solotank environment and removed lots of tank synergises open queue is actually more fun for me as a tank player at this point

3 toxicity is still not being addressed even in qp people are flaming you for no reason i have reported many players for toxicity but nothing is addressed its so bad to the point i had to turn off all text chat and voice chat so i can actually have a fun time in the game

4 workshop has been a very welcoming addition to the game but right now its not being actively updated sure we got the new projectiles extensions which we are grateful for but theres still many issues like hud alignment being incorrect left and right hud should be leftright aligned like in ow1 not centered aligned many workshop actionsvalues not working well with the new ow2 heroes such as setting cooldown and detecting ability usage also we need more deathmatch maps would be nice if every map can be available for ffatdm

for reference i have 1139 hours in overwatch since its original release in 2016

do not spend a single cent peso ruble whatever in this game activision blizzard does not deserve it dont say but i am supporting the devs you are not this is not an indie company the developers are salaried workers your money goes straight into the executives christmas bonus

however you may notice this game is free you can play it without spending any money so should you probably not
the games balance is constantly in a cycle of being so close to good then the devs completely ruining it and making some hero overpowered for seemingly no reason
people always say if everyone is overpowered no one is overpowered and this game is proof that that is not the case and instead it just results in every hero either able to instakill or not able outdamage the healing it isnt fun

i just want the game to be good and i want the pve mode with hero talents


#####

they removed the fun just like when they removed womens rights at blizzard

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

overwatch 1 is better than overwatch 2

change my mind

no pve














#####

the devs respect their players as much as they respect the women in their office

edit november 2023
game is still riddled with microtransactions and gameplay is still mildly infuriating at its best and downright painful at its worst

#####

bad game subway surfers better

#####

for reference i have over 1200 hours in the game and have played since season 5 of ow1 on my linked account

the game is just an overall downgrade from overwatch 1 with an arguably more predatory monetization system and so many broken promises some of which had been made even before overwatch 1 released

jeff kaplan in 2015 all future maps and heroes will be patched in as free content updates

overwatch 2 pay up or grind like hell

h1stay awayh1
before anyone claims i am a bot just spamming a negative review i preordered overwatch 1 between my friends and i we have clocked in thousands of hours playing solo and together now only one of my friends from that group still plays this game i understand what was left behind by overwatch 1 was and still is phenomenal but the pros in this case do bnotb outweigh the cons left in the wake of this sequel in short if you do not care about details i want my money back or at least them to bring back the servers for the game i paid for not this garbage this game will strong arm you to part with a considerable amount of cash where the original game did not this game has only seen an increase in cheating and toxicity this game has horrendous balancing issues that keeps getting compounded with each new update due to the new 5v5 format all in all this game and im not even joking when i say this got most of my friends to play team fortress 2 again and even in the middle of the bot crisis we had significantly more fun with it than our time with overwatch 2 stay away from this game it is a hollow shell of what it used to be which is a great shame
hrhr
h1in depth reviewh1
overwatch 1 was a fantastic game like no other even compared to tf2 it was fun and exciting for years we all would anticipate the drop of a new hero a new map new cosmetics the game has had its ups and downs no game is ever perfect especially one continuously getting updates but at its core no matter how bad it had gotten it was still fun ill spare the details as many people probably have said in their reviews or you may know of it they had announced overwatch 2 after a long drought of slowgoing updates when ow2 came out i was initially positive to it the new 5v5 format was fun i liked the new heroes push was fun the biggest problem for me was the new cash shop and battlepass system more on that later i personally wasnt really hopeful that pve mode was going to be good and as such didnt care much about it although this soon would be the catalyst to all in my friend group leaving the game but as time has gone on and as i noticed more people becoming toxic and i noticed the game becoming stale it came to a point where i just had enough so where to begin
hrhr
h15v5 and balancingh1
the biggest difference between the two games is 5v5 instead of 6v6 at first i enjoyed the change i felt games where faster and enjoyed the lack of shields that had plagued the first game for years but as time went on i realized a lot of issues with this new format and found myself enjoying it less and less the truth is bthe game was not meant for 5v5b it literally just makes the game worse in every way and makes balancing atrocious
the reason for this is that a core part of the games design is synergies and counter picks you pick a hero to fight against the other teams heroes and you pick a hero that works well with another team members pick the most important role for synergizing picks is typically support and tank this worked to great effect in ow but as time went on in ow2 it was clear that the move to 5v5 is a mistake
the removal of a tank causes major problems the first is that the tank role is missing a core part of the game synergies the second is that tanking has now become a boring game of rotating to counter pick and every tank game feels relatively the same lastly this has put a burden on tanking as a whole since theres only one person to fulfill the most important role now a side effect is that now instead of a teambased game the game has become a tankbased game having a bad tank that refuses to play any hero other than roadhog or sigma etc will lose you games if the other team has the counterpick hero this issue leads to further issues with balancing but for the sake of brevity as i have a lot to say i hope this explanation paints a clear picture on why 5v5 is bad for the games health in short 6v6 needs to come back but it never will now that they broke their promise of pve if they revert 5v5 they will have nothing to show for ow2 except for a cash shop update
hrhr
h1cash shop updateh1
all in all this game is just an update that went away from lootboxes to a cash shop in theory this should be greatwe all hated lootboxesbut blizzard in their infinite greed has made the experience related to cosmetics and microtransactions worse now instead of having every single player on the same playing field with every character unlocked you are forced to unlock them or buy the battlepass this is incredibly dumb and makes the game worse especially since they said back when the first game released that locking heroes behind paywalls was a bad idea and are these heroes worth it so far no theyre all just incredibly mid which doesnt even make you want to buy them or make you want to get excited for them because the truth is paying for heroes means that if theyre too weak people will complain that they got scammed if theyre too strong then people will complain the game is pay to win this is not a moba where you have to make a hero pick and stick to it before the game start this is a game with dynamic on the fly decision making which extends to hero swapping this decision once again goes against one of the fundamental design philosophies of the first game its an absolutely baffling decision made by people who dont understand the game but just want to make more money
speaking of making more money the cosmetics they are atrociously price 2030 for a single skin no skin is worth that much no matter how dripped out itll make you look every skin is now earned with money another downgrade from the first game in the original you would play and level up your account each time you level up you get a lootbox lootboxes in ow would give you random cosmetics or coins to farm for specifically purchasing cosmetics the only thing to buy was the lootboxes say what you will about lootboxes i didnt like them either but i also think the new greedy shop is worse especially when you realized they gutted the entire account progression system from the first game and left you with a multiyear grind heavy avenue to unlocking a isinglei cosmetic you want i could feasibly grind for a skin i wanted in a couple months time in ow in this game i am left with no choice but to buy the item i want at an abhorrent price
hrhr
h1misc thoughts and conclusionh1
i am already on the verge of writing a whole dissertation on why this game is just overwatch 05 and how they keep fumbling around with bad ideas to eventually and hopefully land back to where overwatch 1 was already at my friends and i didnt particularly care about the pve but we were mad when we learned it was canceled why because for years we got nothing they pushed out an update and pretended it was a sequel then they lied to us and led us to believe that pve was coming along and great when in reality and they let this slip after the announcementbthat they knew pve was canceled before ow2s launchb they led us to believe the pve as promised was coming when they knew it was never happening
all in all this game is a dumpster fire its upsetting that a great game that i loved and put so much time into enjoying and playing is being dragged through the mud and for what money the hope that the people that will put up with it will whale out copious amounts of cash on stuff they could have gotten for free in the first game furthermore i bought ow that game was not free to play and they deleted it i would have been more content with the happenings of ow 2 had they let me continue playing the game i had once paid for and the better game they had to offer but after what i had outlined i think we knew why they deleted it stay away

the game has removed social features from the original game  
postgame lobbies including text chat
level borders
the visual indicator that tells you who is in a premade group in your match
the visual indicator of the rank of each member of your team
your career profile is defaulted to hidden despite that being the only way to see your accomplishments
seeing who gets endorsed at the end of the match
the group finder
leaving quickplay as a group
inviting friends to your group who are in quickplay even if the match has ended
the message you are typing gets deleted if the round changes
there is 2 less people in the matches
classic synergies are removed from the game because there are not two tanks

the game is too balanced except for the flavor of the season heroes that are too good
 tanks now have a passive buff that reduces knockback so all characters with knockback are not as fun
 mei cant freeze people
 wrecking ball cant spin around things as long as he wants
 mccree cant stun flankers
 bastion cant be a turret
 doomfist is no longer a fighting game character instead he is a guy who punches you and flies away
many of the changes make the characters more engaging but not more fun

the pve isnt coming

the game is greedy in ways that youd need to watch a 10 hour video to explain all the ways they are manipulating you

this is the current state of the game throughout 2024 there is a possibility that the developers can start making real change to get the game back on track but the new development team seems to care more about making a balanced game than making a fun game or a game that respects the legacy of overwatch

what can i say about this game
i have more than 1000 hours not in steam as you can see but in battlenet im writing this review thanking valve to finally let me leave an opinion of this game 

i started playing ow in 2017 specifically in september and stopped in 2023 mayso i can say i lived the best and the worst in this game 
the game was amazing a hero shooter pretty balanced in characters synergy not players a lot of fanbase etc but the lack of content and i believe the ow leagues decay started to dent the game i think we can agree there were 3 major nails in its coffin

1	brigitte blizzard always overpowers its last charsskills etc in every game but this char broke the game it could kill healers dps tanks no matter what if you encountered brigitte in a small corridor you were dead eventually they nerfed her but still she destroyed the synergy only by herself
2	role queue ranked an attempt to revive the number of players but did the opposite this thing made me leave overwatch back then you had to choose before knowing which map you were going to play in what role you wanted to bethis had 2 cons first you couldnt balance your team if you had a noob or a troll taking his role and helping your team and second in some maps i played better for my team in one role than another for example defending hanamurarialto with tank but attacking oasisnepal with healer or dps
3	2 types of ranked role queued or free when role queue didnt work they made some changes in quick play and arcade but the important change was the free ranked what happened well if you have less players and more ranked modes surprise you had a worse matchmaking so
doing the same shitty pve content halloween winter games lucio ball over and over again destroyed it as well

but a light was ahead they were going to give us a new game at least a reworked game with finally a good multiplayer pve content new stories maps skill trees etc
23 years of development later they gave us overwatch 2 removing ow1 which i paid with no pve content but with season pass and the promise of the future pve content by the way they changed mccree for cassidy that didnt solve anything on may 16th the head staff cancelled the promised pve content making the number 2 in overwatch 2 lost its meaning they lied deceived and mislead us july 19th blizzard offers 6m to every team to not renew in overwatchs leage rip

note i bought ow1 i played a lot with friends i believed in ow2 so i bought every battle pass with euros or coins if i had till may 2023 i was platinum all role queueso i wasnt a god but at least i know what im talking abouti started this game on steam only to finally tell the world my humble opinion and my and probably others story of love and hate with this game

#####

as a person who has lots of sex all the time i can say that this game is 100 accurate to having sex with sexy women like i do everyday this game did not make me horny however i am not gay i just have too much sex with real women to spend more than 15 minutes in this game on the other hand i would recommend this game to people who do not have sex unlike me because i have lots of sex with women a lot as there is a naked woman in it and she is naked she kinda looks like one of my many girlfriends who i have sex with a lot i have lots of sex i also an very handsome and women always want to have sex with me because i am very muscular and handsome and very good at video games all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her i have sex with women not men i am not gay i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy my penis is very big all my girlfriends like my penis because it is very big and i am very good at sex with my women every woman ive had sex with is very sexy and so am i i have lots of sex i am also very handsome and sexy and i have lots of sex

#####

you might think people are review bombing ow2 on steam but it is far from truth while it seems like it it is a silenced voice of many people that were and still are dissatisfied with blizzardactivision policy of censorship and development these voices and negative opinions were present for many years but blizz are very good at buying reviews deleting negative ones and not letting anything even mildly negative stay on their forums for more than a few hours thats called censorship and this corporation is very good at doing it starting from diablo 3 or even earlier negative opinions about overwatch have been present for years they just kept being swept under the carpet so people that are not familiar with it could see only good reviews and then buytry it and perhaps leave some more  in the form of microtransactions

i have more than 3000h played in ow1 it was a blast back in 20162017 i really enjoyed this game even when i kept losing and losing a lot since im not that good at shooter games but when you like something even constant losing cant stop you from having fun but now i cant really force myself to play it it sucks i dont mind racist transhomophobes afker and toxic people that will make your day worse  i had long experience playing multiplayer games and im somewhat thickskinned when it comes to loud people in pvp games they exist and not even big price tag will make them disapppear but the game is just not the same  it lost its shine and individuality it shouldnt be an issue if you never tried overwatch since you have nothing to compare to you definitely can have fun in overwatch 2 it is game worth trying especially now that it is free to play game wise it hasnt changed its core that much for all these years and i bet a lot of people could enjoy it on top of that they seems very progressive and supporting lgbtqia personally i dont like it  companies that are keep making poor decisions shield themselves with being pridefriendly to keep peopleand their money in game but proceeding with poor choices that are rainbowcolored in the end it seems like it is bad for game development and for lgbtqia community in the longrun since we cant know for sure if they really support this community or is it just to get more cash from rainbowpainted facade likedo they support lgbtqia in the middleeast why they dont fight for their rights there if they are so pridesupportive

i recommend you to try ow2 you might enjoy the game but watch out for toxic people play with friends for better experience i personally lost any interest in this game they hide their past mistakes by adding 2 to the title promoting it like it is completely new game switching grindable lootboxes for realcash only battle pass pissing on their loyal but poor part of community and abandoning overwatch league cause it is not profitable anymore insert btoy storyb i dont want to play with you anymore meme

blizzardactivision is not worth supporting my dudes  they are getting worse and worse with each and every next big decision they make sad to see but maybe it is time for new king of video games
oh and dont forget about 20192021 urlhttpsknowyourmemecommemeseventsactivisionblizzardlawsuitblizzard sexual harassment lawsuiturl internet remembers

tldr read the other long negative reviews look at the percent of people unhappy with this game and install this game with caution the capitalistic greedy corporate company that runs this game only cares about lining their investors and themselves pockets via milking their customers

back in 2018 i played ovw1 well over 1000 hours one of the reasons why i loved it so much compared to other games at the time instead of being a moba was the fact that there was free updates it won game of the year that year because simply of how new it was seasonal events introduced with new game modes being added free heroes given out that you could get cosmetics for via the old lootbox system but even if you didnt have money you could still take part in the game and it would reward currency that you could use your free lootboxes to get currency to save up for the cosmetics and skins you wanted it was a consumercustomer friendly experience but with all activisionblizz game it had to come to an end one of the great sides of ovw1 was the characters we all came to love their personalities and wanted to know more and more we got comics cinematics and even seasonal events that were pve orientated despite the game being primarily pvp that gave us characters and a universe to cheer for and because of how much we begged for more ovw2 was announced you promised your loyal fans to bring us pve 

in the year 2023 the year of gamers putting their foots down when it comes to greedy companies exploiting them and their employees we as a community are putting our foot down and thumbs downing ovw2 we were all promised pve but now that youve gone back on your word on it how is ovw2 i decided to play almost 25 hours last night to get a taste to see if the reviews were right and they are us loyal fans who bought ovw1 are now forced to play ovw2 all the stuff we liked the pve the free content is now moneygated want to play their new watered down scrapped pve content that they couldnt seem to deliver fully but can with this 15 bundle its disgusting online service games are the worst when it comes to removing whole games that you otherwise had and it seems activisionblizz is the biggest culprit they slapped a shiny new coat of paint on the graphics and told you this sequel will get updates alas the only updates you get are just only free new maps but everything else you have to pay money for money that previously in ovw1 we didnt need to spend 

i do not recommend this game i will give them props for making it so the newer heroes you can unlock after enough time has passed via a unlock challenge but even then that challenge is weird you have to win games on the role of the said hero making it more enticing for you to just buy the heroes outright when they launch maybe the people who bought the new heroes should win 35 games first before they can play that hero too

all in all i will never touch another activisonblizz product in the future it seems this company ruined warcraft and now overwatch for me

you may be wondering why do i have this many hours in the game and continue to play it even though im giving a bad review well youre about to find out

i have been playing overwatch since 2016 i was 16 years old when i first started and now im almost 24 overwatch 1 was amazing i fell in love with the characters personalities lore and play style of the game 
when blizzard announced overwatch 2 i was very excited especially when they announced pve missions and skill trees a year or 2 later with little to no new ow1 content we all assumed that they were working hard on pve they announced the release date of the second game but also announcing that the game will be free to play with battle passes i was a little upset but got over it since every game is starting to do that

first 2 seasons of ow2 was great the mythic skins had amazing customizations although i severely miss 6v6 at the time of those seasons i was still having fun with the game season 3 the mythic was starting to have less customizations 
then blizzard announced that they were scrapping the skill trees from pve that was a huge disappointment for me because they had months to tell us that and yet lied to us at this point in the game i was starting to have less and less fun
pve finally releases and its 20 for 3 short and repetitive missions it was like the archives event missions
seasons 48 the mythic custiomizations were awful and very limited they kind of improved the mythic for this season season 9 but compared to the genji mythic its still not as good

now finding out they entirely scrapped pve blizzard has completely lost my trust the entire reason they even came out with overwatch 2 was to introduce pve and they get rid of that completely honestly at this point revert back to overwatch 1 give us 6v6 back lower the prices of skins and battle passes

dont even get me started with how the ow team cannot balance a character then completely changing characters abilities

yeah i continue to play the game because that 16 year old that fell in love with this game doesnt want to let go but the game is no longer fun for me blizzard has become severely money hungry and does not care about the players

how does overwatch go from goty 2016 to this

 rip ow series
h1if you dont have time for the substantive part of the review and want to know whether its worth playing overwarch2 i answer its not worth it it is not worth your time for this game if you have positive feelings from playing the first overwatch and for those who want to read my opinion on frankenstein which was brought to life by blizzard studios i encourage you to read on cry and enjoy beautiful music that in my opinion matches the meritumh1
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhzy5dbmgc_a

dear reader
curious about the flood of negative reviews towards the title from the blizzard stable i have to say that less than a few hours with the new ow have confirmed me in very sad conclusions sadly true 
ive seen enough and i write this in disappointment 
because having in my memories the solutions of 1st ow i see prosocial regression and extreme mercantilism of the studio which took a step backwards
overwatch was my most played game on playstation including bloodborne and darksouls series and now every time i hear about ow2 i just get more and more disapproved sad and pity 

blizzard took what was one of the best team shooters and turned it into an action focused money hungry machine with no purpose the game is now free with a giant star next to free because if you want any enjoyment out of it like we had with ow1 you better open your wallet multiple times the progression system sucks the loot sucks the paywalls suck and now the game sucks

during an interview with gamespot blizzard confirmed that the highly anticipated pve modes that we expected to get with ow2 are now canceled the entire purpose of ow2 releasing was to add story driven pve modes and now it doesnt exist at all

investigating the whole case the pve modes were announced in february 2021 officially but were long known about before then it was at this time we learned about hero mode which would add character trees and perks to the roster along with player progression and of course story driven missions to explore the lore of overwatch it looked stellar then blizzard switched gears and said pve wouldnt release alongside the newly revamped ow2 and then went completely silent about it since fans have been desperately asking when we would get this and it seems blizzard chose to ignore the fans as they knew it was canned over a year ago ow2 is currently heading into season 6 which will finally have its first new pve event that fans have been waiting for but given the feedback from comments of players at the turn of the title changes every point ow2 is clearly a sequel made for a sham 

instead of a full fledged hero mode we now get copy paste pve style missions that will be included in the games live service over the next few seasons blizzard already recycles events for halloween and the holidays etc so these missions will be very similar closed pve missions with no depth at all and most likely just be on a recycled schedule similar to these events

apparently the reason for all this is blizzard somehow forgot they made a live service game their team couldnt handle creating the depth for pve missions or make pve missions for that matter so they took the content stripped it down and are now releasing it over several seasons instead of all at once some of the missions wont even be cannon to the lore

blizzard explains that they want to ensure new pve content releases as expected while ignoring the popularity that say lucio ball has every time it releases no matter how many times they recycle it again the whole purpose of overwatch 2 and why it wasnt just a simple expansion to the core game was due to the added depth pve was going to add instead all we got was a toned down ow1 and a bunch of microtransactions nobody asked for

if i havent been rather blunt with my opinion on the team destroying overwatch well here goes their excuses for dropping the pve side are totally bogus in every way a multibillion dollar studio couldnt find the time to build out a pve game right just be honest you couldnt monetize it and the only option that came to the table was to strip the content down and hide it within the season releases so people hopefully buy the passes and keep playing the lousy game period they made sure all the overpriced junk on the ow2 store worked on launch and raised prices when people were already exclaiming how expensive it was to begin with its all about money

i wouldnt be surprised if the content releases include locked new characters or enhancements of some kind or have insanely long grinding sessions for secondary coins i was one of the few original ow fans that played that game every day and i played with the same dozen or so die hard people in every match and its sad that blizzard looked at us all and said eh sorry take the 2 off the name and go actually develop a game


dear reader thank you for reading and blizzard 










wake up

#####

i have a new hobbie reading overwatch 2 reviews it gives so much joy to me seeing this garbage been nuked by everyone long have i waited for this to happen but i am not satisfied yet not until all overwatch 2 servers are shot down

#####







































#####

they stopped making content for overwatch 1 for 3 years just to come out with the same game but with worse features and payment model frustrating

#####

been playing since the game first launched i cherished the game up until a few nights ago i was walking down the street and saw this piece of dog dog shit after staring at this piece of dog dog shit for awhile i realized how much better it was than the game itself and its company 

not to mention the chernobyl nuclear disaster had less toxicity than this game

#####

this really is a game that is not good for your mental health matchmaking is atrocious because unless you have a 5 stack you will be paired with singlecelled organisms

#####

get fucked activationblizzard you fucked up overwatch you fucked up diablo 4 just close your doors forever because you are sooo out of touch with players delivering these crappy games

game so bad it killed twomad

#####

i paid for the collectors edition of ow1
they now removed that which i paid for and replaced it with a lesser edition bringing nothing new to the table  or at least nothing they couldnt just have done to ow1 such as changing it to a 5v5 game 
now i cant really play the game i paid for  and quite a bit for at that i borderline feel like i cant play ow2 at all seeing as im now unable to counter  in a game all about countering cause i have to play the game as a fulltime job to get something through just gaming or i have to pay blizzard a fortune such as 20 for a bloody skin its kind of this whole you have to fix our issue for us mentality which blizzard has gotten increasingly better at 

the one reason for ow2 existing in the first place was removed the pve they deserve the downvotes all of them its not as blizzard claims review bombing its just the truth  and i hope that it hurts in this case so that they might learn from this
they removed a fully functioning game to replace it with the exact same although lesser edition  with macrotransactions
the game itself in its core is not terrible the company and its business practices however those are abysmal

when jeff kaplan said theyd change what a sequel meant well sadly he wasnt wrong i entirely get why he left smart man

lastly  whomever was in charge of putting this game on steam with open reviews so that blizzard would finally see how people felt that person has some impressively poor judgement

#####

as a rule34 artist who doesnt use ai tools i can confirm that i have put more time and effort into drawing tracers british backside than blizzard have done with this whole game

#####

you would get more value from downloading 50gbs of ow r34 then downloading this garbage

its as if they slapped a 2 on the title and called it a day leaving us with a sequel about as thrilling as a sloth on sedatives the new story mode is like trying to read a book written in invisible ink  you know theres supposed to be something there but good luck finding it and the new heroes theyre as memorable as a goldfish with shortterm memory loss as for the pvp mode its a masterclass in frustration its like they hired a team of confused hamsters to balance the game play overwatch 2 youve achieved the remarkable feat of making us wish for the glory days of being repeatedly sniped by widowmaker and crossmap hooked by road hog

#####

if you dont already have 8000 hours on this game or any other fps games you will experience the biggest upward climb of your life the addiction has solidified and now my path has been set in stone i leave this review as a warning to nearby travelers as these grounds are not to be stepped upon if you choose to play this game regardless of its negative reviews you will undergo the stages of grief

the stages of grief
1 you will be pummeled severely game after game as your skill issues are too grand to overcome
2 you will be mocked and ridiculed by both your teammates and the enemy
3 by this point your friends lost interest in this game but now you are addicted you buy the battle pass
4 you will grind for hours and slowly be rewarded with mere pennies of monopoly money you then realize that you cannot buy skins from the shop with your monopoly money so you have to settle for lesser skins
5 after enough grueling quick play games you will try competitive
6 you will be placed in gold then after a faithful losing streak you will be banished to the inescapable land of bronze
7 you will spend copious hours adjusting your mouse and crosshair settings just to continue missing ez picks
8 you will buy a new adjustable desk just to continue missing ez picks
9 you will do aim training just to continue missing ez picks
10 you will realize that your steam hours were inflated by queue times that do not reflect your actual ingame play time
11 now that you are slightly less bad at the game you try comp again 
12 after 5 wins and 1 loss you rank up to bronze 5
13 you go back to quick play for even more hours of practice but then you are pummeled severely
14 depending on your genetics you might become interested in playing widowmaker in this situation the enemy will either switch sombra or try to diff you due to your complete lack of skill you become the least survivable player in every possible scenario you will then spend hours losing to the point where your hands start hurting you will lose so much that even with a winning game tons of elims and a shower of endorsements you will still be consumed by desolation
15 friends will become disinterested in your activities because you spend all your time playing overwatch
16 your parents will wonder why you arent doing anything productive anymore and it is because you are spending all your time playing overwatch
17 you go to sleep after a long day of losing and the only thing you can dream about is overwatch

in the end you will not be rewarded for your time and money spent on this game but you will keep playing it anyway you will get no useful life skills out of this game but you will keep playing it anyway you could have your arms and legs amputated while you rot in the iron lung but you will still keep playing it anyway there is no rest for the wicked and now that i think about it there is more grinding to do

edit i now have 900 hours on this game

#####

the best decision blizzard made for ow2 is releasing it on steam so we can see the reviews

#####

h1 what happens blizzard are you desperate h1

b tldr as someone who loves ow and has been playing it for a long time i know that this game and the company behind it suck i recommend that you go play something else or if you like masturbate with a sharp glass because even that is more attractive than playing this sh1t b

its all amazing i love ow very much ive been playing it since 2017 and i always saw it as an incredible game that i could return to when i was tired of playing the same old games but how disgusting is that this game is in the hands of blizzard

 first they temporarily pause the development of ow abruptly u they are working on a new and great project u leaving the competitive scene frozen and directly killing it due to the lack of patches and meta in the game

 u this project turns out to be ow 2 u weird but you are given the benefit of the doubt after showing more than 15m of a campaign with cinematics skills coop etc

 the campaign is paid strange but it gives you the benefit of the doubt as it is something that the fandom of the game had been asking for for years especially considering that you managed to provide good content with the coop story missions

 it turns out that you announce that the game is going to be free you release it in your words as an 
u early beta u so that people could play and get used to the new mechanicsmeta until the game reaches its  full release with the campaign

 your release date is getting closer you start to reveal game data in important events like the summer games as it turns out the game is going to replace the loot box system with a fortnitestyle battle pass and weekly shop people dont like it but they have faith in you because it is still an early beta and the objective of this 2nd game is to have a complete coop campaign

 the game comes out as if the server problems were not enough strike poor indie company strike the virtual store turns out to be horribly expensive and a lot of content and skins that you could buy for free just playing in ow1 now they are blocked for real money some reaching up to 20 dollars to be able to buy you are also awarded as the game with the worst battle pass ever created expensive empty and useless

 your game to no ones surprise decays quickly veteran people do not plan to return since on the one hand their competitive system is still broken and given the lack of investment in professional teams and brands there is no incentive from large groups to put the game in the spotlight either on the other hand people who only play for fun have no interest in coming back either because its still exactly the same game as before only now everything is blocked for real money  u congratulations blizzard you somehow made people miss loot boxes and even consider them as something more to the fun factor of overwatch only you can screw up enough to pull off something like that u 

 however new people who enter through the new f2p system quickly run into a game that its patch progression is excessively slow and therefore end up leaving the game after a few weeks as well strike these types of people who come to play are more used to games with more types of daily content like fortnitelol strike its not their fault at all 

 your game is dying fast and somehow it occurs to you that it is a brilliant idea to announce that you are going to cancel the campaign in development with all its skills and such in just a second you kill the little hype that the game had left and leave it as a game without a soul the existence of ow2 was only because of its campaign releasing the game in october in its beta was just for people to try the new mechanics and had something to play with until the campaign launched well now nothing its canceled and the game magically reached its full release

 your numbers drop sharply because of this decision and in a matter of time he will be totally dead so you decide to announce that actually no the campaign will come out but as an extra event minigame between seasons exactly the same as the original event missions nothing changed at the same time that you announce the game on steam u i dont know what it did to you to think that the people of steam were going to be stupid enough to receive this crap happily u

 the new season comes out with such announced campaign missions oh surprise b they are exactly the same as the previous event missions that ow1 had b even the level you give for free as a trial has a lot of stuff recycled from the old kings row invasion from your previous game

 u you are activisionblizzard probably the worst cancer in the video game industry u

i dont know what else to say about this game or blizzard in general overwatch is a beautiful concept it has an interesting plot funny characters quite interesting gameplay that sets it apart from the rest of heroshooters but nothing to do with it it belongs to one of the worst existing video game companies because i even put my hands on fire and i risk saying that strike ea strike behaves are more dignified with some of its games

h1 blizzard please eat sh1t and die h1

#####

h1an actual gameplay reason for a negative reviewh1

this game has the worst matchmaking i have ever experienced in 35 years of life and gaming

i play a lot of multiplayer games which are similar to this and i get wrecked sometimes and do ok sometimes ya know like how it should be

i am old and slow and i like to play games after getting blazedup and yet almost every game i play in ow2 is against the sweatiest twitchiest little 13 year old progamers and i get wrecked while i cant even land a single shot as they bounce around my screen

is there really no one else playing this in my skill range that the game can match me against

maybe anyone who isnt a sweaty twitchy preteen already quit and thats why matchmaking cant find me a single decent match  

maybe ranked would be less of a missmatch but i have to win 50 games in this shitshow that is quickplay to even unlock that mode to even try to play with other bronze trash like myself  is it worth the investment

either way if you are reading this and wondering if this game is for you i recommend you try paladins instead  its basically like this but just better  not a perfect game either but definitely better than this while being practically the same exact formula with basically the same heroes

#####

the game is so bad it killed twomad

#####

thank you blizzard for putting your game on a platform where people can leave reviews 

now everyone can laugh at you putting your garbage game on steam because you messed up your partnership with netease so this is the only way you can put your game for the chinese market

h2overwatch 2 reviewh2

h1a failed attempt to revive the gameh1
entering the world of overwatch 2 i was fueled by a mix of anticipation and nostalgia especially given the impactful legacy of its predecessor the original overwatch was a landmark in teambased shooters combining vibrant characters with dynamic gameplay so naturally my expectations for this sequel were high with hopes of it pushing the boundaries even further but as i delved deeper into the game it became increasingly clear that overwatch 2 while carrying the torch of its name stumbled in ways that are hard to overlook lets break down what makes this game a shadow of what it could have been keep in mind that i will be comparing this title to overwatch 1 a lot

h1about this game h1

h2storyline h2
the storyline in overwatch 2 was a major disappointment for me it lacked the depth and innovation i was hoping for especially considering the rich lore established in the first game the character arcs seemed flat with new heroes failing to bring any significant narrative to the table it felt as if the game was content to rest on the laurels of its predecessor without making any meaningful strides in storytelling this neglect of narrative development was a real missed opportunity to deepen the games universe and engage players on a more emotional level

h2gameplay mechanics h2
bucombatub
the combat in overwatch 2 is another area that warrants discussion its an integral part of the gameplay experience yet it feels like it hasnt evolved much from the original game
list
bcombat dynamicsb the dynamics of the combat feel offkilter the pacing often swings between being too chaotic to moments where its unexpectedly sluggish this inconsistency makes it hard to find a rhythm during matches leading to a disjointed experience in a game where teamwork and strategy should be paramount these erratic shifts in tempo can be disorienting
bhero balanceb a key issue in the combat is the balance among the heroes some heroes clearly have an edge over others making certain matchups feel unfair this imbalance disrupts the strategic aspect of the game where ideally each hero should have strengths and weaknesses that players can exploit or counter instead it often comes down to who has the more powerful heroes detracting from the skill and teamwork aspect for instance i feel like the new hero mauga is too overpowered
btactical depthb theres also a noticeable lack of tactical depth in the combat in overwatch the joy of combat was often in the clever use of hero abilities and teamwork to outmaneuver opponents in overwatch 2 this seems diluted the new heroes and abilities dont add much to the tactical play often feeling more like gimmicks than meaningful contributions to the combat system the player base is pretty small right now which means matchmaking is messed up new players are getting pitted against highlevel players this is not an experience someone is eager to go through when they play a game for the first time
list

bugame modesub
along with the beloved classic modes overwatch 2 offers new ones like push and flashpoint to liven things up while flashpoint shakes things up with teams fighting for control spots on some of the biggest maps available in ow2 push is this awesome strategic tugofwar additionally new limited time modes constantly appear adding to the excitement and freshness of the gameplay and it appears like even more fun is ahead of us with clash just around the corner its obvious that the sequel is adding to the playbook rather than simply resting on previous achievements to keep us interested

buheroesub
the new heroes introduced are a mixed bag while they bring fresh abilities to the game they dont quite integrate well with the existing roster some heroes feel overpowered overshadowing the older ones disrupting the games balance the lack of significant updates or changes to the original heroes adds to the feeling of stagnation making the gameplay feel repetitive rather quickly

buclassesub
the class system in overwatch 2 feels underdeveloped the roles of damage tank and support are there but the balance between them seems off tanks feel less impactful while some damage heroes seem overly dominant leading to a less cohesive team experience the support class often feels undervalued which can lead to frustrating gameplay for those who enjoy playing these roles i feel like the main reason for this imbalance was changing the game from 6v6 to 5v5 as the entire core of the game was built around the 6v6 matches in mind

buwhy is the game hated so muchub
overwatch 2 has overwhelmingly negative reviews on steam with a rating of 210 rather than reading through all the reviews just to find out why heres a tldr version
olist
bminimal changes from overwatch 1b we feel that overwatch 2 is more of a minor update than a fullfledged sequel they point out that the graphics and gameplay are only slightly improved with few new maps heroes and only one new game mode
bdevelopment and content issuesb the development of overwatch 1 was halted for years with promises of substantial content for overwatch 2 however players are disappointed as only a minor new game mode was added and other promised content like the pve campaign was canceled
bmonetization and accessibilityb the shift to a freetoplay model introduced heavy microtransactions this change made obtaining items and new characters especially without paying a grind the best characters and skins are perceived as locked behind a paywall
bcompany ethical concernsb theres a growing distrust in blizzard due to various ethical concerns including allegations of workplace misconduct and a focus on profit over quality game development this distrust has negatively impacted the reception of overwatch 2
bimpact on player baseb the requirement to play and win numerous matches to unlock new characters is seen as overly taxing especially for new players who didnt own the first game who would want to play 150 matches to unlock all the default characters which were freetouse in overwatch 1
olist

h1prosh1
list
 retains the core overwatch gameplay style
 some visual improvements over the original
 introduction of new heroes and maps
 freetoplay model potentially attracting new players
 introduction of new game modes and ltms that ensure the gameplay doesnt go stale
list

h1consh1
list
 lacks significant innovation feels like an incremental update rather than a true sequel
 canceled pve campaign and other promised content
 heavy reliance on microtransactions and a grindheavy system for unlocking new characters
 ethical concerns with the developer blizzard affecting player trust
 imbalance in hero power and abilities
 allegations of workplace misconduct within blizzard
 general sentiment of disappointment among the player community due to unmet expectations and changes in game direction
list

h1conclusionh1
in conclusion overwatch 2 has been a significant letdown for many in the gaming community its failure to innovate significantly from the first game coupled with unfulfilled promises of new content and a heavyhanded approach to microtransactions has tarnished its reception the ethical concerns surrounding blizzard have further fueled the discontent while it retains some elements of the originals charm these issues overshadow the games potential leading to a sense of disappointment and skepticism about its future

they deleted ow1 which many people including me bought for 40 on release instead we got this garbage excuse of a game where every skin  hero is locked behind a paywall and you cannot earn the currency through lootboxes anymore you have to buy legendary skins 20 each and theres a battlepass as well now lol also they scratched the pve content which was the only justification for this game 

tldr its a greedy cash grab activision blizzard is a garbage company

h1overwatch 2 is abysmal and an unmitigated disasterh1
this game was already in a bad state before being launched on steam because of the changes that they made going from ow1  ow2
6v6 down to 5v5
dps increase for tanks  healers
worse monetization
unbalanced characters

on top of that they scrapped the pve hero mode which resulted in a lot people wasting their money 
and they thought it would be a good idea to shove in some virtuesignalling and diversityinclusion for optics because of all the sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits against them

ijust when you think it cant get any worse it cani 

they made overwatch 2 available on steam which opened themselves up to be publicly criticized on a popular gaming platform that resulted in them getting review bombed and is now officially 
bthe worst user reviewed game on steamb
this has also attracted a lot of unoobsu and utoxic individualsu into playing overwatch 2 which completely changes the dynamic of how the game feels in an unpleasant way

bblizzard doesnt exist its just activision puppeteering a corpseb
to the people who killed overwatch 1 and to the developers of overwatch 2 i hope you burst in flames and go to hell

h1boverhyped and underdelivered the sad reality of overwatch 2bh1
butldrub
 the reason why i installed this on steam is to solely leave a negative review the only thing not covered behind a paywall in this game is the free download this piss poor excuse of a sequel is seriously underwhelming and the disgusting community is literally fed through prn content bido not play itib

 like most people who played the original overwatch everyone eagerly awaited the release of boverwatch 2b with high hopes and expectations unfortunately that excitement turned into disappointment delving into the sequel iblizzardi took everything that made the first game enjoyable and tossed it out the window

h1graphicsh1
 first off the graphics and design are an absolute letdown overwatchs charm lays in its vibrant and unique character designs but overwatch 2 seems to have taken a detour into the uncanny valley the characters now look like they are trying too hard to be realistic and the oncecelebrated art style has been replaced with a mishmash of uninspired visuals that lack the originals personality

h1unbalanced gameplayh1
 gameplaywise it is a mess the new pve emphasis they touted feels like a cheap attempt to cash in on the coop trend the missions are repetitive and lack the dynamic objectives that made the original games matches so engaging it is as if the developers thought that throwing in waves of enemies would automatically translate to fun gameplay spoiler alert it doesnt whats worse balancing issues from the first game seemed to have followed the developers into overwatch 2 and perhaps even worsened the new heroes are either overpowered or utterly useless leaving players frustrated as they navigate through uneven matches the development team practically tossed the concept of playtesting out the window and crossed their fingers hoping for the best

h1horrible storyh1
 the muchanticipated story mode falls face flat while the idea of delving into the backstories of the beloved characters was intriguing the execution was lackluster at best the narrative feels disjointed and the emotional arcs are rushed and fail to make a lasting impact it is clear that the focus was more on quantity than quality when it came to the story content

h1paytowinh1
 and lets not even get started on the microtransactions and monetization the game seems to have taken a page out of the worst kind of freetoplay models with players bombarded by loot boxes and cosmetics that cost an arm and a leg the games approach to cosmetics feels predatory and overly aggressive it is evident that iblizzardi is more interested in squeezing money out of players than providing a satisfying and rewarding progression system

h1conclusionh1
 all in all overwatch 2 feels like a rushed attempt to cash in on the popularity of the original without understanding what made the first game special it is a shadow of its predecessor and i cannot help but feel that the developers have let down their loyal fanbase save your money and stick to the original overwatch  at least there you will find the magic that overwatch 2 sorely lacks

h1bscore 4510bh1

this game makes me want to install genshin

#####

rereleased overwatch added bugs removed content removed free cosmetics and locked new characters behind a paywall call this overwatch 5 because its a step backwards

#####

i tried being reasonable didnt take to it  mccree from overwatch 1

tldr
i lament how this game transformed from a promising dream into a significant mess
i am saddened by the lack of respect given to their communitie
i discuss how the gold rush greed and inexperienced employees ruined this game and made everyone angry and toxic


look
this game is a sht show a disaster a shame
it was once the best and only game of its kind in the market but sadly the new employees at blizzard have ruined it
why i guess there are a few reasons perhaps first of all because they can and some political nonsense about sexual harassment in the office that tarnishes their reputation
perhaps its also about how sad it was when the director of overwatch 1 left the company jeff your name will be forever blessed amen
but above all i see greed as the number one reason for this colossal failure

i have spent more than 5000 hours on the original game ive been there since its release and ive finally lost faith in the developers ability to make things right
because they just dont
they ban people for discussing the truth about how bad this game has become and how the staff show no respect for those who spend money on their games
clearly i understand that sometimes you need to ban those individuals who use offensive language towards each other but thats not whats happening here
toxic behavior in this game has always been a major problem but it only got worse after the developers started milking their customers wallets like cows
seriously blizzard how dare you ask your community for 20 for old skins just for that you should be banished from steam
after that you introduced a lot of paytowin elements like having to buy a battle pass to get the new character quickly
sometimes it feels like the developers care only about making new skins to sell instead of adding content or fixing simple bugs in the game

for example the most familier bug is that many players from overwatch 1 lost their skins after going to overwatch 2
i am still troubled by that bug today and none of the skins i had have been returned to me
ironically as i mentioned before they are selling many of the skins i lost for 20 each
hold on its getting worse
i see theyve even started to redesign old skins with nothing more than new colors and theyre selling those for 20 each as well

when you see such a welloiled machine trying to grab every penny you have i personally find it disgusting and am filled with regret

now for some personal truth i was banned two weeks ago
why i just dont know it wasnt the first time i was banned and they always send me an email accusing me of things they say ive done
but now there is no email there is nothing  just an error message that says check your email
well i guess i just give up
this game isnt worth my time or anyone elses time go do something better with your life even the adult films of this game are much better

why r u looking for positive

go switch back to all comments

#####

this game is a shadow of its former self the devs let the game die in 2019 when there was no new content for 35 years they promised an entire pve campaign for ow1 and called it ow2 which would have been an entire story pve game with high replayability and unique upgradebuild choices for your hero there were trailers streamers who play tested the early levels with already programmed maps builds and much more video evidence of a standalone title they lied to the player base that ow2 would be a seperate game from ow1 and that they will temporarily merge ow2 and ow1 until ow2 pve releases they knew for atleast 4 years that this will not be the case and despite of this made promises to the community that all will happen as they promised with the start of ow2 however they fired all the old devs from ow1 jeff kaplan left prior to this on his own and hired a completely different team to say that ow2 is full of bugs would be an understatement abilities glitch out entire maps have open spaces where you could hide during a competetive ranked game and be invulnarable to enemies to blizzards credit some of the bugs were fixed some were not but the worst offender by far was the bug that at the end of a competetive season players rank would decrease from what they actually achieved at the season end people in gm got placed in m5 for example some players jumped ranks from plat2 to master5 without actually getting this rank during the active season titles from the season rank rewards got mixed up not delivered at all this was the case for atleast 4 season and blizzard adjusted the ranks 6 weeks after the new season had already started since the start of season 5 there were no adjustments to this day however despite the same rank bug happening again now they officially anounced that the so long promised pve standalone title ow2 will be canceled instead they sell the game in little portions story events which take 2030 mins per story mission and cost around 15 for 4 missions what a sad joke i was in love with ow1 and the vison jeff kaplan had in mind but this transformation from a loved game to this ruthless cash grab led me to abandon this game for good no amount of copium could convince me to trust this game again what an end of a legacy

#####

















#####

someone made a custom game mode that reverts it back to ow1 6v6 it even rolls back the hero changes i just play that and pretend ow2 never happened 1010 im delusional

fun fact an ingame gadget that is attached to a weapon is more expensive than an actual physical one in blizz shop

i dont know where to start overwatch 1 was a great game i have many hours on blizz account so this is not written from a newcomers perspective back in the jeff kaplan days this game was so enjoyable there were more boring metas  sure but overall game was enjoyable but lets recap
o1 development stoped around 2020 and after two years in 22 o2 was seeing daylight they took away our o1 from accounts and upgraded to a sequel it would be worth it they said as we will get pve finally but they did not deliver it makes me believe that only mockups were made from leaks and sneak peeks for me it was orchestrated move to change b2p overwatch into a f2p title with more predatory microtransactions in order to satisfy shareholders if you lurk around forums you will see that people miss old lootboxes and when people miss them you fd up big time 

what is super cool about overwatch on steam is that they can no longer censor negative feedback  posts i find it funny that blizz is calling this review bombing  its not we can finally be heard and the game we used to love is no more

if blizzard is smashed by a meteorite in 2020 it will be a sad game company
if blizzard is hit by a meteorite this year it will be a good meteorite

i have never been so disgusted by blizzard entertainment as a company forget the incident in hearthstone forget diablo immortals announcement and the infamous you guys dont have phones line forget the company simply cancelling development of heroes of the storm and the esports forget wows shadowlands launch or even shadowlands entirely forget those things for a moment even if you didnt know they existed

blizzard simply cancelling the hero mode entirely scrapping content that was shown at blizzcon of 2019 including a talent tree system clan system items and so much more that made the game immersive and fans were in awe of it all they wanted to be a part of the game they wanted to play the pve mode alot because the archive missions as short and sweet as they were were very enjoyable i for one am a pve player which might turn this review bias but ive also amassed hundreds of hours in the pvp side of things pre 2020 if you asked me i really did not like the goats meta some people did but i found it boring and annoying so i atleast know what im talking about or so i claim

lets just go back in time for a few moments all the way back to 2004 two whole decades ago blizzard was really setting their foot in later in that year when they finally launched world of warcraft dare i say it it was one of the most successful mmos that launched at the time and later on in wrath of the lich king it would have over 10 million players thats alot of people no matter who you asked at this time blizzard knew how to make a successful game whether it be the raids and dungeons with the pve side of things or the oldschool battleground systems of the pvp there was something for everyone in wow and despite it now looking like a jumbled mess of new players being scared and overwhelmed back then it was blizzards most prized ip at the time

so why am i talking about a completely different game in this review even if its by the same company because blizzard knew how to do pve stuff very well the art direction the gameplay the core components of keeping players addicted either for 15 dollars a month or to simply spend time with their friends in a starcraft 2 game or heck even diablo 3 as much as that game sucked on launch it still went on to be a successful blizzard game even if it had its flaws and some glaring problems they werent a massive problem and the game was still praised for the pve

what im trying to say is that blizzard knows how to make pve titles sure they know how to make pvp titles like the top down strategy games of warcraft and starcraft and even in wow in some degree but their pve was how many players were sucked in to playing their titles its how wow has a thriving raiding and roleplaying community the immersion or grind for success was always there

and then sometime later they had a super secret project called project titan long story short it morphed into overwatch and the game was set to release in 2016 as blizzards next title the gameplay footage prelaunch really shows that blizzard put so much care and effort in the original game i was easily blown away by the gameplay in the open beta just 2 weeks before it launched ive poured hundreds of hours into the game overwatch 1 has gotten many updates over its cycle with new heroes every 34 months cool seasonal updates it really felt like the game was in a healthy and active development

now lets return to the present more specifically when blizzcon 2019 was around overwatch 2 was announced thats crazy overwatch is only 3 and a half years old at this point why even make a sequel turns out the developers want to update the game hard enough to really flesh out the lore with coop story missions a hero mode and a talent tree sign me the frick up that sounds so amazing

and then the years start ticking 2019 finally passed by the hype was real 2020 passed with little to no new information on the hero mode or the story missions 2021 passed with only a developer stream revealing more content about pvp and maybe some teasing of pve at this point were in 2022 with quite literally no release date on overwatch 2 no new information and a lot of radio silence about blizzard oh and the final hero echo was released in april of 2020 so overwatch was getting very stale and not much content was shown only seasonal stuff with cosmetics not even a new map

in early 2022 we got some hopes reignited that overwatch 2 might be releasing sometime in the current year as many content creators were signed under an nda and praising how overwatch 2 looked finally some good news on this title and while it might be understandable that it took so long perhaps that means theres a lot of content to be rummaging through right

right

well no the pve was not to be launched with the release of overwatch 2 now at a date in early october of 2022 and thats a massive bummer thats a huge drawback but the community was still hopeful that within a later season the hero mode would be promised and hopefully be in the game soon with that juicy talent tree and multiple replayable missions right

right

nothing radio silence as always blizzards worst tactic they dont like telling us whats in the bag because of how fans will portray it as and come may of 2023 a post was made by the overwatch development team stating that the hero mode the talent trees and all of the stuff shown about the pve from blizzcon 2019 was scrapped gone

what happened no really what happened

no seriously im being genuinely honest what the fuck happened i barely swear in these kinds of rants about a company that it has to be known from november of 2019 to october of 2022 what happened why is the only change to overwatch 2 from 1 a graphics overhaul the game going free to play removing one less tank from the team comp now making it 5v5 three new heroes about 7 or so maps a new gamemode a battle pass system i hate triple a titles that do this its not fun its not cool a shop with ingame cosmetics skins that costed you 20 dollars with no suitable difference other than they look cool and a bunch of other things that i really want to talk about but i genuinely just cant find the words for them im sure you know what they are considering this game is being review bombed so hard literally the top review i saw points out how little to no effort and care overwatch 2 is compared to the r34 scene of the game

and now they migrate to steam well actually i dont think it was blizzard entertainments decision i think it was microsofts decision at least they know the battlenet launcher sucked with them hopefully putting more of their titles in on steam its a good decision because 3rd party apps have always tried to be hip and cool and not put their stuff on steam but the truth is most of these launchers are horrible and outdated now if only epic games ditched their launcher oh what am i saying

so effectively this game is a cash grab it originally was 60 dollars back in 2016 later reduced to i think 40 or 30 and now its free to play i highly encourage you to never touch this game and if you think this review sucks i highly encourage you to watch urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7nyeqodelideath of a game overwatch 2url by nerdslayer studios or urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgjakz5kssdghow blizzard killed overwatch twiceurl by savantics or hell even give skyminslashs urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzp45q3gbhmowhy ow2s pve fails but tf2s mvm succeedsurl video a watch theres hundreds of these videos out there pointing out so many flaws and problems with overwatch 2 and blizzards greed but these three really highlighted the core issues the most

i hope you have a wonderful day after reading and remember

no king rules forever

well to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion without being sentimental of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also by looking into this matter in distinct perspective and without condemning anyones view and by trying to make it objectified and by considering each and everyones valid opinion i honestly believe that team fortress 2 is better than overwatch 2

#####

ive been with overwatch since its inception in 2016 pouring my heart and soul into it from day one the exhilarating matches the intense team dynamics and the deep sense of camaraderie that formed over the years  it was more than just a game to me i stood by its side through all the ups and downs defending it from naysayers this was a world i believed in a haven where my friends and i found joy and refuge

remember the promise of pve the potential for rich narrativedriven experiences that would expand upon the lore weve all grown to love its as if those dreams were swept away just like the hopes of countless players when blizzard decided to cancel the pve aspect the game i invested years into the very game that taught me the value of perseverance and teamwork bwas stripped of its core promises b 

and then theres the dark figure of bobby kotick the embodiment of corporate greed and avarice his influence on blizzard has turned a oncebeloved company into a soulless machine focused solely on profit the departure of so many talented developers the minds behind the magic that captivated us left a void thats irreplaceable what remains are the echoes of what once was

overwatch 2s story missions watereddown shadows of what could have been epic tales now treated as mere addons to be purchased its heartbreaking to see a game that was once celebrated for its creativity and innovation devolve into a monetization scheme squeezing players dry for scraps of content that pale in comparison to the original vision

so here i am a player who once poured blood sweat and tears into overwatch now left with a heavy heart the spark that ignited my passion has dimmed overshadowed by disappointment and sorrow overwatch 2 feels like a tombstone a memorial to what once was a painful reminder of a time when things were different a time when we believed in the magic

alright lets actually provide a constructive review why are people review bombing overwatch 2

we paid for overwatch we supported it throughout its lifespan it was popular and liked by its community and turning a happy profit each year

when blizzard announced overwatch 2 the big new feature they announced the entire premise that made it worth the sequel treatment was the pve campaign mode hero talent trees customizable abilities an expansive coop campaign that would add to the story and lore we were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldnt be putting out updates for overwatch any more they were reallocating the staff to work on this new project

with no updates and no content overwatch started to get stale people grew tired and bored spending less time in the game or moving on many of us stuck with the product playing a little each week just to keep fresh waiting for the new campaign mode for a lot of us playing became a chore something we were doing out of habit so wed be ready for the new campaign

but the new campaign wasnt the premise that established ow2 it was the pretext it was a lie blizzard abandoned the pve campaign a full year before ow2 launched  but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature its even in the announcement trailer for ow2 and on the roadmaps they knew theyd canned it 12 months earlier but they knew thats what people wanted so kept putting it front and centre to get peoples money to get people to buy into the project they took our trust and monetized it



what does ow2 actually offer then what did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldnt make content for ow1 the product people paid for and were supporting

1 they overhauled the graphical engine

before overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer and itd be smooth now it stutters and stammers in the menus theyve added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world heroes and environment alike  so where before heros would pop against the background and be easy to follow now everything has the same texture to it and it all merges together into visual noise  especially at longer ranges theyve compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos a pvp game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what youre looking at so you can react and compete and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled

the new engine also has a weird slippery feel to it reviewers whod played overwatch for 50 hours came into overwatch 2 and reported look its the same overwatch you love but its f2p now just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously feel like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing and they didnt understand why all the timings are messed up

2 they reworked most of the heroes

tldr they screwed up the game balance previously one of the biggest appeals of overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style and main them getting good at whatever suited you best some people like sniping or hitscan run and gun some people arent good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning tactics and strategy you could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy and paying attention to your surroundings and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference

with overwatch 2 the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily now the one tank on the team is insanely chunky and its near impossible to kill them quickly  with healer support they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh everyone else dies almost immediately regardless of who their aggressor is

teamfighting now is very onenote you have one tank whos immortal if they have support and you have four hitscan dps characters following them  theres not a lot of difference between supports and dps characters the teams try to pick off the other teams dpssupport characters and when they pick a few off they can finish the tank and take the objective repeat theres no room for variation in play style at all you either play a dps and try to kill the other team dps or you play a tank and try to position correctly  maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you

i understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights they wanted the game to feel more like other fps games  but for a large portion of overwatchs playerbase specifically the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter

3 they got incredibly greedy with the monetization

its a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming but overwatch was one of the few examples of lootboxes done right most of the longterm players of the game actually liked the system that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly i started playing ow1 with the first anniversary cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week and at the launch of ow2 i owned every single item in the game those who didnt have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted and lets be honest when you have your favourite skin how much do you care about unlocking other skins  and those who didnt want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it  if they wanted to

the new system puts almost everything behind a paywall the minute number of cosmetics on the free track are often insultingly lazy simple recolours or minor alterations while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for 20 the content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you even content from the first game that was originally free is now paid only

battlepass systems suck pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot if you dont you have to pay us more or lose the stuff you already paid for  limited time deals rotating shop offers fomo fomo fomo it reeks of manipulation and insincerity

4 occasional dlc packs of pve adventures

these are blizzards new approach to pve occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a pve mission you can pay in my uk currency 13 for the dlc pack or 35 the cost of a good indie game for the ultimate bundle

so heres the thing  this content is the same amount of content and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios  its just now instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up  now theyre paid dlc

nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely it doesnt make anyone like adobe photoshop or microsoft office and it doesnt make anyone like blizzard



so this is why people are review bombing your game you took something we paid for supported and enjoyed for years lied to us about your plans and turned it into trash now youre telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for its greedy its cynical its manipulative and youve lost our trust

also you should fire bobby kotick
