this game takes me back its saturday afternoon cartoons are over its just me and the snes mom just told me shes ordering pizza and its gonna be a good night

#####

my feelings on this game are complicated  yes im giving it a thumbs up and yes i think its a good game that is worth a jrpg lovers time but i have a lot of criticisms too

i am the poster child of this games target audience  i was a jrpg lover of the 90s and consider chrono trigger to be nearlyunmatched masterpiece that it generally lauded to be  i played and loved super mario rpg where the timed hits took inspiration from and the old zeldas and lufia ii where the puzzles likely drew from  i was a backer on kickstarter and i thought this was going to be the one  the topdog chrono trigger spiritual successor that ive waited nearly 30 years for  sea of stars to that mission did not deliver im afraid  i 100 cleared the game got the true ending found the easter eggs completed all minigames etc

this games visuals can only be described as outstanding  im a pixelart andy and sea of stars knocks the visuals straight out of the stratosphere  the lighting the vibrant color palettes the absolutely absurd number of sprite animations for each of the main cast for the various traversal means they use in the world climbing tight rope walking swimming etc  chefs kiss sea of stars raised the bar here  they set a new standard for how gorgeous a retroinspired rpg can be  while still capturing that retro look and feel

the sound was pretty good  it had some bangers i like encounter and the jungle theme as two right off the top of my head  the sound effects were also solid and the sound more than holds its own  its not giving me earworms like any trails game would but i was still generally delighted by what i was hearing

regarding gameply ill start with the most important part the combat  its honestly just ok  the combat has some problems  first its very easy  i mean lets face facts chrono triggers a masterpiece and that game wasnt hard either but sea of stars just has some really gamebreaking mechanics like serais disorient or a certain characters ultimate which drastically delay enemy turns  this stuff was abusable to the point where most midlate game bosses could be killed without getting virtually any turns  still i dont personally play a game like this for dire challenge so lets just move on

the timed hits and blocks were again just ok in my opinion  i probably could have done without the  moonerang and sunball felt great  venom flurry had this frustrating problem where often serai would be offscreen so youre trying to time it blindly  not great  blocking felt considerably worse to me because the animations in the game were a little janky  a lot of attacks came from nowhere like spikes coming from the ground  blocking horizontal projectiles felt good but many other attacks it was a matter of if you knew the animation or not for me the novelty of the timing wore off  pretty quickly and by the end of the game moonerang my favorite spell just felt tediously long to execute because i was going to get many bounces  this segues into my next complaint  lack of abilities  barring combos and each characters lateish game ultimate ability they were each relegated to 3 abilities  and they start with two  what a travesty  progression is a key cornerstone in rpgs and unlocking new abilities is a key to that  the games severe lack of ability variety made mechanic progression feel almost nonexistent  new combos were ok but combos arent usable on demand  same with ultimates and in both cases some options grossly outshone the others im looking at you mr eagle  and its made even worse by the fact that most characters had wildly underused abilities from their meager lot of 3  moonerang disorient and sunball got a lot more play than any other moves  if youre going to give me that small of a lot of abilities at least dont make it a nobrainer which one im going to use 90 of the time   i felt pretty burnt out of it by the end of the game  and the trash mobs in the game just felt too beefy  they were seldom hard but i kept wishing i could falcon hit my way through trash and be on with my session rather than being routinely stopped by the harmless punching bags

exploration was fantastic  it must be the freest and most interactive traversal ive ever seen in a retroinspired rpg like this  you can swim in that body of water  you can climb that ledge  or jump off if theres a space below to land on  you really felt like you could touch the world you were exploring and you were often rewarded with treasures or vistas  or both  for doing so  an retroinspired jrpg had no right to have this good of traversal but sos went ahead and raised the bar anyway  well done

the mini games were ok  the fishing was basic cute and lean  100 clearing the games fishing was pretty much not a chore at all and the ridiculously overpowered food you could cook from said fish was all the more incentive for me to do it  the wheels game was a good deal more tedious bordering on annoying  it was unique and actually really cool looking so ill applaud that but i would have skipped it if i could have more on that later then there were plenty of puzzles i honestly found them delightful  none were so complicated as to be frustrating but they utilized the games outstanding visuals and broke up the exploration in just the right way

the dual protagonists are extremely bland carbon copies of one another  seriously their dialogue could be 100 interchange  we have the summer solstice blade dancer and the winter solstice lunar monk  the yinandyang personalities we could have had would have been tropey but they almost write themselves but we got 2 selfinserts  in a game with pretty much 5 playable characters mind you  everyone will tell you garl is the best character in the game and heart and soul of the party and id agree to that  but even then garl was just a onenote happy guy in a room full of drones and selfinserts  he was a good character who shone above all the drab and boring ones he surrounded himself with  none of the characters have a meaningful progression arc either  the villains were laughably bad and boring

storywise im a guy who can appreciate a slowburn but sos was excruciating in this front  trails in the sky fc is my favorite jrpg of all time  that game is the uncontested king of the slow burn but but where sky was different was that it enticed you through witty dialogue endearing characters and masterclass worldbuilding  sos has none of those things  the dialogue is never good  and for hours you just feel like youre traipsing around a completely inchoerent world  the world buildings not there just a mosaic of beautiful areas that dont plausibly connect to the other only to be passed through or explored for some powerup artifact needed to progress the plot  sos is completely plotdriven  youre the chosen ones  the world needs you  kill the big bad  the first three quarters of the game feels like one elongated fetch quest  game picks a up a bit after that but its too little too late  i never felt invested in the world or any of the characters  by the end to my utter dismay the only way you can get the true ending is by 100 completing allthesidecontent  the cardinal sin of rpgs is forcing optional content

overall sos is a good game but its not a great one  its carried by its bestinclass visuals and exploration but made some big gameplay flaws and had really bad charactersdialoguewriting  sure it tickled my nostalgia and i did onbalance enjoy my time  but i was disappointed  the game has the soul and polish of a masterpiece but some bad gameplay choices and extremely weak writing hold it back  i give it a 610  chained echoes is the better indie title of this generation

#####

the golden sun experience of my dreams

#####

youre 13 its a saturday afternoon and the microwave just beeped your pizza rolls are ready you grab them and quickly run back into your room to sit in front of the snes this game feels like that

#####

it is passionfilled games like these that make corporate cashgrabs filled with gacha and battlepasses an absolute embarrassment

this is what real art looks like

#####

let me just start by saying this game launched with the incredibly unfortunate problem of having the wrong set of english scripts loaded into the game and that resulted in the first 8ish hours of content basically being filled with placeholder text hell even the longterm collectible figure minigame had game code in the dialogue boxes for the tutorial this has been fixed as of september 1st but that still means the i overwhelming majority i of negative reviews complaining about poor writing quality lack of punctation etc are no longer true edit ive gone through the prologue chapters again while the earlier sections of the game i have i been touched up theyre still not nearly up to the standard set by the rest of the game if youre not willing to read through 100 lines of mediocrity under the promise of eating good later on id advise against buying

okay actual review  pretty much everything is excellent the mostcommonlypraised aspects are the music and overall art with the environmental designs being easily some of the best in the industry though the actual maps are fairly linear the music consistently hits a high bar to the point that boss fights often took a good minute to actually get started since id just idle in menu and listen for a bit additionally nearly every song in the game has versions for both day and night as well as a tavernband style doppelganger that you can play at every inn once you find the related sheet music they spent a ton of effort on the ost alone and it paid off pretty well and thats ignoring the fact that they got chrono triggers composer yasunori mitsuda for a chunk of it

the combat is probably the weakest part of the game but not by much basic combat overview is as follows everyone has fairly low mana capacity which can be restored with basic attacks you can lower damage takenincrease damage dealt by timing button presses and doing certain things fills up a meter thats used for tagteamcombo attacks  a separate meter thats used for ultimate attacks though that last one takes a while to unlock therere 2 fairlyunique mechanics locks and raw mana whenever an enemy starts up a special attack you have the opportunity to interrupt it by hitting it with enough hits of certain damage types indicated by the locks above the enemy smaller moves usually have 24 locks while big moves often have 6 or more even if you cant interrupt the enemy destroying even a few of the locks will weaken the power of the move raw mana meanwhile is a resource you generate with basic attacks that can be spent to increase damage output for your next attack in addition to adding magic damage to nonmagical moves this can be used for things such as breaking locks getting around highphysicaldefense enemies without spending mana or adding a hefty damage bonus overall the combat is fairly simple while still being engaging due to resource management and the lock system which organically adds puzzle elements to boss fights figuring out what moves you need to do in order to make that mage fizzle the nuke theyre prepping is satisfying to pull off and the lock system in general gives you a good reason to use everyone in your party instead of focusing on 23 people

there are some caveats to the combat however with the most common complaint being every characters moveset everyone gets 3 moves an ultimate and at least 1 combo attack with every other member thats it the devs ditched the rpg standard of constantly upgrading your moves firefirafiragastyle in favor of every character getting a wellrounded kit as well as a niche to fill everyone can and should deal damage all but 1 character can heal and everyone does everything in different ways theres no dedicated roles and i personally think the games better off for it but i can understand people getting annoyed over the relative lack of options theres also the slight issue of the lock system rarely behaving in strange ways sometimes id start a battle and an enemy would have a lock i cant break without a combo attack which is impossible to do turn1 there was also a brief portion of the game where i was getting locks for a damage type i didnt even have yet it was only a few minutes until i got the required character for it but i hope these things gets fixed

finally we have the story  its relatively simple yet still impactful  the kind that anyone can enjoy but might be left wanting if theyre looking for political messages or detailheavy worldbuilding the main duo are both psuedoselfinserts that are fairly normal personalitywise and dont really do much to define themselves the storys set in a way that you see these two from childhood to young adulthood  no dark backstory no complex motivations nothing tragic about these two most of the wouldbe writing for them is instead funneled into their friend who rounds out the starting party and i have half a mind to think this fucker will go down in history as one of the greatest rpg brotypes of alltime dudes awesome i dont want to say too much about the later party members but theyre all pretty damn good although one is lacking in terms of character and instead has a coolyetadorable set of animations the actual overarching plot takes a while to get started i got to it at around the 6hour mark some people got to it at 12 but id say its excellent the main villains interesting and the game likes to throw around a bunch of neat ideas for regions and artifacts  a mountain that had holes carved in it in order to play a lullaby to lull a destructive dragon to sleep and a book that magically records the history of detailed objects it touches to name a couple theres some particularly creative stuff later on but i wont detail it here

the weakest part of the game writingwise  first few areas aside  is definitely the ending spoiler the default ending is a slap in the face and thats putting it lightly you need to get the true ending in order to get something good thankfully the conditions are mostlylenient just do optional bosses and get a bunch of collectibles but even then theres a decent number of plot threads that seem to be left hanging at least at first glance apparently the devs have been running an argalternate reality game in their discord server since around 2018 and that ties into both this game and the messenger enabling the community to interact with characters and affect the story of upcoming games ive looked into it and its pretty damn interesting but theres no indication of this within the game itself and a good chunk of players are going to be missing out spoiler

if you havent played it already the demos a very good indicator of whether youll enjoy the gameplay music and map design the spike in writing quality is rather inconveniently only apparent for all the content i after i the bits that the demo covers this is a very good title if you can get past the start of it

#####

ive just finished it and now my life is meaningless

#####

if you love chrono trigger you will like sea of stars

the beginning has that same mystical aura that washed over me the first time i played chrono trigger on my snes in august 1995 on my 16th birthday 

i love sea of stars and its flawless on the steam deck

update i have now 100ed the game including breaking the 4th wall and exhausting the shopkeeper i love this game i really do i have 5 final thoughts

1 i find it annoying when people complain about the 2 main characters lacking personality but chrono was a blank slate that never spoke and no one ever complains about him the dualprotagonists are just a backdrop to the stories of the other characters and the world like most mainline dragon quest games 

2 perhaps the most impressive thing is the complete originality of every single area there are zero reused tilesets every single second of game play is overflowing with unique masterful pixel art 

3 im also annoyed when people complain about the battle system i found every battle to be a fun enjoyable puzzle i finished the final 5 bosses with the artful gambit relic and it was a wonderful way to master the complexities of the battle system 

4 overall though the game was too easy i really hope the upcoming dlc ramps up the difficulty the picnic panic dlc for the messenger was a serious step up in difficulty and im hoping for the same in sea of stars 

5 thank you sabotage you created a masterpiece

#####

my favorite part of this game is playing moonerang

#####

all i have to say is 1 word wow 

this game is just us kids back in the early to mid 90s playing chorno trigger all over again but instead being kids we transformed to boring adults 

and one of those kids wanted another chrono trigger 2 but the big adults said no so one the kids promised to everyone one day they will make another game just like ct and everyone will be happy with joy 

fast forward to 2023 and the dream is indeed real 

this game screams nostalgia for those fans nothing but amazing from what ive played from the demo 

the game also has this this subtle love for lunar silver star story with the love of exploring adventures 

which is alone makes me fan 

the gameplay is just so rich and very fun you cant just sit there and press 1 button to attack no you have to watch cause some attacks requires you to focus and do some combos neat idea to stay on your 2 feet 

the music really good capture the world youre playing 

to every team who worked on this game just wanna say thank you and keeping the kids in the past happy 

5 stars from what ive played and if youre a fan of old school jrpg then you owe to yourself to try it you wont be sorry 



hopefully top 5 games this year for me 

sea of stars is a fitting name for a grand legacy that hopefully big devs can make your dreams bigger than the stars itself 

big thumbs up indeed

#####

basic game extremely well done like going home and eating your moms food after decades on the road

editing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game
 the level design in general is not that great with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first eventually it just feels like a chore
 not sure if its something with my steam deck but i had to put both the games and the screens brightness to the max to be able to see things before that i was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something
 while the game is 2d theres a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart you often dont know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it
 battle system gets repetitive after a while

despite those problems the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas

#####

best jrpg ive played since golden sun

#####

if super mario rpg and chrono trigger had a child it would be sea of stars

gorgeous pixel art

great soundtrack

engaging combat

good storytelling and likable characters

#####

its not a perfect game each character only learns 3 abilities and they start with 2 so it doesnt feel like theres a lot of skill progression and you use the same abilities save for combo abilities for most of the game the script definitely needed to be run through grammarly or something because there are way too many missing commas sentence fragments and other grammatical errors quite a few plot elements could have been explored in more detail the storys pretty good as they go but it doesnt feel as shocking or surprising as the games that inspired it its also slow to start the inciting incident and rising actions feel slow to come

with that said i was still totally enchanted by sea of stars i dont think everyone will be but i was the art is wonderful the musics catchy and fun the characters are likable and have tons of personality and the combat while simple is pretty engaging and does make you think a bit its also a really dense game it feels like theres 50 hours of stuff packed into game that at most clocks in at about 35 hours the dungeons for example are large and intricate zeldalike affairs complete with dungeon items sometimes and like zelda dungeons theyre packed with secret paths treasures and interesting traversal puzzles there are also a lot of them so many in fact that its a little bit mindboggling theres no filler here every bit of this game is packed with things to do side quests to find minigames to play and lore to uncover

the second coming of chrono trigger it is not but a really fun rpg with likable characters a fun world to explore and lots to do its probably one of the best games of its kind to come out in the past several years

#####

this game makes me feel like a kid playing their nintendo ds under the covers again

#####

sea of stars is canadian game devs beautiful rendition of a jrpg its inspired by the classics but not a direct lift sabotage studio did a great job of simply presenting nostalgic elements here and there to great effect without overly relying on them to deliver an experience that is uniquely theirs to express there were a few key elements that propelled this title near the top of my list and some smaller things here and there that were only okay all in all thanks to sea of stars im confident in the future of jrpgesque games as we get deeper into the 2020s

h3bthe worldbh3the most strikingly beautiful feature of this game is how the pixel world is presented expertly in an isometric fashion maybe its because some of my most played games of all time during the 90s were presented that way ragnarok online for one but out of everything ive played since the day i was born sea of stars has done the best job of presenting a gorgeous isometric world

h3bthe soundtrackbh3 second to the beautiful pixel world is my absolute love for this games soundtrack the turning point for me was when i stepped into a factorytype place it really opened my eyes to the way this game uses one of the tracks in many different mindblowing ways the soundtrack in the aforementioned area really gave me a 70s vibe or what i think a 70s vibe would sound like similar to when i listened to bdavid hasselhoffs true survivor from kung furyb it was awesome and unexpected in a good way

h3bthe charactersbh3admittedly the main characters are a bit bland in my opinion i think this may have been done uon purposeu for selfinsert purposes and because i think the main characters are not truly the main star of this sea of stars if you catch my drift i found myself way more enamored by the supporting cast and i seriously believe the game would just be as good even if bgb was made the focal point of the entire story

h3bthe combatbh3while the combat was not my favorite thing in this game i enjoyed the planning involved in breaking the more complex locks for certain boss fights i think the game would have benefited more in a tactical sense if 3way combo skills and lock breaking were a consideration theres definitely room to make this more exciting im also 5050 on how i feel about the button timing concept when it comes to less important battles but it didnt really affect my experience in a negative way i believe that out of all the elements in this game the combat has the most potential left to reach just as zale and valere keep on doing their pushups and situps i hope future sea of stars dlc can somehow innovate the combat mechanics further

h3bconclusionbh3roughly 47 hours deep and after obtaining the 100 im extremely satisfied with my purchase sea of stars is my first sabotage studio game and i look forward to trying the messenger at some point good job to these canadian game devs for a job well done 8 garls out of 10

#####

sea of stars is really really good 

its a throwback to old jrpgs that borders on being a love letter but never quite hits the mark youll recognize themes and plot threads echoing the games you grew up playing but unfortunately more often than not sea of stars doesnt do anything extremely interesting or new with them it tacitly acknowledges the references but never builds extrapolates or deconstructs any of them in a really meaningful manner it also feels like game rushes through some sections and some plot threadspoints far too quickly for the resolutions to be as satisfying as they could be theres also plot threads left floating and dangling though those could be addressed by dlc or a sequel

that said sea of stars is really really good the battle system is dynamic and intuitive the graphics and sounds are gorgeous and detailed and the story and plot are wellwritten and developed for what they are there are multiple endings and numerous sidequests its a great game if you like the genre im just frustrated because it could have been so much more

#####

the game is beautiful the lighting is sublime 

the difficulty is bang on as long as you dont use the relics that make it easier but hey if thats your thing or you have young kids that want to play its got great choices for that too

the ost is banger after banger seriously same guy that did chrono trigger

the beginning is a little slow dont try to do any exploration in the flashback and save yourself some time i checked every corner of everywhere because im that type of gamer and was slightly disappointed by that but theres definitely plenty of rewarding exploration outside the tutorial

i played this game for 16 hours straight after downloading it the combat is fun with timed blocks and combos i actually thought i got close to the end of the game before realizing that i was only just barely scratching the surface im glad i stuck out the slightly slow beginning because i kickstarted this baby nearly 5 years ago you can tell how much passion went into the game

buy it play it enjoy it

#####

this game does not claim to be specifically inspired by chrono trigger like many jrpgs yet its one of the most spiritually close candidates in years

edit i finished the game thank you for the experience

#####

for garl

#####

beautiful graphics repetitive yet challenging game play sound tracks off the chart

storyline couldve used some more work but still great

would play again 910

to put it briefly the game is amazing ive never seen a game with animation and pixel art this good for a tbs game the gameplay is really engaging since it keeps the players attention timing attacks and skills to maximize their effectiveness really prove that point if my understanding is correct the developers primary objective was to produce a game that would emulate the ones they had played as kids with that in mind i believe the game is ideal for the purpose it is intended for i played the game intently and i was pleasantly surprised by each turn of events it felt magnificent given the length of the game and its high level of polish the game is incredibly reasonably priced

i hope sabotage continues to produce games as amazing as this one it is unquestionably one of the best 2d games i have ever played therefore i recommend giving it a try

#####

a modern take on a 16bit rpg sea of stars just oozes charm throughout both visually and musically it is top notch and the gameplay is a lot of fun too it has little backtracking that is required although you will do some later on after unlocking new abilities but by that time you also have faster methods of travel

the story is pretty nice as well with the major downside being that the two main characters dont have much of a character fortunately the side characters  especially garl  make up for it

a neat thing the game has is adjustable difficulty with the relics system if like me you have problems hitting the timing for double attacks and blocks there are items you can equip that make this easier if conversely you want a tougher fight there is also a relic for that
there is a even a relic that autoheals after every combat encounter if you just want to enjoy the world and not deal with using items or magic to heal all the time

overall its a great presentation dont look up too much about the game as its best experienced as close to blind as possible and play it

as for the links to the messenger this game is completely playable even if you never played sabotages earlier game the main link between the two are some broad story hints and cameos

#####

many indie devs make turnbased rpgs and say something like this is a love letter to classic rpgs on the snes but none of them have ever quite captured that feeling

sea of stars does and it does so beautifully i love this game and im glad it was a day one purchase for me do yourself a favor and buy this amazing game

#####

its great to see saturos and menardi again after all these years

#####

garl is the goat

#####

 jirard is gone from the game 

#####

remember the golden era of snes with games like chrono trigger breath of fire and dragon quest you do cool then buy this game its like them with better graphics and qualityoflife upgrades have fun

#####

chrono trigger meets mario legend of the seven stars thats how i see it love the game finished my first playthrough on game pass bought the game full price here on steam for my 2nd playthrough for complete achievement and true ending i have no complaints soundtrack is good story and character development is amazing wonderful game overall

ps
after reaching the true ending and getting 100 achievement ive come to say its a 1010 for me im moved with the story with sabotages work and now im about to purchase the messenger thank you for making a great game

congratulations for best indie game of the year 2023

#####

nonspoiler review

i just finished playing this game then 100ing it and all i would like to say is please give the game a shot

sea of stars is a jrpg heavily inspired by old school jrpgs from the 90s and early 2000s if youre familiar with games like chrono triggerchrono cross golden sun and secret of mana then you should feel right at home its a love letter to the genre and the price to time spent playing makes this worth your while

the good

storytelling this is a story with high fantasy elements and environments as a quick summary your two starting characters are known as solstice warriors guardians whos goal is to protect and eradicate the world of dwellers world ending monsters youll have obstacles and characters who youll meet along the way learn new moves defeat monsters etc usual jrpg formulas the plot is engaging even during side quests and the characters you meet have a wide variety of personalities that really make you feel attached to them its an overall charming and enticing world and each area feels like its own 

gameplay 
the maps and overworld serve their purposes well inside maps your movement is pretty smooth and unrestricted you dont move in a grid while you can climb walls hop ledges swim and move objects you will also get upgrades that enhance and compliment these map elements which will be needed to progress further 
battle system is easy to understand with some added depth that rewards the player for executing it well pressing a button during specific timings will give you extra damage and perks if done correctly much like super mario rpg or paper mario there will also be times where an enemy will begin casting an ability and you have to perform specific types of attacks or elements to interrupt it or risk taking bigger damage there is a toggle you can enable to let you know when you time these correctly to help build muscle memory as well
for the collection aficionado there are tons of treasures and hidden items to find in maps ranging from valuables to equipment upgrades

art very fluid and animated pixel art helps make the world pop out just from running around with your party you can see fluid limps hair bouncing fabric moving buildings and environments are heavily detailed keeping you immersed wherever you are this becomes especially apparent when you fight huge bosses with loads of particles and animations and you start seeing so many details put into the animation and sprite work

music renowned composer yasunori mitsuda and eric w brown were in charge of the music for the game one big thing you have to have in a jrpg is a catchy and memorable battle theme as its likely going to be the song you hear the most in the game they absolute met this goal the music fit the environments and themes when needed and certain songs just stay stuck in your head

side content
outside of the main plot the side content and plotlines easily add an extra 1015 hours they put in quite a bit of extra content for people to focus on if they wanted to take a break
there is a lot of things to collect as mentioned above ranging from fishing to food ingredients for cooking
wheels whats a jrpg if it doesnt have its own built in minigame this is a table game popular throughout the world of sea of stars with easy to understand rules that make it fun to play and keep on going back for rematches 



the notso good

storytelling the plot while engaging and the characters are charming it unfortunately at times falls into jrpg trope pitfalls certain decisions are questionable certain plot points are either forgotten or tossed aside for the sake of progression and certain times the story will really take an unexpected turn that feels out of place but nothing that i personally feels takes away from the overall experience 

gameplay 
with the battle system and puzzles mentioned above in mind the difficulty is minimal to none you need basic common sense to beat the battles but these really revolve around hit x first not y and block correctly the game has an overall death counter and i only died once in the beginning of the game the abilities you learn and the stats you gain are heavily balanced in favor of the player so you feel somewhat overpowered especially by the end of the game this isnt a bad thing this was likely an intended design choice but i personally never felt like i had a difficult time with the base difficulty 
i mention base difficulty because you get key items very early on that essentially toggle an easy modehard mode moreless damage takendealt passive healing etc the problem i personally had was that the hard toggles felt brutally unforgiving and was difficult for the sake of being difficult not actually challenging i dont have a problem with the easy toggles since certain players just want to enjoy the ride 
the puzzles were very simple to solve outside of a select few that had me racking my brain for a couple of minutes its very trial and error based usually involving pressing a switch or moving an object from point a or point b again this was likely an intended design choice for people who just want to enjoy the ride of the story certain obstacles arent really puzzles as the answer is given to you either by talking to an npc or your party figuring it out for you

side content
sometimes there might be too much collecting im not joking when i say this is a collectors dream game to where it sometimes feels like a slog since certain items are simply fluff to sell or you found something already better
wheels its fun terribly balanced though the games and pieces look to be designed with a rockpaperscissors system in mind but certain units simply bypass that system through their passive abilities not enough units either




overall the game is phenomenal but it doesnt go without its flaws these flaws do not take away from the overall experience and the games musicartbattle system is still very enjoyable and i consider this one of my favorite jrpgs to date



#####

received game as a gift due to my love of jrpgs and chrono trigger specifically  the aesthetic is beautiful the music even more so and the residual love the devs have for old school jrpgs shines through in all the best ways  im 1314 hours in with no idea how long of a game it is and still just as invested as i was the first 30 minutes

edit  just finished the game around 35 hours  not 100 completed yet and i will be chasing some achievements  this game is so so so so so good  huge kudos to the dev team and i hope theres more in store from them

#####

sea of stars could very well be a title that reignites the jrpg passion for many people
it is a oneofakind experience and the closest game that resembles it is the legendary snes title and masterpiece chrono trigger
ive enjoyed the demo and was lucky to have access to a press release prior to launch thx to a friend of mine

after around 4050 hours of gametime i can confidently say that sea of stars is a mustplay title for every jrpg lover and anyone who wants to get into this genre

pros
 serves as great entry title into the jrpg genre
 battles feel fresh and engaging even after tens of hours
 the graphics are awesome it has a charming and unique art style
 does not force you to grind for endless amounts of hours to overcome difficult confrontations
 the game has its very own charming character which sets it apart from generic titles with no identity

cons
 the only minor con that comes to mind is that sabotage studio might have overdone themselves by trying to capture the magic of the 90s jrpgs too much some npcs you encounter have only a few words to say this makes them unfortunately appear shallow at times


i cant wait to have multiple playthroughs and go for 100 achievements on steam

thanks sabotage studio for this outstandingly amazing game 333

this review was written before completing the game entirely please keep that in mind and i will update it if i believe anything changes in my thoughts after i do complete it

sea of stars is a difficult game to judge for me the best way i can begin is by explaining the type of player i am and the type of player sos was created for when it comes to rpgs story is practically irrelevant to me until it is what i mean by this is that before anything else the gameplay loop has to be enjoyable and if it is sometimes i end up getting into the story as well i never go into a game with the intention of only caring about the story which seems to be the way many rpgs believe their audience to be its why square enix stopped using the atb gauge you see in classic ff games its why many modern turn based rpgs no longer have random encounters and its why sea of stars starts you with a relic called the amulet of storytelling which is completely optional to turn on and gives you 100 hp and auto heals you after every battle not a bad thing but an important thing to note as the game does not also start you with a difficulty increasing relic to go with it sea of stars especially is extremely handholdy at the beginning and doesnt seem to respect the players skill whatsoever with a couple mentions of you arent expected to hit every timed attack or block just get a feel for it  in the beginning not even paper mario games do that lol these games have started to have a bias towards those who specifically only care about the story and would rather the combat not exist at all to some extent and as a result it can affect those who primarily only care about the gameplay the challenge the strategy etc that can come with a good turn based rpg 

which is why i find it so confusing as to why the story is so bland generic and essentially as safe as possible everything just happens the characters are almost all incredibly one dimensional and 20 hours in im frankly tired of reading the dialogue altogether but i continue on the hope that maybe something explains all of these issues away

the combat systems are very interesting and enjoyable to execute ive personally had a much more enjoyable time with the game as soon as i grabbed the only two difficulty increasing relics in the game so far dubious dare and double edge dubious dare increases damage taken by a flat 40 so timing your blocks and attacks is more important while also adding more mitigation phases in combat with how the ko system is set up double edge greatly increases enemy defense if theyre casting a spell the lock mechanic and lowers it ever so slightly if they are not casting these two relics make the combat trickier without being impossible its great that theyre there for people like me though i do wish there were more ways to fight at all everyone loves moonerang but after 20 hours its still easily the best way to clear out any encounter or any boss assuming there arent any locks active with double edge equipped each character gets a maximum of 3 attacks which you get pretty early on and 1 ultimate ability which youll essentially only see once in a blue moon at boss fights due to the amount of combo points required to fill the ultimate bar

everything about sea of stars in terms of the story and combat are enjoyable and good fun but the core gameplay loop kinda reaches its height sooner than i was ready for perhaps story beats are there primarily just to move the group from island to island going through what is essentially simple zelda dungeon puzzles followed by a few encounters followed by some more simple zelda dungeon puzzles followed again by some encounters all the way to the boss room where youll have a good enjoyable fight and then its back to the story beats to send you to another location again nothing wrong with any of this but after an amount of hours of essentially doing the same fights with the same story moments its hard not to notice the simplicity of the loop without the difficulty relics id probably be mindlessly bashing moonerangs into everyone all the time with no regard for the lock system or what the enemys weaknesses were 

i think my primary problem with sea of stars is that after 20 hours playing the game im left with a craving for something that actually tickles my brain to any extent i would love if some of these dungeon puzzles took me longer than 10 seconds to solve i would love if any of the secret chests were actually secret and well hidden for once with some nice item or trinket in them so i felt rewarded for having checked every inch of the area i would love if some of the combat encounters werent solved so quickly even with the difficulty increasing relics turned on most of my enjoyment from the combat has simply been that im pretty good at hitting timed attacks and blocks as well as the speed increasing magic skills like moonerang and dont get me wrong its really enjoyable to melt enemies and bosses like that but i just wish it were a bit more i wish i had more options than just the three per character

my initial thoughts playing sea of stars was that everything was sick and the combat was super cool and i loved the potential the game had with combat but sadly it stopped introducing new stuff relatively quickly and ive been left with this oh thats it feeling ever since and once that hit the feeling of tedium and repetition started to creep as well

however all of this said i understand that i am not the target demographic this isnt shin megami tensei and there will be no matador or minotaur moment where im suddenly thrown against the wall and told to get good even with the relics its why despite how much i seem to be complaining in this review im still giving it a good ol thumbs up but with plenty of careful critiques for those who may be more inclined to game hard like i do im still playing the game and have no plans on dropping it but ive definitely lost a lot of enthusiasm i had in my first few hours playing where i was anticipating a lot more player freedom in terms of combat and side content speaking of most side content seems to be set aside for end game or such an exhausting backtrack to get to that it simply isnt worth going to until the end of the game regardless having to run through every area just to reach a previous spot and then run all the way back through again afterwards to get back to your ship is maybe the games worst sin

as a reprieve from the onslaught of why isnt this game catering to me instead the things i do love the pixel art is absolutely gorgeous though the shadow effects the lighting effects im truly still baffled how good it looks ive never seen some of these shadow effects before in any pixel art game the way the shadows of the grass and flowers hit the walls of the caves is truly some of the most impressive work ive ever seen i absolutely love how everything looks and feels the other huge positive is wheels the ingame game you get to play at taverns triple triad is nothing compared to wheels i am desperate for a real pvp version of wheels because its so friggin sick

thats all for now thanks for reading

tldr lots of style very little substance 6510

visually its great it pays homage to games of the 90s while using features that old technology couldnt do like huge animated sprites and dynamic lighting that servers well when altering the daynight cycle

where it falls short however is everything else

the story is okay at best with a few interesting plot points here and there  which mostly come after the long slog that is the poorly paced 1st half the game  but nothing outstanding 

character development is nonexistant as the 2 protagonists have generic nonevolving personalities without the excuse of being the silent protagonist trope
the real main character is garl who seems developped only by contrast until you realize that his overdone positivity is actually his only trait but at least he has one even if onedimensional
sidecharacters actually have a bit more charm despite being less present in the party but thats no saying much

the combat system isnt bad in itself but it quickly gets repetitive as there arent a lot of techniques to learn for each characters and enemies are damagesponges in many areas of the game especially in the first half

also the true ending is hidden behind an optional scavengerhunt sidequest that has nothing to do with the plot
its ok to make people work for a better ending but at least it should make sense feel tied to the story

for the first 20 hours i was wondering when the story would pick up pace and start being interesting and i almost gave up a few times struggling to decide if whether it was worth my time and 30 to keep going or not the graphics and overall decent music made it a bit easier to push through long enough to reach the second half where it starts to get better but really it shouldnt have felt like a chore chrono trigger becomes interesting in less than 20 minutes

if steam had more granular ratings id rate it 6510 or something because there was genuinely a lot of effort put into the game but i couldnt give more than that because of the absence of character growth and meh storytelling

so to balance out all the overhype that makes people think its as good as chrono trigger im forced to give it a thumbs down yes thats stupid because despite its fault if you push through its a bit above average just not by much but here we go hoping the few negative reviews with constructive feedback well help them put more thoughts on the storytelling side for their next game

#####

if you grew up with paper mario and mario  luigi like me then you defintely will love that one

i played 11 hours in one session on  release day the sounftrack is amazing story is thrilling so far and i love all the character you met throúghout your journey 

give it a try you wont be disappointed 

 edit 

i completed the game with both endings and thanks for the true ending i really needed that xd 
i also unlocked all archivments

i still had a really good time playing the game the only thing that bothered me was that its a bit weirdly written sometimes i just couldnt understand it or i was wondering what just happened and why i also saw someone mentioning the same anyway the dungeons could have been longer and the fights harder 
i hope they will make more games in the future like sea of stars  it was defintely a highlight for my 2023

hello friends

today i will review the game sea of stars this is a indie rpg with broad worlds to explore it has a good story many hidden secrets and even multiple endings even at the beginning you can pick which character you play as there are even twists and turns in the storyline the artwork of pixel perfect is awesome although it is not for everyone the game is gorgeous and beautiful in many environments you explore there are also easter eggs to other games found in the game the music is also beautiful although the battle music can become repetitive the combat is very reminescent of old style combat like chrono trigger there are even special combos you can learn for each character and button pushes during certain times does more damage reminding me of sabins moves from final fantasy 6 the best comparison i can have for this game is like a classic game like chrono trigger or even the aforementioned final fantasy 6 between this game and chained echoes this is one of the best years for indie rpgs if you have also not tried chained echoes i suggest playing it also this year has been the battle of the indie rpgs and the fans are the ones getting the rewards from it

httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp1229240chained_echoes

although this rpg is different from the above one they both have similiar graphic styles and playstyles both of these games are contenders for the indie rpg of the year award anyways here are the pros and cons of the game


pros
 a beautiful world with many environments
 great pixel style graphics and nice music
 hidden areas and many side quests
 easter eggs
 multiple endings
 secrets galore
 hidden areas
 turn based combat style
 works with controllers i used a neo switch controller
 works on windows 11 os


cons

 some might consider the game too short although most people take 30 hours to completly beat the game if someone takes their time you can get to 48 hours
 the game style graphics and pixel artistic style is not for everyone
 the combat can get repetitive
 some people think the game is too short for what it is if you find this game to be too short it maybe prudent to purchase the game on a sale for cheaper price

do i recommend this game yes i do it is such a great game i consider one of the contenders this year for indie rpg game of the year with this game and chained echoes coming out this is a great year to be a rpg player as the fans are getting rewarded for such masterpiece indie rpgs if you do not like the price with how it is currently i suggest waiting for a sale 

i would like to thank a special friend for purchasing this game for me as a gift without them purchasing this game for me as a gift i would of waiting until next year to play it and have enough money to purchase it myself due to surgeries in real life

also every game i have played after this feels like it is lacking in many things i found in this game this game makes a high standard and once you play it you will understand this too

i was a backer for this game ill update the review as i play through

sea of stars focuses too much on the spectacle of games art music animation when it really needed more time on the gameplay and story

the developers are french canadian like me and it shows in the amateur english writing the spoken dialogue is often missing commas or other pauses the characters tend to have the same style of speech too barring a few eccentricities shoehorned into the dialogue they have the same sense of humor they make sarcastic or ironic quips none of the characters stand out or feel like they have any personality because of this another reviewer described it as being a modern internet casual style of writing and that perfectly encompasses it too many times characters respond with  when theyre confused it looks like theyre writing on discord instead of being adventurers in a magic world

theres too much dialogue for every little thing it ruins the flow of the story just let me start the dungeon instead of having the characters talk to each other about how the boss must be at the end of the dungeon and that perhaps defeating the boss will solve the nearby towns problem everything is talked about nothing is implied alluded to or expressed through visuals good writing is concise and this game doesnt have good writing

the two main characters have no personalities or aspirations beyond adventure yay the game is lacking in emotional impact even when tragic or traumatizing events happen to people close to the protagonists they dont spend any time dealing with their feelings old final fantasy games like 4 6 and 9 had better character writing writing was a weak point of the messenger too though so i didnt expect much

the protagonists claim to have combat stylesthe boy is speedy and the girl is strong except this never materializes in the gameplay the boy doesnt have attacks that look speedy he doesnt gain additional turns or have fast qte inputs for his skills the girl doesnt have any shows of strength what was the point of having them talk about their combat styles if they dont actually exist oversights like these are a sign of a lack of attention paid toward ensuring the games different elements like writing and gameplay form a cohesive whole

the game has relics that are toggleable items that affect combat most of them just make the game easier like making your characters take 30 less damage for those who prefer a lighter challenge these have no cost to toggle or to use theres no maximum you just gradually unlock an easier and easier game this is a huge missed opportunity to follow in the footsteps of games like paper mario and hollow knight where you have a limited number of badge points to equip effects that you like sea of stars is already easy so why make it more tedious by not turning these on its not like the combat is fun

the relic system is unbelievably lazy design it puts the onus of designing and balancing the game on the player its the developers job to make the game not the players the developer sets the rules and boundaries structure is what makes games what they are and structure is defined by limitations not freedoms imagine playing basketball but the rules are that each team can have any number of players they feel is fair and theyre allowed to play with however many balls they think is fun everyone can have their own ball if they think thats fun points are scored however you like just do whatever you think is fun

how about the recent armored core 6 what if you could use as many repair packs as youd like you have an infinite amount limit yourself to however many you think is fair or just mash the button the whole time if thats your thing or slay the spire cuphead health getting low heres a button push the button to refill your health to full any time if that makes the game more fun for you

games are fun because overcoming challenges is fun sea of stars doesnt present much of a challenge in the first place and they keep giving you conveniences that undermine the combat and turn the game into the very long interactive picture book it wants to be

edit the games also still got bugs so save often heres a hardlock

alright sea of stars is 100 complete 

b what do i get and what can i sell about this game b
list
  the story is more or less the same as most other rpgs with some herbs and spices from some classic jrpgs like chrono trigger suikoden and others
  the gameplay is a turnbased rpg with a note that the skills menus and gameplay are simplified like octopath traveler if you were expecting to find hundreds of skills hundreds of items and the usual jrpg burnout stuff you can breathe a sigh of relief
  the soundtrack is certainly amazing as it is being done by composer yasunori mitsuda
  quality of life qol is very polished for a released game in this state of industry as far as i know theyve only updated once since launching the game in august 2023 due to grammar issues and text errors
  do you like the element of recruiting people and building a village of your own you might like this
  there is a relic feature which will help you during gameplay battles and exploration the rest you can check yourself when playing it
  dont get your hopes up about the side quests because honestly the side quests in sea of stars are pretty meh but they do serve a purpose at the end
  the bonus is that this game is also available on xbox game pass and playstation plus theres no reason for you not to try this game at least for curiositys sake
list

b there are a few things i might raise if you want to play sea of stars b
list
  the games story for the first 5  8 hours has a very very slow pacing and youll realize that theres a point where the story just returns to normal pacing again this is a challenge because usually people will drop out of a game if there isnt any significant progress in the story especially in this case an rpg

im guessing that the first 5  8 hours were an early prototype of sea of stars before they switched to kickstarter and the story became more normal pacing after they got the funding then brought in the writer and screenplay

  aside from the pacing the games story also lacks further exploration because sabotage studio adopted dual mcs although in the end it is focused on one mc and can be switched this can be a selling point if they can explore the interaction of dual mcs for example they could have different responses when facing a problem and not just being a yes man or yes woman 

when sea of stars introduced garl the dual mcs little friend and saw his development until the end i felt that garl should be the mc rather than the dual mc its because garls story is interesting to follow and his character is charismatic

  in gameplay and battle situations there may be some things that i dont like namely ui overlapping and clarity 

so there is one playable character named reshan whose one skill can make enemies gather in one place pulled by a black hole so that they can be attacked with area skills the problem is that if 3 enemies have broken weaknesses above their heads and in the same place what happens 

inevitably the ui has to adjust the place to the empty place and sometimes it is troublesome for players because they have to guess which weakness of the enemy this is also not made easier by the ui naming enemies without numbers such as xxx and xxx not xxx 1 and xxx 2 how can you tell the difference only from the enemys hp heck even you need to get an item for that alone
list

b verdict from me b

with up to 40 hours of content at a reasonable price sea of stars is very much a very good rpg in 2023 and hey it fits my taste too is it the best and unrivaled rpg that has come in recent years not for me because unfortunately i tried octopath traveler ii before this game

if i were to convert everything above into a score like other game journalists in their media i would give sea of stars 85100 or 8510

#####

garl is best boi everyone needs a friend like garl

#####

something something nostalgia chrono trigger childhood

#####

garl the goat ngl

#####

one of the best games i played in years took me back to early 2000s

#####

#####

tldr i love this game  recommend it so much 1110 in my book

anyway onto the actual review

for positives we have

 phenomenal graphics
 insanely good sound design
 music so incredibly good you cant get enough of it
 a platformer  puzzle mix having some simpleesc platforming on top of some tough puzzles
 tons of personality in the characters
 a great amount of balance between easy and difficult with additional accessibility features such as relics
 a notsosimple story with some i shenanigans i going on sometimes
 an additional minigame in wheels
 a generally open style giving main objectives but having tons to do on the side
 aaaaaand fishing

for negatives we have

 a bit on the steeper side pricewise 100 worth my 35 though
 a couple plot points never get touched on
 a reliance on luckrng sometimes


thank you for reading my review whether this convinced you to buy the game influenced your opinion of it or convinced you to ignore it from my very positive review thanks regardless

#####

great turnbased jrpg with amazing graphics story and music worth buying on sale 

 garl 

#####

excellent so far backed on kickstarter so ive been waiting 

chrono trigger and mario rpg  reminiscent of that era of jrpgs awesome pixel art and banger tracks by the dude who made the chrono trigger soundtrack 

combat is interactive and with stat choices on level up you can sort of build your characters to a point looks awesome

#####

comparison is the thief of joy

#####

sea of stars is very good 810

what i liked
 fantastic looking pixel art animation lighting
 many locations with distinct atmosphere
 enemy and boss variety
 has some great moments including one or two spectacular events
 can swap party members out at any time even during combat
 the music the vast majority of kudos here goes to eric w brown yasunori mitsuda contributed some tracks
 nice combat style overall no random encounters and combat isnt on a separate screen
 garl

critiques
 slow start
 writing  i will just say that it is often bland
 too many puzzles for my liking
 timing blocks youre constantly taking on different kinds of enemies with differently timed attacks  some skillscombos exactly when does it want me to push the button
 some silent dialogue scenes feel like they definitely should have music
 why tank controls if youve gotten there you know what im talking about

thanks for reading

i was look forward to this game for years a throwback to the old school of jrpgs like chrono trigger one of its main influences and inspirations luckily these kind of games have seen a renaissance in recent years with more to come and the love and effort for the genre and predecessors is evident in every aspect  the look the feel the sound the developers went above and beyond to do it justice

makes it all the more frustrating that i cannot enjoy this game

now this may surprise you given that i recommend the game as indicated by the thumbsup what gives no well i could give a tldr but i really want this to be taken with context and this review is more about getting it off my chest and for the developers if they care than anyone else wall of text and potential minor spoilers incoming you have been warned

there are two primary reasons that prevent me from continuing after about 25 hours which brought me just to the cusp of the main plot to actually kicking off i have not spoilered myself but i can take an educated guess at how the game will proceed and im all for it this is not one of my problems

b1 the main protagonists are boringb

this is mostly personal taste and a matter of perspective not something i would objectively see as a crucial flaw valere and zale are by no means ibadi protagonists they are just not interesting both are likable enough and i do not mind playing and following them at the same time they could also suddenly die and be replaced and i honestly would not care

while i applaud having protagonists who are not motivated by avenging their family or town or whatever and their status as chosen warriors still makes them neither unique nor quintessential to the universe at large but they also lack any conflict or goal beyond the destiny they were handed at birth  which they embrace again glad you avoided that rebellion trope for ithose twoi yet they lack any intrinsic motivation beyond duty and their personal prophecy quest good save but only a stopgap solution

of course they might develop further down the line i cannot tell from my game state i certainly hope so but i need them to be interesting from the start and not just after 50 hours playtime so far they are eclipsed by almost every other character that is more than a twoline npc

garl has his passion for adventure and cooking serai seems to have some edgy dark past going on which is not particularly novel but more than our two heroes have did not meet the other playable characters but i can guess they got their personal quests as well heck my favorite character is teaks and she is not even playable her quest to collect stories and document history bringing back her ancient order of historians is so damn cool that i would love to have a ifull game just about thati

i just do not care about valere and zale i wish i could play teaks story instead

b2 the combat system is a choreb

i could have lived with the previous issue but this is what ultimately made me drop the game for now and again this is a matter of taste and preference but when i play a turnbased game i do not want to have my reflexes tested with timing puzzles i want to sit back on my couch and relax idly grinding through scores of trash mobs until im overleveled before continue the plot even if i have to revisit the same location 40 times to hit the next exponential experience threshold and i did

if your gameplay is primarily about combat your combat system must be fun players must look forward to the next engagement but the longer i played and grinded as is my mo the more annoyed i grew until the thought of suffering another round of combat prevented me from booting up the game and i hate that i hate the combat i want to love this game so much i appreciate the work i do not regret paying full price for it and hope others enjoy and support it but i cannot enjoy it

i would probably not have played beyond the first combat tutorial if a quick internet search did not assure me i could automate the doublehit mechanic for a damage penalty whoever came up with that relic you are the real mvp because the game blatantly lies to you when it claims the doublehit to be an ioptionali bonus  in a combat system focused on breaking an enemys stride by hitting affinity combos thus making the doublehit extremely important

i never figured out when to press to defend or attack either because there is no visual clue you have to hit the splitsecond of the right animation frame i just surrendered myself to the automatic attack and getting my head bashed in for full damage because every successful crit or counter was just pure luck i did not care to practice either because i ifrigging hate the mechanici i want to relax not be stressed out by every single action in a uturnbasedu combat system

this alone could still be forgiven thanks to adamant shard you can mostly ignore the issue at the cost of reduced damage dealt and more taken fair tradeoff unfortunately these are not the only timing puzzles not even remotely as the whole combat challenge is built around the things

now valeres moonerang or serais venom flurry start with generous reaction times although the latter has less of a visual clue compared to a flying blue object and can end off screen in some encounters but they are not difficult to pull off and maximize i even got the achievement for the moonerang  by button mashing against a single enemy others like the sunball are a joke to pull off perfectly but technically less powerful compared to phase shiv which i only ever managed to time right ioncei

so this is not a skill issue you would need a severe dexterity impairment to completely fail here but that is not my point i do not enjoy having to watch every action and continuously test my reflexes im not having fun doing that im stressed out i do not feel rewarded for pulling off a 30 combo i feel my time wasted

its like playing a tabletop roleplaying game like savage worlds or dd and every time my character does something i get handed a sheet of 4th grade math equations to solve by my gamemaster which i need to do in 10 seconds and the more i solve the stronger my attack becomes eminently doable but not fun and this is what sea of stars combat feels like to me it feels like a chore

and this is not something you could just fix with another relic either because combat is balanced around this mechanic so if you remove it or average the hits you would make many encounters unchallenging but as it stands i cannot bring myself to continue the game with this at that sucks

im also not the only one with this particular issue i do not have statistics on the number of people alienated from the game like myself and if everyone quits after playing 25 hours it doesnt matter anyway we already payed after all im not mad or disappointed and i see my money spent well despite my grievances but im curious how many people quit like for this reason

also a question for the developers did you consider this when you designed the combat obviously with the adamant shard someone must have raised some concerns but did you deliberate choose to for lack of a better word alienate players not enjoying timing puzzles or did that not occur to you i dont want to be mean and it does not change anything but i would really like to know

#####

for someone whose all time favorite game is chrono trigger this is amazing game not only does it capture a similar feel but the writing it top notch and ive found myself laughing at several moments in the game
if you love a good rpg i highly recommend giving this one a shot

#####

the world needs more game like this

#####

garl is king

some party members lack development join very late
no new skills on level up stats only
only 3 skills per character

#####

i really thought i would like this game ive been a fan of jrpgs going back 30 years i love all the games sea of stars is desperately trying to imitate super mario rpg and chrono trigger foremost among them the game looks great and was a lot of fun for the first few hours

the problem for me is that after about 10 hours of play the gameplay has gone from fun to stale to annoying and the story and characters arent nearly interesting enough to compensate enemies are damage sponges i never feel like im getting any stronger when i level up or find new equipment despite what the game tells you about the combat button presses being a nice bonus the game is clearly tuned around the assumption that youre hitting them most or all of the time and you will absolutely feel it if you miss one on top of all of that i never feel like im in control during combat because of how all the combat systems interact im always reacting to what the enemies are doing and frequently find that because of rng i simply cant mitigate what theyre about to do that feels awful and it happens all the time

the story is even worse and kinda feels like it was written by a teenager writing their first novel characters are twodimensional and often react in ways that only make sense if you consider that acting any other way would mean the plot cant happen theres potential in the setting but they havent done anything with it and im long past the point at which im willing to keep playing to see if they ever do

 i dont think ive bounced off a jrpg this hard since lost sphear which failed in my opinion for all the same reasons a promising combat system and setting are under developed and the game is too focused on appealing to nostalgia hey remember chrono trigger you loved chrono trigger without ever demonstrating that it understands why those classic jrpgs are classic

#####

hit a very specific point in the story cried really hard game has been fantastic up until this point but now it might be one of my new favorites cant wait to replay this again and again

update 35 hours 100 completion yeah im going to new game plus this i did everything i could and i still wanna play it right after its that good

#####

as someone named luana this is the first and only game i have seen with a character named like that 
as a non biased person the game is very lovely specially because of the mention of the name luana

the music is my favorite thing about this game

very cute story fun characters catchy soundtrack and impossible to not love if you like chrono trigger

#####

chrono trigger this game is not there are some absolutely good things going on here but i am just not enjoying this game and it seems unlikely to change it is already obvious that this game just has too many things going on in combination such that im not going to enjoy this specifically i take issue with the following

1 quick time event combat i dont typically enjoy this mechanic in other rpgs shadow hearts covenant being the sole exception due to how well it was implemented and here it isnt particularly well done there just isnt any indication of how you are supposed to time things and it just comes off as fairly random the game tries to tell you that you dont really need to worry about it but that isnt true as the battles are very clearly designed around your being able to hit the timings on both offense and defense so this alone is enough to kill my enjoyment of the game the only feedback you get is after you have already failed or succeeded at the timing which to me feels backwards

2 dialogue this is personal preference but im really not feeling the writing it comes off as very modern internet casual feeling for lack of a better way to describe it and it is just taking me out of the experience i suspect that it is going to age about as poorly as working designs infamous translations from the 90s also they took the annoying feature from golden sun where everyone speaks in sort of a nonsense babble while the text is being output it isnt a big deal but i wasnt wild about it there and am not wild about it here

3 pacing this is killing me im two hours in and nothing of any interest has happened yet compare to chrono trigger which i only bring up because everyone seems to think this game is chrono triggers second coming which had you neck deep in action within 10 to 15 minutes if you wanted to breeze through the millennial fair based on other reviews ive read this doesnt seem to improve as the game goes on

4 character customizationgrowth pretty minimal stuff  you get some basic equipment options and a stat perk to choose from upon leveling and that is about it the available skills  and options seem quite shallow

on the positive side the game absolutely looks gorgeous and i wish more modern games would take 2d artwork this seriously there are some really great visual effects going on in the world despite the game being 2d and it really does come together nicely the soundtrack is nice too and i am particularly excited to listen to it more given that they were even able to get yasunori mitsuda on board for some of the tracks probably the only area where i think comparing it to chrono trigger actually works

i will probably force myself to play through this some more since i bought it and dont have anything else id rather play at the moment but so far this game is a big miss for me no doubt this review will be drowned out by the mass of positive reviews comparing it to chrono trigger but hopefully this will at least provide at least a bit of counterbalance to those for anyone who is on the fence about this

#####

alright sea of stars is done and dusted this is unquestionably an excellent game that will keep you engaged throughout it is an old school inspired jrpg but it has a few fresh gameplay mechanics and completely ditched timed random encounters altogether much to my relief

the story is where its at with this game quite evocative i did think it amusing that the main protagonists although cool were more boring than the companions who all had pretty compelling stories beyond the overarching goal of saving this reality and other realities as well even the primary antagonist was in many ways a more compelling than the main protagonists that said the writing was top notch in general and i think the protagonists are less entertaining because they really have a singular focus overall

the fighting system adds a few wrinkles the turn based battles have enemy countersclocks that wind down with each of your parties actions when it gets to zero for an enemy it takes its turn the counter varies based on the enemy and the action its planning you can also push back their counter or completely reset it with certain abilities or combination of attacks and abilities the latter requirement is randomly rolled during the encounters which encourages you to diversify your strategies

there is also a timing system for attacks and blocks allowing you to get an extra attackextra damage in or reduce damage taken from attacks characters can be swapped in and out of active duty whenever you want during combat with three being active at all times there is a wide variety of special abilities that can be found or unlocked additionally there are combos which combine two characters abilities into a special attack and there are ultimate abilities as well which are universally area of effect attacks

there are also relics btw which offer optional in game cheats and challenges should you choose to use them and certain items can be handed in to a historian to learn more about the games lore and offer hints to solve certain puzzles the character upgrade system used in sea of stars is simple i recommend boosting your mana whenever its an option while leveling up

the map system is reasonably intuitive and features both level and world maps there will be a network of puzzles and such that appear frequently throughout the game and kinda spruce up the gameplay there are also numerous side quests available all of which having a real impact on the game

in fact you will need to complete a variety of the side quests if you want to get the secret ending i didnt have patience for this as one requires you to find all rainbow conches in the game which are collectibles used to earn special items from one specific vendor which is fine and dandy but there are 60 of them i found 44 by the time id completed the game and since they arent marked on the map id basically have to go through every area again trying to find the ones i missed which isnt what i consider a good time lol fortunately youtube saves the day

there is no voice acting but the audio was otherwise on point with some funny moments like the rock djs having their own music track the graphics were stunning its a screenshot archers dream

i tried the demo of this game in one of the past steam fests but ive been following it for a long time both for the captivating promotional art and the previews they have given us throughout its development like that beautiful compendium they have on their website i recommend you to check it out needless to say im not the only one who has been looking forward to this title it has generated a lot of hype and expectations and with this review i hope to give you an idea of what to expect

sea of stars is a turnbased rpg that takes inspiration from classic 90s games and puts its own original touch into the equation modernizing a formula that i can say ill never get bored of and it does it in a spectacular way it invites us into a fantasy world and tells the story of two children of the solstice winter and summer and thanks to their powers of the sun and moon they will be the ones able to face the adversity that persists in this universe the fleshmancer and his army of dwellers

before i start talking about the game its story and mechanics im going to take the obvious out of the equation the baudiovisualb section needless to say the pixel art style used is beautifully detailed both for the environments and the characters and enemies as well as their immaculate portraits several enemies have very creative designs such as the drill bat and especially most of the bosses which i found amazing i really liked were the color changes depending on the areas from vibrant to dull and dreary places generating a very cool contrast 

the soundtrack is the perfect complement and from the very title screen prepared me for the delight that it would be to listen to it and no wonder since in addition to eric brown who returns from the messenger to lend his melodic talents one of the guest composers is the renowned yasunori mitsuda who participated in the soundtrack of chrono trigger and xenoblade to give a few examples this combination including the other members who lent their talents to the section makes the soundtrack a beauty and they are the reason why several of the games tunes stuck with me through the day 

now that weve established that its a treat to our senses lets start with the bstoryb which follows the protagonists zale the sun boy and valere the moon girl along with a village boy named garl who although doesnt share the solstices abilities he doesnt lack courage to accompany them in their adventures from a young age zale and valere will be trained as solstice warriors in order to grow and help the rest of the order in the battle against the dwellers

there is something i want to mention regarding this moment in the story and that is that in the main menu well have our protagonists resting around a campfire and well also see their silhouettes running in the loading screens but when we are in those moments of their childhood these sprites change to their childhood appearances i thought that was a really nice touch for something that is very fleeting since it doesnt happen much and i loved that they did it

from time to time a mysterious narrator the archivist will intercede in the story to make the tale more interesting and mysterious showing us a little bit of how this universe is managed and the forces that rule over it the plot will advance revolving around the dwellers and the warriors of the solstice and will introduce us to new characters and situations in a very fluid way

its a story with funny tense emotional and relaxing moments and it shows that they are not afraid to use recurring tropes from the genre and treat them in a way that doesnt bore you in the slightest there were several scenes where i was left speechless and with goosebumps others where i was stunned and even moved accompanying these emotions with some comment out loud for such a level of awesomeness undoubtedly i enjoyed the story to the fullest and it knew how to pull at my heartstrings again and again wonderful what else to say

but this game not only excels for its story but also for its bgameplayb that shines with creativity regarding this section i went into the game with very high expectations since both the trailers and what i played in the demo let me see a little of what i was going to experience a very interactive adventure and it truly exceeded those expectations by far 

for starters there are several very entertaining exploration mechanics well be able to climb up certain walls jump between and down from platforms and we can even use our solstice powers to move time forward or backward and it has a very cool visual effect the verticality makes each map feel like an adventure in itself its like solving a puzzle in different ways to reach a halfhidden chest or find our destination there are many nooks and crannies alcoves and false floors full of secrets and prizes waiting to be found and setting out to investigate the locations made me feel very rewarded 

in addition to exploration combat takes the same approach because although it is turnbased we are allowed to act with the characters in the order we like within each turn of course while the enemies have a counter that shows when theyll attack us but most importantly is that some of their attacks will show us indicators in the form of icons and if we manage to hit them with the type of weapon or element that they show us we can interrupt their actions or at the very least weaken them apart from that we can time the interaction button at the right moment to strengthen our attack or defense to benefit us in combat this makes it very rhythmic and without fear of repeating myself pleasantly interactive

its also worth noting that we can change active members for those in the rear in combat to take advantage of enemy weaknesses and not interrupt the flow of the fight and once again every encounter felt like a puzzle and made me change characters dynamically i really liked its implementation since im very used to being locked in a group usually the characters that first enter the party what can i say i get attached to the first thing i see like a baby chick but in this case i found myself swapping the members constantly and in a very natural way 

combat aside i want to mention that there is fishing and cooking and a very curious minigame that we can play in the taverns we can also interact with our companions when camping get information or secondary quests and when they level up we can choose stats to improve for a bit of customization there are more systems and mechanics both outside and inside the combat and they are be given to us as we progress but i dont want to explain them all because i want you to feel the same surprise that i felt when i unlocked them it is truly a very complete game and it made me feel very excited with every new thing i discovered

in bconclusionb sea of stars is a great game from head to toe it kept me hooked from start to finish and made me go wow all the time its an rpg with a story that completely grabbed me captivating characters and a world both colorful and serious it has several references to the genre some obviously to the messenger since both share the same setting and you can clearly see the effort and love they put into its development

between sea of stars and chained echoes these years have given me two immense pleasures and besides reaffirming that the genre is stronger than ever they earned a very big space in my heart and gave me something to look forward to without a doubt i wish with all my might for a continuation of this work to be able to go through this universe again in one form or another and as archivist himself says at one point walk with me tonight and well explore the story of an intense adventure give it a try its a game that deserves you

#####

one of the best jrpgs ive ever played no grinding pacing is perfect combat is engaging and evokes the nostalgia of older titles like paper mario or og super mario rpg

#####

b sea of stars an absolute masterpiece b the music design scenery combat and story are all fantastic gives old school golden sun vibes whilst hiving out its own battle system a refreshing take on the old school pixel rpg genre one of my favorite things about the game was just how impressive its visuals were with the brilliant pixelart characters and environments stand out throughout its a wonderful way to relive the glory days of snes rpgs with a contemporary twist exactly what ive been waiting for all these years

#####

i bought this game after playing the demo it gave me nostalgia vibes immediately it plays like if chrono trigger and super mario rpg had a baby not a long game from what i understand but its actually super fun if youve liked either of the games i just listed that it reminds me of works great on the deck too

#####

i backed this game in 2020 because the idea of a modernday chrono trigger ct excited me so much loads of jrpg fans myself included hold ct as the pinnacle of jrpgs whenever i was reminded of sea of stars through the backer emails over the years i would always feel a sense of excitement and anticipation i couldnt wait to get my hands on this game youll read lots of reviews about how this game is a love letter to classic jrpgs and if you loved ct youll love this game 

i completed the entire game including side content and my time with the game bothered me so much that i decided to write this review to gather my thoughts  when i watched the credits roll i finally figured out what i was feeling it was disappointment i had been waiting years for this game and i felt like i was let down 

 this game is not really that comparable to ct in terms of quality sure they both share similar music and art style i guess and hey when you engage in combat you dont transition into a generic battle area you fight where you engaged the enemies like in ct and there are character combo attacks too you know in that game everyone loves if you liked that game surely youll like this game 

but the dialogue the story the characters the things that i love about jrpgs and make me want to keep playing and the things that ct excelled at are so laughably bad in this game that they really i mean really detract from the overall experience from the game the blatant grammatical mistakes are only a very small fraction of whats wrong with this game zale and valere are selfinsert protagonists that can be interchangeable at any given moment i cannot tell you a single thing that differentiates the two personalitywise the only standout feature of their personalities is that they really cherish their friend garl the warrior cook whos very wholesome and friendly and everyone loves him dont you love him too love him he is very wholesome and friendly why is this game not called big garls big adventure the other characters are there too i guess 

the dialogue can be read with your eyes and lets you know what to do and where to go its not enjoyable to read and at times it was grating for me because of certain side characters who have funny quirks like making fourthwallbreaking jokes that are so funny and make me laugh every time i read them i loved it 

at a campfire you can sit down and listen to a story about cool things that happened in the past some things are only elaborated on when you listen to these stories at a campfire but in my opinion it feels very artificial and boring to be told about past events and characters through this way it doesnt help that the delivery is very bland and boring

i dont want to talk too much about story but i will say that i was very unimpressed i had joked about why isnt this game called big garls big adventure but i feel like theres some truth to it it feels like sabotage studios put more love and effort into garl so much so that it feels like hes the actual protagonist whereas valere and zale are the deuteragonists despite their massive significance to the plot at times some plot points personally made no sense to me and other times i wanted to know more about certain things but theyre never followed up on i saw loads of potential in the story but it never came to fruition and thats a shame in my opinion 

like i said i beat the main game and side content on normal difficultly so my characters were fully decked out and had all their skills throughout the game i didnt feel like i was progressing that much i felt the same as i did at the final boss as i did in the middle of the game the real challenge of combat was fighting normal enemies that felt like they were poorly balanced bosses easiest battles of my life 2v4 with mobs that deal lots of damage via normal attacks and have a special attack that hits the entire party only two of you by the way probably the worst fights of the game it bothers me that the devs tell you in the beginning of the game that you dont have to be perfect by blocking every single hit that comes your way and yet they make some mobs regularly dish out absurd amounts of damage which makes you feel like youre being destroyed regardless of whether or not youre blocking properly i normally play on normal difficulty for games but i was tempted to put on the storyteller mode just so i could get through the painful fights more easily skill issue maybe but how am i able to defeat big scary bosses easily when i get beat up by normal mobs so badly shouldnt it be the other way around 

conclusiontldr
 i thought about chrono trigger while playing this game so go play ct if you havent already
 art style is beautiful 
 music is pretty good imo 
 characters are very bland and onedimensional
 story and world had potential but didnt capitalize on it 
 combat is okay in the beginning but becomes tedious youll feel like youre scraping by in normal fights almost all the time but boss battles are a joke 

if you really want to play this game i recommend buying it on a discount otherwise i would recommend looking elsewhere

#####

if anyone remembers yiik a postmodern rpg i remember one of the biggest complaints people had about that one was just that the combat minigames were cute but they eventually wore out their welcome as you continued to have to do them repeatedly again and again there were a lot of problems with that game but i remember that criticism sticking out to me 

i cant help but feel like sea of stars is actively the worst iteration of this system ive ever seen its cute at first but every single character does the same action just with different timing theres no variation to it at all and two of the best abilities in the game are rapid button presses in time with sort of iffy animations 

blocking press a sometimes several times in a row 
attacking press a as the weapon hits
healing press a as the heal happensthe character shuffles his bag twice
combos same thing just push a at the right time

i remember paper mario had thumbstick holdingrelease at the right time thumbstick spinning rapid pushes timed pushes and it never really asked you to push it constantly all the time for every little thing its at least a bit of variety for a game thats almost a decade or so old now 

its just too much and with too little variety it becomes tedium

im trying to tough it out but the initial fun i had feels like its waning fast as i realize how little depth there really is to the combat its not got any real deep rpg mechanics and its reliance on poorly thought out minigames is holding everything else back

#####

i recently had the opportunity to try out the highly anticipated sea of stars and i must say it exceeded all my expectations this game provides a captivating and immersive experience taking you on a grand adventure you also can become a pirate d

the graphics in sea of stars are truly stunning the vibrant colors and intricate details bring the world to life in a way i have never seen before each level is beautifully designed making every moment in the game a visual treat

the gameplay itself is equally impressive sea of stars offers a unique blend of exploration puzzlesolving and combat i found myself completely invested in the quest always eager to uncover the secrets of the story the controls are intuitive and responsive ensuring a seamless gaming experience

one aspect that stands out in sea of stars is the storytelling the narrative is captivating filled with twists and turns that keep you hooked till the very end the characters are welldeveloped and their interactions add depth to the overall plot youll find yourself emotionally invested in their journey

another noteworthy feature is the soundtrack the music in sea of stars is enchanting perfectly complementing the gameplay and enhancing the overall atmosphere its a true auditory delight that adds an extra layer of immersion to the game

overall i would highly recommend sea of stars to any gaming enthusiast its a masterfully crafted game that offers hours of entertainment whether youre a fan of complex battle engaging storytelling or beautiful graphics sea of stars has something for everyone  1a

#####

without a doubt one of the best games ive ever played enjoyed it from the first minute to the last one and am sincerely eagerly waiting for the next one to be released

great and simple level design music characters narrative visuall style character development system and fight mechanics basically everything who couldve though that such a small game may contain story twists more interesting than in modern films or on the level of other good storyoriented games but it does even if not many also i reallyreally love and always prefer pixel graphics with clear contours and youve decided to stick exactly to such style hooray

ps separate tiny thanks for ending credits with the speed control feature 

#####

an absolute masterpiece of a turn based rpg with one of the most gorgeous pixel art styles ive seen fun and engaging combat lovable characters and a story filled with so many twists and turns that id be spoiling a lot if i said anymore seriously one of the best games ive played in 2023

#####

ive been waiting for a jrpg to enjoy as much as i enjoyed chained echoes ive just started sea of stars but so far its great the fighting system is especially nice because with timed button hits you can be more proactive in the turnbased combat

#####

im sorry but i couldnt stick to the end with this one im a huge fan of sabotage because of the messenger  this game has beautiful pixel art and landscapes and effects but thats about it all the actual gameplay and writing are not at the level i was expecting  the fights at level 1 are the same as fights at level 16 enemies are health sponges and the fights drag as a result the main characters are so milquetoast that they might as well grunt instead of saying their boring lines 

i hate saying this but it really feels like they sunk the entire budget for this game on the art and getting the colab with mitsuda

h1welcome to the sea of nightmareh1

when i play a turnbased rpg i expect an engaging story great characters and fun gameplay with bsea of starsb winning indie game of the year i was looking forward to playing especially since the developers who made it were bsabotage studiosb the same folks who made bthe messengerb a 2d platformer that i really enjoyed for its gameplay and humor when i started to play bsea of starsb i was actually hooked and found myself playing it more and more now that i have put a lot of time into the game i have to ask myself where do i start in describing things

h1pros and consh1
bprosb
list
the puzzles are very creative
animation is fantastic when going through the cutscenes
soundtrack is very well done
beautiful pixelated art style
list

bconsb
list
the writing for the story falls flat and character development suffers from it
gameplay while simple gets repetitive later on in the game
the games mechanics are very simplified and never evolve
list

h1storyh1
the story starts out with bvalereb and bzaleb two bsolstice warriorsb who have control over beclipse magicb this magic is the only magic that is capable of harming these monsters called bdwellersb who are created by the bfleshmancerb an alchemist with godlike powers they are traveling around with their assistant bgarlb their mission is to meet bheadmaster moraineb and two other bsolistice warriorsb to fight bthe dweller of woeb

that shall be all that i will talk about the story there is more to it but i would be spoiling it if i told any more this may make you think i have a lot of great things to say about the story but in truth its the opposite the major problem with the story is the writing at first it started off very strong but later down the line the cracks started to show if i could describe both bvalereb and bzalesb personalities is this we love bgarlb thats their entire personality and its not like bgarlb himself is really any better he comes off as mr perfect like everything goes his way and he is able to do anything without issue

even the characters that i myself tried to go out of my way and like ended up not being that well thought out either the only other character that i mildly liked was bteaksb while she is with the party she does not engage in combat and is pretty much left out of the story this leaves an empty feeling when major events happen or something like she is completely oblivious to it all although bteaksb role in the party does get somewhere and turns into somewhat of a party member her character development is left empty at the end the twists also dont really feel all that special too and i want to talk more about the story but i would of course just be spoiling it

i have played many rpgs and have witnessed amazing stories that i have praised and if a game like this has some bad writing thats not a good sign for things to come unfortunately bsea of starsb continues to have a few more issues in it that hold it back still

h1gameplayh1
bsea of starsb gameplay is very simple for an rpg while thats not a bad thing it does have a few issues with it although it does have some unique mechanics that i do want to talk about combat is of course the main focus of the game and you have a few attacks at your disposal that you can utilize the turn order in which party members take their turns is not in any way predetermined the player can choose the order they act in so for example you can have bzaleb act before bvalereb in the first round then in the next have bvalereb act first

enemies attack completely differently as they have timers that will go down when each party member takes a turn you also have access to timed attacks and timed blocks timed attacks will let you attack twice and a timed block will reduce the damage you take from the enemys attacks you can also boost your attacks with live mana by doing a nonboosted attack you generate live mana by attacking enemies with your normal attacks but you can also generate some by hitting an enemy before battle

there are also different types of damage in the game as well there are a total of six different damage types sword which should be sharp blunt sun moon poison and arcane each regular attack skill or combo will have one of these damage types enemies will be weak resistant or immune to each of the damage types the only abilities that dont have a type are healing abilities

so now that i got the core mechanics except for two but more on that later out of the way i can talk about the issues i have with combat my main issue is that combat does not evolve in any meaningful way you dont learn a lot of moves and are forced to reuse the same attacks over and over again to take enemies out because of that combat can get stale and i want to avoid fights but i cant as i need to farm to make sure my characters level up

now bsea of starsb has a unique levelingup system instead of your party members leveling up individually they level up as a group while this idea is interesting there is another issue that comes up you dont feel any growth in your party members as enemy attacks will still be doing a ton of damage even when blocking

then there is the lock system that the game has in place for enemy attacks when an enemy is about to cast a spell they will have their turn order each enemy spell has a certain number of locks for you to break if you break all of the locks before the turn timer is up that enemy will be unable to cast their spell and you can build up combo points for your special attacks you can have a max of 3 combo points and every party member has at least a few they can use 

the issue with the lock system is that there will be times that you will be unable to deal damage to a certain type because you either dont have the mana for it or you dont have access to a certain damage type although this is where combat leads to my next issue it gets very dull in the later parts of the game to the point where i dont feel like playing it anymore as it becomes a slog the last ten or so hours of the game are not leaving me very invested

bgarlb is not only my least favorite character in the story but also my least favorite party member his abilities dont do much except nourish which is the fourth or fifthbest healing spell in the game his abilities get outclassed by later ones he is meant to be a tank but he does not offer much in terms of being a tank this is also the only turnbased rpg game that i know of that does not have stat increasedecrease abilities something that i think should have been included

the only good thing i will praise the gameplay for is the puzzles while simple i did find them creative

h1graphics and performanceh1
the pixel art style that the game has is very beautiful and colorful i really loved how the developers made it as the areas feel very special the animation during the cutscenes are also very well done and something i loved seeing i tested the game on an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 3gb amd ryzen 5 1500x quadcore processor 350 and 16 gb of ram i had no issues while playing the game and it ran very well the soundtrack was good for a few songs
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3187813357
h1final verdicth1
bsea of starsb was a game i had high hopes for but ended up being disappointed with what the game showed me there is something to write and show here the world looks fantastic but with the bad writing and dull combat my interest can only be kept for some long if the game was 15 hours or so i may have given it a pass but bsea of starsb clocks in around 3035 hours of game time

#####

this game is a beautifully written love letter to my childhood

#####

its no chrono trigger but its still worth playing 710
the presentation world design locations puzzles and music are all well done combat lacks variety and character development is almost nonexistent the writing is some of the cringiest stuff ive ever seen

#####

excellent indie game a lovely story you feel the love put into this game plus theres an awesome work on the character design by that i mean each character has their own way of speaking
also the fight system is surprisingly dynamic and enjoyable
i had a really good time playing it

if you want to play a good rpg game then this one is a perfect choice

#####

second best rpg ive played this year but its probably impossible to steal demons roots first place

stunning visuals great music 9h long ost incredible work gameplay was simple yet engaging with a mariorpglike timing system that never got old characters were decent overall except seraï who was awesome and story was enjoyable enough
game has a few animated cutscenes every now and then and all of them felt like a reward it added a lot to the experience really enjoyed them
i had a good time wouldnt wait for a sale to grab this one well worth your money

#####

i will recommend this game and yet not as much as i would like to

sea of stars is a classic 16bit era actionrpg unashamed to homage even steal from the classics illusion of time chrono trigger secret of mana etc  its visual presentation is incredible with a dynamic lighting system that steals the show from the start the soundtrack is overall good with some great themes this is not surprising since the legendary yasunori mitsuda composer for chrono trigger chrono cross xenogears etc  guestcomposed for the game
this is unquestionably a really solid game with a couple of highlights

and yet is not as good as i wanted it to be the gameplay is very restricting with no real tactical options during combat or meaningful choices on party setup or equipment the game leans too far into environmental puzzles and has no meaningful exploration outside dungeons the story is very basic with no payoff losing completely the plot on its third act the ending felt extremely rushed and left me unsatisfied and confused

overall this is a cool game with a couple of memorable highlights that could have reached greatness if it wasnt brought down by a handful of issues luckily is not so long as to have its flaws overshadow its qualities i grabbed it at a discount gave it a go and didnt regret it

#####

great callback to the golden age of jrpgs while still having plenty of unique features to make it its own game everything from visuals to the surprisingly good soundtrack to the atmosphere especially later on in the game  were on point

my only complaints are the dogshit minigame wheels not sure which developer decided to give npcs assassin and think its fun to play against and that there is some backtracking needed for sidequests which this game does not handle well at all you cant fast escape areas youve already beaten even after you should be able to and will spend time going through tedious and boring areas just to snatch something that you missed the first time around these two things really soured my experience but the positives more than make up for it

#####

this is the first game i have been compelled to review mostly in confusion as to the general tone of awe that the community has towards this game this game is absolutely beautiful to be sure the environments are breathtaking and the majority of the boss encounters are spectacles of the highest order this game falls critically short in two areas however  the character development and the combat many other reviewers have nailed that the two main characters are basically mary sue chosen one stand ins with no progression whatsoever throughout the entire game the developers also clearly push garl as the favorite character but it is hard to maintain empathy for a character who calls an evil immortal a loser to his face just for the game to have a cool moment and set off one of the dumbest and most predictable story beats in this game all of which pales in comparison to the true ending i havent been this mad at an ending since i finished reading the mistborn series we bait out the big bad we beat the pozz out of him and the alchemist rescues him and smiles the end what the actual chocolate fudge

the second giant elephant is the combat often enemy locks will require uses of moves that require timing like moonerang i grew to dread moon locks because they would drag combat out a massive amount and with food i never lost a single combat throughout the entire game except for a single arena encounter for the true ending 

all of this combines to mean that i finished this game thoroughly underwhelmed setting up a true ending after a lot of optional content sets the aftertaste for the game and this game was completely ruined by its ending i do not recommend it

#####

this turn based rpg has been everything i have been craving for what feels like decades it is a wonderful mix of chrono trigger and golden sun in feeling and it is just fun i have laughed i have cried i have had a wonderful time and i am only part of the way through it if you grew up with turn based rpgs and are missing them please give this game a try it is absolutely worth it

#####

i had extremely high hopes and expectations for this game i backed it immediately upon hearing of the kickstarter i think it might have even been day 1 i loved the messenger and was excited to explore more of that world and it was going to be in the style of chrono trigger one of my favorite rpgs of all time i even made my tombstone in the crypt a memorial to a friend who passed away from cancer some years back to say i was hyped up and ready to give this game my all would be an understatement

not only did the game meet my expectations it far surpassed them the story hit beats that i wasnt emotionally prepared for and the true ending was cathartic in a way that only the most passionately developed and written stories can be i dont want to spoil anything but this game hit in such a personal way with its story and character development for me the beginning of the game is a lot of setup and may not wow you but stick with it and the story goes places it is worth the time investment for sure the bonus easter eggs are worth the extra effort too i think every time i saw a connection back to the messenger i had an excited ah ha moment of realization and i appreciated just how well everything connected back together

i cant wait to see what sabotage brings in the future but for now sea of stars has found itself among my top 10 games of all time a list that mostly consists of games for the ps1 that ive been playing since childhood for it to replace stuff with so much nostalgia behind it i think speaks volumes to just how good of a game it really is at least for me

the music is amazing
the combat mechanics keep things interesting
the boss fights are unique and the designs are awesome
and the story is one emotional gutpunch after another

i loved every minute of my playthrough and i look forward to going back and playing more in the future

also the mini game wheels while at first kind of weird was a blast by the end and i want more of the game

#####

i dont usually review games but this rpg is amazing a mix of chrono trigger golden sun and paper mario definitely a must buy if you are a fan of turnbased rpgs

#####

honestly did the people who praised this game even try to get halfway through the games writing is so bland its insane how much i have to push myself to even continue playing the characters have dialogue that feel like a couple of cardboard pieces talking to each other with maybe one or two unique party members with actual personalities not to mention the story itself is alright which would push me if the game wasnt so charactercentered

the gameplay is perhaps the most stale the chrono triggerlikes have seen everytime i see a random battle i dread it it doesnt evolve nor improve and its genuinely so daunting it hurts if this changes past the midgame i would even lose all interest the depth the combat provides is that of a kids pool i cannot in good faith recommend this to any jrpg fan

#####

this game could be a case study on how terrible writing can turn an otherwise absolutelybeautiful rpg into a completely underwhelming experience  wanted to like it but could not get into the story at all

#####

i give it a 78 out of 10 82 out of 10 once the bugs i complain about get fixedqol improvements i kickstarted this game in 2020 was finally able to play and beat it and also got 99 of the achievements in one playthrough some things probably mentioned will get fixed later on since i played it within 12 weeks from when it launched the game feels like a mix of super mario rpg has some ff7 vibes but also has other snes jrpg elements going for it

 great soundtrack
 simple but engaging combat similar to super mario rpg
 lengthy game taking roughly 50 hours to basically collect everythingdo everything for the most part
 the writingstory is above average not bad but not great
 some elements of the game gave me a sense of fantasy like id hope from old final fantasy games if thats what you look for

 serai semioften uses their abilities and literally goes off the screen when you use the skill venom flurry which you will use often 
 valere very often positioning themselves poorly with the skill moonerang she can and usually will move to inconvenient locations that can negatively impact how well you perform the skill it can get very frustrating that they stand far from enemies in idle combat but when you choose the skill they may as well jump even closer to the enemy and at odd angles so some enemies are really close while others are medium or long range when you likely want some symmetry and consistency it bothered me enough to put this here
 the puzzles in this game all of them basically require zero intelligence to solve they are made for babies
 the normal ending is very very very unimpressive and youll feel like most of your effort was for nothing in the very end
 the true ending is genuinely not much different from the normal ending spoiler its literally the exact same thing as the normal ending only they added an animation to make it look cooler garl is alive and he kicks the fleshmancer and the hot redheadednowademon and formertomboy senpai went somewhere else and is alive i was still content enough with the true ending but i was expecting more and id get a feeling others will agree more than disagree spoiler
 the game sequelbaits at the end but resolves almost 8090 of questions you may have

nonspoiler advice id give to beginners you do not need to backtrack really early in the game wait til you get air travel instead of being restricted to ground travel

woof

i think banking on chrono trigger nostalgia and focusing the iadmittedly prettyi visuals in marketing was the only thing they were going for here very few other redeeming qualities sadly combat is repetitive and doesnt evolve much from the opening hours only having literally 3 skills was a choice the main characters have the shared uninteresting personality of cardboard theres no character growth or meaningful arcs and the overall writingpacing of the cliché storyline feels like it was written by someone submitting a gradeschool level creative writing exercise 

the ending goes into my hall of shame for the bizarre ieasierthaneverythingelseyouvefoughti final encounter which seemed like it was just the warmup for the real boss before abruptly ending instead but not before genre swapping and making you play some dumb shmup against the actual big bad for reasons 
apparently someone on staff thought that making all the narrativelyunimportant mcguffin collectable items throughout the game essential for the true ending was a good idea also which just ensures most people will youtube it instead 
the new ending hilariously adds about a dozen more plotholes when you think about it for more than a few seconds too

i honestly dont know why this has an overwhelmingly positive steam score maybe some people voiced their opinions while still in the honeymoon phase of the opening handful of hours when the mediocrity was in its infancy 
i cant imagine my fellow peers who grew up with this stuff in the 8090s are ok with the result considering even the likes of the early ff games and chrono trigger with the disadvantage of localization were more coherent than this 

hurts even more as a kickstarter backer who was anticipating this for years in hindsight i probably should have taken that refund they offered when the announcement of them selling out to psplus and gamepass day 1 came about 

theres some talent in this devteam for sure but i just hope they hire a damn writer and do some editing for their next project

for garl

#####

maybe the prettiest rpg ive played very good

#####

i wish i could return this game 
the three most important things for me in an rpg are
1 combat
2 story
3 exploration

i can accept simple combat or a generic story or a boring world if one of the three is at least pretty good while i do think sea of stars manages a fairly unique take on all of these i cant say that it does any of them really all that well so lets get into it then

combat my initial impressions were that the combat systems would offer me some amount of tactical freedom to the decisions i make and how i play however it very quickly just became a checklist of doing certain things in the order that makes the most sense and it is both disengaging and feels as though most of the agency ive been granted isnt necessarily taken away but doesnt exactly matter at all boss fights have mostly been uninteresting and have on more than one occasion proven easier if longer than regular combat in the areas leading up to them

story i am only about halfway through the game as of this review so i cannot comment on the story as a whole however right now the story with specific regard to the writingdirection is the thing making me least interested in actually trying to finish this game at best its uninteresting i just dont find myself invested in it the twists and turns have so far been predictable i do like the way that symbolism and archetypal characters are represented within the world and i appreciate the worldbuilding however the reason im absolutely turned off by this game right now is in the first moment that captivated me that felt dramatic and that gave me some sort of catharthis i got insert funny internet joke and as of right now thats all that i will be able to take away from this game

exploration i like the pseudo platforming mechanics and the fact that most areas arent totally on rails and have things to discover unfortunately however it still feels pretty stiff also something i find inconvenient is that most encounters seem to be unavoidable which kinda sucks when the enemies are visible in the overworld since typically rpgs with onscreen enemies give you that option at least the encounters are not typically grouped close together so you have a small respite if you need a break or just to heal up a bit 

speaking of needing a break thank god im playing this on steam deck because while save points are given to us pretty generously theres no quicksave option for when i have to stop or when im just feeling drained and need to go do something else i am aware theres an autosave feature but i cant check if its autosaved recently and refuse to risk any of my progress to chance it

which actually does lead me to the things i like it runs well on the steam deck the game really is beautiful the tavern minigame is fun the dialogue doesnt feel stilted or unnatural and despite all my negative comments i have still felt engaged enough to play through a fair amount of it until an unfortunately misplaced joke soured me on it when i felt like it was gaining momentum

in summation tldr this game both takes cues from its predecessors and treads new ground but a few missteps make it a truly mixed bag not exactly disappointing but not great either

im a person who usually struggles to finish games and i told myself i would commit to finishing this unfortunately right now i have no interest anymore but i would like to mean the things i say so if i do finish this game i will come back and edit this to reflect my thoughts about it then

h1overviewh1
rpgs are complex games and they are difficult to make rpg fans like me are unusually very demanding the classic turnbased formulas were slowly abandoned by bigger developers in search of a wider audience the torch is figuratively passed to smaller teams with lesser demand for rois the resurgence of the classic jrpg has brought us many excellent games and one of them would be sea of stars at least that was what i thought when i saw this game for the first time in august 2023 studio sabotage entered into the foray of the rpg world with this game and it was received with such an overwhelmingly positive reception my experience however contrast the general reception of the game here is why

h1gameplayh1
the players begin by choosing zale or valere as the main controllable characters this is a purely inconsequential choice as they can be used interchangeably a few hours into the game

zale and valere are solstice warriors born respectively at the zenith of the sun and the moon solstices they wield the sole magic that can destroy maleficent creations of the evil fleshmancer called dwellers which have plagued their world for eons
after extensive training since childhood both warriors are ready to graduate as fullfledged warriors this serves as the initiation for the players as well and the first dungeon teaches us how to overcome obstacles in this world upon regaining control after a lengthy cutscene the effort sabotage put  becomes apparent starting with the movement it is unbelievably dynamic yet straightforward and each character is animated with such life and personality for instance when crossing a tightrope valere balances calmly without losing her posture while zale sways slightly left and right i appreciate these subtle ways of conveying the characters temperament they can also jump fall down and mantle ledges emphasizing the vertical and layered level design even in the tutorial dungeon

enemies roam throughout the dungeon floor and touching them initiates combat without transitioning to another screen sea of stars employs a timingbased combat system pressing the prompted button at the right moment strengthens your attack and weakens the blows you receive from enemies regular attacks restore your mp allowing characters to use various skills with different button prompts for extra oomph for example zales fireball can be held until it reaches the optimal size and then released for extra splash damage

damage dealt and received will charge a combo meter when filled two characters or more can unleash powerful combos that deal multiple damage types at once the game cleverly uses these attack types and elements beyond the usual rockpaperscissors formula when enemies start their big attacks locks appear above their heads
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3138998485

this system integrates seamlessly with the active timing combat this means you can break the locks in just one turn with the right skill and timing this is where the games core mechanic lies rationing mp managing the combo meter health and using abilities at the right time are the rules of the games engagement

so whats the problem then the issues arise later in the game where i feel like the combat hasnt evolved beyond the basics sure the party will grow and you will gain new skills but the activities with those skills and combos arent that interesting for two dozen hours there are no buffs status effects or synergies in the end youre just attacking and healing the lock and interrupt system get barely more complex because while there are more elements and attack types the basics stay the same throughout 50 hours of playtime there are also random elements where when the battle begins you will get some complex locks where you wont have enough combo meter to cancel enemies attacks in the end there is only one sure way to get good at this game mastering the block timing of enemies attacks maybe this is the intended way to play it and there are various kinds of attacks and enemy types each quite different from another the problem at least for me personally is the lack of tactical depth i want from turnbased rpgs combined with the lack of an option for running away from battles and some combat encounters are difficult to avoid makes the mid to late game especially frustrating

character growth is another problematic element of the game every level up you have the option to raise a stat point on top of predetermined stat growth that means later on each character will have their specialization in the party yet it never happened for example you want to make garl a tank because of his high base hp and defense yet you cannot pick to increase his hp every level up instead the game roulettes four stats out of eight whether this is random or predetermined i dont know so theres no truly specializing by consistently increasing a certain stat on a character it just results in a frustrating illusion of choices

h1storyh1
i feel the same way about the storytelling of this game the true dullness hides behind the facade of a promising hook and beginning without saying too much the most obvious example of bad writing is how the plot progresses using multiple very specific prophecies given to the team in early to midgame prophecies are a tricky plot device that requires finesse so it doesnt turn out cheap the writers definitely lack the finesse required

what frustrates me the most is the ending and the true ending of the game to access the true ending one needs a few extra boring hours of tracking a few dozen collectibles that require backtracking and to my disappointment it doesnt really add a meaningful layer to the story just adds extra frustration on top of everything

the game is very polished no problems at all at least not ones i noticed it runs well on both my main pc and potato laptop

h1graphics and visualh1
this is the aspect where sea of stars truly excels oh god the pixel art the animation everything is just beautifully made i have never seen modern shaders and lighting features put into pixel art so well during sunset the light effect would paint the terrain bright orange hues and buildings trees and rocks cast proper shadows that dynamically move with the sun and moons position there is an insane amount of effort in animation too especially the bosses where some of them would look progressively more wounded as the battle drags on the locales and dungeons are varied each populated by unique monsters this is the aspect where the game truly shines

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3138996960

h1audio and musiclh1
there is a similar amount of care put into the soundscape of sea of stars the music is quite varied enough and they are enjoyable to listen to the sound effect of spells enemies and their various movements and attacks are very well done to accompany their excellent animation

h1conclusionh1
its very difficult to judge this game it is not a straightup bad game i know sabotage truly put everything into this game and their passion and care show in multiple aspects of the game it is just playing through this that frustrates me greatly because of the design and narrative choices they managed to put in the game this is just the perspective of an old grognard though i can see why the game is hugely popular and glad it achieved this success what i hope is they use this opportunity to iterate on some of the weaker aspects of the game in future projects

would i personally recommend buying this game not at full price not if you think my complaints are valid for you but at a discount if you think the critiques dont bother you much yes

#####

garl is a sweet baby cinnamon bun and i would die for him

#####

im not typically someone who usually enjoys turnbased style combat but this game was fantastic the music the characters the art style story boss designs etc were all phenomenal additionally just when you thought youre used to the game and that they couldnt possibly add more they do whether it be with new game mechanics or mindblowing cinematic sequences this game blew my expectations out of the water and has easily become one of my top games of 2023 now would highly recommend to anyone considering purchasing and at 52 hours i would say its well worth the price now excuse me while i listen to the ost on repeat while ruminating in my post game depression

#####

for a 35 rpg i enjoyed it dont expect it to cure cancer though

#####

its not a bad game but i feel its overrated with a variety of issues



the story has tonal issues being overly comedic with bad jokes when its not suited

theres a lot of unnecessary backtracking too perhaps most egregious revolves around the bonus collectable item spread throughout the world the location to get rewards for collecting them is rather tedious to get to requiring retreading the same several areas over and over again to reach this isnt helped by world map movement feeling a touch too slow

the powers of the sun and moon play an important part in the games story and early on you get the ability to change the time of day when standing in certain spots however despite this its really only used to focus beams of light to hit switches
npcs dont react to time changes enemies arent affected by the time of day your partys powers dont change based on whether its day or night nothing
only one area in the game is affected by the daynight cycle so really the biggest purpose it serves is to look pretty as it changes in real time which admittedly it does its gorgeous watching the lighting change and seeing shadows smoothly shift but from a gameplay perspective theres a lot of missed potential

again not a horrible game but way overrated

#####

this game is incredible

this really brings me back to when i would play jrpgs for the first time before all the shtty cashgrab games would come out loaded with bs when games were made with a passion with a love and worked hard to make a finished beautiful game this game is like if final fantasy chrono trigger stardew valleyvisuals and mario rpg had a child together this game is insanely beautiful combat feels so good characters that feel soo refreshing and to top it all off the world building and story really make this game feel like nothing ive felt in years from all the newer trash games 

if youre reading this far into the reviews literally just buy it you wont regret it even at full price seriously try it

#####

tldr aside from amazing pixelart and one or two soundtracks the game is so average it hurts boring story no character development and a myriad of battlerelated mechanics that actively harm each otherin the end the game is simply not fun

full review
i was really excited for sea of stars and backed on kickstarterafter all sabotage studio did a really good job with the messenger and seemed to understand how to modernize retrostyle games seemed to being the operative phrase in this case i wasnt expecting goty or anything but i was certainly expecting it to be good but when the best parts of the game ended up being average at best its hard to view this game with anything but disappointment but lets start with the positive

you can already tell from the screenshots that the game looks amazing the pixel art is well done and the character animations are really good there are a few animated cutscenes that are less good but they dont take away from the game in any way

the music is the most varied in quality the soundtrack is mostly forgettable standard rpgsounding stuff there were a couple tracks that i really enjoyed but also one particular track that was grating on my ears fortunately that was in the early part of the game and didnt return so not a big deal in the long run

oh and honorable mention to the minigame wheels which was honestly more fun than i was expecting it to be and sadly was probably where i had the most fun moments in the whole game

but now lets get to the meat of things in my mind an rpg like this must succeed in three important aspects story characters and battles sea of stars fails one fumbles through another and actively works against itself in third

story  boring predictable unearned
i wont spoil anything but the story doesnt do anything interesting like at all you are the chosen ones obvious betrayal is obvious with legitimately moronic reasons given at the time made only slightly less moronic by late game context every time i thought the story was going to gear up and change things up it fell flat right onto something unambitious and bythenumbers there are also a few moments that seem to mirror key moments from chrono triggerhowever the game hasnt laid the groundwork or put in the effort to make these moments meaningful or revealing in anyway so they just come across as sure that might as well happen and oh i guess were doing this now dont even get me started on what happens when you beat the final bossi havent seen a villain become less interesting after you win to this degree since kingdom hearts 3 some people might mistake the game for having varied and deep lore because it throws out a lot of names and places without contextbut thats really all its doing some of them become relevant but most of them could just as easily have been left out and it wouldnt have affected the game nor how you perceive the games world also a minor gripe but with these names they fall into the trap of inserting apostrophes into the middle of names make them more fantasy because reasons

characters  planks of wood annoying no development
i almost hesitate to call these characters in the first place honestly zale and valere have 0 personality outside idolizing garl oh youll see their happy or angry portraits from time to time accompanied by some generic dialogue but nothing about them makes them feel like more than planks of wood who respond environmental stimuli garl is clearly the developers favorite character as he does basically all of the talking and drives the other characters forward through the entire story even when he isnt in the party honestly its pretty annoyingespecially since hes so positive about literally everything he comes across as obnoxious fake and in many situations stupid the other characters are slightly more interesting but fall into pretty generic tropes grumpy girl is grumpy but also nice mysterious man is mysterious and sad and late game party member is there too but has no time to do much not to mention the true ending actively undoes some of the emotional almostcharacterdevelopment the characters could have had if the writers had explored it a bit more

battle mechanics  each cog bypasses another
first a couple general remarks battles are agonizingly slow in most cases especially when you need to use a multihit moon element im so sick of moonerang they are also poorly tuned in terms of difficultyits unclear to me why normal mobs can 23 shot your characters in some cases if you arent constantly healing there is a relic you can get early on that reduces damage to a more reasonable amount but then that seems to completely nullify the need for itemswhich ill get to in a minute as im already running into the games big problem in this area the different mechanics that play into the games battle system are individually cool ideas but when executed together they end up just sort of fumbling over each other to drag down the experience let me start with the individual components
ive rewritten this section a couple of times trying to make it concise but this is the best i can do basically the game encourages you to use a lot of items by giving you lots of ingredients and frequent campsites for cooking however since you can get a full heal at a campsite for free without restriction you never really need items outside of battle when youre in battle enemies can start casting and create a series of locks that can break with different attack types which is a really cool idea however cast times are short and theres basically always at least one enemy doing this which means youre constantly going after those locks run out of mp and need to use an item well you can but now youre run out of that short casting time and get hit with a strong attack normal enemies this ranges from fine to bad but on many bosses this can be devastating depending on the move they use rather than waste your time with an item youre better off just attackingthis way you deal damage and also recover some mp from using a basic attackwhich is another good idea by the way if your goal is to keep battles moving at a decent pace of course battles dont move a decent pace when you start using those skills that require mp as many of them have long animations and drawn out timedhit combos to perform at least it builds your combo meteragain a cool idea since combo points can be used for new moves but the combo meter also gives you access to a powerful healing move and attacks that regen mp for multiple characters so once more we find items becoming kind of useless but you also need to make sure you throw in some normal attacks from time to time so you have a supply of live mana which you can use to add a second attack type to your normal attack on the field to break different locks when they pop up so what ends up happening is that there are too many things demanding your limited action economy for any one system to feel like youre truly getting the most use out of it and items are except in the most dire of emergencies rendered absolutely pointless despite how hard it feels like the game is pushing them which again would mean youre spending a characters turn every other round just healing which is not a fun way to spend rpg combat your party really isnt big enough and the enemies too tanky to have a dedicated healer

so at the end of the day while the game has some good things going for it theyre basically all squandered and saddled down by the weight of the aggressively mediocre execution of the other parts to be honest i regret backing this game and now im genuinely concerned about the couple of other games i backed that are currently in development at the very least i dont think ill ever be backing another game in the future

#####

mid game impressionsreview 
sea of stars is an absolute love letter to all diehard jrpg fans who are looking for a similar experience to classic games like the final fantasy series and chrono trigger the game has one of the most interesting and fleshedout turnbased combat tbc systems ive ever seen in addition to consistent quality content with different dungeons enemies spells and characters so far all of the dungeons and areas ive explored have felt very fresh and intriguing the introduction of new tools has added another layer of depth to the exploration which i have very happily welcomed

ps garl is the real protagonist in this game lol

#####

this is the chrono trigger 2 we deserved the game is simply amazing the devs have made a gem

#####

a gorgeous jrpg thats heavily inspired by classics like chrono trigger its good fun and the soundtrack is exceptional the story can feel slow at times and some of the writing missed for me but its clear how much love and care was put into this game and it paid off a solid recommendation for any jrpg fans

#####

im around ten hours into the game and decided to post a review with my thought so far as background chrono trigger is one of my favorite games of all time and i love traditional jrpgs i loved the messenger until its halfway point and ive been looking forward to sea of stars since it was announced

unfortunately based on what ive seen of sea of stars i cannot recommend this game ill break down my review into sections

writing

story the story is very generic so far theres nothing unique or interesting going on so far although that could change after the ten hour mark ill be short here because theres not a lot to say

characters huge miss on the characters they are all extremely bland and the two leads fail to even be archetypes they are completely interchangeable and have zero personality genuinely two of the least interesting characters ive ever seen in a game and that really makes it hard to feel invested in the story the third main party member garl is a caricature with no depth he is always infinitely brave and kind and positive even after he is maimed happens in the first ten minutes of the game he is still overwhelmingly positive and seems incapable of having a single doubt or negative emotion i rooted for him at first but he became extremely annoying after i realized that hes just not realistic

dialog really bad i dont know if there was some localization issue but the dialog is riddled with obvious grammatical mistakes there is a comma splice at least every fourth dialog box and probably more than that not to mention the erroneous commas in other places even ignoring the errors the dialog is just extremely bland throughout theres nothing interesting the only humor is lazy fourthwall breaks one side character in particular constantly makes jokes about being in a video game that dont really work and have already been done to death by indie games notably in the messenger characters just say what they mean all the time and there is no cleverness in the dialog

visuals

the game looks incredible the pixel art is very well done and feels like an evolution of the 16bit era classics the game seamlessly blends pixel art with modern lighting effects however unfortunately the character portraits arent great and feel very indie in a bad way thankfully there are several character portraits per character to depict different emotions neutral angry surprised etc but the drawing style doesnt work for me and the character design is painfully generic

there are also cartoon cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game and im not personally a fan of the art style although thats purely subjective

musicsound

the music is really hit or miss for me you probably know that the team got the legendary yasunori mistuda to compose a few tracks however a lot of the music either feels generic or doesnt match the game there are some great tracks but the music falls well short of jrpg classics

the sound is very solid throughout but this isnt really something that you notice while playing no complaints here which is what you want for sound design

gameplay

difficulty has been quite low so far but im only ten hours in i came close to dying once in a random battle that was far harder than any boss so far every boss has been extremely easy and im not using any of the easy mode charms that you can enable however people who are new to jrpgs may struggle in some fights

combat relatively simple each character only has four abilities and you dont unlock them all right away so the first 10 hours of gameplay each character will only have 23 abilities which feels limited there is some additional depth including combo abilities a boost mechanic and character swapping but it all doesnt amount to a satisfying puzzlelike experience that a game like octopath traveler does each boss and enemy has a relatively unique gimmick but none have interacted with the mechanics in an interesting way the combat isnt doing anything new and feels right at home in the forgettable indie jrpg landscape if you like jrpgs youll enjoy the combat but if youre looking for toptier modern jrpg combat this isnt your game

exploration the exploration is okay so far everything has been relatively straightforward but its satisfying working your way through an easy puzzle to get to the boss the pacing and length of the dungeons has been great and moving around the map feels really good there are also unlockable abilities you can use on during exploration that are gimmicks so far but im hoping that the game does something interesting with them unfortunately there are lots of chests hidden and most of them have these rainbow conch shells which are a collectible in the game its always so disappointing finding a clever route to a chest only to find a collectible that you cant use until you find some shop to spend them on it felt a lot like finding korok seeds in breath of the wild overall this makes exploration a little less satisfying but exploration in this game is still quite good

gearprogression the gear is very generic so far accessories that give 10 defense weapons are slightly higher in attack power etc character progression is forgettable  theres a super mario rpglike mechanic where you get to choose one stat bonus at levelup but this doesnt really feel satisfying in practice leveling up appears to only give small stat bonuses and theres not a significant sense of getting stronger as you level up

uiqol

the ui is excellent menus are easy to navigate and extremely fast everything is laid out in a logical manner the game has most qol features that you could ask for including easy mode options frequent save points warnings before points of no return etc there are some minor issues such as unskippable cutscenes although none of them are very long and slow movement speed particularly on the world map but those are minor complaints and shouldnt impact anyones enjoyment of the game

miscellaneous

there are two main minigames available fishing and a game called wheels the fishing is extremely basic and doesnt really deserve an indepth review its just not calming or satisfying or gratifying in the way that a lot of fishing minigames are it feels like the devs threw fishing in because they thought they had to but it really doesnt add a lot here

wheels is their answer to minigames like triple triad from final fantasy 8 ive played a few matches and while its sufficiently deep to be interesting it plays quite slow and relies heavily on rng your mileage may vary here but i didnt find wheels to be a satisfying minigame after i won the first couple of matches i doubt ill keep playing them fortunately it appears to be entirely optional

summary

overall this is so close to being a good game but the writing is so bad that i simply cant recommend it hopefully they can at least fix the grammatical errors but this game really needs an entirely new script with major rewrites i will edit my review after i finish the game if the writing improves but i really dont see how it can at this point

#####

the art the music the combat the story the love
buy games from indie developers because you know it is a labor of love and not a cash grab

#####

i absolutely love it it hits the nostalgia button for chrono trigger the graphics are beautiful the dungeons are very reminiscent of golden sun and the battle mechanics are a lovely combination super mario rpg chrono trigger and octopath traveler however i will say it has a few shortcomingsthe character depth is weak and it seems like the battle system although super fun and engaging is still in beta by that i mean that certain mechanics such as the combos  aspect which is meant to copy cts dual and triple tech system fails miserably you get tons of different skills but you never actually get to use them outside of a boss battle and they are not that powerful against bosses which blows cause without the combos you are stuck with the same 3 skills for every character maybe even more like 2 cause a lot of the skills arent useful so its the same attacks over and over if the interactive battle mechanics werent so engaging this would absolutely be a game breaking defeat i truly hope they fix this i also feel like at least so far they should have exploited its unique relic system it uses for difficulty a lot more than they have they have tons of relics that make the game easier but only 1 i know of from the demo that makes it harder im nearing the end of the game i think and i havent found a relic to make it harder during the first play through the difficulty is a little too easy it would actually be perfectly balanced if they didnt autorevive slain characters in 2 turnsit makes it so you essentially never need to use items because you can just let them die and come back at over half health which is generally more health than if you were to waste an item keeping the character alive they could fix the combo system by letting the combo meter carry over between battles or by making the gauge fill up a little quicker though the latter would break boss battles which are already too easy the locks system also often falls short because 9 times out of 10 no matter how creative you are you cant actually lock break an opponent you can only reduce the damage they will doanother beautiful mechanic all but destroyed because it lacks a few final tweaks

so in conclusion a very solid and beautiful game albeit a bit broken with a few minor tweaks such as added spellsskills a little more depth to the characters harder puzzles more dungeons and this would be a contender for best turnbased rpg ever right next to chrono trigger a solid 810  lets pray for some updates and dlc to turn this into the best rpg of the decade

tldr 
this game is all looks and no depth

maybe i am being unfair as an old jrpg veteran and coming of playing the absolutely genius chained echos earlier this year but i couldnt bring myself to play more than 10 hours of this game while sea of stars has a lot going for it on the surface it ultimately falls short of delivering a good experience for at least regular rpg enthusiasts i guess i should start with the obvious strong points the game looks absolutely stunning not only are the graphics beautifully handcrafted also the creature design and sheer number of small details that this game offers are a sight to behold the music is still pretty good and gives you that nice retro gaming vibes of the 90s jrpgs which we all love sadly thats about it in all my 10 hours of playing the characters did not gain and depth the writing was rather stale and seemed uninspired the story was flat and there was nothing which amounted to much to keep me playing that said i did stop before the first major encounter that apparently the game was building up to which brings me to the absolute weak point of the game because not only does sea of stars fail to hook the gamer early on with interesting characters or a compelling story to keep playing the core gameplay loop is boring and repetitive 

the battle system is one dimensional and rudimentary at best the various skills of the characters of which i had six in total at my disposal in the first 12 hours do not offer any synergy of strategic depth every battle is the same and over fairly quickly the combo system which on the surface might have been a nice addition doesnt really play into the rest of the battle system either since the battles are usually over before the meter is filled everything feels like there had been some good ideas somewhere but nothing really connects and due to the little variety the enjoyment of the battles subsided within the first 2 hours of the game the 8 hours left i was just grinding along to see if there was more interesting stuff coming down the line to justify my time sadly the lackluster battle system ultimately wore me down maybe before the game might get better in writing story and who knows even battle system but from what i have gathered online maybe complaints about the game are analogues to mine leaving me bummed out 

the game could have been so much more the battle system if it had only been interesting couldve elevated this to a beautiful game with lots going for it but from my perspective it is sadly only nice to look at and nothing more i really wish i could like this game but it left me feel utterly disappointed


#####

to be brief i spent 40 hours playing this game to nearly 100 completion on stream if i didnt have an audience and a copilot to goof with that time would have been mostly boring slog 

sea of stars paints a beautiful world with delicious sound design and it absolutely nails the nostalgiabait aesthetic its going for but aesthetic is pretty much all it has the combat system is paper thin and falls apart pretty early in the second half of the game most of the bosses never got an action even with all of the hardest difficulty options available enabled and theres basically no mechanical meat to interact with the dialogue is vapid behold a storm of  and  and  and most of the characters never develop a personality garls fine though hes the real protagonist anyway the overall narrative is pretty uninspired and absolutely loaded with references to the messenger that feel really really intrusive

if youve got game pass or can nab it on a deep discount and know what youre getting yourself into you might have a good enough time but you really need to temper your expectations if youre looking to play something like chrono trigger or super mario rpg youll have more fun replaying those games instead

#####

not bad but fails to live up to expectations   

very polished but bland and shallow  

game has been completely linear up to hour 12  combat starts strong but fails to evolve and its starting to feel repetitive  the story and writing are fine but simplistic and aimed at a younger audience

if you like this type of game but want something more sophisticated check out chained echoes  id probably be a lot more forgiving of sea of stars if chained echoes hadnt nailed so many of things that are lackluster in this game

#####

this game from beginning to end was absolutely fantastic i have not a single gripe or qualm with this incredible title from sabotage studio 

sea of stars brought me to tears many many times it brought me so much joy throughout my time playing i never wanted it to end i am beyond hype that theyve announced a dlc i know it will be well worth the wait and money

i will certainly be following sabotages journey to the top of the indie scene i am beyond happy for them and sea of stars for winning game of the year i can only hope it brings more people to support the indie scene 

i cant wait to get in on the ground level of their next project if only id heard about them sooner id have supported the kickstarter

do yourself a favor do the optional end game content it was so worth every second even the conch hunt however frustrating at times ive never been one to collect all or even most of the collectibles in any game but i spoiled the true ending for myself just a tad but it forced me to do the optional end game content and i was pleasantly rewarded with more tears happiness and fun

dont sleep on sabotage studio or sea of stars youll regret it

#####

very very mediocre story to the point where is boring and theres no incentive to keep playing mid gameplay too

#####

so far loving this game if you want that chrono trigger vibes this is the game for you
great on the steam deck

#####

early impressions

1 memory lane for rpg lovers
2 you will adore this game if you liked chrono trigger breath of fire or suikoden d
3 interactions from battle is entertaining and fun
4 music from mitsuda

#####

the game is visually stunning but super shallow in a lot of other areas so far

the mini game  timing mechanics of combat are cool at first and remind me of super mario rpg but they are pretty much just hitting a in sequence or holding a for timing i think even mario rpg had some variation of that with the joy stick and stuff

another gripe would be the games lack of like cool stuff to look forward to from a leveling perspective and a combat perspective you get a choice of random stats you can pick on how to improve the character per level up but no abilities if they just picked the stats for you it would have made zero difference in the end leveling just isnt exciting especially since you dont get any new skills or combos from it just stats
the skills    this was a huge let down for me there are four per character thats it and you dont get them by leveling the character for the entire game you will be using the same moves you got at the beginning of the game hope you like using fireball and moon boomerang every fight and the cool combo techs and stuff will get very little use outside of boss fights

maybe i wouldnt hyper focus on the combat so much but so far the games had pacing issues and there has been no hook for me so far to make me want to keep playing it there is a lot in this game that reminds me of chrono trigger breath of fire mario rpg and my brains like this should be a masterpiece but its just missing something that those types of games had that i cant put my finger on im going to push my way through it because i bought it and ill update the review if it gets better but im keeping my expectations pretty low

tldr the game feels like a gorgeous but shallow rpg that just makes me want to go play older games which is not how i thought i would feel after finally getting to play it i was really excited about this game and im super bummed that i came out feeling meh about it

#####

awesome but dont let this distract you from the fact that in australia there are 48 million kangaroos and in uruguay there are 3457380 inhabitants so if the kangaroos decide to invade uruguay each uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos

#####

pros
 audiovisually its a fantastic experience the pixel art and the music are beautiful
 combat mechanics are pretty cool boosting and lock breaking gives it a strategic feel

cons
 not enough depth to combat and equipment systems each character gets like 3 skills this also makes the combat feel very repetitive because youre using the exact same skills in every encounter from the beginning of the game until the end additionally combat feels dragged out because some skills like moonarang which is super useful so you use it in every encounter take very long to execute when it comes to equipment almost all of them are straight stat boosts with no interesting qualities whatsoever

 the worldbuilding is very poor and often doesnt make much sense for example theres the port town brisk visually the town screams that its a trading hub except if you progress far enough into the game to see the world map youll find out they have no one to actually trade with the other settlements either dont have ports or are otherwise inaccessible the game is just filled with all these elements that dont really coexist with anything else in the same world and kind of do their own thing

 the story the characters the writing in general theyre awful theres no other way to describe it the dialogue is boring the jokes are painful too many of the characters are bland and none of the interesting characters get any meaningful screentime the story is pretty generic save for one or two interesting moments it just falls flat the pacing is awful theres a part where youll just spend hours trudging through these seemingly neverending dungeons just to get to another dungeon so the story can continue theres a sign near the beginning of the game that reads this way to the goat boat that made me want to alt f4 immediately


 but far and away my biggest gripe with this whole game is garl fuck this guy hes supposed to be joe everyman the guy with no special powers so why does this sidekick best friend character get so much of the spotlight he hogs every moment for himself every bit of storyimportant dialogue is delivered by garl every important interaction with an elder or council or whatever its garl that does the talking when the two chosen one main characters save some people the people cheer for garl its fucking ridiculous and the worst part is all the characters love garl the entire main cast all the side characters just cant stop talking about how good of a guy he is hell the villians are probably categorised as evil in this world because they dont love garl the two main characters especially are so obsessed with garl that he is all they talk about when hes not there all they say is oh how i miss garli wish garl was heregarl would know what to doremember that thing we did with garl best time of my life and when he is there they go what would we do without you garl youre the best garl youre so right garl thank garl youre here garl im fucking sick of it i was convinced partway through that garl was going to turn out to be the evil wizard final boss that hes been emitting spores or something to make everyone fall in love with him all so he could manipulate the heroes and take their moments of growth away from them so they could never grow powerful enough to defeat him but no hes just genuinely a gary stu that can do no wrong and everybody loves him because hes the best fuck you garl

im gonna go wash the taste of garls dick out of my mouth and i suggest the writers do the same

510 too much garl

#####

only got 15 hours so far and im enjoying this game to the maximum level the plot is good with few twists that you might not expect
theres a lot of stuff to explore and enjoy specially the mini game within thats alone i spent 2 hours into
graphic and sound both are amazing and on point
been waiting for this game since it came out on kickstarter in 2020 and it did deliver more than expected thankfully i avoided any spoiler as i didnt watch the trailer or playing the demo cant wait to finish it 
the only con of this game that the fight sometimes is repetitive but i can look past that with what the game provided me with

#####

a gorgeous jrpg thats heavily inspired by classics like chrono trigger its good fun and the soundtrack is exceptional the story can feel slow at times and some of the writing missed for me but its clear how much love and care was put into this game and it paid off a solid recommendation for any jrpg fans

this was amazing i cried multiple times lol one of the best games ive played in a while

#####

contains no spoilers

i waffled for a while err week about whether to drop 30 on a brand new gamereading and watching every review playing the demo a time or two trying everything to convince myself not to buy it but boy am i glad that i finally ultimately got this game i havent played anything else since i currently intend to 100 and new game it i also as of now intend to write one of my longer reviews on its behalf here goes

ive been aware of sea of stars ever since its kickstarter campaign but for whatever reason i failed to participate other than sharing in the sheer hype a throwback jrpg from the creators of the messenger featuring contributions from composer yasunori mitsuda i probably wanted to but couldnt for reasons similar to one outlined above  it was early 2020 afterall wasnt it world events etc etc

on the steam store page the positive reviews are overall more correct than the negative reviews i would say for instance sea of stars really does achieve the difficult duty of taking me back exactly to where i most long to be back to golden sunny summers of enjoying easygoing snes games via both classic hardware and shiny new wiis virtual console back to cozy christmases of chrono trigger ds from my parents backseat to my grandmas fireplace to my bedtime blanket burrowback to when life was comparatively simple and clean and free there are myriad means by which sea of stars achieves this feat

to start design the art design and sprite work are breathtakingly beautiful especially in tandem with environments lighting and relighting which never fall short of impressing surprising and delighting that includes somewhat novel implementation of physical lighting in a slightly different and arguably superior fashion to hd2d square games like octopath traveler

the music is practically perfect and fits supremely well everywhere its heard surprisingly mitsudas contributions dont tend to stand out from the rest like a sore thumb as one might eagerly expect but feel somehow simultaneously right at home and yet still his signature style the overall sound design and implementation is equally exceptional the audio director returning from the messenger  eric w rainbowdragoneyes brown who is also the main music composer even ensured that sound effects cut layers from the music most of the time much as they would on a real retro console the archivists theme contains a very cheesy piano sample think apple garagebands default instrument circa 2008 that ive long loathed any n every way n where that i still hear it so i wince a little extra every time the game cuts away to him to disrupt and slow the games pace and flow for seemingly no reason might i add but i suppose its subtle enough

based on some negative reviews and on my time with the demo prior to playing i believed that the combat and most of its mechanics would wear out their welcome fast but in my playing thus far that notion has yet to prove true if anything continuing to master every button press prompt and the nuances of each attack and animations timing windows only grows more rewarding the further i progress through the adventure its fun in the paper mario rpgs and marioluigi rpgs and bug fables so naturally its fun here

the writing and characters and plot while not nearly as bad as negative reviews might lead one to believe could be better even after the september 1st patch the english grammar is occasionally questionableincluding at least one absentee oxford comma the two protagonists are not necessarily lifeless but basic and naive like blank slates for the player to project onto most likely intentionally so

i can understand a kneejerk contempt for garls constant courage and overflowing optimism but ive found his and the games sincerity and earnestness refreshing i highly recommend a youtube video entitled the problem with irony  david foster wallace that explains how ive come to feel about the characters tldr hope love and authenticity are rare and underratedseverely so nowadays yet more by the day

many reviews mention that the writing gets better further into the game but i dont think thats entirely accurate that is the writing starts good enough and hardly changes at all in essence or quality and rather its primarily the game itself that gets better and more complex while the narrative coincidentally does both in tow my theory then is that players grow more acclimated to and therefore more appreciative of the games tone style and voice through exposure and experience admittedly the earliest section of the game is kind of long and slow but in hindsight ive found that it did make me more invested and enthralled in the long run than i mightve been otherwise and that to adjust or trim the start at all any more than they mustve done already would accomplish more harm than good to the game overall

im normally of the mind that games are for gameplay not so much story or lorey which is why im not bothered if the world tone cast or narrative happens to be ever so slightly on the whimsical or even juvenile side of the spectrum and im plain entertained by the thread the game spins

despite the 169 aspect ratio the game is absolutely perfect for playing on the steam deck the black bars are negligible nostalgic even plus i like keeping an eye on decks performance in the top bar

another honorable mention that helped sell me is both the demo and the full game including native support for different gamepads such as the ps5s dualsense even down to the correct controller glyphs represented ingame simply disable steam input for sea of stars then enjoy

my main nitpick thus far is a wallet that apparently caps out at 99900 gold its possible this changes later though like in an old zelda game relatedly the 10mealscooked cap is kind of annoying and i would argue unnecessary just like meals themselves i avoid using them because i have yet to find any relics that make the game harder instead of easier i only cook meals to sell them for the most part and when npcs or chests try to give me meals but my meal inventory and party statushealth pool is full its a tiny bit irritating

and once or twice my character valere disappeared behind some level geometry when i activated the moonerang which completely threw off my attack pattern if only because it was so surprising if id reacted quicker i wouldve probably still kept the rhythm just fine at least for a bit the two or three patches full of fixes since launch would indicate that complaints like this one are only temporarily relevant

i may update this review again soonits taken me over 90 minutes and its past my bedtime but the point is i dont regret my purchase and neither will you reader thanks and have fun ill see ya in stars

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3040271146

#####

the game was amazing in my opinion one of the best pixel art out there  it has it unique ideas for the combat system that are really fresh for a turn base rpg the game offers a good amount of enemies and bosses variety which i really enjoy to fight with

#####

so someone ive met in a discord server who im assuming was a backer bought a copy and then got their key later so i got given the duplicate key because i was in the right place at the right time however i was planning on getting this game already since it looked right up my alley

obviously im not far in but ive seen enough of the core gameplay loop for meaningful first impressions i do plan on editing this as i get deeper in the game i know theres a lot more to be had but i just had to talk about my initial impressions because the games that interesting from the start

first thing to address i saw that one other review chastising this game for over reliance on minigames and i dont agree they feel exactly like the alphadream mario and luigi minigames and the one button thing is exactly like those games they are so fast and satisfying that i cant say they bogged down the pace of the game similar to super mario rpg the minigames are baked into the spell animations and you arent expected to take any extra time to do them

the other complaints that review made were about a lack of depth my first impression was that the magic counter system was quite unique and encouraged paying attention more to targeting even during the basic gameplay also no yiik was not hated solely for the combat minigames that was minor in comparison to the abomination that was the writing and the insufferable protagonist

i also picked up on some other less obvious inspirations for this game like breath of fire and lufia ii its pretty clear to me that the devs have a lot of experience with the genre and it shows with how much attention to detail ive seen so far

everything feels tight the art and animation are beautiful the soundtrack is really good and this game in one hour invoked nostalgia i hadnt felt in a long time the other reviews seem to point to this being as good as chained echoes

also review time is wrong because i wrote this while the game was open and it didnt update properly i did play for a full hour before writing this

#####

after playing for 11 hours i found i didnt care for the story or any of its characters 

the writing is third grade level you are told to go to this location or that location just because someone told you to or because some random artifact is there without any other explanation

the main characters have no personality and need a third wheel to maintain relevance 

normal battles drag on forever i wish there was a fast forward button because enemy animations take ages

#####

im honestly so stunned to realize i dont like this game  i put 10 hours in before coming to that realization  which is so weird because the effort is so obviously there  i think it might just be that sabotage are very good developers but not very good writers because the thing i could not get was invested  the characters just have no depth to them and the narrative is very very generic  so even with an impressive combat system and a fun traversal system i just cant bring myself to care enough to keep going

i wanted so much to love sea of stars and im floored that i dont

#####

pros
game is absolutely polished
everything is animated to the 10th degree from combat to overworld exploration in varied ways
music composed from yasunori mitsuda brings similar scores to chrono trigger and xenogears
battle engages you similar to super mario rpg with timed button presses
level design feels appropriate when traversing based on different biomes

cons
main characters lack any real defining traits other than being a hero zale  valere could have switched places and nothing would be different
battle system
  could have used to run away feature
  takes too long to build combo which is a huge highlight for making combat fun since each character only has 3 movesets
  enemy weaknesses  resistances play a smaller role compared to the lock system so it doesnt feel like theres a balance between the two
puzzles are serviceable but dont provide any real challenge to solve

final thoughts
the game is beautiful and i can feel that no corners were cut when realizing their vision to making a game similar to the rpgs from the 90s  i thoroughly enjoyed reliving that experience with amazing visuals so if thats what youre looking for i would recommend the purchase  
on the other end of the spectrum the story is not as engaging especially when you factor the main characters they dont question their beliefs have any inner strife nor do they conflict with anyone in their main party  they just jump in head first to be the hero making the adventure less compelling  the side characters are way more interesting and have a personal struggle that you can sympathize with compared to zale  valere  
i feel the combat could use some tweaking  the cooler combo moves are also gated by the length of a battle which are at level 2  3 but by the time you can do a level 2 combo move the battle is already over  so unless you are fighting a boss you are unlikely to utilize those movesets
i eagerly waited 2 years for this game and wanting to have a new experience while wearing nostalgia glasses  while it was short i definitely got my moneys worth  you can easily tell that the developers had a passion with the quality they put into sea of stars

#####

h3not just nostalgia baith3

i really love how sabotages design ideas take the best parts of oldschool games and create something even better its like theyre finally making the game theyve always dreamed of

in sea of stars theyve added a more active turnbased combat system inspired by super mario rpg you can time your attacks just right for increased damage and use blocks against attacks for reducing incoming damage and from chrono trigger they added lot of things they liked including combat happening in world rather than other screen after swirly transitionscreen there is almost no random encounters outside few ambushes

i havent been this obsessed with a game in a long time decided straight away to aim for 100 the game outside one last achievement meant for new game im almost there too 4142

i get that some people might find the block and attack timing a bit tiring after a while but dont worry you can turn on relics to make it happen automatic with block being 35 chance and attacks always with less dmg so its not too op and that way have a more traditional turnbased experience it wont affect your achievements and no one will even know youre using them plus you can turn them off again once you feel like doing active gameplay

what i will also mention as sort of con depending what you expect is that the story is full of jrpg tropes in both good and bad like power of friendship being massive almostgodkilling power or city npcs talking almost nonsense or small random things like i really like the inn no one would actually say in real life to random passerby i personally found that part amusing and very nostalgic
if you take those as heh of course they would add that trope from the genre you will have bit more enjoyable time dont expect too much

#####

i really enjoy this game the game kind of reminds me super mario rpg it takes some time to get the button presses right for the extra hits but the game is fun i really enjoy the story and cannot wait to finish it to see its conclusion

#####

bfirst impressionsb since ive only played 6 hours of it on pc and a few more hours of the demo on switch ill gladly change my review in the future if those strong impressions change
bif you want a spiritual successor for chrono trigger thats not itb and itll be hard not to compare sea of stars with chrono trigger since we all know everyone claims this should be heavily inspired by it im not sure now if the devs themselves claimed such a thing

one of the bmain problems of this game is its pacing and the way the story is toldb during those 6 hours id have to say that at least half of it were dedicated to the intro the storytelling is just so expository and slow that it becomes just bad its like it is trying too hard to make you feel attached to these characters and make you understand this world in such a short period of time it takes so long for you to be in control even though things are completely linear and sadly shallow take ct for example
list
in chrono trigger at the first minute of the game you are in complete control you wake up youre told you live in this marvelous kingdom and a festival celebrating its 1000th year is happening you are in this different world that quickly shows itself to be somewhat fantastic with monsters and robots and marvelous things you have only one directive meet your childhood friend she is waiting for you in the millenial fair do you want to go straight to there sure do you want explore your neighbors houses fine you want to even go to another town or visit the dangerous forest go ahead learn about your surroundings learn about the lore learn about who you are in this new universe
instead of doing something similar sea of stars baits you at the first minute making you think you have control and then put you through an extremely tiring and boring linear introduction where you dont really play as your normal characters and you just go through the expository story as if someone is reading a script to you you dont really have much to investigate or learn because things are just told to you through janky dialogue npcs other than the main ones dont add anything to the atmosphere or lore objects are mostly not interactive and when they are they dont add anything to the game or the story when you finally reach the world map you cant really go anywhere other than the next checkpoint its completely linear theres no wonder to be found no exploration to be done to add to all the boring introduction during cutscenes which is most of the intros first part its like the game feels the need to explain itself to you every second of the way and that keeps going even after the introduction bshow dont tellb let the players experience the world you crafted
list

bsome other considerationsb
list
maybe that will change in the future but so far the characters are just lacking a lot of charisma i dont really like any of them and they dont really feel unique at all so far the story and its characters are so silly while trying to be somewhat deep at the same time and it doesnt really work for me im quite past spoilerthe pirates partspoiler and no character got my heart yet and its like garl is trying too hard at all times its a bit artificial and annoying sad
another thing that sadly didnt have me by the feels yet is the soundtrack quite bland the fact that there is no music for combat contributes to the pacing issue its like fighting is not eventful youre walking then you find a monster and start fighting but nothing changes in the atmosphere of it all you just stop moving and start pressing a few more buttons theres no rythm to this transition no excitement its like the devs havent played a rpg at all and im not talking only about jrpgs most rpgs if not all of them have combat music because fighting should be different should be engaging actually i believe most games in general have some sort of combat music thats not the case here weird
platforming why have fake platforming if it doesnt requires actual platforming why make the characters jump and climb or walk on ropes at all times if doesnt require actual skill or gameplay its just disruptive its like i am required to stop my normal speed or flow of movement constantly because the devs thought it would look nice and only that for those who didnt play it yet all the jumping and nonwalking movement is automatic you cant miss the platform youre jumping to you do not require any sort of skill to reach your destination its not fun or engaging it just slows you down all the gaps and verticality of the map serves the only purpose of turning the map into some sort of maze and sometimes a puzzle we got a good example that will have a remake pretty soon one that combined jrpg with platforming and that required the player to do actual gameplay super mario rpg and the first two paper mario or all the mario  luigi series sea of stars did not do it well though the jumping and climbing is just whatever at best and annoying at worst
the game does not have difficulty modes or does it sea of stars introduce things called brelicsb that you can activate to somewhat reduce the difficulty of the game by decreasing the amount of damage you receive making you automatically hit harder showing you when you scored a perfect block etc but its kind of weird because you gotta buy those relics and you gotta activate them so they just feel like another piece of equipment and i feel like according to the game itself that was not the developers intention its just weird to play the game in easy mode you gotta buy that option with the gold you were supposed to use for equipment and items and you can activatedeactivate them whenever you want just a weird design decision mainly because you gotta buy those options like you buy any other piece of equipment so the relics are just equipment i mean equipment is supposed to make the game easier because it makes your character stronger right anyway just adds a bit to the whole they didnt know what they were doing box to me
list

the combat is fun but nothing new the pixel art is pretty expository storytelling characters and world that lacks charisma weird or bad gamesound design choices thats what sea of stars is to me right now but ill finish the game and come back here to give my conclusion bif you want to get an okay jinspired rpg go for itb there are much better options though like spoilerchained echoesspoiler for example if you want an amazing jrpg or the spiritual successor of chrono trigger sea of stars is not it
ill be back after im finished with the game


#####

i have nothing bad to say about this game so far i dont expect this review will change much by the time i finish it

music art gameplay story length price 
h1grade ah1


they did a great job in creating something that is clearly inspired by chrono trigger and likely super mario rpg as well im highly impressed how this game turned out and this is a must play for fans of those games i hope they have all the success in anything else they try to make including the dlc thats coming out

#####

what an absolutely awesome game

right off the bat you get immediate chrono trigger vibes  map layouts are all similar to ct but yet it has anew uniqueness feel to it that just feels right  combat and moving all feel fluid  you can tell the developers spent lots of time making homage to games of yesteryear but creating a new masterpiece for a new generation along the way

#####

combat reminds me of mario  luigi which me like also garl is a chad and a king

#####

sea of stars ran great on the steam deck oled at 90 fps without the need to tweak settings the story was great with multiple arcs that were mostly completed by the end of the game the only open for interpretation possible incomplete arc was burgraves the story was nice and you get to enjoy new characters complete puzzles that should be fairly easy for older kids to do without adult help with a cute story its a nice turn based rpg one of the best aspects of the game is the ability to tweak the difficulty confirm bonus hits and blocks and whatnot id recommend this game to someone looking for a cozy turn based rpg with likable characters

#####

i wouldnt say its bad per se but its lacking in a lot of departments that i wouldnt expect a jrpg in this price range this release year to have instead of using the games its supposed to be inspired by to elevate itself it only takes the superficial similarities for more of a marketing strategy than anything

after so many other jrpgs since chrono trigger try to add to the genre and explore all kinda of unique twists or even trying to just better the already established mechanics of jrpgs comes a game that doesnt really try anything new it sits comfortably on its chrono trigger inspired seat without an ounce of effort towards being anything unique

combat doesnt really change after the first hour or so youll be doing the exact same thing up until you finish the game levelups dont mean anything you get some increased stats and a choice of an additional increase like the one you can see in the steam store page that seems to only be there because otherwise level ups would be even more boring

the story actually went backwards in terms of quality and interest in contrast to the very cool concepts chrono trigger has this one takes the safe road and doesnt tell anything new or exciting you are the chosen ones you are stronger than all of your predecessors because you are and only you can save the world not to mention the mid game spoiler im about to die so let me just know everything that needs to be doing just because spoiler which throws any suspense of disbelief out the window

characterwise the same as the story not even having anything close to characters like the magus from chrono trigger for example

tldr a step backwards from things like chrono trigger which released almost 20 years ago nothing ventured nothing gained is a sentence that is quite fitting for this game considering how few unique things they have maybe get it on a big discount no way this is worth 30

#####

oh sea of stars where do i start with you this is the first time ive found myself leaving a negative review of a game not necessarily because i find huge faults with the title itself but rather because of what it represents that said if you care solely on someones opinion of the title in a vacuum then this isnt the review to read the game is fine enough but i have more intrinsic issues with it 

as stated the game is fine but thats actually part of my issue its just fine this game was hyped up and endorsed by well known names in the jrpg community and even cocomposed by yasunori mitsuda the world was calling it the spiritual successor to chrono trigger but as many times in video game history have taught us hype for a title is rarely met 

there are far better indie rpgs even those that came out in the same couple year time span yet this game was heralded just because of its pedigree and a few big names putting their names behind it 

the price of the game is a sticking point with me too this game is approaching that uncomfortable price point for an indie game when you are asking for over half of the amount of a typical aaa studio title for your indie game it better completely and utterly rock my socks off part of the charm of indie games if finding small scale indie developers who put a lot of personal passion and sacrifice into their titles you arent coming into this expecting blockbuster cutscenes and insane graphical fidelity  but a small quaint passion project with a lot of heart you are also not expecting to break your bank with over 30usd 

id be remissed if i didnt actually bring up the game at all so let me say  again  that its fine there is nothing groundbreaking about the story or the combat but what is here is engaging enough the problem is in a world of games awash with indie rpgs left right and center you need to stand out  this game doesnt or at least not for the right reasons it stands out because of its pedigree and because of its endorsements  not for its own merits 

the two main characters are probably my two biggest sticking points  valere and zale for two characters who actually talk and interact with other characters and objects in the world they sure are lifeless and feel like they would be better suited to being silent protagonists things happen around them hell things happen because of and in spite of them but never do they feel impacted by those events the other characters thankfully help carry the narrative and emotional impact but when your main characters just simply exist you have a problem 

sea of stars is by no means a bad game but i do not appreciate the precedent i fear it sets a surprisingly generic game hyped up to insane amounts because of a few blockbuster names involved in the title and endorsements by individuals in the industry who surely knew better than to throw their weight behind a completely average title an excuse to charge a frankly ridiculous amount for an indie developed title all of it leaves a proverbial bad taste in my mouth

#####

in one word i would call this game refreshing sea of stars succeeds in being a callback to a bygone era of turnbased rpgs not only by implementing these classic systems and storylines but by making them better the food system encourages you to use your items instead of hoarding the mana system encourages the use of spells even in lower level encounters the relics make the experience customizable for new or experienced players and personally i loved the story of this game i find that playing for the true ending is essential but without spoiling anything it is very worth it i cant recommend this game enough to people who feel unenthused by relentless remakes and ports of these classic jrpg style games and would rather play something new keep an open mind and enjoy

#####

the style of this game is great the visuals music and feel are awesome but once you get through the first few hours you realize the combat never really gets better and starts to just feel like a grind i really tried but this game just felt like a grind

#####

its quite tricky to sum up my opinions on this game at first glance i was struck away by the beautiful art that the game displays it does a wonderful job of creating wonderful vibrant scenes and characters each environment is beautifully crafted and unique unfortunately however thats what it shows on the surface

in my opinion the rpg elements of this game are extremely lacking whether it be the lack of different move types the lack of strategy and even the limited customization the game allows each character only comes with 4 moves total which is really frustrating it prevents the use of complex and unique strategies to the game furthermore one of the moves is gated off and cant be used repeatedly although there are combo moves is still doesnt make up for the lack of strategy i found myself using the same exact routine on every boss not because it was the best but because it was frankly the only way i could play 

when getting new gear and items its essentially just a stat upgrade theres no reason to not use the most recent gear piece you obtained this just furthers my point on there being little to no customization or strategy you simply make the same few numbers go higher no risk and reward or any of that 

additionally i feel as though the story fell flat in a few places the first half of the game was excellent in my opinion but when getting to the latter half oh god it was plot holes galore i felt frustrated thinking there was more to something but got surprised when they didnt expand on certain plot points even the ending was a bit ambiguous in places and i can only feel as though it was rushed theres not even that much side content either you just have the main story and a very short little postgame 
 
in short i really wanted to love this game but i couldnt force myself to the game gets carried by the beautiful pixel art but everything else about it is lacking if youre in it for a true rpg experience i would strongly say no otherwise go right ahead for all i care buy chained echoes instead lol

#####

this is the most complete indie game ive played in recent years no bullsh just straight love and care
big recommendation to everyone

edit just received the spoilertrue endingspoiler and im starstruck by how good this game manages to be the whole way through i feel emotionally attached to this game now after playing it help

#####

hate to say it but this game is just boring i thought id grab this as it looked like a chill steam deck game to chip away at during evenings but ive put it down and dont really feel the urge to pick it back up again i have never played chrono trigger ff or anything like that so take what i say with a pinch of salt 

the art style animations and music all blend together well creating a pretty package but for me it just falls apart the longer it goes ive played for 8 hours and feel like ive given it a decent go with the last 3 feeling quite forced waiting for a lightbulb moment that never really came it was once i began actively sprinting past combat encounters that i realised i was bored  i packed this game away shortly after

i do however see the appeal for those more seasoned jrpg enjoyers and appreciate the work thats clearly gone into the creation of this game but for me personally i found the experience pretty middling at best

#####

the character development and overall story are a huge upside here the combat system is on the primitive side but overall the variety of enemies and attack styles is welcome this game has some clever twists part way through that are worth sticking it out for the soundtrack is a total ripper from start to finish youll be jamming

#####

this is one of the best and most beautiful rpgs i have and ever will play if you like rpgs you wont regret it

godspeed solstice warriors

h1 a masterclass in tickling your nostalgia pickle h1
this game is just so fucking awesome not only does it have the sense of familiarity and nostalgia that just takes you back to the good old days of games like chrono trigger and my favorite super mario rpg they somehow manage to improve upon it and just make it a fantastic experience overall

gorgeous pixel artstyle an absolute banger of a soundtrack and the animations just make the presentation of this game top tier people wouldve been sold on that alone but the gameplay is no slouch either combat is engaging and fun the inspiration they take is very clear but then they add their own twists such as the lock mechanic and live mana on top of the various skills combos and ultimates youll unlock which makes things very interesting exploration is rewarding and a plethora of other things to do the story without saying much is wholesome af

while i enjoyed my time with this game there are some flaws id like to mention for starters the writing is a bit iffy for example the protagonists dont really feel like the protagonists and that theyre just tagging along with someone who probably shouldve been the protagonist hope that makes sense lol the combat lacks depth after you reach a certain period and i guess i was just expecting a bit more and the lock mechanic can be a bit random at times which leads to frustration but that could just be nitpicking on my part regardless ive thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish

i remember seeing the announcement and groaning on having to wait so long for it but after finally playing through it i can wholeheartedly say the wait was worth it

#####

lackluster gameplay and characters hamper on what could have been an enjoyable experience if anyone on the development team had asked is this mechanically fun and what can we do to change it

after seeing the launch trailer for sea of stars i wasnt too big on the art direction but it thoroughly surprised me as i played through the game every area in the game especially the latter half are nothing short of breathtaking and i cant imagine how much time and effort went into creating such detailed art all of these areas are only enhanced by the beautiful boss artwork and the exceptional soundtrack unfortunately these are the only good things i can say about the game as we move into the gameplay territory

the main mechanic of the gameplay in sea of stars is that it has a timed hit in battle akin to super mario rpg where you press the a button in this case to empower your own attack to do extra damage or increase your defence during an opposing enemy attack while basic enough the window for blocking opposing enemy varies wildly due to how different enemy attack animations are in the game some enemies shoot a slow ball at you that may do 10 of your overall life and others have incredibly fast melee swings which due to the animations they have results in you having to delay your block for a microsecond else your block animation would run out and you would take the full hit not exactly fun how tight the your execution needs to be when a ton of later animations have a severe delay to them where the animation may be over your characters but the hitbox isnt active yet

another major part of the battle system is spells or spell locks where you must break enemy spell locks by using the appropriate action command such as slashing hammer poison or solstice magic the spell lock system is engaging enough and is also the main source of frustration many newer players will have towards the first and second act of the game because you have next to no resources at these points in the game mana pools are pitiful and your party is nowhere near complete resulting in random monsters sometimes all having spell locks at the start of battle this all results in unavoidable party wide damage which depletes your very small healing pool of spells or food many of the resources you will have to counteract all of this are only acquired during the final act of the game when the majority of combat may as well be over with because

grinding is a nono in this game monsters in your area dont drop gold and their exp rates for how much effort that needs to be put in for each monster pack is not worth it when monsters in the next area give 10x more exp the only thing of value that monsters can potentially drop is cooking ingredients yay at some point during the end of act 1 i felt punished for even bothering to engage with monsters in dungeons for these reasons their overly long attack animations constant consumption of my materials to keep up with all the manahp that was lost per battle and so on all for a few hundred exp when the monsters in the area proceeding would be giving me 15002000 exp per pack and the next area after that 35004000 and so on until the very end of the game

the final mechanics of the battle system include live mana and combo points where each spell lock broken or turn taken increases your cp gauge combo points can be spent between two party members and holding a maximum of three combo points to preform stronger joint attacks that require 0 mp to use great but this is never expanded upon there is no trio combo attack in the game and what you learn is fed to you throughout the game so until you reach a certain point in the story youre stuck with basic joint attacks until the end of the game these joint attacks can also be used to break spell locks in fewer turns as they will be using affinities between both characters such as poison sun luna etc

live mana on the other hand is handed out in battle after auto attacking an enemy monster up to a maximum of three live mana on the field boosting with live mana enhances the players attacks and gives their autoattacks one hit of their respective element such as sunlunapoison to help in breaking locks if you preemptively strike a monster you gain access to a single live mana ball at the start of battle but the ability to consistently strike an enemy is only given to the player a few hours into the game in an odd choice by the developers prior to this the player has to walk within a pixel of a monster and tap the a button to hit them which is finicky as all hell again as with combo points this is the extent of the live mana system and it is never expanded upon

what you see within the first hour or two of gameplay is what you will be seeing for the next 25 hours incredibly slow animations that make final fantasy 9 blush horrendous random spell lock on dungeon monsters where all of them may have spell locks or there might be 1 instead combo points and live mana that are never saved between battles meaning you will always have to work towards something in every battle if you got two combo points in the previous fight and were hoping to have an incredibly high damage opener or party wide heal on your party at the start of the next battle youre out of luck youll forever be struggling in the opening of new encounters

the only upside of this battle system is that the boss battles are the highlight of the game they arent exactly hard but they are engaging enough to be fun

 and finally the characters and story the characters are written with a good foundation but thats all they have going to them anything interesting that could happen to any of the characters never comes into play nobody is expanded upon what you see during their introductions is all they will ever be zale is introduced as a speedster but this never comes into play during the story valere is the strong one of the two but this never comes into play in the story this is a thing with every single member of the cast be it your future party members or villains of the game the devs write a line or two about them or hint at things regarding and none of this is used within the games story many of these characters are simply dropped in the games story with no conclusion to their respective arcs with the exception of one reveal late into the game all in all as i finish the game i have 1000 questions that may never be answered because the developers conveniently dropped them all without a proper conclusion


as a backer of this kickstarter i cant say i regretted dropping cash on it the boss battles were fantastic the soundtrack was phenomenal and the sprite work is impressive unfortunately thats all there is everything else the game has to offer is an unfun inconvenience at best

#####

a game that hits all the right notes but fails to produce a beautiful melody

you guys i wanted so badly to love this game really i did when i first booted it up and started to play the nostalgia hit me so hard that i started tearing up but the more i played the more i found the that the mechanics that were implemented were shallow and basic 
the game is 1 part chrono trigger 1 part super mario rpg and 1 part zelda 
it takes the best parts of each game and implements it into its own the issue that arises however is that these mechanics are not properly fleshed out and expanded upon
i will give you an example from the very start of the game one of your characters has a skill called the moonarang it is essentially a skill  where you need to time your hits and the better you are at getting the timing right the more damage you do this at first was extremely fun and engaging but as time went on the fact that this skill did not evolve change or get better or more complex made combat feel very dull boring and repetitive worse yet is that this one skill is essentially the strongest dps your team has if you get good at it meaning that you need to use this constantly or else your damage output goes down significantly
it just feels like the devs had a great idea they started it but did not build upon it

other things that bugged me
1 remember when in games like final fantasy or chrono trigger you first get your airship how cool was that you finally had the chance to visit anywhere on the map and do anything you wanted right how freeing was that how cool did that make you feel well in sea of stars you get a similar mode of transportation but guess what all the cool new places you wanted to visit well you cant access it now or you need a special item etc they give you the illusion of freedom meanwhile you are 100 still on tracks and must go to this one location for the next story beat
2 for the amount of hype the devs touted about the musical score i was expecting a lot more than what i got the only score i loved was the one that plays in the archivists home this also was the first song that greets you when you start the game maaaaaaan did that get me pumped but slowly i realised that the rest of the musical score was serviceable at best
3 story was basic i felt nothing about my characters or their plight in the world they lived in

now for things i enjoyed
1 the art design and colour palette used are fantastic the incorporation of pixel art combined with small anime clips was a huge hit
2 the chrono trigger combat style
3 there is a mini game in sea of stars that is very well made it is complex enough to want to engage with it regularly and i found myself looking forward to playing it in every single town i visited excellent job here devs 

i wanted to conclude by saying this this is a great first attempt from the devs for a game like this it has the potential to be amazing and believe me i really wanted it to be but it lost a lot of steam once you past 10 hours of play 
i wish i could give this a neutral rating because i want thierry boulanger and his team to make more games like this but i also want them to understand that just because they found a diamond does not automatically mean that it has a mirror shine keep at it guys

#####

another shining example of why supporting indie developers is the right call sea of stars oozes passion and love seriously this game is truly special do yourself a favour and pick this one up you wont regret it

#####

i really wanted to like this game but the writing and combat system sucks

when a character dies they automatically revive after a few turns they didnt balance the game around this at all and it just makes every fight a joke its better to let your guys die than to heal them sometimes leads to really braindead easy combat

the worst example of this is that theres a boss that counter attacks your entire team if you hit the wrong spot i didnt realize that i was hitting the wrong spot until he was 2 turns from death i fought him completely wrong and still won taking roughly 5 times the damage i was supposed to 

the characters dont feel real its like a childrens storybook level of intensity that tries to act mature

#####

edit review has gone over to negative from positive

first the good stuff 

plays like a lost playstation 1 era turn based rpg something that working designs wouldve released on the console or on the saturn although they wouldve fixed things that i outline below if they had brought it to the us

nice graphics nice music some of the spell effects and boss monsters would make square soft during their peak 16bit era proud in particular

the game though has a few  issues

firstly some of the areas seem way too large for what they should be 

to compare to an 16 bit rpg  imagine if you played final fantasy iv2 us for the snes and the mist cave area leading to the summoner village at the beginning of the game was like 10x longer then it was it would screw with the pacing of keeping things moving so the player feels like theyre progressing this game seems to want to bog players down with each new map area you go to by making them as complicated and enemy riddled as possible to navigate it shouldnt take me as long as it did to get through some of those areas near the beginning but the devs designed it that way and it gets tiresome seeing the same scenery i kept saying either give me a boss or an exit to another area already navigating places like that giant teleporter place

the world maps and environments  sprite work are lovely  why is the ui so damn stock was it a time constraint or you just didnt think it mattered you go through such trouble everywhere else you could add some visual flair to it at the very least 

speaking of the enemies and combat  your character sprites never change based on gear they use i mean this is 2023 if you cannot change the armor or show accessories can we at least make the weapons look different guys

combat at first seems like itll be cool that is until you realize you barely get any spells or skills for your characters and the ones you do get to me feel like someone on the dev team didnt like how strong they were and wanted to raise difficulty so they were nerfed into near uselessness and thus are practically worthless

every fight ive had through the first like 9 hours of the game against the regular enemies who are time road blocks basically has been the same thing over and over instead of combat being fun it feels like a slog and your characters are weaklings you can dump all the stats in melee combat you want at level ups  you may hit for 36 extra damage if youre lucky but those enemies will still feel very tanky same with spells its disheartening

the game is super linear as well  and with no world map you feel like youre going from instanced area to instanced area because thats what you are doing nothing feels connected  its much more episodic at least through the parts ive managed to play through then it is interconnected world with a sweeping epic chrono trigger i guess didnt have much urgency from the random npcs in its game world either but it made up for that with great pacing which obviously this game lacks badly because of the combat

besides combat the other biggest sin to me is the writing

someone else in their review on here mentioned the pirates and i can say i loathed their inclusion here we are supposed to be controlling these trained heroes and yet the writers force us to require their help  and the help is supposed to be funny but it isnt i can overlook that sort of thing though 

however the unskippable longashell 4th wall breaking moment with one of the pirates angered me greatly and isnt something i can overlook the person writing it probably thought they were the funniest person on the planet when they wrote it but im here to tell you it makes you look lame as balls

resorting to that kind of storytelling to try and get across characters being zany or comical is embarrassing especially if you want us to take your games plot and characters seriously your team needed a level headed editor to keep this 10th grade garbage away from the script gang

tldr  good music  graphics but weak characters with lackluster writing and a sloggy combat system that never changes

#####

equal parts super mario rpg and equal parts chrono trigger

fantastic pixel art coupled with a banger of a soundtrack fun combat system that makes you plan ahead and feels rewarding once you get it down

#####

so far fun and solid gameplay  combat is more interesting than i expected graphicsmusic are good gameplay feels a lot like chrono trigger  only complaints so far is a few small ui errors and theres a lot of talking about 1 hours worth before you actually get into the real game

#####

첫 인상은 훌륭하지만 조금만 해봐도 
이 게임이 그런 평가를하는 의구심이 드는 게임
크게 3가지 문제가 가장 두드러진다


1 반복되는 게임 플레이

전투는 물론 맵의 구성조차 특정 패턴을 반복한다
마을낚시포인트던전그리고 다시 마을로 반복되는 식
좀 더 다양한 이벤트로 변주를 줄 수 있지 않나 아쉬운 부분


2 이상한 전투 벨런스

적의 약점을 찌르는게 주가 되는 반면
약점을 플레이어가 알아내기 힘들거나
아예 약점 공격이 불가능한 상황이 자주 발생한다

전투 템포가 꽤 긴 편인데
변수가 적고 할 수 있는 행동 가짓수가 적어서
전투가 생각보다 굉장히 빨리 지루해진다


3 미묘한 캐릭터

주인공의 캐릭터가 매우 미묘하다
성격도 알기 힘들고 목표 의식도 알 수 없다
동료가 사실상 주인공이라 치면 그 캐릭터라도 살려야 할텐데
사이드킥 이상으로 강조되지 않아 확 끌리는 캐릭터가 없다
스토리에 나오는 주변 인물들은 좋게 말해도 유치한 편



그래픽과 음악은 훌륭하지만
정작 장르에서 가장 중요한 탐험과 캐릭터
그리고 스토리는 좋게 말해도 평균수준

모난곳 없는 게임이면 고평가를 주는 최근 리뷰 흐름이
꼭 좋은 게임을 고르는건 아니지 않나하는 고민을 하게 만드는 게임
나쁜 게임은 아니지만 꼭 해야하거나 수작이라 치기엔 많이 부족하다

#####

do you still remember when you first discovered that you time travel in chrono trigger or when two best friends jump in the waterfall in suikoden ii those nostalgic feeling during the time when the only problem you have is how much time you will play before you get some scolding sea of stars has that and i am just a few minutes in i do not want to be technical about the game if you give me a tour down the memory lane you are easily a thumbs up for me

heal the inner child yours might be wounded for a very long time already

#####

great soundtrack nice art design  fun combat make this jrpg a must have game for chrono trigger fans so far its the best modern jrpg for me since lost odyssey excited to play more

#####

biggest disappointment of 2023

an extremely bland story paperthin even cardboard is too charitable a word characters and awful dialogue are coupled with gameplay mechanics that were ripped off from games going back almost 30 years alongside a worldlevel design philosophy with no regard for crafting a cohesive or even sensible game world i thought competent game studios had mostly figured out how to do these things well in the last decade or so but it seems sabotage never got the memoor maybe they were never competent enough to begin with

carried fully by visuals music and raw nostalgia factor if those are enough for you to enjoy a game feel free to go for it

#####

okay i zombied out hard when it came out at midnight until i fell asleep at my pc admittedly it wasnt too long before then but still ill try to write down a more in depth review now that im not uber excited

preface i played the demo on switch many times so im familiar already with some mechanics which allowed me to zip through the beginning portion of the game easily

bcombat b

the game itself has an incredible turnbased combat system it takes inspiration from various old school jrpgs such as chrono trigger and the final fantasy series but it manages to create a unique enough twist on the system that its refreshing its still turnbased dont get me wrong but youve got input in the mechanic so its not as simple  

you can do deflectionsparries combos build up combo specials and nonmagic magic attacks lmao youll get it when you play it and most importantly the enemies have different systems stacked onto them they can start to charge a special attack that in order to break you need to break them you do the combo it shows above its head theres also a general break system and a type attack system such as some enemies are impervious or resistant to physical attacks so it needs magical and so on and so forth

additionally you can find scrolls ingame to learn more combostechniques so you can add more variety to your attacks or planning keep an eye out and explore that world

bleveling b

leveling comes as standard stat boosts but you get an additional stat boost you can select from ranging from physical attack increase to magical damage defense increases this allows for a way to customize some of the characters for example if you want valere to focus on magical damage you can just keep selecting those for the additional bonuses if you want to turn garl into a super tank you can focus on damage reduction and so on 

you get exp like any other jrpg from battling 

bmp  hp restoration mechanics b

you got your standard potionether system just with different names inside of battle you can generate mp by items or by putting in average physical attacks for hp you have items but you also have spells to heal with additionally for both hp and mp you can find various trinketsequipment to help with regeneration if you so like 

bdifficulty b

the battle mechanic makes it pretty tough already especially if you dont do parries or combos youll find it not so average you can mindlessly attack however if you do find it easy there are relics you can find and equip that can either make the game harder or easier for example a relic that can make the game easier for story enjoyers that will 100 heal you after every battle keep an eye out for them 

bworld exploration b 

the world is much like any old school rpg except its gotten heavy chrono trigger inspiration theres a world map you walk could be by ship etc etc across to different sections of the world the world itself is beautifully crafted from its design to its pixel art all the way to ost and ambiance i promise youll find plenty of places you want to explore just to see and hear it all 

theres also puzzles and such to keep you engaged via exploration so its not just go here and theres nothing except walking to get to story

bcompanions b

you start with the mains valere and zale but you get others like garl good boi super tank chef i dont know yet if you get other permanent companions but itll be okay in my opinion if you do not you do not need a ff6 roster a concise team with great character building is all you really need 

bstory b

i dont know what to say here that wont spoil the story but its really interesting and its written with a great pacing dont skip the story or you will miss out

h1 end commentaryh1 

if there was anything that id add that id consider a con so far it would be no actual difficulty tier setting from the start the idea of the relics is great but it should become an additional system not a replacement if someone wanted to play this on the hardest setting with optional items that make it a hellscape i think that would have served better

another con would be that i cant seem to get keyboard and mouse to work i dont know if theres support or not and i do prefer controller but i know others arent going to enjoy being forced to a controller

lastly i feel like the magic system is too heavily required and too punishing when youve run out of mp some fights quite literally require you to be able to chain magic on enemies or youre screwed its really hard managing magic or at least so far in early game it is and with scarce money gold or whatever and items to craft food with its tough 

with that all said and done im really enjoying the game its not chrono trigger and its not trying to be and thats okay but you can feel the love easily from the devs for old school rpgs i completely recommend it to any fan of rpgs especially old school ones and those sick of the modern day gimmicky stuff its a fun rpg with a great concise story 

1010

#####

im not sure what is happening with indie pixel art games but i cannot recommend sea of stars just like the earlier released chained echoes its crazy to me that both these games have the same fundamental flaws did sea of stars not look at that game and try to learn something

first the story is just awful the characters are incredibly one dimensional and show no depth or growth and instead stick to one archetype everyone is also so incredibly cheerful that its obnoxious at times  im not against positivity but seriously the characters dont need to be written for a g audience the story also is riddled with plot holes like its trying to collect as many as it can for no reason other than to waste your time the ending is terrible it builds to this huge main villain the entire time and you dont even fight him

the combat is also incredibly weak its fun for the first 2 hours but the game shows its whole hand right away there are like 1 maybe 2 new abilities per character for the rest of the 20 hour game some of the abilities feel like they were designed to waste your time as you have to keep clicking buttons to use them and not in a fun way like paper mario

the games strengths are the art and music both of these were fantastic but really the game is nothing more than a shiny turd the entire experience is a slog to get through and i really wouldnt recommend anyone buying it and wasting their time with a disappointing ending

im not sure whats so difficult about hiring a writer for these kinds of games both chained echoes and sea of stars had the exact same problem at the very least they need to hire an editor because the game is riddled with grammar issues that constantly took me out of the experience

i would love it if they learned from this experience and hired an actual game designer for the gameplay and a writing staff for the story the audio and video team did a fantastic job and dont need to change anything we constantly rip on aaa studios that produce shallow games that are nothing more than graphics without any substance why shouldnt we do the same here

#####

its kind of chrono trigger do you like chrono trigger

#####

its okaaay 

h3prosh3
  nice graphics
  inoffensive music
  cool battle system
  interesting traversal mechanics
  most of the puzzles are fun but not very challenging
  garl baby igarli best boy
  mountains are nice 
  nothing is missable you can go back and grab collectibles if needed

h3consh3
  the writing this is a big one for me if maybe a few more people had worked on the script and let it develop for a few more months and they had a copy editor this game couldve been great but the writing and grammar is really amateur and that really took away from my experience all the characters are pretty flat and onedimensional even my favorite character garl
  bloat a good deal of the time the game felt like it didnt really respect my time it could maybe have been 13 of the length and it wouldve been more impactful many areas are too big and winding and it felt like empty padding
  though pleasant the music isnt really emotionally striking or memorable

h3overallh3
if you arent picky with story have a lot of free time and want something that reminds you of classic snes games i might recommend this

if you want to play something that made you feel like chrono trigger made you feel ehhh maybe just replay chrono trigger

that said i dont regret playing it i got the spoilertrue endingspoiler and im not mad that i spent as much time on it as i did but i dont have any other games that are really calling for my attention now either

#####

im not very far but ive played enough to know this game goes right up next to all the other timeless rpgs that ive played growing up if you grew up playing chrono trigger mario rpg golden sun and loved those games you will love this too if you are reading this and have had anything to do making this game thank you so much

#####

i almost never write reviews but ive been eagerly waiting for this game and now that ive had a chance to play it the feeling of not being disappointed with a video game i just bought for this price point needed recognition

if you played chained echoes and need another old school jrpg to binge this game is it 

world building combat exploration lore character building this game has it all plus a dope sound track im not a big puzzle guy but this game is constantly throwing little puzzles at you to continue to exploring and i get them fairly easily with common sense and trial and error and it feels rewarding every time cause you unlock somewhere new you really want to explore

im only 5 hours in mind you but im having a really hard time putting it down runs awesome on steam deck to and since the save files transfer i can play on my tv until my lady is looking to use it and then keep playing while she watches whatever 

you definitely wont be disappointed

#####

i am really into this game despite being only at around 13 of my progress

to begin with i like the game art the style is consistent across different maps yet a region has its own special landmarks and texture i never grow tired of exploring the town or delving deep into the forest

for the game content there are simply too many aspects to praise the combat system offers a plethora of choices and requires enough strategy to keep me engaged the exploration part consists of some fantastic puzzles and mechanism i can even gain an advantage by ambushing enemies from behind creating a perfect synergy between exploration and combat whenever im tired of the enemy mechanisms im always greeted by something new whether it is a new type of monster a new skill or a new minigame the game maintains a smooth flow that allows me to revisit previously missed collectibles without losing sight of my main goal

the character stories are welltold even though it follows the classic herosavingtheworld plot it delves into the reasons behind our actions in a narrative way

i really liked how the game does balancing  especially when the balancing has something to do with the story no spoilers at one point an event summoned numerous formidable monsters with unique weaknesses this event prompted me to completely revamp my combat strategy and the story seamlessly supported these changes on top of that all these are supported by the story seamlessly the bossfights also feel special and grand

very retro and compact to wrap up ive been longing for an indie quality rpg game and i think i found my answer in sos

#####

having enjoyed sabotage studios previous effort ithe messengeri i was looking forward to seeing their take on a snesera jrpg 

however while the art in isea of starsi undoubtedly excels very little else does and overall i found it to be a thoroughly underwhelming experience 

h3writingh3
the biggest letdown is the writing  it rarely rises above incoherent nonsense and the motivations of certain villains were poorly explained the story is needlessly convoluted and the conclusion felt anticlimactic and unsatisfying its a shame the writers didnt settle for merely telling a simple story well in line with many of this games inspirations

its a warning sign of things to come when the game transitions to an awkward and mindnumbingly dull flashback scene moments into the action

on the character side  the two leads are so bland and interchangeable that i had difficulty remembering their names and the game instead relies on the player becoming invested in garl whose constant effervescence wore thin on me quickly this led to various plot developments and key moments falling completely flat

the pirate group you encounter after a few hours deserve special mention  i cringed every time they appeared on screen yolande in particular seriously tested my resolve to continue with the game

h3gameplay  combath3
the combat takes its cues from the mariorpg games involving timed button presses for attack and defence while its initially interesting and engaging it quickly loses its appeal it never evolves beyond the first couple of hours of gameplay with each character being limited to a small number of skills and no significant customisation options available i never felt as if my characters were growing in power and combat in the final dungeon felt essentially the same as combat in the opening areas of the game

the lock system for enemy spell casting further restricts player choice by funneling you into using the correct skill the seemingly random nature of it can lead to situations where it is nearimpossible to break the lock and interrupt the spell

additionally all of the combat animations are very drawn out to allow for user input which causes even the most trivial of fights to drag on for far longer than necessary i found as the game wore on i would often select moves with the shortest animations and least amount of input required in order to progress as quickly as possible

theres some very basic puzzle solving but it never progresses beyond pushing a few blocks and usually just serves to waste more of your time

isea of starsi is not a particularly difficult game unless you choose to engage with the optional relic system strangely some of the fights with regular mobs can prove more challenging than boss fights due in part to the mentioned lock system as you can end up with all mobs casting a spell at once

lastly some minor nitpicks  you cant skip or fastforward dialogue and you can only save at designated save points  which might be an inconvenience if youre not playing on a steam deck

h3musich3
i also found the music to be rather lacklustre despite yasunori mitsudas much trumpeted involvement this was especially disappointing as i thought the soundtrack was a real strength of ithe messengeri 

while technically sound isea of starsi soundtrack was mostly bland with few memorable melodies and mitsudas contribution was limited to around 10 tracks admittedly amongst the osts highlights

some of the tracks felt illfitting for the setting or the mood of various scenes also

h3final thoughtsh3
i managed to persevere with isea of starsi to achieve the normal ending but had absolutely no appetite to continue to the true ending especially as it requires a tedious hunt for conch shells

isea of starsi apes a lot of the look and feel of classic jrpgs but comes up short in many departments and ended up feeling strangely lacking and dare i say soulless

much of the prerelease marketing revolved around how this game was inspired by chrono trigger and frankly i spent most of my game time thinking about how id rather be playing that instead

rating 510

#####

best of several old school rpg mecanics mixed in one
great story great gameplay definetly will be an all time classic

#####

the game wont be goty but it is indeed a gem that needs to be played if you like the genre
it has flaws like lacking some satisfying character progression but at least you dont have to grind enemies for hours to progress the game
the characters arent mind blowing but in the end i didnt expect much character development from some childrens that lived in a tower for 10 years and had to save the world
still the game throws at you tons of lore and sometimes it even subvert your expectations
it gains a lot by having played the previous game of the same developer the messanger so i recommend you to play that first because its not the same the other way around
play until the end complete it
and please remove nostalgia goggles when pairing this game with the likes of chrono trigger


#####

only 2 hours in and all i can say is this game is ridiculously good so far cant say too much about it other than ive never seen such a gorgeous game with pixel art

edit  19 hours in and holy shitthis story seemed so predictable at first but goddamnlets just say if you ever make it to where you understand what sea of stars meansyou know exactly what im talking about that shit was such a good twist and the animation of that moment left me smiling and jaw dropped at the same timethis game is a blast you dont get a crazy amount of abilities at allbut the fights are pretty much puzzles it seems with some strategy mixed it its very different but fun this story thoughit just did a complete 180 to what i expected props to the devs also a small but very appreciated detail the main home screen changes based on where youre at in the story

#####

this game starts off with an amazing art design some great music and a fresh take on the chrono trigger style combat however the combat will quickly overstay its welcome as it is about 90 of the gameplay and it never really innovates in a way that keeps it fresh there is very little else here to relieve the built up resentment over how absolutely annoying the combat is the story is compelling when it exists but it does not exist enough to carry this experience the wheels minigame is similarly frustrating and time consuming as the ai will always have some gimmick that forces you to play one specific way

there are a lot of positives with what they tried to do but i feel like they failed to make it a good experience overall i would only recommend this to people who have a high tolerance for the mundane

#####

80 hoursall achievements and im still utterly unable to chain serais ivenom flurryi

#####

a visually amazing game that is let down by its mediocre combatbosses and lacklustre story

#####

love it love it love it

#####

this game is truly a masterpiece

the dialogue is fantastic the characters are funny and relatable the graphics are retro and wonderfully done the combat is comprehensive yet simple

theres not much bad i can say about this game ive encountered one glitch and its purely a visual one and did no harm

if you enjoy turnbased games like final fantasy or magical starsign amazing hidden gem of a game youll love this game too 3

#####

no 
goes to show you how little you can rely on reviewers and influencersthe masses are rarely right

yes the game looks great
yes the ost is brilliant even if you dont like the particular tracks the production quality and mixing is wonderfull

but thats about where the ups end

theres little in the form of character or progressionmechanics this is one of the best examples why i think complexety is a must have for every rpg beeing it jrpg crpg or whateverthefckrpg you level up and can chose between 4 different additional boni next to your stats automaticaly increasing then theres a tiny and i do mean tiny equipment systemand thats about all there is you get relics but frankly most of em are downright cheatsenabling and thats kinda how they are implemented accessability options for people who just want to go through the pretty enviroments 
rpgs need some mechanics to play around with the more the better heck even soulslikes need some sort of character building minmaxing etc  what sea of stars offers is just to little to keep you from getting bored 

then theres the combat that got so much praise i find it horrid imagine playing a game like chronotrigger but ever mob every encounter every action needs you to sekiroparryand im not beeing dramatic then theres enemies having castturns the only way to break these turns is by using specific attacks kinda like a qte especialy when you think about the timed buttonpresses for attacks the game hints early on that all of this is optional which is utter nonesene unless you are using the accessability options all these sekiromechanics are mandatory this grew old very fast 
enemies also only respawn on loading a save file or completely leaving an area loading screen which makes grinding just annyoin theres a rest mechanic camp which probably should just respawn mobsbut again the game is mechanicaly so bereft of depth that it doesnt realy matter its a qtecombat systemand im realy not a fan

the characters and story are okay these elements are always subjective but i found em enjoy and servicable

but the most important thing about a game is the actual gameplayand this is sadly where sea of stars completely falls apart for me personaly and why i cannot recommend this game unless you want to hit the cheats and just run through the game once

in a day and age with games like dragon quest 11 or tales of arise most of these gimmicky 2dnostalgia clones just forget to put in interesting mechanics and character buildingwhich is just sad 

a real progression minmax or character building system and a more classical corecombat gameplay and this game couldve been a banger but it is definitly not

#####

so far sabotage is 2 for 2 in knocking it out of the park they really understand the classics and how to approve upon the formula i cant wait to see what more is to come this is definitely a company to watch

#####

sea of stars is constantly compared to the best snes rpgs and that was its main selling point for me but if thats whats drawing you to it too in my opinion its missing what made those games so great a compelling story

all those snes rpgs had something exciting happen at the beginning to grab the players attention and then established clear motivations for the characters soon afterward for example

 in super mario rpg the game starts with a giant sword slicing into bowsers castle exciting and then sets you on a quest to find the star pieces that sword sent flying clear
 in chrono trigger the game starts with a time travel experiment gone wrong exciting and then you have to find a way back to your own time period clear

but in sea of stars the game starts with a very extended tutorial a fairly generic fantasy world and three samey feeling main characters nothing exciting

after many hours into the game i got bored and gave up i didnt know why i was on this adventure with these characters  their goalsmotivations beyond eventually defeat a bad guy i know nothing about were missing the game constantly alluded to there being other mysterious things happening in the world and maybe they do eventually make sense but i was not invested enough to want to find out

if youre wondering if you should buy this game id say if youre looking for eye candy then you will enjoy it the games aesthetic is beautiful 

however if you loved snes rpgs because of the cool things that happened in them and the unique characters that had compelling stories behind them then you might want to look elsewhere

#####

i knew sea of stars would be good after playing some of the demo but playing it in full is an experience like no other this game is a gem so do yourself a favour in playing it and experience all it has to offer

#####

im an old school rpg player ive played games such as breath of fire  final fantasy and some other japanese rpgs from back in the day 

im in owner of a steam deck and so this game type fits well with my business travels and it looks absolutely stunning on the steam deck works really well at 60 frames per second battery life lasts about 3hrs

im halfway into the game now and im enjoying a lot its a lot of fun the character development is very impressive even the npcs this game has a lot of similarities to breath of fire including the game sound music and map design all reminds me of old school breath of fire 4 im certain its definitely been built based on bof the story although good im going to wait till i finish the game completely before i update the review of the story aspect of this game further

overall this game is a musthave for anybody who is new to rpg or played older rpgs or if you just have a steam deck and want something thats easy to pick up and put down at any time while enjoying a good story fun gameplay and good art

big thanks to developers for creating something that reminds me of my childhood

only feedback i have is that id love to see more of those cartoon cut scenes those are really good would be great to see more of that in sea of stars 2 or a dlc

#####

i need to know which person at sabotage is selfinserting themselves as garl i have played so many rpgs in my life and i cannot remember the last time that i groaned audibly whenever a character opened their mouth which because they really clearly want garl to be the main character is all the time there is no journey of selfdiscovery there is no character growth in response to the events of the game there is no learning from the consequences of ones actions there is only garl and what a best boy he is what a chum what a pal 

ill give credit where credit is due the visuals are great lots of very nice little animations abound and that takes work and time i had been telling people the music was good too but as i write this review i realize thats a lie i cant remember a single track from a single area its competently made chiptune music which dances into one ear and out of the other and that leads in to what this game lacks soul it is paint by numbers stay safe between the lines chrono trigger grips you within 30 minutes with its possibilities as you slide through that first gate into the past ff6 paints a moody haunting march through the snowfields while the credits roll super mario rpg turns its formula on its head from the very first encounter this copies the form of classics without comprehending what made them into classics 

combat isfine i dont know i just usually want it to be over with because options are so limited and so are upgrades dungeons look okay but are fairly linear the minigames range from me not grasping why theyre there fishing to actively hating the content wheels 

i just dont know how something that i really thought was going to be a great blt turned into a sad slice of bologna between two slices of white bread i dont know why they wanted to write more lines for garl 

my last gripe is this in so many games people face the consequences of what theyve done and they grow from it it can be a major mistake that leads to catastrophe or something small that hurts the people around them sea of stars has opportunities for this and flatly refuses them every time because that would require character growth or lines for someone who is not garl just go play chrono trigger or chained echoes or lisa or something i dont know the world is your oyster for rpgs right now

#####

i cant say that ive played a lot of retro rpgs in my time but as someone who liked super mario rpg i thoroughly enjoyed this game the music is great the characters are loveable and the story kept me interested i highly recommend playing as much as you can without the help of relics that make combat easier aside from the one that makes the visual feedback of successfully timed inputs more clear this is because i found the level of difficulty really engaging and fair timed inputs are one of my favorite mechanics to spice up turnbased games and im glad that sea of stars leans so heavily into it

my only complaints are that the game says that timed inputs should be seen as extra when in reality they feel kind of mandatory if you want a real fighting chance this as well as backtracking being a massive pain for some areas to collect all the things necessary to get the alternate ending after completing the game once

#####

ive been looking forward to this game for over a year as a long time jrpg fan who just finished trails in the sky trilogy i was pumped to start a new adventure but if i had to be honest this is one of the most boring games ive ever played it fails to live up to its inspirations and also to stand on its own

dont get me wrong the pixel art is god tier the music is stellar the fight system is simple but enjoyable however the game failed to grab me simply because i couldnt care less about anything happening part of it falls on dungeons being too simple but most of the blame is the fault of the characters

most of the cast is just simply boring at the current point i have 5 characters in my party and 4 of them are just stoic theres nothing wrong with this archetype if balanced by other members of your party but having 4 of 5 be these emotionless husks with no distinct personality just drags the whole script down of course the fifth member garl is the favourite of almost every reviewer ive seen makes sense since hes the only one who shows any emotion he has all the funny lines while everyone else just kinda stands there he has an interesting journey while everyone is ooo mysterious backstory may happen after 10 hours and yet it still didnt happen im 70  through the game and know almost nothing about the personalities of my party i could not for the life of me tell you more than a sentence or two about most of the cast

the game fails to properly introduce or build up any characters its hard to grasp their motivations when many of the decisions the cast makes are just baffling a character may switch sides to evil because they want to feel free and not be ordered by people around them so they join a faction with a clear intent to destroy the world and consume all its citizens who are just evil guys being evil because they are evil yes im sure youll live your best life when youre dead i cant even call most of these characters stereotypical because they mostly make absolutely bonkers decision once in a while and its impossible to get a grasp on what they actually want

now im writing this review 16 hours in and ive not seen the credits some of my problems may be solved by the end but then again im 16 hours in and i could not possibly care less what happens the game should already make me invested by this point i keep pushing through trying to find something to enjoy but all i keep getting is a basic rpg with nice pixel art and music being dragged down by the script

the wheels minigame is fun at least

#####

going to start this review by saying i loved their previous game the messenger and thats what made me buy this game on release

h1combath1
its heavily based on qtequick time event do you want to hit for more damage then press a just as your character hits the enemy do you want to block some of the damage then press a just as your character is about to get hit 
i hate this mechanic but the game is clearly designed around it and makes the game annoying
all of the characters have the same attacks there is no variation in their normal attacks kinda wished you would get more normal attacks or a special attack that you can learn 
the only things i have encountered so far are new combos

the combos are ok but most of the time you dont get a chance to use them since the build up is so slow you might not see a level 2 combo for multiple battles

i dont like the special attacks monsters do with some its impossible to break their attacks had a monster one time that required 3 slash damage on a 2 turn cooldown while my guy could only do 2 slash damage and that is if i managed to correctly time the qte attack this mechanic is a bad joke

h1story and dialogueh1
the story of the messenger was a breath of fresh air it was the perfect mix of twists jokes and good well written story this game on the other hand is boring and uninspired im almost at the half of the game and im bored out of my mind
the dialogue is a perfect way of having a lot of text on the screen but saying very little  a good example is meeting up with the joke of a pirate squad they talk and talk without progressing the story that much 

h1character progressionh1
the progression is limited you get some choices when leveling up 1 to mana 8 to life 2 to attack 3 to defense boring way of improving your character


the game is gorgeous and the pixel art is well done but unfortunately that cant be the only good thing about the game it saddens me that im not enjoying this as much as i enjoyed the messenger that game was a 1010
came into this game thinking i will get something similar to the messenger but got literally nothing that made that game great
at this point i will have to force myself to finish the game since i bought it at a release price tag

do i recommend this game at full price or the 10 discount at launch this is a big no from me do i recommend it at a 4050 sale yeah maybe just keep in mind this is nothing like the well written and fun game that was the messenger

#####

enjoyable game i like the ambient music some of it is very excellent and adds to the experience the fighting mechanics can be a bit dull early in the game but it does get a lot better as you gain more characters and skills and combos the fighting can be easy at times but i find it the right level of challenge most of the time where you get to have a good relaxing experience playing this game i also enjoy the colourful graphics its just pleasant to look at and exploring in this game is a beautiful experience

#####

a love letter to classic snesera jrpgs

great artstyle  animations the combat system is insanely fun and the soundtrack is just so so good the boss theme alone made me get this game

it runs perfect has unlocked fps and is very polished you can really feel that they put a lot of work and heart into it definitely looking forward to the devs next project

insta buy if youre a fan of games like chrono trigger ff6 lufia breath of fire etc

#####

a little bit of crying a little bit of vengeance i was late to work every day for the first week i started playing this
1010

#####

i really want to like this game the art style is beautiful and hooked me from the very beginning the music can also be great unfortunately so far i feel like thats all i can say positive about it i believe ill try and finish it still but this is my review 10 hours in

1 story isnt great not bad but pretty uninteresting dialog is really weird a lot of grammar issues it also tries to be too quirky lack of a better term and i feel like it never lands one character tries to be funny and break the fourth wall with every comment and i cringe every time they talk

2 combat feels very boringuninteresting i dont use any relics so i have nothing on to make the game easier combat feels very repetitive and way too easy im not the greatest rpg player at all but it seems every boss fight takes little to no effort combat just feels like spamming the same abilities theres also so many qte events which just are press a so with combat already being boring a lot of the abilities you have you just spam the a button if youre using a controller the moonarang ability seemed awesome when i first got it but after using it for the 500th time im tired of it  

3 all the characters are bland no one has hooked me no one feels interesting i like the idea of all the main party members you can use but 10 hours in and nothing has really happened with them only one im interested in is serai everyone just feels was to one note i was excited to play as valare but i feel like she and zane is pretty much just adventure yay so far

i want to like this game its beautiful and it reminds me of gaming as a kid however i feel like thats the only reason ive even put 10 hours into this game so far without the nostalgia i feel like there wouldnt be enough there to make me play for even 10 hours

#####

no idea why this has good reviews its a very shallow game its only cute visuals totally regret purchasing and hoping the game gets better the entire time ive been playing it this game is a fraction of the older games this took inspiration from ive played all old rpgs and most modern ones like literally all of them zero world development and character development combat system is boring and yet requires your actions the entire time making it feel extremely tedious and not strategic just annoying items dont really exist your reward for exploring  heres a fcking shell to add to your shell collection that you cant use for the entire duration of the game this is so forgettable and i resent buying and trying to like it so much

#####

not much to say that others wont say better so ill keep it short music an absolute pleasure to hear combat is excellent and fluid and presents the right amount of challenge visuals are a beauty to behold in all their nostalgic pixelated glory writing is great too and characters feel lively in and out of combat no small part due to the lovely animations constantly at work cannot say too much for story but it seems to be pretty straightforward and so far has been fun to follow our main characters fans of classic turnbased rpgs will feel right at home definitely a dev team that understood the assignment and went above and beyond

#####

absolutely stellar game so far art and music direction is distinct and spot on takes the best points from mario and luigi series and combines it with chrono trigger as a love letter to rpgs in general clearly a lot of love and care has been put into this game and it shows 
would absolutely reccommend

#####

1010 game of the year

has a fishing mini game

#####

nobody reads steam reviews so ill just say it

this game is awesome

there it is peace

#####

final fantasy  other turnbased rpgs usually arent my thing but i found myself not wanting sea of stars to end it does a bunch of small things right which when combined with a beautiful pixel art style  intriguing plot make it my favorite rpg in a very long time

having normal attacks restore mp  an autorevive mechanic takes away a bunch of stress that id normally feel while playing rpgs youre rewarded for timing blocks and attacks helping the boring nature of turnbased combat the lock system is both genius and stupid with the right setup you can ensure you always stop one enemy from using their special attacks i swear i permalocked the last boss out of all its spells

sea of stars isnt too difficult and is aimed at casuals theres tons of in game relics that let you make the game even easier such as autohealing after battle regardless its an enjoyable memorable ride

#####

enjoy 90s rpgs enjoy chrono trigger enjoy secret of mana enjoy super mario rpg legend of the seven stars if yes to any of these get this game
if you said yes to all of these youve probably already got this game

#####

i enjoyed some parts of the game but overall i cant recommend it at 35 20 maybe ill just repeat whats been stated by the minority that its an average game in many aspects  outside of the artistic style and a few soundtracks this game has very little going for it to keep you coming back unless you like being repeatedly interrupted by dialogue of no substance

#####

wow what an incredible journey this game is up there with the classics for sure the setting characters and lore are all pleasantly original and bring forth that sense of wonder achieved when diving into fantasy with plenty of secrets and side quests this game is an absolute joy to play

#####

one of the best rpgs ive played in recent memory not only that but i really think it jumps into my top 3top 5 favorite rpgs of all time the story is fantastic something that i havent really said about most games ive played in the past few years i really enjoyed the characters and the writing gameplay was phenomenal  absolutely engaging battle system was fun and flexible i really cant recommend this game enough


#####

combat outside bosses gets really repetitive after few hours and story doesnt really keep up the grip to continue further amazing bosses art and music though 

#####

has fishing

#####

let me start by saying that this game isnt terrible id put it in the its okayish camp the very positive rating at the moment of this writing makes it look like a modern classic though which could not be further from the truth 

the best part about the game is the art backgrounds sprites animation its gorgeous to look at its one of the most beautiful 2d games ive seen to date they also put a lot of effort into making navigating and exploring the dungeons interesting in the end you are still walking a linear path though from a to b even if you hop over some chasms and climb a few vines during the process there are also puzzles i like puzzles in jrpgs none are hard enough that i ever needed to consult a guide so they are more like diversions than obstacles

to summarize the experience you could call this style over substance  the jrpg unfortunately nothing besides the art is really great and some of it is downright bad 

the combat is a mix of timing minigames like super mario rpg and choosing the right attacks to stop enemies from using their big attacks timing based minigames are a way to not make you fall asleep during random encounters but some players find them annoying i dont hate them but many attacks have their own mechanics and often its not super clear how the mechanic works exactly by the end youll have quite a bit to memorizepractice too but its ok since mostly youll stick to the same 3 skills from the beginning anyways the chosing the right element part is another staple of jrpgs and like most times its just simon says at least what elements are needed is clearly telegraphed otherwise the combat is not too hard and not too easy either it was okay some animations albeit beautiful take forever though so battles never go fast 

you can freely explore most of the world after about half the game but there is nothing to find except for a slot machine like minigame there are no side quests worth mentioning you always just walk from dungeon to dungeon to whereever the game tells you to i got tired from the dungeon delving and wished for breaks from it interesting storylines side quests or optional paths with rewards could have provided that but the game railroads you ever forward from dungeon to dungeon

the characters are bad and except for one sidekick who the developers clearly wanted to be the actual main character they have basically no personality the two main characters speak so they arent silent protagonists but they dont have any more depth than chrono 

the lore of the game world might be interesting but we only get to see a fragment of it and not enough for any of it to really make sense 

the story suffers from that and the lack of characterization as you wont care about most events are happening and the villians motivations are nebulous or poor there is a big surprise in the middle but its not really putting a twist on your quest and there is never a big payoff to it in the end the end in overall is a whimper there is a true ending but i didnt bother i dont feel like wasting another 3 hours or so for another battle and one extra cutscene 

so overall i cant recommend the game if you want to play a 2d jrpg in 2023 play chained echoes instead

#####

i wasnt effusive enough in my praise of this game it is an absolute delight to play fun characters great art and puzzles that are actually interesting without holding up your progress for very long do yourself a favor and play it you wont be sorry

#####

the game starts off great the sense of adventure is there the visuals are pretty enough but the music keeps repeating itself the combat is bland you only get 2 skills at a time and it feels like the story just drags itself on and on the 2 main characters are boring i wish i wouldve enjoyed this game

#####

one of the coolest looking and feeling pixel turnbased rpgs

#####

so far really good the art is nostalgic and the animation is beautiful the combat offers more interactivity than most turn based rpgs and feels satisfying to play

#####

a fantastic jrpg
takes a lot of inspiration from the greats and is all the better for it
the plot is interesting and liked how it ended
the gameplay is pretty solid but get a bit boring near the end
especially loved the quality of life improvements it bought
there is lot of optional stuff
highly recommended if you like the genre

#####

this is a good game that doesnt just want to feel familiar to fans of the genre but strives to be the genres new outstanding exemplary of how to innovate while still respecting the reason why games like this still excite so many people i cannot think of a single thing id rather change here every frame is an art piece every second fighting is engaging every new location is memorable 
and i am not sad that this journey is over because i know that sabotage will keep making games that make me feel just like sea of stars did

#####

if you view my steam reviews youll see that all of them say this happened to my buddy eric i put this because i dont usually have much to say about games i likedislike but im going back to edit this review because i just finished my playthrough and oh my god this game is phenomenal tldr as someone who went into it on the fence this game blew me away absolutely play it you will not be sorry

no spoilers

combat
i normally hate turn based combat i normally think its the most draining unrealistic and boring way to do combat but this game has made it incredibly engaging and satisfying it got a little redundant at times when i just wanted to reach the next part but it isnt a huge glaring issue that made me want to turn off the game i still thoroughly enjoyed myself even in those very minuscule times of discomfort the times where i felt like i was getting screwed over i just changed the way i approached things until i found what worked and as a big fromsoftwaresoulsborne fan i really appreciated the ability to do that a lot its simple on the surface and it can be if you choose to play that way but the game also gives you that freedom to play more in depth if you want to

story
the same as turn based combat i also hate games i have to read everything in but every time dialogue started i couldnt help but be sucked in the story is so well thought out with so many layers to it so many twists i never saw coming so many times i thought the game was going to end just for it to keep going and im so glad it did because there wasnt a single point in this game where i felt bored or like things were dragging on or that there was just unnecessary padding everything had a purpose and each component executed that purpose perfectly the plot is heavy the lore is deep the characters are lovable and distinct from one another theres happiness heartbreak hopelessness love triumph malice you name it such a perfect blend of emotions that by the end i wasnt entirely sure how to feel but i mean that in the best way

graphics
the graphics are absolutely beautiful and its actually what drew me to this game to begin with the general way things look is already very good but wait until you see some of the ultimate attacks or some of the environments this game takes you to its not very often ill stop to take a minute to just appreciate how beautiful a game looks but i did that several times from beginning to end

soundtrack
the music in this game is so versatile the combat music gets you hyped the down time music makes you feel relaxed safe even some areas the music writing will stay the same but the production elements will change as you switch from day to night above water to underwater explore new areas etc its such a small detail but it adds sooo much extra depth that i think the game wouldnt feel the same without and as a songwriterproducer myself i think its incredibly creative and ambitious to go that extra mile when i think people would have been content with just one consistent set of songs that tells me that the devs were passionate about this game which is awesome

overview
ill admit i was skeptical at first because a lot of what this game has im not normally the demographic for but let that fact be a testament to how good this game is its a well thought out experience with so much life to it and it is 100 worth your time whether you enjoy these types of games or not i urge you to give it a chance the demo only gives you a crumb of what this game has to offer i would 100 help fund a sequel i gotta see what happens next 1010

#####

normal ending achieved didnt particularly feel like going through the rigmarole for the true ending sorry

its pros and cons with this one there are genuine high points but overall the game is kind of like eating a bag of jellybeans where every 10th jellybean is mouthwash flavoured its mostly pretty enjoyable but its very easy to find fault with

the main mouthwash jellybean most frequently consumed is that the two leads are just so so boring and bog the entire game down with their intense blandness that plus some incredible contrivances made it basically impossible for me to become emotionally invested it becomes inescapably obvious that the world revolves around the players experience there is no sense that this is a real world that i should care about and so i largely fail to become invested like yes i know video games by definition revolve around the players experience but other rpgs do a much more convincing job of giving the impression of a livedin space sabotages games have this bad habit of getting bored with their own story and lampshading their own tropes in doing so simply just coming off as insecure and puncturing whatever immersion mightve been possible

but the game is immaculately rendered the musics really good and it showcases a clear understanding of its primary inspirations chrono trigger strongest element pacing its a very snappy game it flows well this by itself was strong enough to carry me through a 20 hour game which has to count for something i dont finish 20 hour games if im not kinda into it there are some true high points where it reaches for some spectacle or emotional moment and while it kind of struggles to really make the latter type land as hard as it could theyre still high points of the experience

sea of stars overall is a decent endeavour it expresses a clear love for classic jrpgs and its artistic sensibility is second to very few but what it primarily lacks cornily enough is heart enough that would enable it to reach the level of the classics it venerates i think there is more good than bad here so i land squarely on recommendation it aims for the moon and misses but at least it hits a few stars on the way down before ultimately concussing itself


#####

this game is made with so much passion id find it hard to believe if you dont experience love at first sight with sea of stars a simple but epic story easy to grasp but layered combat incredibly charming characters and a slight sense of  messenger humor that helped make that game as fun and charming as it was i may not be very far into sea of stars but as of now im having so much fun with it will probably land in my top three favorite indie games right behind the messenger also developed by sabotage and papers please so far it has met my extremely high expectations and hype that i let build up for 23 4 idk whenever the steam page first went up years do yourself a favor and purchase this game immediately especially if youre a fan of jrpgs sabotage is two for two and i hope to support and play their games for years to come 




#####

this is an excellent rpg i had a lot of fun playing this game would definitely recommend if this is a genre you like as it is a highquality addition to the genre 

pros 
1 amazing artwork
2 great soundtrack 
3 incredibly smooth gameplay from combat to movement it felt very polished one of the biggest pluses for me 
4 the story absolutely loved the finale especially 

cons 
1 the middle of the game 1520 hours in got super grindy for me
2 combat doesnt really evolve throughout game some new party members and combos but the grind feel came from same combat mechanics being used in new areas against new enemies repeatedly as others have said combat from the tutorial to final boss remains the same 

overall still absolutely worth it and the payoff at the end for me was more than enough to justify the middle of the game turning into a grind definitely check this one out

#####

this game is awesome

#####

nice ct vibes but doesnt quite reach the same heights obviously

#####

for anyone like me who used to be a huge fan of the golden sun games this right here is a must play good boss fights good story good level design good dose of nostalgia this has it all

#####

stunning arts and graphics visually one of the best indie games ive seen some mechanics in this game are quite nice platforming in this game is wonderful

however the story is dreadful i have not seen a more boring main character duo combat is interesting for first 3 hours but quickly grows dull each character only has 3 skills no skill unlocking or upgrades gear upgrades simply increase stats 


#####

do you remember how you felt the first time you played through chrono trigger

did you enjoy solving environment puzzles in zelda games not the water temple f that place

did you ogle the art style of illusion of gaia and laugh at the tongueincheek selfawareness of secret of evermore

ive been chasing those highs since the 90s and this game is about as close as ive ever gotten to that bfirsttimeb feeling of a playthrough

sea of stars was kickstarted as a love letter to classic rpgs of the 90s

it feels familiar and brand new at the same time

traversal of the world feels really good and only improves as you go

puzzles are pleasantly challenging but never frustratingly so 
im looking at you water temple

you have a lot of choice in how you level your characters

each characters abilities feel unique and useful if not outright epic

you can pick ingredients and choose what food to make for healingmp items or you can just sell all of the ingredients and buy whatever items you want precooked when theyre available 

there are fishing and battler minigames that are fun to learn and master 

spoileryou can swap party members in combat spoiler

you can perform timed attacks and blocks for bonus damage or damage reduction

its as if they took your favorite games from the 90s and gently lovingly massaged in quality of life improvements and all of the fun unique aspects of other games that have come before and since

enhancing replayability is the bastionhades style toggles in the form of relics
want to make the game extra smooth or are you dying a lot theres a relic for that
do you want bad guys to hit harder or take less damage theres a relic for that
are you a completionist like me who wants to find every treasure in the game 
theres a relic for that
are you a tryhard who deletes their save file when they die seek professional help 
theres also a new game  feature which im also super excited about trying after i finish my first playthrough

to the best of my knowledge you cant permanently miss anything in the game 
most items are fairly straightforward to find so far no digging in unlit corners of the map to find some hidden item for later

if you listen to the soundtracks of final fantasy games in the car and at the gymor wherever
this soundtrack will be on your rotation 

i kickstarted the game and was a bit hesitant to buy the vinyl without hearing any of it 
now im super excited to get mine 

for the snarky negative reviewers i dont know who hurt you but unfortunately the one thing this game cant do is heal whatever childhood trauma made you unable to have fun and enjoy something like a wideeyed kid again
like i said this is like playing chrono trigger or similar again for the first time 
inject that shit into my veins 
do you understand how hard that is to pull off without being just a fullon clone 
its a razors edge edgelord

meanwhile ill be over here crisscross apple sauce on the carpet gaming until four in the morning when they have to call a paramedic to get me up off the floor because im old and cant get back up  
 
if my nieces and nephew dont play the original chrono trigger secret of mana secret of evermore a link to the past etc i would be just as happy if this was their it game for them 
i will be introducing them to it as soon as theyre old enough to hold a controller they will be solstice warriors

this game is hard to recommend some concerns i see get pointed out often but are valid criticism
for one the pacing of the game is insanely poor people will defend it by saying its trying to mimic story telling of older rpgs of that era this isnt true simply playing one of these older rpgs will debunk this statement immediately limited hardware had you compress the scope of the story just due to text taking up a lot of resources you had no choice but to get to the focal point of the story quickly
but despite the poor story telling in searsheh of stars it does actually pick up 15 hours in so if youre patient sure it does get interesting however the last 3 hours of the game becomes such a plot hole riddled mess it leads up to what is possibly the worst ending ive seen in anything

another complaint combat is slow while interesting at first youre notice that there isnt many abilities to play with seeing the same moves over and over again along with the same strategy it never evolves average completion time of his game is around 25 hours so get used to seeing moves like moonerang over and over and over and over and over
it got to the point where i was avoiding using special moves because of how much time they took up there were no issues doing this due to lack of challenge in the combat even with the dubious dare relic on which is the games hard mode everything felt painfully easy
another criticism on this is the animation which relates to the slow combat it isnt slow because of the special abilities alone but everything takes so long to hit this has more to do with the animation direction for this game older games of that era couldnt do much with the animation so they heavily relied on key frames to do all the work to demonstrate impact on their attacks but even on better hardware games like the breath of fire series did a good job to illustrate impact with attacks using little amount of frames as the saying goes less is more
unfortunately the animation principles dont apply here rather than working on improving their key frames and poses seems like the direction on fixing certain animations were just to add more frames the side effect of this is an overall much slower paced combat so for people who complained that the combat is too slow its an actual criticism faults rarely found in older rpgs

#####

im not super far into this game or anything didnt even manage to beat the first dwellerjust recruited serai despite this i just cant bring myself to keep playing
the characters are bland the story is mediocre and messy and the gameplay got stale about 2 hours in and isnt likely to get better going by the lack of new moves on the horizon or the weirdly designed combo system that almost doesnt allow for use of the combo moves outside of boss fights maybe more party members would improve on this but i doubt it 

the music is fantastic and the areas are wonderfully designed the waterfall area in particular is incredibly beautiful there are also some genuinely awesome animations for the characters not that it can salvage the writing of said characters but its still great the puzzles you do throughout are also pretty decent this sadly doesnt make up for the straight up bad combat system or the awful pacing of the story which is coupled with characters that dont really have much personality 

i really wanted to like this game having been excited for it ever since i heard that the makers of the messenger were making a turnbased rpg but what theyve presented is a gorgeous game with almost nothing else going on if you can stomach a battle system that practically never changes from hour 1 and dont mind a story that has nothing going on then id say go for it 





#####

i got all achievements thuroughly enjoyed this game killer soundtrack awesome art design really took me back to chrono trigger

#####

amazing game many aspects of this game feel unique havent seen that kind of battle very much i like the way leveling up works the story keeps getting better and better every chapter and the visuals and music are really great definitely recommend

#####

phenominal game 

there are minor tweaks that i could suggest but compared to the overall package theyre hardly worth mentioning the game runs great on every device ive run it on its stunningly beautiful to look at and listen to the gameplace is engaging in a way that most turn based rpgs fail to do the story is emotional a modern masterpiece 

this game is genuinally fantastic immediate cult classic static a love letter to jrpgs of old 

if youre at all interested in this type of game this is that nearly perfected and it should be tried by everyone

#####

gave me golden sun vibes the whole way through for some reason beautiful graphics dope story fun combat this is another great game from sabotage i recommend playing this and the messenger if you havent already

#####

a fun game with a story that takes a couple turns you might not expect and finds away to keep giving you reasons to be invested i have enjoyed my time with the game so far and its systems are deep enough to be fun but not so much that you get lost in them an rpg that is compared to the classics but could be considered to be a classic in its own right

well written straightforward fun that understands what it is doing and goes right in

h1summaryh1
i absolutely blovedb sabotage studios debut game ithe messengeri what started out as a humble nod towards the ninja gaiden series wound up being one of my favorite video games of all time so when i heard that the same team was working on a jrpg that was a humble nod towards chrono trigger i knew i was going to play it this title did not disappoint its a fantastic experience and i think everyone can find something to enjoy about this game

i loved isea of starsi not as much as i loved ithe messengeri but i still loved this game im in the unfortunate position of not being able to play this game without having played ithe messengeri because its possible i would have enjoyed this game a little more if it didnt have such big shoes to fill in my mind

h1the negativesh1
the pacing at the very beginning of the game was slow i know that this game borrows a lot of elements from classic jrpgs of the 90s but i think the team could have gone without the longform heavyhanded storytelling at the beginning of the game i was honestly worried when i first started playing the game that it was never going to pick up it was a solid two hours before i felt like i was done with the intro section and into the main gameplay loop fortunately once i got past that point the pacing is wonderfully crafted but that opening sequence is so long that i think it will hinder my enjoyment of future playthroughs

the second aspect that didnt quite do it for me was a minor quip i had about the story dont worry i wont be spoiling it at all its a disappointment because this studio has iveryi strong narrative writing specifically ill say that reshan one of the playable characters had an arc that i wasnt quite satisfied with his relationship to the main conflict and the rest of the characters never felt fully resolved again this is really more of a minor nitpick because reshan is still a lovable character however i think one of the strongest selling points for this game and for sabotage studios as a whole is the narrative writing so to see one character that doesnt feel as fleshed out as the others was a disappointment

h1the positivesh1
h2core gameplayh2
mechanically this game is obviously an homage to chrono trigger there are three things you do navigate the map explore towns and dungeons and engage in combat all of these elements are borrowed from existing classic jrpgs but they all have modern conveniences and twists that make them more engaging and fun especially when it comes to the combat overall the combat system was very well designed personally none of the combat encounters ever gave me too much trouble  i think i saw the gameover screen once in my first playthrough  but i wasnt playing isea of starsi for the difficulty

h2noteworthy combat mechanicsh2
 your entire party levels up instead of individual characters having their own experience points and levels this is nice because i always hated in classic jrpgs where one character in your party is lagging behind

 there are timingsensitive mechanics for even the most basic moves not an innovation unique to this game at all but it deserves praise because its executed very well and because it goes a long way towards making the combat feel like more than just navigating a menu

 you can only have three characters active at once but you can swap them whenever its your turn without using up one of your actions very convenient and it really makes you feel like the whole party is participating in every combat encounter

 every enemy in the game has at least one special move they can execute and you can interrupt each one by using a unique combination of attack types this is a fantastic twist that adds a whole new dimension of riskreward to combat which never got boring for me loved this mechanic

 theres a mechanic you unlock very early on called living mana which adds even more depth by allowing you to boost any physical attack or magic skill any character can generate living mana by executing a physical attack and any other character can make use of that living mana afterwards not only does it add more decision making into the combat but it also pairs nicely with the riskreward dynamic i mentioned using up all the living mana will give you one really powerful attack or let you heal a lot of health but it might make it impossible for you to break a devastating special move from your enemy

h2the art directionh2
its no secret that this game is pretty to look at but its not just aesthetically pleasing the art style borrows a lot from classic jrpgs without coming off as a ripoff or a cliche though a couple of the ingame characters make subtle jabs at the game being cliche  i appreciate the selfawareness but the game never felt cliche to me honestly the universe this game takes place in is unique every place i visited was memorable visually with their own unique color palates and styles the artists were also willing to experiment with modern lighting techniques in a few spots too without breaking the whole 16bit aesthetic the characters are all expressive and unique and the animations for the enemies especially the bosses are awesome the combat encounters almost look like a graceful dance is happening because of how cool the animations are

the sound design is also lovely the sound effects are recognizable useful and sometimes charming not only that but the whole soundscape of the game shifts as you explore different areas its something to behold well done

finally ill say that the music was wonderful it was nostalgic without being a ripoff of anything and it always fit the present gameplay element i particularly love the music that plays while sailing there are two different sailing themes and they both experiment with odd timesignatures i believe the earlygame sailing theme is in 94 and the late game sailingtheme is in 104 which isnt something you dont see in video games too often whoever made the soundtrack deserves a raise

h2the narrative writingh2
perhaps the strongest selling point of this game and all sabotage studios games up to this point is the narrative writing whoever is behind the writing has a profound love for storytelling that resonates with me the shopkeeper in the messenger inspired me with his stories and teaks from this game served the same role so much love and care went into the story of this game there were so many mysteries and exciting twists that kept me engaged and thirsty for more up until the very last moments each of the main playable characters were lovingly written they all had their own desires and personal struggles and i thought all of them had arcs which resolved nicely by the end except for reshan unfortunately  see the negative setction above

i cant say much more about the writing without spoiling the story and it really is a pleasure to experience for yourself so i recommend playing it suffice it to say that there were multiple times that i thought i had a pretty good understanding of where things were going each time this happened my expectations were blown out of the water as a new layer of depth was added to the overall conflict and characters i felt the same way about ithe messengeri so its nice to see that this is still a strongpoint for this team ithe messengeri had a pretty ambitious story and i feel like this game was even more ambitious in that regard and it paid off for me mostly


h1overall verdicth1
i give this game a solid 810 i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys indie games i dont think id rate it as highly as ithe messengeri which i believe i gave a 1010 but its still worth your time and money

#####

just finished the last achievement 56 hours not too bad

there are a lot of obvious inspirations from chrono trigger even a few brazen easter egg references the music is fantastic the art is a nice style the combat is very similar to ct in that it takes place on the same screen no loading to a different battle area there are dual techs and triple techs under a different name when you save it has a special flavor text depending on where you are in the story theres a new game mode very similar to ct where you keep your levels gear and inventory

ive only got 2 things against this game  its stingy with money which makes the first playthrough a little rough and you can never just button mash through combat you always have to be strategizing ways to prevent enemy attacks a lot of people say you shouldnt want to button mash through combat but sometimes youre backtracking and you run into an old enemy from 1992 and you just want to button mash  well you cant

but these 2 cons are minor i still enjoyed the game i still put 56 hours into the game i plan on finishing this ng run for sure its a great game

garl is my homie

#####

you did it you crazy son of a bitch you did it 
you captured and reproduced 90s jrpg magic
and i love you for it

#####

as a huge fan of the messenger i was already looking forward to this game for quite a while after playing through the game once i am left speechless the gameplay while revolving around the central exploring and fighting aspects is still very diverse and a fun experience on its own however considering the story and all the little details built into the game i can just say i have never seen or heard of anything like this

truly a worthy cousin of the messenger

#####

i cant say i have many original thoughts that have not been spoken already in the reviews but this game would be a 1010 if i cared about the main characters in the slightest they always agree upon everything theres no conflict between the two of them everything just happens to them as a pair

i didnt grow up with chrono trigger as a millennial but i did grow up with mario  luigi superstar saga which has a very similar play style if i may compare the two to strictly story id rather take completely silent italian plumbers over anything these two have to say really

i think fans of the glorious chrono trigger will be disappointed  but fans of mario  luigi might be in for a treat

that being said i thoroughly enjoy the gameplay the combat the puzzles wheels everything else i think that those aspects will help me to see the game through

810

played 20 hours on a different copy and decided to buy it on my account game took about 26 hours to get the true ending 

 music art direction and the visuals are genuinely breathtaking and doesnt let up throughout the entire game youll be wowed at every step
 combat is fun the concentrationbreaking mechanic had me thinking a bit in my opinion better than the regular turnbased combat you would expect of a jrpg but it does wear out after a dozen hours in the game  
 story is incredibly mediocre with an unsatisfying payoff for both endings a few plot threads get left hanging by then unless ive missed something it feels like theres no weight to the story 

spoiler spoiler
 characters feel samey main protagonists who only talk about stopping the main villain and garl is my best friend sidecharacters are justthere reshan was pretty cool though liked him  


sea of stars straddles the line between a recommend and notrecommend for me absolutely would be a good buy with a decent sale this feels like a game created by art directors and a good gameplay programmer you can tell the amount of effort they put into the visuals and sound design right from the beginning and i want to congratulate them for the incredible work theyve done its a shame they couldnt extend that into the writing of the game  

hr hr 
b some  notes regarding the story spoiler stuff will be marked as such b

list
 some things just show up without much explanation like the cloud kingdom giants which get absolutely no buildup and all of a sudden are really important maybe i missed some dialogue along the way but i feel like i was pretty thorough with talking to the npcs
 it feels like theres no weight to most of the events that happen in the story spoiler like when brisk gets destroyed everything just springs back like nothing happened spoiler spoiler garls death was probably the one sticking moment in the game for me but it wasnt particularly strong spoiler
spoilerthe true ending is almost the same as the regular ending and in my opinion a little worse in the latter god aephorul leaves after erlina gets defeated cause thats the rules fair enough in the former you save garl using timetravel and you use the power of friendship to fight god and dont even kill him after a pretty good boss fight his ego gets hurt and he sulks away into a portal in an animated cutscene dialogue is mostly the same for both endings and the epilogue adds a few more slidesspoiler  
spoiler erlinas and brugraves plotline isnt elaborated further which is a real disappointment theres even less conclusion to it in the true ending since you dont even challenge erlina again maybe i missed somethingspoiler
 the story isnt i bad i by any means it just feels really simple like it was a story in a jrpg of the 90s i understand that this game takes a lot of inspiration from those but there are some things you should be bringing to modern standards 
list

#####

spoiler free
47hrs at time of writing finished 99 minus an trophy that would probably require a new game

for anyone looking for a throwback and engaging fighting system regular and semichallenging puzzles with old schoonew school graphics to reminisce on the chrono triggersecret of mana era this is it
decent enough overall story emotional moments epic moments the feeling of your power growing and enemies different enough to challenge and keep you on your toes
no grinding necessary for gold or xp plenty of relics to smooth out difficulty or add to your challenge

id have to give a big 9510 round numbers are for rookies 
scratched the hell out of my itch for an old school rpg and i doubt itll do anything different for the fans of aforementioned games and others in that style plenty of optional content like a ton easy consumable crafting worth taking the 2 mins to use graphics and attacks make you feel good and powerful and very diverse

only knock for me is i wish characters had more single character skills 4 per but theres a ton of skills overall with crossskills combos as the game progresses

kudos to the team for creating game im psyched its as good as it is and hope youre all proud of your work cant wait for your next game

#####

fantastic game play lovely retro graphics and feel to the game good story and endearing charaters

a definite indie hit

#####

early impressions
i really liked the demo and stopped probably half way through it because it convinced me quickly that i wanted to play this the small vertical slice they give you felt more fun than any section ive done in the full game so far 4 hrs but thats probably by design
the beginning feels pretty slow they give you a couple battles at first with a few abilities and then take everything away and dump a bunch of story on you while you slowly unlock new things with very sparse combat encounters

the combat is really solid it feels a little similar to mario rpg snes youre constantly given sufficient choices to make to keep things interesting this game has timed hits and parries which i feel im absolutely awful at the game explicitly tells you the extra damagedefense you get for timing should be seen as a bonus and not required but thats just a gamer challenge of course i want to hit 100 of them some of the animations i just have no idea when the timing should be you can chalk most of the missed timings up to lack of repetition but a few of the enemy attacks even after seeing them quite a few times make me think i need to be a fighting game player to counter them you can enable one of the accessibility badges cheater items which you get early on to let you know when youve timed something successfully which i enabled but that doesnt help you identify when in the animation you should press the button

theres a lot of traversal including jumping climbing avoiding falling platforms and tightrope walking but all of it so far seems completely inconsequential like you cannot fail any of it so navigating the world is like some kind of simple pseudomaze i cant imagine this continues throughout the entire game that would be absurd

12hr impressions
updated combat thoughts above
the game feels like it hits its stride shortly after you get to wraith2nd island which is after the tutorial and first town
the music isnt blowing me away exactly but the battle track gets remixed when you get to the 2nd island and then gets unremixed during the 2nd islands dungeon i feel like this is a bug or an oversight but i dont know which is neat
the dungeon structure seems similar to various zelda games get a cool item half way through that lets you do cool stuff two things the game doesnt tell you about and are omitted from the tutorials during fishing if you release and press reel again while a fish is airborne it will stun the fish making it easier to reel in and if you run into a monsters backside precombat and press attack you gain the upper hand the 2nd islands dungeon will give you something that changes one of these aspects which i liked spoilera hookshot which lets you ambush an enemy from rangespoiler

ill add more impressions as i play but you should just try the demo if youre interested

the rest
sometimes you need to do timing combos for attacks but your character is off screen or hidden behind scenery
equipment is kinda boring its linear for the most part with nothing super interesting for the rings or amulet slots
this game really needs a training dummy theres attacks i still havent used and have no idea on the timed hit on because of that i still dont know the timing on garls nourish despite it being one of the earliest abilities you get
this game desperately needs a quest log it started to lose me after a 5 day break and beating the gorilla boss the map pointed to the wrong landmark the most recent quest item description had only a character name whos supposed to be ooo the mystery guy whom i forgot about and the way back to him wasnt trivial i had to google him to even get a hint of where to go absurd

#####

if you wanna relive the chrono trigger experience once more then you made a right choice with this one pal hop in and have a blast the games great for turnbased rpg fanatics like you and me the storys fly the pixel art graphics are an eye candy have fun with the game

#####

amazing game so far if you want to play something that improves on the 90s jrpgs then pick up this title

#####

sleeper hit of the year as soon as i started the game it took me back to the 90s early 2000s having those chrono trigger  golden sun vibes while playing is a phenomenal feeling turnbased combat which have always been my favourite too and the pixel art is spot on sea of stars is on its way to be my goty

#####

have been eagerly awaiting this games release since early in development well worth the wait its so so good

#####

amazing rpg in the style of chrono trigger game just oozes quality from the art to the animation to the music which even has the composer for chrono trigger on a few tracks remember when rpgs had minigames this game does and the game they cooked up in this game is a joy to play cant recommend this enough if you enjoyed rpgs back in the 16 bit days

#####

nicely done game worth spending the time on it 

#####

excellent experience combat got a bit repetitive but the art and feel of the game won me over

#####

extremely charming rpg with inspirations from the likes of chrono trigger and mario rpgs beautiful soundtrack pixel art and mechanics banger

#####

the game lacks complexity at all levels its a easy game but i did enjoy the casual gameplay the visuals of the game are really good the music is good but in game money is not really important a lack of weapon and armor variety the mini game is too easy it lacks the exploration vibe its very linear 

i see the effort put into this game if they come out with a 2nd one ill consider it but lots of improvements are needed i give it a 510 and appreciated the 18 hours i played it

#####

sea of stars is a fun and impressive jrpg ive seen criticisms of the writing and certain gameplay elements but these pertain mostly to the first half the writing is lowkey as the adventure ramps up until fully coming into its own after the events of mesa island that said what follows is genuinely impactful and moving and proves sea of stars is more than just a chrono trigger nostalgia project as for the gameplay while it true that each character only gets 3 skills plus ultimates in the lategame and especially postgame the mp and combo management sequencing and lock complexity are developed enough that the experience remains engaging throughout and the swap mechanic introduces choice fluidity that makes up for a limited skillset id love more skills sure but i was never bored by the number in the game and the varied timing on different attacks and blocks kept me engaged throughout the lock system is a novel approach to introducing player engagement to the turnbased combat formula and im excited to see how it can be further developed in the dlc the spiritual successor to chrono trigger was always an impossibly tall order to fill but its clear that sea of stars was made by people who loved chrono trigger as much as us the result is a very strong genre entry that not only satisfies oldschool jrpg fans starved for content but could very well turn the uninitiated into fans and send them back toward the classics

#####

quality game brimming with classic era jrpg nostalgia big chrono trigger vibes  gorgeous sprites  banger soundtrack engaging enough story  fun minigames  my only minor complaint is that combat feels a bit too easy even with challenging relics turned on i hardly ever lost a combat and save stations are almost too frequent  its easy to see how this could win indie goty   910  would sacrifice garls eye for adventure again

#####

beautiful graphics and sound design ok story and bad gameplay jrpgs and rpgs are my favorite kind of game btw

combat is very boring it does not develop or change at all and leveling is just increase stats new abilities dont change gameplay overall just the worst part of this game by far

the story seems ok when its happening the issue is the story happens for like 30 minutes then youre set for like 6 hours of what feels like side content the story also doesnt make sense certain characters behave in ways that just dont achieve the goals they say they have 

the game feels like it was made by artists and feels like it wasnt actually played from start to finish by a dev because its a slog and its slow i would love to see the rest of the story or explore the world without having to play abysmal rpg battles with 0 depth

character development doesnt exist btw go play chained echoes it has its faults but i actually had fun with that game even with its faults this game i did not enjoy and really tried to give it a good shot

#####

just finished the game i was not impressed the pixel art was gorgeous of course but thats about all it had going for it

i suppose its good if youre new to rpgs strange that they went with such a simple game when they are targeting people with nostalgia who are likely not new to rpgs

#####

peak fucking fiction 1010 
genuinly one of the best current jrpgs out there

#####

i recommend this game if you really enjoyed chrono trigger and super mario rpg the art style is quite beautiful and the music is right in the legendary status of all my old favorites the story is weak in areas feels either directionless at times or building up for a possible sequel hoping for a sequel the combat i felt was mostly enjoyable but would love to see more options on the playable characters i always kind of felt stuck having two powerful characters and one that is just sort of there taking up a move

overall i enjoyed my 30 plus hours in the game but plenty of room to build if sabotage goes for a sea of stars 2

#####

a very solid turn based game 

it is more simplistic compared to chained echoes the level up system here is pretty alright i initially thought we could hyper focus on a stat but its mostly just to set which stat you want earlier skills are kinda limited not much strategy at play here just mostly timing what skills you use skills and attacks require to time it right similar to super mario rpgs or virgo versus the zodiac it does it well but only at the end i realized you could also time attacks like  crescent moon abberage etc they should have put a notice for it

the story was pretty simple have some parts where i questioned some of the characters decision at the end i wont delve too much but it was still very enjoyable i enjoyed how much the main duo was able to grow stronger and the relationship between the mage and fleshmancer

i also really hated having to pick up 60 conches at least have them be trackable through the minimap

overall it is still a very good turn based game still would reach to my top 20s for turn based games i was really expecting to be able to build my characters in any way i wanted maybe something similar to virgo vs zodiac the pixel art was legit really good i loved the design on places

malade je me sens très nostalgique et excitée de me lever le matin pour continuer ma partie comme quand jétais kid hahah merci sabotage davoir créé ce nouveau jeu légendaire jespère un jour pouvoir visiter votre studio à ma prochaine visite à québec

this game is just amazing it reminds me so much of my childhood thanks sabotage for creating this new legendary game keep em comin

#####

very solid turnbased rpg with timing based attacks and guards in combat
the writing is good the characters are interesting both visuals and sound design are impressive
an excellent game for sure just make sure that you are into this type of battle system as its not super heavy on numbers and character build but more about timing things right and reacting to what is happening at the moment closer to a mario  luigi rpg than an octopath traveller in a nutshell

#####

mountainsre nice

#####

after one hour and a half and 2 bosses defeated i think i can safely say this game is amazing

the pixel art is top notch the ost too and the gameplay and story telling is simply perfect in my opinion

sabotage studio did it again they made an old school rpg with a modern twist another master piece for me

i recommend it to all rpgjrpg lovers ღ



#####

i played the demo for this and its the first game in a long time that ive wanted to play day one im only an hour in but im loving it so far im playing with my kiddos watching and were all loving it 

#####

update i put about 25 hours in to this game and decided to uninstall it this game is just not fun quite frankly it was a test of will to get to 25 hours i found myself getting bored about 1015 hours in but decided to see if it gets interesting or better it does not the story is so dumb at one point you bake bread for a longsleeping dragon who wakes up and decides to become acaterer thats not even quirky or funny its just bizarre the whole story is like this it is all rushed and incoherent 

i can forgive the story because i can see why people would like it what i cannot forgive is the battle system if you want to do a special or magic attack you hit space bar thats it thats the battle system hitting space bar a hundred times sure theres a little strategy decided what element to use but there are so many save points and bonfire resting points that there is little to no challenge 

bthe best parts about this game is the sound and art thats it if you want the sea of stars experience download a few pixel art gifs and listen to the soundtrack on youtube b

original this is a middle thumb game at best the story is painfully simple the combat is painfully basic and the map is painfully boring it looks like a great game it sounds like a great game but lacks charm the best i can say for this is it is generic i would much rather play epic battle fantasy on those old flash websites 

sos is clearly inspired by the old rpgs like secret of mana and chrono trigger but somehow misses the fun and i think it is because of the lack of depth sure the game makes you think its got an open landscape but this is just a trick of level design yeah you can jump off cliffs and grapple across gaps but they all are designed to take you on a linear path there is no sense of exploration or danger or excitement 

the characters are boring as hell too partly because the story is rushed along and partly because the writing is just bad the humor is not very good and most everyone you meet is forgettable 

the sound design and artwork are great for sure but those dont make up for how not fun this game is 

i would recommend epic battle fantasy 14 legend of heroes trails in the sky final fantasy tactics tactics ogre final fantasy ix or any of the original classic snes rpgs

#####

a real shite boring game dont waste your time on it i beat the game and got all achievements this game felt like the biggest chore to play ever the characters are 2 dimensional and tripe the writing is abysmal and there isnt one enjoyable character in it there is nothing i have to say for the game at all octopath was a far better game in all ways visually writing characters exploration and so on this game has nothing that other games havent done way better

#####

youll genuinely love this game if you like games like chrono trigger everything is beautiful and is made with love crazy to think this game is canon to the messenger story

#####

h1tldrh1
i was so excited for this game but it turned out to be a let down
combat is a big miss from me story is mixed and with too much uninteresting text andor boring


music
artstyle
difficulty options relics
steam deck performance
fishing minigame is fun

 
combat super duper omega basic
same spells for 5 hours
pacing
i keep comparing this to chained echoes


weak storycharacters

#####

when i heard that the developers of the messenger were making a new game and furthermore an rpg strongly inspired by chrono trigger i knew i had to play it even if im not a hardcore rpg fan sea of stars fantastic presentation is evident from the beginning of the game the pixel art is absolutely gorgeous and the soundtrack is incredibly beautiful featuring different versions of the same songs according to the time of day
gameplay is simple but quite addictive the player has a party of up to three characters in battle which take turns to attack use special techniques dual techniques or use items characters have a limited amount of mana and spells can be quite expensive but regular attacks recover mana so there has to be a careful balance between regular attacks and special attacks encouraging planning to decide the best moment to use the strongest attacks these attacks also have different types of damage which are effective to different kinds of enemies and can even be used to break the lock of the enemies that is to apply certain combinations of damage type in a certain number of turns to prevent enemy action there are also timed hits to deal additional damage or reduce damage taken and some special techniques require careful timing in order to deal maximum damage this system might be too simple to hardcore rpg fans but it is quite fun to use and it is accessible enough for casual or newcomers to the genre weapons and armor can be bought or found throughout the game but there is not much variety of it and there are no reasons to return to old equipment once better equipment is obtained healing items in the form of meals can be bought or crafted by cooking using ingredients again bought or found along the adventure there is also simple and fun fishing minigame and there is also a board game the characters can play but honestly i didnt care much about it
the game world might not be very big but there are a lot of places to explore which some of them requiring revisiting after some upgrades or new skills are acquired dungeons are extraordinarily well designed with lots of puzzles involving switches blocks ladders and buttons and are very fun to traverse and explore there are no random battles enemies are visible on screen and can be avoided most of the time there are lots of secrets and hidden items and some puzzles require manipulating the time of day 
the story is fairly basic and nothing spectacular it is very childish and lighthearted most of the time characters are very onedimensional and none has a deep or rewarding character arc it is a shame because the worldbuilding is quite interesting cool concepts places characters and lore are introduced all the time but none is explored in depth and i had the feeling that stuff just happened without much rhyme and reason however there are a lot of references to the messenger which i absolutely loved
it might not be as good as the revered rpg classic that inspired it but it is a very fun and enjoyable experience on its own with a lot of charm ideal for a quick and stressfree playthrough

#####

this is my goty 2023 and i dont think thats going to change

in a sea of soulless cashgrabbing microtransacting games that are only interested in your dollar sea of stars feels like a game crafted from the depths of the soul there is a care in the construction of the game that i rarely see have to backtrack to a place well after you leave now theres a convenient path back to the rest of the world qualityoflife is part of it but even small flourishes in different areas add to the feeling of care and love put into this game

this game might have a bit of a slow start but once the train starts it never stops at one point i was telling friends that i thought i was almost done and that was like a third of the way through the game

the action command system ala paper mario is used here to great effect including some really surprising twists on the convention that i was delighted to discover later on

exploration via a world map is handled masterfully and you feel that gradual growth of your powers in the ways your traversal evolves throughout the game there are a ton of secrets to be found and most importantly they are all hinted at in the game in some way you can and id recommend trying to complete this game to its final secret without using a guide a rewarding challenge to be sure

theres a really great message here about being in charge of your own destiny and that there is a mighty power in working hard and persevering even if you arent a chosen one i enjoyed the progression of the story and got really surprised by a few of the twists

i backed this game on kickstarter but didnt really go into it with any expectations i just thought a game inspired by chrono trigger with a soundtrack by yasunori mitsuda sounded like a banger and i with nearly 9 hours of soundtrack it absolutely is

i could probably write about this for hours but the game is worth the asking price and more id recommend going for the final final ending well worth your time

i rarely finish games i have nearly 100d this one

total ingame playtime after getting the final secret 39 hours 56 minutes

#####

i was a kickstarter backer and i give up at this point  the game looks beautiful  incredible pixel art great character and enemy design and a pretty dang good soundtrack too  unfortunately thats not really enough to keep me engaged in the game

the combat is boring and an absolute slog to push through  and theres a lot of it  grinding through enemies to level up doesnt make the combat any better as i played it just feels tired and tedious  the block system and the active attack system felt gimmicky and more of a method of making combat take longer  at first i didnt mind the whole attack to earn mp bit but every combat battle started to have an audible grown from me  

while the world is beautiful to take in it all felt like disconnected areas that might have been standalone locations  i wanted to care about the lore of the game but it does such a poor job of making it interesting and valuable to your time  whats there is either poorly written or feels like an afterthought  the main characters have the personality of wet socks and despite how hard i tried i simply could not find myself relating to either character

ultimately the combat is what caused me to toss in the proverbial towel  im just bored out of my mind dealing with the combat  i try to avoid it as often as possible but its inevitable so often that i just cant be bothered  maybe the story and writing get better eventually but i guess i wont know  when a games no longer fun its just not worth playing anymore to me

#####

if you are looking for chrono trigger this is not it overall a 6 or 7 out of 10 jrpg

good 
 solid soundtrack throughout the game but there isnt really a memorable masterpiece
 the last 23 of the story getting thru the first 13 was a snooze fest
 dungeon has variety of design and puzzles
 for gale
 nostalgia certainly brings back memories of the good old times

bad
 battle system gets repetitive after a while
 most of the characters no one is really memorable outside of gale and the last party member
 the grind to get the true ending

rating
355 dial soap bars

1010 so far perfect turnbased game with a twist puzzles are not overly hardeasy story depicts a heartwarming story of friendship

#####

kino is on the menu

#####

nice music nice story

#####

this game is the most mediocre thing ive ever played across the board so much potential that all just falls flat it seems pretty fun at first but gets more and more boring as you go along i had force myself to finish it because i just didnt care anymore the most fun part was playing wheels until i got both the assassin and healer and absolutely smoked every bout after that

#####

awesome awesome game jrpg fan buy it you wont regret it first time in a long time ive completed a game in my library we all know how many of those sit unfinished lol

#####

you can buy this game just for the music and it will be worth that and more

#####


my friend i play with said that if i post a review about the game and it gets 200 likes and 100 rewards hell buy me a bag of chips and a rtx 4090 so ill leave this here

#####

looks great sounds pretty good gameplay is decent but after 11 hours i cant be bothered to go on because i couldnt care less what will happen to these cardboard characters in a generic story youre making an rpg in the 2020s fellas you cant get away with a story thats less interesting than final fantasy 4s not to mention dialogue that was probably written by an adolescent chimp and pacing that nearly put me to sleep for the first 6 hours of the game

im being overly harsh here im sure if i finished this game i would give it a solid 7 out of 10 but if i have to force myself to play through more than 10 hours of a game to hopefully get to the interesting part without much reason to trust that the good part is coming theres something really wrong

comparing sea of stars to chrono trigger might seem unfair because ct is a timeless classic and a good candidate for the greatest jrpg ever made but since sos was so obviously inspired by ct it really exposes the formers weaknesses sure ct also starts slow with crono running around his towns fair with a cute girl  but within the first 20 minutes of the game they fall into a freaking time portal to the past he gets separated from the girl he has to find her and figure out what the hell is going on from there the story never lets up coming up with endless twists fascinating worldbuilding new characters new character development and so forth so that the player is always engaged with the story

as i alluded to in sea of stars the hook comes more than 6 hours into the game and then just as the tension finally finally rises just as the stakes are finally revealed and you might start you know caring about this world and the people in it that tension immediately lets up and the heroes just go on with their adventure it all feels pointless and during that rare moment when i was actually feeling some dramatic tension it was immediately destroyed by a 4thwallbreaking npcs truly idiotic dialogue

for the record i backed this game on kickstarter so im feeling more betrayed than i otherwise would if id just discovered this game and paid a little bit less for it this might have been a very mildly positive review but my god it really hurts to think what this game could have been if the devs had hired a decent writer they requested yasunori mitsudas help with the soundtrack they should have requested yuji horiis help with the writing

#####

pretty solid game has a lot of the best parts of games like mario rpg chrono trigger and golden sun
story has some really cool stuff around halfway through that got me really hyped and id say the stuff after that is still nifty but didnt quite match up to how exciting the middle of the story was

id give it a 75 or 8 out of 10 it was really fun but its not going to stick in my mind rentfree forever like sabotages previous masterpiece the messenger

#####

jirad does not deserve to be immortalized in this game

#####

when an indie studio manage to make what square enix refusedcould not do
highly recommended

#####

as a huge golden sun fan grew up with it i cant stress enough how nostalgic this game feels to me i went in with the expectation that it couldnt compete with the oldschool rpgs that i grew up with but damn did this game blow my mind so far the music is beautiful and catchy the world looks vivid and lively the artstyle is truly amazing and unique in its own way just wow even the interactive combat mechanic which i first thought were going to be annoying before buying the game are so fun to learn and make the whole turnbasedcombat more than just that it makes the whole combat system super interactive you have to strategize well with all the different mechanics the game throws at you and even though the game can be difficulthard at times even that is answered with handicaps both positive and negative to select at any given time in the game i highly recommend this to any fan of rpgs or the like its truly a piece of art and you can tell the developers put so much love into it stunning

#####

the pixel art in this game is among the most beautiful ive seen this year with great lighting effects to showcase the cool glowing auras of the characters and the glowing visual effects for the attacks and skills the music seems basic at first but as you progress in the game and the story it becomes increasingly fun it may also be nostalgic for snes rpg fans 

   the combat is super interactive and unique and allows you to affect how much damage a move does or which targets it affects depending on where you use it by pressing certain button inputs during a movie or at the right time a spell hits etc in this game there are also combos and ultimate attacks which are both special moves that you can perform in battle by building up a meter throughout these moves typically involve performing a skill with another party member and unleashing your ultimate signature move to deal tons of damage respectively mechanics like these in combat is what makes sea of stars very fun and memorable and prevents it from becoming repetitive as you unlock new party members progress the story and explore new areas you will unlock new ultimate attacks and combos to use in battle the combat also takes place in real time rather than entering a loading screen or some flashy animation to start combat when you engage a target or vice versa the characters hop into place and immediately are ready for battle its practically seamless and is another reason why the combat doesnt get stale unlike some rpgs like pokemon with its extremely repetitive and long intro random encounters

    another cool feature is that you can cook meals in this game instead of your standard elixirs and potions you would normally find in other rpgs this game allows you to cook meals at rest spots like bonfires or stoves with ingredients you have collected along the way or bought from a merchant each meal has amazing and appetizing pixel art in the menu as you cook them and of course their own healing and mana restoration effects little deviations like the aforementioned from the standard formula of an rpg is what makes sea of stars such a breath of fresh air 

    the story is really cool from the start but picks up even further around halfway through the game to tell an epic story of all the characters you will meet i dont want to spoil anything because its so great so i wont say more on it but if youre looking for a storycentered or storydriven rpg i 100 would recommend this game all of the different aspects i have mentioned as well as the story cement this game as my 2023 goty for sure buy it

#####

lets see how the love letter to chrono trigger turned out

bgame playb  a mixed bag combo attacks check and thats all
zale is easier to use because theres no basic qtes with his skills but valeres main lunar ability involves bouncing a lunar disc between her enemies and herself and its based on releasing the button press not pressing the button which means even till the last boss im missing these qtes now you can call this a skill issue but i call it boring repetitive twitch gamingfor a turn based game which also hurts my eyes because i cant blink or ill miss an insanely quick qte which is good when youre timing one hitbut not 25 in succession especially when all its doing is reflecting that lunar disc faster and faster till youre just smashing the button and hoping for the best same with serais dagger throw not fun but valere is the only one who can do lunar attacks so you have to use that ability in every case you want to break an enemy properly so how do you do that with zale when they only get broken by solar attacks i dont know how to fix this outside of removing it but maybe not base it on button release
and some enemies dont weaken their 100 strength even after taking apart their shield so the potential qte of thevalereseraitradeoff isnt worth it

aside from that annoying mechanic combat is okay dropping magical bits to charge up your attacks is about as innovative as it gets i found the warrior cook kind of lame for all of his story focus but i think that was the idea the concept of foraging throughout the game worked well with the cooking system so that was good also very good balance of economics with gold being eventually needed but scarce in general and tied mostly to item selling so enemies do drop gold but not bags of it which is a good subverted jrpg trope

but the problem i saw with cooking theyre just hp mp and ko recovery items wherere the buffs or the magical spell buffsdebuffs youd think a game with cooking as a main game play concept would have temp buffs per mealrest but nope wasted opportunity considering the stats of the game are so low
which brings us to

bequipmentb  lame and forgetful no sense of power or accomplishment naming scenario etc remember repairing then getting the masamune and then upgrading it rainbow safe helm wondershot etc in ct it felt awesome story tie ins meaningfuldare i say a quest
but in sosnothing i think the best item was the leeching thorn which you get very early and i still had it on zale by the last boss

bmusicb  this is interesting some tracks have multiple versions based on where youre fighting so the combat theme gets remixed whether youre in serais world a very cool synth style remix or the normal one all tracks for levels have two versions of themselves based on night and day which was a really cool touch so the music in sos is very good but its not great amazing memorable or dramatic
however it seems sos is using what sounds like the wave tables from ct they even got yasunori mitsuda to make a track or two but for the life of me i cant tell which which means that mitsuda was calling it in or the normal musician was good at emulating seriously mitsuda worked on this was it the waterfall level
regardless these tracks dont hit home theyre not memorable theyre not dramatic theyre just passable which is the biggest let down for a ct fan
ct was made by its music same with cowboy bebop every piece is memorable every scene hits marles theme is the games leitmotif luccas theme is the victory sound frogs theme is dramatic and motivational robos is cool and fun magus and the main theme is unforgettable
sea of stars musicid argue maybe the fight and boss music is catchy at times definitely not bad definitely not great but its just passable 

blevel designb  this is the best part of sos a true pirate adventure looks at chrono cross you can climb jump up jump across hookshot push blocks with your gust power break the ground by falling from a tall height and change the time of day using sunmoonlight powers simple easy block puzzles are fun and easy light reflecting puzzles the same the levels are sometimes a bit off with a sense of parallax based on dimension how far how tall how deep etc which is hard to pull off in a 16 bit world but you figure it out no random encounters even better than ct which is a godsend the levels are brightly colored brilliantly animated and have a somewhat gritty  magic design some gorey ones like that last level are fun and disgusting great art design is more zelda than chrono trigger whereupon you find a cracked wall and get a bomb item later so theres plenty of backtracking
which brings up a huge issue later

bsprite artb  looks cool well animated

bthe rainbow conchesb  i got all 60 got the true ending etc needed a guide this is bad game design this is ct sealed black chests on stupid angry crack those were fun this is dumb you shouldnt need a guide for collecting every item just to get the best ending endings should be based on your choices in scenarios not whether you can spot a blue chest in every level sneakily hidden behind a branch or platform or given at the end of some obscure quest hey thanks heres a seashell unless theres a very good lore or story reason which there isnt anything explaining these things what are they whats the rainbow star oh but you can get a parrot that tells you theres treasurea conch in a level that still means youre hunting down 60 things not just chests but entire events going through every pixel of a level which includes finding hidden passages to get these conchs for some collector in some underwater city for the true ending and some levels like torment peak are so poorly lit you dont know where the ground is in front of you which is the problem that made exploration games die out in the 90s the idiotic logic of events and objects that lead to solutions to puzzles did the events leading to getting traders signet make any sense to anyone
simple solution tie this into the story give us some reason why collecting rainbow conches mean anything
which brings up another issue

bmap layoutb  where the heck is docarri and various other places and objects how do i get to it its not easy to remember on the map and you know its on a certain continentbut it takes a good 5 minutes just reexploring because theres no immediate teleport or entrance on the map this is something the first suikoden game figured out long ago with the blinking mirror and this is all to find some trader who likes conchs all to get the best ending and thats the whole maplocation system its tedious

bbase buildingb  simple enough not much to say but unfortunately largely based on the rainbow conchs you either end up inviting people to your town to be a merchant or fisherman and they just stand around because they dont have a building to operate in or you build an inn or spa and no one can fill it up because you havent done your adventure game logic quests to find themwent rainbow conch hunting

bfishing minigame b fun simple enough cutely integrated into base building and the true ending which unfortunately means its connected to the rainbow conch collecting but a good jrpg staple sos does well

true ending  better done than mass effects citadel dlc

bspoiler timeb
bstoryb  weird 2 magical mitosis babies are literally delivered via transformingalchemist eaglestork the 2 previous babies didnt like that fight them and the big baddie sea of stars is just a drug trip game should be called garls cooking adventure

other than that its awesome

#####

play this game

#####

first game ever that let me do a screen clearing attack with the help of a rubber duck
and it has a grappling hook too definite thumbs up here

#####

pros 
gorgeous pixel art
great music
combat is fun
feels and plays like an old school snes jrpg

cons 
 save points are located throughout the game but you cant save from the main menu
 you cant pause the game during cut scenes or mid combat
 not a lot of interactive items throughout the world besides enemies  and npcs
 lots of dialog boxes when fewer could tell the same story

#####

im doing an immediate review right after i finished this game to give my thoughts
this game does so many things so right and it will be the perfect game for you if you do it right
and yet i dont know if i can recommend it or not there is sadly no inbetween option

pros
 characters are fleshed out and have or will have motivation down the line
 combat is awesome fluid and rewards patience and reflexes
 worldbuilding is fantasticly vibrant and creative without breaking boundaries
 music is composed beautifully
 fishing
 minigame is addictive although 1 combo of figurines is broken beyond belief

cons
 sometimes in combat abilites with timed button presses leave the screen which makes it very hard to hit them
 music variety is not big enough but that might be more of a budget thing
 combat could be a tiny bit harder or at least a relic that allows for a harder fight
 and last but not least  the ending is absolute giga dogshit  no payoff no satisfactory final fight no lesson learned no proper reconsiliation 1 character is just gone from the ending no buts where is he and not only that they make a mockery of it even more by adding a bullet hell at the end seriously bullet hell in addition to a unsatisfactory ending

btw alternate ending is still not good  better but not good

all i can say is play about 3640 hours until the final confrontation with some sidemissions and secret bosses and make the ending up for yourselves

hope this helps
cya

i have never been so disappointed with a game in all my years of gaming since the super nintendo how is this the same team that made one of my all time favorites the messenger this is one of the most abhorrant nostalgia grabs ive ever played

let me hit the good points  it looks great and exactly like the games its copying the soundtrack matches the game areas well and the combat is passively fun the world design is great 

the bad points come from everything else from the overworld traversal to the disjointed and clunky story and the absolute worst main cast of a jrpg ive ever seen

you were so focused on building the nostalgia train you didnt think to give it tracks an absolutely horrendous story with no direction connection or even passably well written characters you built a strong world then gave us the most bland cookie cutter characters you could with absolute mary sue protagonists who learn nothing dont grow and conquer everything through the power of being the destined heroes this isnt a story its a half baked 9th grade fanfiction 

the developers need to step back and think about what made those old jrpgs they focused so hard on emulating actually good they copied the art and the combat but not the spirit the heart of those games this game is a love letter to those old jprgs that shows their love is surface level and entirely superficial and is an active detraction from its genre 

playing this game actually has retroactively made me like the messenger less sea of stars has proven that the messenger was a fluke i wont be following this dev team anymore and it breaks my heart

#####

sea of stars is a wonderful jrpg for all its simplicity and casualness it really accomplishes what i think it was invented for  providing fond memories of adventure nicely invoking the spirit of the cartoons you grew up on

a cozy stronghold of kindness in a world of darkness

#####

first you start with a good story interesting characters and great writing  then you add gorgeous pixel artwork and animations  then you take the best mechanics from chrono trigger super mario rpg and zelda  mix well spread in pan and let cool  thats how you make my new favorite rpg of all time

getting all of the achievements took me around 40 hours and it was great all of the way through  this game made me emotional at multiple points which doesnt happen for me often

#####

game of the year 2023

#####

great turnbased rpg if you liked chrono trigger or super mario rpg youll most likely enjoy this one as well great soundtrack too

#####

the only way this game could be better is if it was golden sun 4 

nintendo please contract this developer to revive the series in place of camelot

sea of stars is phenomenal

#####

it has a little something for everyone

#####

lemme start off with amazing experience while youre high funniest plot ive ever gone through and all around a really good time im also extremely trash at games and even i can play this one

by far one of my favorite games ive ever played got introduced to sabotage by one of my friends because he played the messenger and loves sea of stars more than anyone ive ever seen i got interested cause i thought the art was kinda cute for indie and i havent done a turnbased rpg in a while now im addicted they even give you items in the game to make it an easier or harder experience like my dog could play this if i really wanted her too

the sound track is amazing i literally play it so my partner and i can go to sleep with noise the characters personalities are amazing garl is the main character no one can tell me otherwise the art is to die for as an animation major sure youve got minor bugs here and there like being able to walk through a random rock on the wall but that makes it even more enjoyable now its my mission to find any secrets or bugs i can nothing breaks the game or the experience its just funny watching your team get stuck on a clam for 20 minutes while you complete a puzzle by yourself

i will absolutely be selling my soul to this game and getting all of the achievements no matter how long it takes me its absolutely worth it for the memories and the bonding moments i get to have with my friends

i warn anyone on pc though it might just be my game but theres an area where you use a crane machine i swear never ever hold 2 controls at the same time unless you want the most demonic cries of machinery the noise is so bugged and so loud but way to funny i held w and a at the same time for 10 minutes straight just to hear the cries of that poor machine

at the end of the day
story 1010
music 10010

#####

great turned based jrpg game
i recommend 

#####

the writing and story ranges from weak to abrasive sometimes venturing further into the realm of seemingly disliking the common elements of the games genre when it becomes meta in an unpalatable way

the art is pretty good and is what sold me on buying the game hoping it would live up to its polished aesthetic

gameplay wise the game would be fun if they didnt ruin the paper mario combat by not paying attention to what they were doing

to explain the variety of attack minigames is incredibly low considering its a derivative system they disinclude obvious easy alternatives seeing as they have a solid background of games to draw from

considering this the fact that there are more than a few repeat minigames within the characters incredibly small skillsets and further that these repeats are on moves that are used so often as they are the default bread and butter attacks is even more egregious

compounding this and maybe the most damning is the lack of understanding that these minigames need to work with the flow of combat as opposed to interrupting it for long periods of time 
in a more polished game all combat minigames except ults should resolve in at most 5 seconds usually less

the result of this lack of attention is that nearly every turn of every combat you will spend 20 seconds playing the timing bounce minigame as the blue hair woman then when the ninja girls turn shows up you will spend 20 more seconds playing her exactly equivalent timing bounce minigame every fight large and small becomes a chore because this move is costedbalanced around being your basic all the time use magic attack 

the game seems spot playtested instead of runthrough playtested otherwise they would have realized something this abrasive was a problem immediately

regardless outside of them increasing the pacelimiting the duration changing the mechanic or scaling  cost and expected use case of some of these minigames this in addition to throwing in at least one or two varieties of mashing games short memorization games stickflick timing games etc there will remain a game ruining problem

i cant recommend the game because of just how obvious this problem is how easy it is to solve and how bad it is for the game experience

the gameplay becomes unfun near immediately this because even the most pathetic weeny fight takes ages of watching yourself time a presses these moves are so important that avoiding them would be a challenge run and doing so would be limiting further the already miniscule pool of actions and combat minigames present

#####

os piratas tocando as musicas do jogo na taverna é uma das melhores experiencias que eu já tive com video games

#####

my overall take away here is sea of stars is not a once in a lifetime kind of game but its probably a once in a decade kind of game there are so many games that come out nowadays halfbaked mediocre or under deliver based on what they promised sea of stars did not follow this pattern and while releasing a quality product shouldnt be the exception to the rule i really have to tip my hat to the team who made it for putting out a game lathered in love and passion for the medium

the game is a friggen work of art everywhere you look the music is full of mystery and adventure with some sick ass bass during fights the characters are charming and endearing the combat exceeded all my expectations and rewards players who are strategic and responsive the menu and user interface are very clear to understand but dont look generic 

sea of stars is a rpg in the vein of chrono trigger but it doesnt copy their work it instead looks at the things that really worked and then comes up with its own solutions to keep the player engaged and challenged there are so many quality of life aspects ive never seen before and i would wholeheartedly recommend this game as a great option for someone playing their very first rpg and for someone who is a veteran of the genre looking for a fresh spin on what they love

my favorite thing about the game is definitely the visuals the art is beautiful the animation work was done by god its so good and the visuals you see while cooking god damn

but lets talk about fishing this games fishing is fast easy to understand and fun you arent bound by stamina here cast your line tempt the fish reel it in and be awarded with ingredients that can be cooked into vital combat tools

i feel the combat is very accessible but you must be attentive while in battle getting attack bonuses and defense bonuses are granted when the player times additional inputs with the animation on screen and if you just select your action but watch the outcome passively youre going to get stomped fans of the game octopath traveler will feel right at home with the system to weaken your enemies by attacking strategicly with different damage sources and this game lets you choose which character you want to use instead of being locked in to using the one that is up next unless you just went in which case your character will be greyed out

put some headphones on and get lost in this world its a great time and your jaw will drop when you see how beautiful this whole damn game is

stellar stuff absolutely blown away it doesnt pretend to be something its not and it is everything it ever aspired to be great turn based jrpg that clearly cites its inspirations while coming up with a lot of interesting stuff of its own combined with witty and funny writing amazing atmosphere and an enormous attention to detail that speaks to the passion of the people involved this is one of my favourite games to come out this year and probably for years to come if you like your retro games and find yourself replaying breath of fire chrono trigger and were enchanted by games like chained echoes then this is for you


edit so after i am nearing the end there are a few things i have to admit i despise in this game

1 leveling when you get a level you can choose out of four different skills to additionally increase of a total of 6 attributes sadly these numbers mean total jack eg valere has 141 atk while zale has 119 yet zale will always and consistently deal more damage with his standard attack yes against enemies with no resistance i just hate it when games give me numbers that dont do anything why give me the illusion of choice 16 difference in attack score and the character with the lower score consistently albeit only slightly outperforms the one with the higher score likewise the character with even lower score also consistently deals about the same damage as the one with the highest score because well apparently she is an assassin and therefore meant to deal that much damage but why why would you not have the stats reflect that aptitude same seems to be true for magic attack and both defense stats which is why i simply only increased hp and mp halfway through the game and it turned into a cakewalk because unlike the other four stats those actually do represent very tangible numbers 

2 encounters man encounters are all over the place 95 you can beat with one hand down your pants the remaining 5 just seem brutally unfair with sometimes enemies going 2v4 and of those 4 three attack at the very same time allowing for zero strategy if they decide to attack the same party member which they often do 

3 backtracking in general seems like an afterthought despise is too strong a word here but it feels unrewarding and like a chore 

dont get me wrong i still like the game and i think the soundtrack is a total banger but these things are something i think that shouldve been really really obvious when testing the game and its a shame they made it into the final cut

phenomenal overall but a few pet peeves of mine which really grind my gears make of that what you will id buy it again but to pretend the game has no issues is just wrong imho

#####

i dont wanna go to work tomorrow i wanna play more its great

#####

i was very excited to play this game but i found the game very shallow the music and art are both beautiful but the story dialogue and combat just did not vibe with me at all the lackluster story actually made me a little bit angry because there is potential there but it just never really took off the characters are very flat and that makes it very hard to care about anything that happens in the game i have to admit that i did not finish this game i held out for a long time hoping it gets better but i spoiled the ending for myself and couldnt bring myself to finish it

#####

this game received best indie in the game awards 2023 yesterday and it damn deserved it

sea of stars is beautiful the pixel art is gorgeous each character has so many animations in and out of battle and all of the fantasy environments are welldesigned to transport you in this wonderful world

the music is reminiscent of some of the early final fantasy titles which means amazing with a plethora of tracks to adapt to each location of the world

the gameplay reminds me of those mario  luigi games its a turnbased combat system but when youre performing any kind of action if you press the action button at the right moment youre are going to amplify the effects of that action for example more damage dealt more healing less damage when being attacked etc i really like this mechanic as it adds a nice bit of spice to the turnbased system you can also adjust the difficulty making it easier or harder and find that sweet spot in difficulty that you prefer

the only thing i think could have been better is the story dont get me wrong im not saying that its bad its a really wholesome story that introduces you to an epic world with legends and gods and so on i just think im more into a dark tale than a happy colorful one still some of the plot twists really left me with my jaw dropped

the last thing i want to talk about is the quality of life in this game which i really appreciate as a completionist it is never hard to backtrack in any area with tons of shortcuts you can unlock there is a damn ping parrot that you can talk to in the world map and it will inform about the areas in which youve missed a chest in every fishing pond there is a sign of every fish you can catch in that pond that also shows which ones youve caught without spoiling anything towards the endgame you have the ability of travelling wherever you want on the world map without having to get through an area in order to get to another one it also has a big amount of optionalpostgame content so all of the above really help to complete this game

overall this game is excellent its beautiful its uniqueits nostalgic its entertaining and the list goes on  really deserved indie of the year and im glad i played it

#####

if you like 90s squaresoft rpgs you will love this game

while i find the characters a little one dimensional the writing in this game is some of the best there is im a cutscene skipper video game story hater and i think the story and more importantly the way that they tell it is truly great it is so sincere

the game on a whole doesnt quite hit the pinnacle of greatness of the 90s jrpg but it is as close to capturing that magic as i have felt since 

the music however exceeds the source material songs like the great archive hit on an emotional level that 90s jrpg music could only dream of it adds the perfect flavor 

graphics are great 

now what this game overlooked from its source material is diversity it all gets a little samey the characters essentially wear different costumes but theyre all motivated by the same thing there is very little drama the characters are too certain pull them apart show some vulnerability express some doubt take the time when the time comes and we win with them the payoff is bigger these types of character dynamics are what makes the characters in ff6 and chrono trigger so memorable they pull together despite their differences

this sameness extends to combat and exploration as well unfortunately i think it just needed a bit more time in the oven especially combat 

still its a lovable game and these details are easy to overlook thanks to a pretty polished bug free experience excellent storytelling great music and fun overall

game of the year 2023 in my book hands down this game is a fantastic love letter to fans of classic rpgs like chrono trigger while still taking modern twists on certain aspects to keep it from feeling to old and bogged down the story is great the characters are fun the gameplay is spectacular and the graphics are absolutely immaculate

my only criticism of this entire game is that it becomes disappointingly easy in the second half or soeven without any of the relics active the devs did great in most regards but the action economy kills any threat of failure the worldthreateningly insanely evil overwhelmingly powerful demonic monstrosity only gets one turn to your three and most of its attacks only target one character in the end its too easy to have two characters fighting and one healing at all times and suddenly most of the later bosses are an absolute breeze im not great at strategy games and even i only died a single time and that was just sour luck that took a full party from max health to dead without me getting a single turn in between

if you ever wanted to try a classic style rpg this is above and beyond the best place to start

if the devs continue to update this game i would love to see more difficulty in the later bosses it would also be nice if there were a theater or something in the settings so you could rewatch the animated cinematicstheyre so spectacularly animatedsomething akin to chrono triggers theater on the gba version or ori and the blind forests theater

one last note i wont spoil anything but the game does have multiple endings if youre just starting your own playthrough be sure to go out of your way to grab any and all rainbow conchs you findyou can thank me later
