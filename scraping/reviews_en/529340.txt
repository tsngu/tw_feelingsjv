h1 i would say the game is getting better and better but consider those updates should be included at the first place and they are selling more dlcs to prove it i will still suggest you wait for a big discount to buy it h1

update posted on may 25 2023

im updating this review after the release of this games third major patch and first dlc release although paradox has fixed most of the major bugs i complained about initially as well as introduced several small and moderate improvements i still cannot recommend victoria 3

in my opinion the core gameplay of victoria 3 just isnt very fun this games core systems are deeply undercooked and the hours ive spent playing the game since writing my initial review have only further intensified my dislike of most of the fundamental mechanics of this game things like the excessively abstract war system the overly restrictive diplomacy mechanics or how goods magically teleport across national markets routinely kill my interest in continuing a playthrough despite my love of this time period and other paradox games

likewise the games flavor content is still lacking and if the latest dlc is an indication it seems that paradoxs plan is to dripfeed countryspecific flavor content in the form of overpriced immersion packs over the course of victoria 3s life cycle while this is a review of the base game not the dlc i must note that dlcs have always been a core part of paradoxs games and that there has been a recent trend of this publisher raising the price of dlcs without a corresponding increase in value

maybe victoria 3 will be worth playing in a year or two however i worry that even then itll just be an inferior experience compared to other grand strategy games while costing significantly more than the competition

original review posted on oct 28 2022

look if youre a masochist like me who owns every paradox game and most of the dlcs no review of victoria 3 is going to affect your purchase decision youre going to buy it play for hundreds of hours and then complain about how much it sucks to anyone wholl listen

this review isnt for me or people like me this review is for people who havent played paradox games extensively and saw this on steam and are checking the reviews to see if its worth buying if that describes you i do not recommend buying victoria 3 in its current state

this is for a pretty simple reason victoria 3 is embarrassingly unpolished im writing this review a few days after release with 31 hours played in that time ive encountered an enormous number of bugs poorly balanced design choices bizarre and stupid ai repetitive events insufficient flavor for even the largest countries and major mechanics like diplomacy and war that are so barebones i can only describe them as downright incomplete

if paradox were still a humble indie studio releasing 20 games developed by a dozen people i wouldnt be so hard on victoria 3 but paradox is a major publisher who priced this game at 50 80 if you bought the grand edition and released it despite it clearly needing several more months of balancing and bugfixing this isnt the first time theyve done this and they clearly havent learned their lesson from imperator and leviathan

so if youre not sure whether you want to buy victoria 3 heed my words dont spend your time and money on a game thats actually finished and wait at least a few months to see if this game gets fixed

i really want to love victoria 3 i believe that developers do their best but at this moment i cant recommend this game to anyone  neither veterans of paradox gsgs nor people who want to try something new in strategy genre

first i want to say a couple of good things about this game
 graphics  they are good i wont lie
 fronts  while they are an unusual thing for most of paradox gsgs i like them it is a new refreshing system
 base systems they are serviceable and you can build a good game around them

now to the bad things
 trade trade is boring there isnt a lot of things that can help you manipulate it and mostly ai wont produce anything in any reasonable amount for you to want to trade so you are forced to colonize as nearly any country
 investors now your pops can build factories using their own money unfortunately they werent taught how to do it they will build factories in regions where there are no peasants or unemployed left they will overload region with factories so infrastructure collapses then they will build a railroad but there is no people who can work there they also just randomly build things wo considering demand 
 flavor it is terrible there isnt a lot of it and most entries dont provide you with any reasonable bonuses  just slap a 5 year throughput and call it a day 
 diplomacy i still have to see a diplomatic play resolve peacefully for example playing as france top 1 gdp top 1 prestige top 1 naval and military power i start diplomatic play to make a protectorate out of a small african state and they decide to fight against me and it happens as any country with any goal integration with great relations war protectorate war ban slavery war war war there are no peaceful resolutions
 manipulation of public opinion basically non existent decrees are too few and you cant promote ideology without bolstering like you could in victoria 2 agitators cover this somewhat but it is still not enough
 characters some of them are terribly represented interest groups are set up from birth etc considering how some people affected the world and shaped continentscountries it feels too rudimentary
 economy government planning  the simulator this game feels like spreadsheet
 construction now economic system allocates part of your construction to private sector considering that this isnt how it works and that you cant influence this in any meaningful way for example  better offers for construction companies from the state it feels like a stick with which you are punished and if you go laissezfaire you are basically killing your industry read part about investors

this is not the full list but i think it is enough to understand  victoria 3 is not a finished product it feels like a second stage of beta test at the moment please wait 2 or 3 years before even considering buying it

#####

this game is not worth buying in its current state there are fundamental flaws with the game design and super important features that are missing andor broken

if you ever played cookie clicker you will immediately get the hang of this game majority of the gameplay is checking what good shortages you have and clicking plus signs to add buildings to your construction queue thats 90 of the gameplay and yes in case you are wondering all countries play almost the same

what made the predecessor popular was rather the simulation aspect of it each person is alive in the world and they are represented as a pop which is also in victoria 3 great however instead of going further and creating a more simulated world that feels alive and organic they instead introduced capacities which are arbitrary restrictions that play exactly the same as the highly unpopular mana mechanics from their other titles of course it is impossible to fully simulate the world abstractions are needed but most of them are just lazy game design in this case

economy one of the most important aspects of the game there are huge flaws with how it works how can a power plant in australia power the street lights in london how can a farm in mainland usa be using transportation from a railroad in hawaii  just because shipping lanes in the atlantic are being raided and canada is no longer connected to london that means you cant move wood from ontario to quebec these are very serious flaws that break the immersion of the game and it is extremely disappointing they havent been fixed after so many months

diplomacy incomplete you can completely crush and occupy an enemy country but just because you didnt pick a wargoal before the war started all you will be getting from them is 10 of their income for the next 5 years mission successful boys pack up and go home we are getting 5 shillings a week after losing 50k men and occupying all their territories for years furthermore you need bird points to improve relations with a country out of bird points sorry you cant increase relations with a tiny island from 49 to 50 point unless you break your alliance with france you can have other countries owe you an obligationwhich they usually wont even listen to if you give them money but its a very small weekly chance so its just random rng 

war absolutely broken not in a good way if you are playing as russia and you are at war with china you can have only one battle at a time on the huge russianchinese border recently they added a chance for two battles occurring yay fronts are absolutely horrible especially in germany and india where you could lose months of progress in a week because the game decided to randomly split a front into two and placed the enemy troops on the other one so they have free reign to get back all that territory by the time i manually send my soldiers there thanks for reducing the micromanagement s

internal politics simply rng only 8 interest groupssame ones in all countries and they randomly decide what they like or dont like laws that you want to pass feel like eu4 sieges you just have to pray you succeed on that dice roll

performance not great gets terrible late game

the development should be focused on fixing broken things and fundamental features that are needed how can they even release the game without foreign investment agitator mechanic that comes with the first dlc is nice and all and i understand multiple people can be working on multiple things at the same time but the players would rather have all the missing and broken stuff get fixed first 

there are still many problems not mentioned above

i say get this game in 2 years when it is going to be on 75 sale it is currently boring and broken

a sisyphean experience of making chairs and clothes for my growing population only for the french to buy them which angers my population so i make chairs and clothes for my population and prussia buys them which angers my population so i make chairs and clothes for my population and great britain buys them which angers my population and i run out of fabric so i build a cotton plantation so i can make more chairs and clothes but theres not enough workers so i invent a technology which lets me have less workers making chairs and clothes so i make chairs and clothes for my population and the usa buys them which angers my population so i make make chairs and clothes for my population and spain buys them which angers my population so i make chairs and clothes for my population

edit 2 it has now been roughly 3334 days since the patch to fix the ai not building ports which has instead resulted in the ai building too many ports and going bankrupt literally the day after there were mods to fix this bug but its still in the base game

also fun fact you know how construction would lag out when you got to the 6k10k mark depending on your computer its because the construction queue loads up the images of the buildings in the queue with no limit and your computer basically freezes over trying to simultaneously run 300500 pngs of a building with a loading bar also fixed by a mod

did you know that in the base game theres still no way to easily see how your pops are actually spending their money on their needs and thus how to increase their sol mod for that too

also to give some background  i have about 35k hours in eu4 does that mean i have to love every aspect of it does it mean i cant point out how their dlc policy is toxic to newcomers i have about 2k hours in ck2  does that mean i cant be pissed that paradoxs last patch of the game left bugs in the game praise the hammer of zeusposeidenariesheraathenahelaartemis i have about 400 hours in ck3  does that mean i cant point out that the game is honestly sort of bland and flavourless compared to ck2 and paradox probably leaned a bit too far into the whole le funny incest and nudism at the expense of the rest of the game

edit ive chucked in another couple of hours so i wanted to update my review to reflect the added playtime i still cant recommend the game in its current state because the current patch which was supposed to fix the ai not building ports has resulted in great britain and france going into debt spirals by building exclusively ports going bankrupt deleting ports rinse and repeat

i want to love this game i really really want to love this game it scratches the same itch for me that eu4 ck2 ck3 and hoi4 do but with an actual focus on the economy which i love the problem is that each patch brings out new game breaking bugs that have a large impact on the game experience

as a side note i cannot recommend anbeelds ai fix mod highly enough  it actually makes the gameplay enjoyable since ive already gotten all achievements it doesnt matter if ironman mode is achievement compatible or not so i can enjoy playing what the game will hopefully be a couple of years down the line its just frustrating that the game which i want to love because it scratches an itch in my lizard brain is repeatedly broken on each new update and it falls to what is essentially volunteer work from the modding community to make sure the game is in a playable state

tldr  has the bones of a great game but severely lacks depth and replayability even if you fall into playing it for a long time like i have its more akin to stockholm syndrome ala lol or dota than because its an actual enjoyable game

to start off  yes i have at the time of the review 364 hours in the game and have obtained the 45 achievements which were included in base game i felt that after getting all the achievements id have a good understanding of what the devs intended as the proper experience on top of playing a wide range of nations with a wide set of goals

as the game stands now i cannot recommend it at its current price it feels like a public beta with severe and frustrating bugs prevalent throughout the initial release to the current version 112 these range from mild to gamebreaking depending on when and how they happen with whole achievements rendered unachievable after 3040 hours of play due to a bug my biggest example would be the achievement you get for completing the tutorial missions  i was playing as sweden and doing a chill game of followtheobjectives when the journal chain actually broke and never gave me any new objectives i played through to the enddate in the hopes that it would fix itself to no avail another example is when i was playing as the sikh empire for the empire under the pun achievement and there was a revolt in the east india company that won their independence war against the east india company but werent able to have war declared on them

in regards to replayability  there is a severe lack of unique features between the different nations around the world yes there are minor things  the qing dealing with the opium wars and opium addiction japan having a couple of objectives to modernise the state or the ottomans trying to fix their sickly empire  but by and large the game play loop was the exact same no matter which nation i played its pretty much weaken the landowners if present get colonialism in place rush malaria prevention colonise zanj before france gets a chance to and colonise half of africa before the ai manage to get any sort of foothold on the continent if the nation was too hard to get colonising before africa was blocked off then the gameplan was conquer sindh build opium plantations declare war with qing to get them on free trade if gb hasnt already and export opium to them if that was too hard then research mil tech until you have an advantage over the qing then enslave half of china to work in your factories

there is also a severe lack of depth in everything other than the internal economy the ai will frequently suicide their economy by taking an obligation from an african minor nation despite the player having a good relationship with them and supplying their market with the majority of their consumer goods leading to a significant drop in their gdp and sol warfare can sometimes be summed up as i lost against switzerland because they took a tiny chunk of my land and despite me winning all the offensive battles my army never actually reconquered what the swiss were occupying forcing me to surrender to war reps the naval combat is a complete joke with there being no significant advantage to teching up the ships and man o wars managing to win against battleships a bit less than half the time in an actual game which is ridiculous

there are also minor things which are annoying luxembourg starts as a vassal of the netherlands but has 0 market access at game start and can freely declare an independence war without the netherlands being able to get their troops through belgium or prussia to fight you you have no control over the economy of your vassals or colonial subjects leading to muchneeded resources going untapped you cant create new colonial nations at all there is currently a mod in the steam workshop that makes the ais economy significantly better than basegame using a scuffed method of ingame scripts and triggers and no actual changes to the games code which is better than what the developers have managed to do in the patches since release even if fancy clothes are dirt cheap and regular clothes are experiencing a goods shortage your peasants and farmers will refuse to buy the cheaper alternative leading to clothes factories in the lategame often having extremely cheap luxury clothes and extremely expensive standard clothes there is no way to peacefully annex your vassals  it will always lead to a diplomatic play with the chance of france or another great power deciding to meddle in your affairs you cant annex vassals that have a high opinion of you even if your tech is far greater than theirs and you have a significantly higher sol you cant share your technology with your vassals leading to them often building lowtech factories which are inefficient and waste all of the basic resources its basically no 1 priority as great britain to annex your colonies and directly rule over the lands so they stop being parasitic leeches on your market

thats not to say i havent had fun playing the game and i do enjoy watching the gdp go brrrrrr but i cant recommend that anyone buys the game in its current state

#####

dont buy this now wait for six months for the bugs to be sorted out the current patches have all added new game breaking bugs warfare is still a complete mess as well

#####

like other reviewers i recommend this lukewarmly only because i dont think its bad enough to warrant a negative review and i had fun with the base mechanics enough to not call it a waste of money

but the critiques are valid and paradox will really lose the trust of their base if they turn their back on this the way they did imperator

#####

i love victoria 3 but lets be clear its not an easy game to love i suggest that you understand it as a hybrid of icivilizationi and idwarf fortressi you are the abstract governing spirit directing a polity in peace and war in scientific discovery and industrial development in harmony and upheaval as with civilization the scale of the game is grand  you are an actor on the world stage in a time of tremendous geopolitical change and great forces move at your command however as with dwarf fortress youre going to very quickly discover that while you can give many commands you do not icontroli what happens the specific combination of control and lackofcontrol you experience in this game is one of the reasons i think you should play it but its not for everyone

what is that combination of control and lackofcontrol like to writers there are two kinds of science fiction you tell the difference by asking how their warp drive works one kind of scifi will tell you about energy sources quantum physics and abstruse mathematics the other kind will say you push the button and it goes with that in mind ask a civilization game how do you declare war you push the button and now youre at war ask victoria 3 how do you declare war well you start a diplomatic play and add some war goals primary or secondary by spending maneuvers but dont get hasty because you also need maneuvers to sway allies which you wont always need but you want to retain the option to do so because other countries with an interest in the region might decide to join the other side whether because they really like the defender or because they hate your guts and in any event you need to be careful because theres a time limit before a play becomes a war and you can avert war by backing down but if you the attacker back down then the defender gets their primary goals for free and if you misjudged the strength of your position thats going to be painful but it might still be better than fighting an actual war because wars are super expensive but also if the defender backs down then the attacker gets itheiri primary goals for free which is a huge windfall so you will be tempted you do not control the fighting you raise armies hire generals some for skill some for their usefulness as political appointees and set strategic objectives as rulers in the period did you control things like general smith should lead offensive efforts  general jones should stay on defence and our main army will attack from the east  a smaller force will go around the peninsula to attempt a naval invasion you have plenty of ability to affect the outcome of wars but you exert that ability mostly ahead of time you do strategy and operations tactics is fully out of your control

this tension between the things you control and the things you dont is central to the game victoria 3 is as much about people as about the countries they inhabit if a country makes its people unhappy enough the country will break it wants you to icarei about your population while youre playing a globalscale strategy game your pops have desires and opinions and needs and the game makes you care about this by mechanics with real teeth improve the material welfare of your population and everything will be better and easier for you fail to do so and everything will be worse of course its easier said than done your pops want different things because the game is about their ideologies  about their material circumstances their ideologies determine what they want politically and their material circumstances determine how much they can pressure the player to get it

example playing the usa i launched a campaign for fullon universal suffrage in the 1850s and was immediately met with a revolution led by industrialists  landlords by immediately i dont mean as soon as i passed the law i mean as soon as i started itryingi to pass the law it was a striking moment because the games themes and mechanics harmonized the landlords liked the old law because it gave them 25 political power which together created a very strong narrative message of this chunk of the population opposes your changes because they imaterially benefiti from not changing its not just landlords either if you go conquer some faraway place with no military strength you will be dealing with their secession movements for decades unless you pass more inclusive citizenship education and qualityoflife laws though you will have to fight the landlords about those peoples brought into a country by conquest are not thrilled about getting conquered and the game mechanics require conquerors to care about that

some of what you have to do about it is what youd expect as a person familiar with the history of the era you ineedi to industrialize and iprobablyi should liberalize when you start a new game the designers offer you three suggested paths economy military or equality in practice these goals have a lot of overlap because they all require that you build an industrial economy you cant have a strong economy without shifting your workforce from mostly farms to mostly factories you cant have a strong military without big factories producing military supplies you cant have an egalitarian society without disempowering the landlord interest group that starts as a dominant factor in almost every countrys politics  which you do by shifting your workforce away from farms and into factories

the payoff for limiting your control is that the games world feels vividly alive in a way few strategy games do you start not with a passive empty map waiting for expansion and conquest but with an existing world full of people and countries with desires and goals indeed with multiple wars in progress with a living world it becomes emotionally rewarding to grasp the games systems and change that world it feels like an accomplishment you are not controlling your country like in most such games you are ileadingi it and difference between your populations embrace or rejection of your leadership is made extremely clear to you in the game mechanics at its best victoria 3 gives you the thrill of having earned the trust of simulated millions guiding them to a grand tomorrow

victoria 3 is not always at its best it is a typical paradox game incredibly ambitious in a way that causes many bugs some of them severe paradoxs model of supporting games with years of active development means that the games are never really done and sometimes problems persist for years because adding and reworking features is higher on the priority list than getting things that only mostly work to work elegantly sometimes this sucks but paradox also has a strong track record with games like eu4 hoi4 and stellaris bringing them from good to great with years of work i expect them to do the same with victoria 3

i love this game for taking the build a great nation fantasy of civilization and shifting it from an abstract contest of territory resources and management into the messy terrain of people ideologies and material circumstances it is a game that takes a huge bundle of typical strategygame stuff like war economy and technology and overlays all of it with an incredibly pointed question drawn from its historical background which people imaterially benefiti from the wars the economy and the technology which people suffer and what will they do about it it is okay to want an abstract contest of territory resources and management my favorite is hansa teutonica but if you want a videogame that gives you the emotions of leadership of earning obedience by materially improving the lives of those you would command and wielding that command to build greatness of economy military or equality you want victoria 3

#####

so vicky 3 is here what about it well victoria 3 is a society builder game and despite what some might say it is a fairly deep and connected game in some but not all areas more on that in a bit when it comes to economics victoria 3 is not a realistic interpretation of victorian economics at all but neither was victoria 2 what victoria 3 does right with its economics is making them all connected and giving the feeling of growing and developing a real economy in the era which goes a long way considering this is all the game currently has to offer in most cases when you start you will usually begin by building many different buildings to help your economy grow researching technologies to get laws that you can pass to get more buildings or techs to change production methods to help grow your economy its a fairly interesting gameplay loop and it can at times be very rewarding when the game itself works as intended 

victoria 3 is a gem in the way that it makes itself appear like a very deep and complicated game and dont get me wrong in some aspects it is however the game constantly falls short just as you are starting to get deep into it while i was playing i kept finding myself running into many things that seemed odd or were just very bland an example would diplomacy on first sight it seems very deep especially when tied into the diplomatic play system and how the ai can react depending on the situation however after about 12 hours of game time its clear that the diplomacy is ok and best and very shallow at its worst when dealing with other nations mostly in diplomatic plays there are only a few ways to get them involved the primary way being diplomatic obligations what are these well imagine prussia is about to go to war with denmark the danes naturally dont want to get rolled by the prussians and their chances of winning on their own seem slim so they tell the french hey ill owe you something if you help more likely than not if you didnt whore yourself for good relations with the french which many times still isnt enough france will without hesitation or care in the world throw itself into the fray sending waves upon waves of men crashing upon your borders oh you withstood the professional army well i guess i should just sur sike here comes the conscripts baby total war for my danish brothers do not misunderstand me the victorian era was an era were maintaining the balance of power was very important to the great powers and this was sometimes done by force as we can see with the crimean war however to the extent that i am seeing in game where every war i fight is a life or death war where conscripts must be raised even if it is for a nation as small as denmark in many cases in real life the balance of power was upheld by pen and paper just look at the 1878 treaty of berlin for as deep as diplomacy is meant to be and the fact that war is supposed to be the last resort in many cases it feels like the only resort there is no real deep diplomatic dealings you can do with other nations outside trade agreements there is no diplomatic dealings to settle a war before it begins there is nothing it is so bare bones its almost laughable that they marketed it as if it were deep

this sadly isnt all though lets have a quick fire off to see what else is wrong with diplomacy war diplomacy and war itself

ai constantly backs down from diplomatic plays even if their very independence is threatened this also goes for native uprisings and revolutions i once took greece as the ottomans without firing a shot likely story

ai will throw anything and everything at you for the smallest most insignificant nation in existence 

war is not properly explained generals constantly enter battle with smaller amounts of troops than the enemy even if you field the larger overall army modifiers are poorly explained and usually put deep within hidden menus such as why your men enter battle with lower moral etc

terrain and seasons are very bland as far as the game is concerned it is always summertime so there is no debuffs to movement in say winter in the italian alps spring in russia etc none of that matters its just random modifiers assigned when the battle starts

you cannot add wargoals mid war you cannot give allies land before during or really after wars you cannot join wars in progress i feel like i dont have to explain why this is an issue in a game set during the victorian era

lack of any real diplomatic options whatsoever when it comes to discussing peace preventing wars or modifying the outcomes of wars treaty of berlin style very very shallow you essentially see a nation with a green thumbs up and say i choose you

there is no scramble for africa no treaties nothing ai barely if at all colonizes 

revolutions of 1848 what are those never happened never seen hungary revolt yet havent see any semblance of turmoil at all during the so called spring of nations this brings me to something else this game is in desperate need of some railroading the japanese empire almost never forms the ottomans are replaced by egypt almost as soon as the oriental crisis as none of the gps get involved at all even if you have high relations with them in most cases its clear the devs somewhat intended this with events but it just doesnt happen american civil war is never normal most times the csa is just the us east coast taiping heavenly kingdom more often than not is spawning in the most islamic parts of china and do you know why this happens its because these rebellions are meant to fire off where ever this in unrest yea im sure you can see the issue with this as well

the border gore is outside of this world thanks to the lack of railroading i have seen several times where the british just let the chinese ban opium

revolutions when they do actually happen are actually pointless as they only change one or two laws they are never actually true radical revolutions if the ussr ever forms it is always because of silent reform that the tsar must essentially do himself

the railroading doesnt need to be 100 like hoi4 historical ai but its clear that this vicky 3 ai is dumb as rocks and clearly needs someone to hold its hand hell i got so tired of watching the ottomans get eaten entirely by egypt that i had to install a mod for it on launch day 

there is no late game content essentially nothing the world just kinda does its thing no berlin conference no colonial conflicts no nothing the game just goes and it just does and it makes me very sad i can safely say that after engaging with this game the steps they took for war were a massive over correction and there needs to be at least a small amount of micro if not that at least of the love of god make the diplomacy deeper in regard to these things please 

this game launched as a foundation as many people say but is the foundation even really there i was constantly supportive and excited for this game only be given absolute mid this game does a lot of things better than victoria 2 but the thing is that victoria 2 has been around for 12 years and it has mods it has things that make it a deeper experience that has grown on people for over a decade and its like paradox didnt even care about at least trying to make seem like a preferable alternative to victoria 2 at launch i am literally on day one praying that there are some mods soon that can turn this into a better experience than what ive unfortunately gone through so far conclusion did i spend 80 on this game yes am i sad about no will i keep playing this game sadly hopefully pdx can patch it up or at least the modders personally i dont think this game will be abandoned theres too much at stake for them to do that at least thats what the cope in me is saying

this game will be great in three years

victoria 3 is the longawaited sequel to victoria 2 a 12 year old cult classic although it was a buggy janky fundamentally broken mess the economy of victoria 2 was unique among games it featured a closed loop economy where every good bought or pound spent by one entity is a good produced or a pound earned by a different entity the entire thing operated and changed by itself you could not control it only influence it it had many bugs and design flaws but it was a truly unique economic system for a videogame the surrounding systems like diplomacy and war were simple and lazy in the old paradox style but just functional enough

in comes victoria 3 looking at it as a sequel to victoria 2 it disappoints in most ways the unique economic system is gone and the economy more closely resembles anno your goal is to grow your economy using your construction sector and your main activity is fixing the economic impacts of the last thing you did supply demand and prices change instantly nothing in your country happens without your input and you have absolute control over every production building in your country making new buildings and changing how they operate is your primary gameplay loop making you feel more like a middle manager than a country while balancing production methods in every backyard moonshinestill is fun once as a small country it devolves into tedious micromanagement quickly when playing anything larger than liechtenstein 

the only thing that happens without your input is other countries setting up trade routes but this is mostly just infuriating because everything is in short supply and the ai is incompetent at growing their own economy these trade routes mostly just steal your resources and rarely if ever sell you anything of substance protecting particular goods could have been an interesting gameplay mechanic but it isnt you cant stop a good from being exported you can only embargo entire countries so trade boils down to you trying to steal resources youre short on the ai doing the same and you embargoing the ai if it starts stealing too many of yours devolving into isolationism becomes an appealing prospect if only to remove the micromanagement and instability

speaking of the ai in typical paradox fashion its terrible as a result singleplayer is a bland sterile experience you are playing in a sandbox with other kids but the other kids are just balloons with faces drawn on them it would be nice to believe that the ai will get better with some patches but this is unlikely given the reputation of paradox and victoria 3s game director the ai nations in victoria 3 are slow to grow constantly in turmoil due to mismanagement and regularly destroy themselves over the tiniest diplomatic disputes

those diplomatic disputes are probably the one aspect where victoria 3 actually has some interesting innovation most hostile interactions are no longer just a button but executed through a diplomatic play mechanic involving all major powers with an interest in the region diplomatic plays are a neat concept but they are sadly underdeveloped and let down further by the bad ai there is no real distinction between a small colonial engagement and major war in europe both become plays potentially involving every country with an interest committing their entire army its impossible to ensure a nations neutrality beforehand if you plan to simply befriend the other powers or convince them to stay out once its started good luck friendly nations will turn on you in a heartbeat during a play and major ai powers will join a diplomatic play for the most insane reasons the us will fight to the death to defend danish holstein in exchange for an iou china will sacrifice millions to keep an indonesian province out of dutch hands because they were promised war reparations the east india company will happily fight a war against its overlord over some border dispute between indian nations before magically returning to being an obedient dominion once the war ends 

this entire experience is wrapped up in a ui more hostile to the enduser than a suicide vest tooltips can be helpful but the endless recursion of tooltips on your tooltips on your tooltips ad infinitum invokes an escherian feeling of endlessness that makes you feel more lost than before you started this wouldnt be as bad if these tooltips did not contain important information that cant be found elsewhere the game will only tell you the most important information at a glance such as the number of radicals in your country but make it impossibly difficult to find out exactly who is radical and what caused it

critics have said the game looks like a mobile game and while this is unfair to the gameplay  the ui does lean heavily towards modern mobilefriendly ui trends lists and tables are frowned upon while grid layouts are preferred whenever possible the amount of information allowed on the screen at any one point is extremely limited forcing you to constantly swap between windows multiple lists simply cant be sorted at all and no list ever takes up more than a third of your screen width a full screen table with all the information you could want is anathema buttons are large and the ui scaling is very high by default unless you have a widescreen monitor in which case it defaults to unreadably tiny the game defaults to tree maps instead of pie charts suggesting that the ui designer had some very strong personal convictions about design without necessarily having the understanding of visual data comprehension to back them up

i have yet to mention the political system because it hardly matters unless you are trying to change a particular law thats affecting your gameplay like isolationism its possible to forget it exists entirely the interest groups controlling your government do nothing to stop you from changing the economy and eroding their power so the power of interest groups is just a result of what buildings you build rather than an interesting mechanic

ultimately the game is an exercise in making a line go up for the sake of the line going up every country plays exactly the same and there is no real payoff at the end warfare could theoretically provide something to work towards but the war system is so barebones clunky and dysfunctional that warfare is more frustrating than fun there is no micromanagement of units as that system has been replaced with automatic ai fronts but fronts split merge and disappear so much that the micromanagement is somehow just as annoying since the fighting happens automatically wars are heavily affected by arcane mechanics behind the scene that the player cant see or interact with such as the number of troops that participate in a battle or the direction a general advances the reward for dealing with this system is often lackluster since wargoals are decided during the diplomatic play phase and cannot be altered during the war 

victoria 3 isnt a terrible game per se it is simply mediocre as a game and bad as a victoria sequel if it had been an earlyaccess indie game for 30 euros with a different name it would have been received very well with praise for some of its innovative ideas and its potential as a released fullprice sequel to a cult classic developed by a major studio it is disappointing the arguments about its potential ring hollow in the context of a studio known for selling buggy halfbaked products that had potential but failed to deliver

if you are looking for a complex economic simulator this isnt it if you are looking for a game focused on diplomacy and war this also isnt it if you are looking for a cute annostyle economy game that you can play with friends so you can bicker over who ate all the tools in the market this is actually alright though buggy and overpriced

#####

its a great game at first but once you played a few starts it becomes clear that no matter where you start its always the exact same way of playing theres absolutely no variation at all very repetitive

#####

victoria 3 should have been the new crowning jewel of the paradox game library the ultimate in economic and military strategy victoria 2 is an amazing game hoi4 is an amazing game all paradox really had to do was take the economic system of victoria 2 and update it a little bit then take the military system of hoi4 and dumb it down a little bit and they would have had a masterpiece of a game the pop system should have been made more complex than victoria 2 why not separate by age and gender to allow for accurate conscription and to create a new system for the player to try and manage they should have made population growth have more complexities based on sol and events etc military is boring and dumb no reason it should have been done the way it is and was a brain dead decision but overall the game feels unfinished you are not buying victoria 3 when you buy this game you are buying victoria 3 early access maybe in 23 years and with all the dlcs purchased this will feel like a complete game but right now it is not worth a purchase its sad to see paradox fumble this game when they had such good source material to build off of why did they not start where victoria 2 left off i dont know but it seems to be what paradox does now release unfinished games

coming back to this sometime later and wanted to provide an update as of 3202024
i stand by my original comments on the game but i want to say as of now the game is much more fun to play i took a long break but have come back around the 16 update the game still feels unfinished there needs to be more dlcs to flesh out the game but it feels close to a playable game my biggest gripes are still the military system but i think the game is heading in the right direction i will change my recommendation to a buy as buying the game will support the continued development of the game but i think that paradox has a lot to improve and fix in victoria 3 but it is more of a playable game at this point

#####

victoria 3 is a case study on how to completely decimate and ruin the potential for a flagship product with incompetence and egoistic stubbornness

victoria 3 is the long and i mean long awaited sequel to victoria 2 a game which over the course of its lifespan accumulated a niche but cult following due to the fact it had more focus on political and economic systems in comparison to even recent paradox games such as hearts of iron 4 or europa universalis 4 while still maintaining a significant focus on warfare although the system used was a complete mess which would be painful to play at times due to the need of micromanagement

the logical continuation of a sequel would be to build upon the foundations and ideals of the previous game right to increase the depth behind economics and politics maybe completely rework the war system to build a more enjoyable but still significant and engaging war system to improve the diplomatic weapons you have in your arsenal to navigate through the landscape of the victorian era

politics and its depth has been completely stripped down to a basic rng system political parties which werent even supposed to be in the game until community backlash which are made up of igs igs interest groups represent specific groups of people such as landowners each ig supports different laws which change depending on the leader of the ig the leader of the ig is determined by random rng pops support igs which then leads to them supporting a party to change a law you just get the ig you want into the government and then you press pass law and wait for rng to pass the law yes thats right law changes are based on a percentage chance due to several factors 
lets compare this to victoria 2 each political party had specific stances on the economy the military citizenship trade and religion you then had pops who each had their own view and would then vote for a party based on which party had the closest views to themselves the most voted party gets elected into government however laws are passed by the upperhouse a representation of parliaments and senates the upperhouse is separate to the government and is voted on every year by people changing the composition of the upperhouse to pass a law you need to gain a majority in the upperhouse and no rng is involved it is decided by the upperhouse which is decided by the views of pops
what victoria 3 did is completely axe the upperhouse system a fairly realistic representation with a good level of political depth add unneeded bloat to the political party system and then make passing laws rng and easier when the community complained about laws being based on rng the solution was to change the user interface and the way the law passing process is shown on screen instead of just waiting for 1 arbitrary countdown and an rng percentage you have 3 shorter arbitrary countdowns to passing a law and 3 rng percentages instead oh and dont forget the fancy 3 circles added below the ui to show this truly monumental improvement

lets move onto the biggest most disrespectful slap in the face soccer punch in the chin pepper spray in the eye aspect of this game warfare 
do you want to know how warfare works in this victorian geopolitical simulator it works like this
general attack general defend general do nothing
that is it no this isnt a bit this isnt a joke that is the entire warfare system 
a war starts and a front is created you then tell a general to either attack or defend at the front if you really want you can also tell you general to remain at hq aka do nothing that is all your input in warfare apart from basics such as the technology and the size of your army the rest is decided by ai rng 
where are you battling idk rng 
how many soldiers are you taking idk rng
why do you have x modifier idk rng
how much land will you occupy idk rng and rng modifiers
the worst part is that every single battle yes every battle has a countdown timer war is artificially paced with a countdown timer between each battle which would at least bearable was it not for the fact that your armies are indestructible thats right youre entire army killed in a battle no worries in that short battle countdown the entire army was replaced organised and provided with equipment army encircled magically teleport back to the front line after defeat army taken the 1000th defeat of the war no problem they can handle it and always fully organised and prepared for the next battle 
a few lines above i mentioned that the countdown was the worst part that was a lie the actual worst part of all of this is that a huge portion of the community tries to justify it or even outright likes the system 
any suggestion of adding some sort of player agency or control is immediately met with no that makes micro possible which makes the game pain and then the same people will not even realise the same argument applies to the entire economic aspect of this game 
another argument is that the victoria franchise has always been about economic simulation no it hasnt
lets compare this with the victoria 2 war and combat system
fronts do not exist it is an organic property of wars which emerges based on where your units will be positioned and what technologies are unlocked the transition from early game napoleonic warfare to late game trench warfare is all completely organic and based on technological advancement no new game mechanics are introduced no new tools nothing the game uses the previously established mechanics and organically and slowly converts from napoloenic warfare to trench warfare the fact is that the issue wasnt the combat mechanics itself but the management of it the only major criticism i have for the core combat mechanics is the occupation system and how it basically makes manoeuvres such as encirclements impossible

lets move onto diplomacy
victoria 3 axes the sphere of influence mechanic another micro heavy mechanic for a customs union mechanic this is basically a watered down version of the sphere of influence mechanic except for a different purpose economic rather than diplomatic victoria 3 also has the normal diplomatic actions you will find in most paradox games including victoria 2 such as improve relations etc 
finally the new and most exciting feature which actually sounded really interesting and engaging the diplomatic play feature this feature is the crisis feature from victoria 2 except every nation can do them for demands and claims in victoria 3 there is no button to declare war instead war occurs from diplomatic plays running out of time with no one backing out the purpose is to be able to do everything you can do by war diplomatically and peacefully
however in execution it is done horribly when i said it is just the crisis feature from victoria 2 i wasnt joking there is no extra added depth no diplomatic negotiations or convincing nothing instead what it is is blackmailing countries with war thats the great diplomatic system of this game not to mention the majority of the time even when completely outnumbered nations do not surrender leading to useless wars

the economic system
no more state factory limits
tax system and country income redone from scratch
gdp mechanic introduced
goods and production chains redone from scratch
no more stockpile system it is now a flat value for goods
more detailed system in general but running out of space to describe

the economic system is the only major aspect to actually improve from vic 2 it does not justify the rest of victoria 3

instead of building on the foundations of its predecessors it has instead demolished and spat in the face of them potentially dooming the entire franchise
tldr they dropped the ball badly on this game

#####

its crazy how victoria 2 had the base elements of diplomacy and warfare at a very good and realistic level and then victoria 3 comes and just decides to destroy all of it

modifiers not applying entire battles decided solely by random dice rolls warfare in this game is so broken

diplomacy somehow makes it even worse because in diplomatic plays nations can join any war they want now ming travels across the world to help austria against italy yup makes sense

200000 chinese solders landing in europe no problem even though you have complete naval superiority yup sounds realistic to me

what a joke

#####

come back in 5 years then itll be worth it

#####

update march 2024 
nearly one year has past since my review and a lot of my criticism got addressed in a few weeks the devs will release the spear of influence dlc after that my friends and i will test the multiplayer again and hopefully bring you a positive update
_______________________________________________
review from april 2023

victoria was beautiful when i first witnessed her
it was love at first sight we had a lot of fun i enjoyed the time we had but i was a fool blinded by her beauty i ignored her flaws believing she will change but she never did it is part of her character i can only blame myself after multiple back steps i have to end it invested 80 in this relationship and i feel ripped maybe ill try again in 5 years and update my review

why cant i recommend it after 400 hours because multiplayer is unplayable half a year after release it still feels like a beta
i have lost multiple safe files with my friends we all marked our calendars to have fun with victoria during the weekend played 10 hours on a friday and woke up early to get back into it then the savefile didnt work nothing really nothing worked tried for 3 hours to fix it the issue was explained in the paradox form which is known for 5 months the frustration hits hard if you buy this game it will happen to you as well we have lost multiple safe files at this point it feels like theft

gameplaywise it lacks a lot of flavour there is no world war and a massive lack of political crises which happened during this timeframe wargoals cant be added during the war allies cant join during a war navies do not exist you do not have any ships you build a naval base and your sailors fight at the sea as your soldiers fight on the land no ships are lost because there are no ships when your massive fleet gets defeated in a naval battle you can try again 30 days later because ships dont exist therefor cant be lost in a battle naval range doesnt exist zulu can put 4000 pops into a naval base and invade borneo
ai is stupid and you can cheese every war because the war score system is stupid you can become nr 1 global power with basically every country in vanilla because the ai cant keep up with your superior build order the most downloaded mod is a mod that helps the ai to industrialize otherwise there is no fun in playing major or great powers
when a general dies his soldiers teleport away from the frontline chilling at hq losing the war the war system aimed to get rid of the mikro intensive system of victoria 2 but failed and made it worse you still have to mikro and watch your frontline carefully otherwise your general will push into the enemies with low morale while youre watching the frontline youll get mobile game graphics of some bedouin tents fighting each other with calibre 50 heavy machine gun fire ill stop here but there is more

paradox took my love for victoria 2 and made me preorder victoria 3 because otherwise i couldnt get the beautiful music from victoria 2
and here it is
i am the problem 
i deserve to be brokenhearted
no preorders

#####

this game in many ways is a vast improvement over victoria 2now hang on before you lynch me

the change in military and troop movements people complain about i actually like with all their other games micromanaging troops consumes most of the game by creating fronts players can focus more on building an industrial society and playing around with the government mechanics in theory this will create a dynamic changing society that is more of a political simulator

unfortunately it is not that sort of game the player can do everything in their power to mold and shape the economy by boosting production of this or change this economic policy or import this or suppress this group ect ectnone of that meaningfully changes the game

sadly nations just sit there spinning their wheels when i look at the ai they struggle manage their nations the living standards are low and markets are constantly groaning under the weight of the endless calculations you never feel like society has rapidly changed even if the governments names change by the end of the game most of africa is uncolonized nations are still impoverished and none of the reforms you can implement make a bit of difference

i like the idea of this game but the performance of the gamebut like every paradox game the longer you play the more broken and unrealistic the game becomes when i look at the map in 1912i usually just get bored and give up pressing a bunch of buttons to play around with factions and factories wears thin very fast then there is the performance issues game speed is always a problem with paradox games with stellaris being the worst offender but this one is right up there despite the game taking place over a short period time creeps by the time to build things takes ages and reforms and crisis drag on sadly this game is so hands off you just change a few settings for your country and tab out for thirty minutes in theory this could be a fun game in practice you stare at a screen waiting for missions to complete and fiddling around with increasing the production on this good and that but aside from the random political events they stuffed in the game nothing happens sorry guys this game just is not fun and given how abusive paradox is with their dlc i think i am done here if you really liked victoria 2 just keep playing that and put this one on your ignore list

on that note i feel sorry for the players who prepurchased dlc before paradox even put it out from what i understand it was a bare bones release so here is the lesson of the day part of the reviewnever preorder anything from anyone

#####

h1 so you want to play vic 3 huh h1
well this is your lucky day this review will try to give you some insight if you can bare my humor that is
the game can be enjoyable and it really has some potential that i hope the developers can achieve i do believe it has the potential to become the next hoi4 eu4 or stellaris 

the real selling point of this game compared to hoi4 and eu4 is in my opinion the capacity for the player to b set up its own goalsb 
do you want to create an equal society with high standards of living
bcheckb 
do you want to accomplish world domination with a minor power to recover its past glories trough military conquests bcheckb 
do you want to start the revolution bringing your ideology to other countries and shape the world as you see fit
bcheckb 
well after reading this you might think wow this really sounds dope af then why the negative review my sweet summer child reality is often disappointing 
victoria 3 has some serious flaws that must be corrected if they dont want another one of their games to die out and i dont know about you but i wouldnt like another triple a priced game to stop getting updates because paradox messed up looking at you imperator

lets take a look at the different aspects of the game also please ignore the little playtime i have on this account my actual play time should be around 200h right now

h1 economy h1
b oh god the economyb 
the economical aspect of the game can seem overwhelmingly complex for the people that are new into this kind of game but once you get the grasp of it you can start to see it is fairly simple too simple for sweaty tryhards basement dwellers  like me with thousands of hours in paradox games on our back it really gives the feeling of is that all it can become shallow at least for my personal taste i would like to see new trade goods implemented together with new technologies especially in the late game things like housing goods pharmaceutics tractors jewelry specialized machinery just to name a few

i dont want to give the impression economy is shit in this game it isnt industrializing an impoverished nation and watch how you become the top gspoilerdpspoiler is insanely fun however it becomes extremely tedious rather quickly you have to manually change everything which is extremely annoying especially if you have conquered a new state with different production methods this should be automated
on the other hand you have to be extremely careful when researching new production methods because the transition between production methods are immediate and not soft by any means this can make your whole economy implode i would suggest that switching between production methods should be something that happens in the span of weeks or months which would be more realistic and help with the transition this is implemented for military units so why not here

certain aspects need quality of life changes 
the game really needs to give you more information in some aspects what is the average wage in your country what are the needs of my popsone mod that really improves qol in this regard is visible pop needs
what has been my economic growth compared to the last year 5 years 10 years ago as percentage i know there is a graph but comparing your economy to other years could be a flavorful addition that gives more immersion

speaking of immersion and economic growth there is some inflation in the game but it is really hidden hidden in the way that when the standards of living increase so does the demand meaning prices will go up having an universal currency and a relative price with the same value in every single country which caps the maximum price means that inflation will never be a problem one of the problems of the countries in this time period was inflation and how money printing fast growth that suddenly crashed and warfare hindered the standards of living spoiler sol important concept in gamespoiler it could be fun and immersive if the players has the chance to devalue its currency to finance its war or maybe construction projects
the game would be more challenging giving more depth to your actions so you think twice when you decide to invest hundreds of millions in construction projects putting more currency in circulation it would also help with the unhistorical growth rates that you can achieve in the game although it could be too overwhelming for beginners

also that i find extremely funny and unrealistic is that pop needs dont depend on the region that means someone that is in alaska has the same food intake heating and clothing consumption as someone from north africa

h1 land warfareh1
bthis is a war to end all wars well kindab 
i think this is probably the part of the game in which victoria 3 really excels at what can i say i love it spoileri am jokingspoiler


the war system as it stands now needs to be thrown out of the window i am for real i see paradox is trying to address this problem implementing military improvements stop if this game had something akin to hearts of iron 4 front lines system it would have been a 90 review game at lunch even with the other problems it has

i have really tried to think something positive and fun about the current war system and i just cant
you might have seen by now some other reviews disliking the war mechanics they are right 
warfare in this game means selecting front lines sending generals and then doing absolutely nothing that is all the impact the player has it is little to none it is really a lost opportunity 

it is a buggy math game in which you need bigger numbers to beat the enemy and then there is a lot of rng involved sounds fun well not to me at least

i have never been a war score fan in any of the paradox games but this is the worst game in that regard it is so underwhelming when facing a stronger enemy then accomplishing to turn the balance in to your favor and just getting started on the counteroffensive and then war suddenly stops because they have fulfilled their war goals i dont know about you but i dont like my games blueballing me
i like a concepts such as war exhaustion and war support depending on the total  of people killed and wounded in recent wars and the lose of sol during conflicts
if the war exhaustion gets too high the players should decide if they want to double down to win the war even if they are losing
risking more if he loses the war and possibly civil war if the unrest gets way too high or going home giving the victory to its enemies the war goals should be dynamic as the war progresses if you want you should be able to make new war goals with a increased infamy cost just like victoria ii they should add as well peace conferences similar to eu 4 or hoi 4 in which the different sides can negotiate the concessions they will give once the war is over war goals getting a reduced war score cost different kind of war score than mentioned above something more similar to eu 4

h1 naval warfareh1
bspanish armada more like sunken armadab 

naval warfare faces the same problems as land warfare much math and little joy

it is absurd that russia can traverse the pacific ocean and reinforce the front line of american countries without you being able to intercept it
one thing that the game really gets right and i have to acknowledge it is that you can completely cripple an economy by convoy riding you can also intercept the land units supplies making them less combat effective which is also a nice touch
however just like land warfare it needs some changes you should be able to at least customize your fleet composition and have different kind of ships that fulfill different tasks

h1 to be continuedh1

#####

i want with all my heart to recommend this game it had a rocky release not super well received on steam but i enjoyed it because i believe its the framework for something great

for the 11 patch they introduced a bug that makes capitalists be permanently politically inactive this completely breaks the game in ways it wasnt even broken on release this is something easy to spot if you play test the game at all this was reported on their bug report forums almost immediately

two days later and it has not been hotfixed modders have fixed it though it makes me wonder why paradox gets to keep all the money and the modders that are fixing what theyre shovelling out get nothing but extra homework with every patch

#####

this is really hard because i love the idea of an economic game that doesnt focus on war with effort and ten years this will be the greatest paradox game of all time

for starters i initially loved the new war system however after playing with it i now agree with its detractors that its way too simplistic and lacking any real depth the meta is to simply raise all your armies and make sure they all have better tech and numbers than your enemy fronts are created randomly and i have no idea how troops are assigned along the front line i disliked victoria iis micromanagement of armies but this game takes it too far in the other direction simply porting over the frontline and battleplans mechanics from hearts of iron iv would work perfect for this game

on the other hand the economy involves too much micro even as a capitalist country youre a command economy as you build  ieveryi isinglei ibuildingi even setting it to autobuild merely expands existing buildings and doesnt actually build any new ones in different provinces the only difference between capitalism and communism is that maybe some of the money used to build things may come from the capitalists as well thus reducing the total cost to build it but the impetus on building things is on you 

for a game about creating a dynamic economic system and simulating the lively social changes and pressures of the 19th century the game feels very dead youre not reacting to the pops more as the pops are reacting to you governments and politics are a joke as you can add or remove interest groups willynilly with no real consequence thus your opposition immediately becomes your ally therefore paying attention to who wins an election is pointless as you can simply change what a party believes in after it is already in office 

likewise the game suffers from a bunch of small issues that individually dont matter much but taken together add up to feel very halfbaked and incomplete cities are named after people or places decades after the actual start of the game or simply placed in the wrong geographic place borders are likewise oversimplified or outright wrong west virginia is a state of america at game start even though west virginia didnt exist until the american civil war nearly thirty years after game start when it broke off from virginia 

likewise the acw is nonsensical with states like new york joining the confederacy i understand wanting the game to be dynamic but this is too much the game already tracks free states vs slave states so why not include a simple modifier that makes free states way less likely to secede other countries such as japan china or russia make extremely ahistorical and memey decisions and their ai is likewise braindead and lacking any initiative 

things like abraham lincoln being president at 28 legally you cannot be president until you are 35 or random events that i suspect are supposed to make each playthrough more unique currently treat the subject matter like a joke abraham lincoln shouldnt be a serial killer because of a random event this game needs to treat its subject matter more seriously and reduce the amount of joke events that make real political leaders and historical figures bumbling bafoons or cartoon characterizations like in crusader kings 3 for a game that includes racism and slavery the use of random events and modifiers with real historical figures is a jarring contrast that cheapens the impact of the world it intends to portray

in terms of length i found two hours had passed and i was already 50 through the game thats way too fast because of a lack of deep systems the game feels like its running on ultraeasy mode the solution isnt to give the ai unfair buffs and cheats on harder difficulties its to make the game more complex and deep thus making the pace of gameplay slower and more methodical currently it somewhat reminds me of an iphone clicker game 

the ui is fresh but i hate the new lenses feature and wish for the old mapmodes that i could check on a whim i strongly dislike having everything be on the bottom of the screen as well i currently have to click on too many buttons in too many panels to get to what i want to see 

while i suspect this will be fixed with updates and dlcs the game feels shallow and lacks unique content and depth for the regions and countries involved

i do believe that if paradox doesnt abandon this game like it did imperator all these issues can be fixed but man thats a lot of issues and thats gonna take a lot of time

#####

short version good game will be great when finished came out too early recommended in its current state but maybe wait for a sale if youre disappointed with the state it was released in

to be completely frank this game should have had 6 more months in the oven and come out in what is now 12 or what is going to be 13 they should rightly get flak for releasing this as they did and currently the overall reviews 67 positive reflect that however they have a detailed update plan up to 14 that addresses pretty much every complaint i heard anybody have they just released 12 at the time of writing and the current recent reviews 73 positive are a good reflection of the improvements made by this update by 14 i wholeheartedly believe this will be one of paradoxs best games

#####

bro its been out for a couple months now can you release the 30 dlc that you guys say is optional but is needed to have fun playing the game now

#####

wait 3 years and then buy it

#####

i reckon the way i feel about this game is the same way that those who never played ck2 feel about ck3

pretty good but no idea what its missing

#####

people need to stop giving a positive review for a game that has potential years in the future and should start reviewing games as they are now

#####

i ll be back in 2040 to play the game when the game is complete

#####

being an economics sim is not an excuse to have some of the worst naval and land warfare systems ever thought up by mankind

battles taking 6 months to end with a couple of hundred soldiers fighting against 100k which holds up thousands of miles of a frontline enemy revolutions cucking you out of the land you went to war for peace deal bugs still in the game from launch

wait a decade before you buy or sail the seven seas

#####

another in an annoying trend of underdeveloped paradox games that will take multiple dlcs at 2030 to be actually finished yet those dlc will be considered optional by paradox as a way to deflect valid criticism of their business practices

#####

i sadly cannot recommend this game 
its aim to simulate the economic systems of the victorian era was good but its execution and early release have resulted in a spreadsheet simulator 
immersion is also an issue the ai is not developed enough to simulate the complex  pivotal events in the 19th20th century and when conflict does escalate to war the players abilities are clunky unintuitive and frustrating
lastly paradox seem intent to release overpriced dlc for features that were included in victoria 2 on launch this includes 13 immersion packs for each of the major powers

paradox i beg you to put more development focus into the base game and consult the community  you will not be able to attract people to this product if its complete version is 70 including dlc

#####

tldr if youre tight with free time or money dont buy victoria 3 right now wait for at least one major expansion and thus few patches and community mods otherwise i recommend it as a truly unique economy simulator and imo its much better than v2

i liked v3 so far also have 1000 hours of victoria 2 on record but i expect many patches and some dlcs

at this point v105 the game looks like a great engine for an economy simulator i like it more than v2 but thats just it  bare skeleton without realistic history or flavour ai tweaks and balancing still are necessary
without more flavour the game lacks replayability because it would just look the same for every country

i really liked the way laws are passed although radicals seem to not enjoy the new laws that result in higher standard of living maybe incidentally it looks pretty realistic even for xxi century so now when a party with bad policies wins the election youre not screwed instantly and might still save your country in v2 playing in democracies sometimes was just waiting when the good guys with laissezfaire get out of power so you can finally build the economy and not just look at them wrecking your country also lf brings completely different rules here and playable

economy building is really fun and all these factories and farms with alternative recipes and kinda telescopic structure is a huge improvement from plain old v2 factories also gave me a strong vibe from factorio space exploration 
the way construction is organised needs some adaptation time from v2 but thats just more realistic and not as magical also goods like electricity transportation and services that were added to v2 by pdmapd mod but now in vanilla give much more depth

market is the best improvement from v2 no more absurdity with supplying your enemy with guns automatic embargo and magical teleport of global market dedicated importexport trade routes with land and sea connection with distance also being important factor  great as well although i hope theyll add limits to trade agreements shouldnt be very hard but they might be saving it for dlc because otherwise they present a serious issue with import wrecking your internal producer and export exhausting your internal supply for this good again that resembles real world economy but i wish i could control it at least to some extent
another thing i wish i had  some kind of national stockpile which was present in v2 but veeery inconvenient there may be some issues with how ai will use it

investment pool and capitalists contribution looks like simplified solution to otherwise very complex property law paradox stated it in their dd that its not possible to fully implement this mechanics realistically and i kinda get it yet i hope it can evolve into something more realistic for example not a fan of state capitalism both irl and in game but i believe if you build a factory with your governments dollars it makes no sense that the profits should go to private citizens or bureaucrats in staterun mode instead of the government itself and no foreign investments yet v2 had them only since ahd which makes satellites and soi not as useful

really like the context popups with calculations inputs outputs how they affect market and what the price would be not super precise for long term outcomes but really helpful as an instant approximation

overall ui is kinda unnecessarily complicated some things are hidden inside few embedded pagesmenus not everything can be pinned and doesnt give you all of the information 100h in still searching for detailed pop needs and how they are satisfied id say for the game of such niche it certainly lacks spreadsheets and ledgers ive seen some ui mods not tried yet

i feel like i should touch all this warfare argument people are having
so i liked the diplomatic part but i didnt like warfare part its incomplete its sometimes counterintuitive it definitely needs more work
at the same time im really confused why some people hate it that much especially when they claim they played v2 if v3 warfare is as bad as you claim what is that primer youre comparing it against v2
well vanilla v2 warfare was crappy old crap it resembled medieval crusade without any notion of a frontline i clearly remember aivsai trying to occupy as much of the enemy land as they can with 0 battles whatsoever it was not until years after release iirc only after many patches and ahd that devs taught ai to first try deoccupying own land before marching on the enemy capital yet it still evaded all the battles not trying to hold any feasible frontline making it a little less crappy but still crap victoria was always very weak at warfare and strong in economy thats why v2 was my favourite paradox title as the only game about economy not war and mappainting but frankly at least this v3 incomplete buggy warfare has a frontline id take it every time over medieval crusade crap of v2

another important point is that the game starts lagging pretty noticeably somewhere in the 1880s so midgame yet even lagging its not as broken and bankrupt as v2 was at this time yep all the ais except for gb were constantly bankrupt at that point

i get why it has mixed reviews rating i guess for many people this frustration over some aspects of the game is just a general frustration of paradox policy to release betaversions as a shippable product and then making it complete with free patches and paid dlcs and many more community mods over few years

swearing that i wouldnt play more v2 back in 2016 after all dlcs and pdm updates because of constant frustration set my expectations of this one to modest and sceptic so seeing it as it actually is kinda gives hope

paradox and its fans are on damage control trying to claim these negative reviews arent genuine the game is broken on a fundamental level important aspects like stockpiles or inflation are absent from the game the economic part of this game is tedious and requires an absurd amount of micromanagement which is made even worse because of the abhorrent ui paradox apparently lacks the technology to let you simply have two windows side by side so expect yourself to have to be opening and closing menus constantly im not even kidding when i say thats 90 of this game its not an excel spreadsheet simulator its like everything you want to look at is placed in a separate cabinet and you are constantly opening and closing them one at a time to do anything 

and the funny part is i like the economic side playing as japan and slowly industrializing and balancing youre economy is crazy fun but thats completely absent from the majority of play throughs because youre usually stuck in some massive british market with endless goods for whatever you want there are game play decisions made that are so baffling i cant tell if its a bug or an intended feature like raising your tax efficiency being a net negative to the budget or the fact that major nation statistics like literacy or arable land being hilariously wrong you know how nations like japan went to war to acquire resources their home nation couldnt support well good news paradox got all the numbers wrong so youre probably going to be able to spam all the coal iron and whatever crops you need regardless of the geographic location 

the warfare is as broken as everyone said it was going to be the front system is a joke islands sit on their hands with their screen flashing them about their generals doing nothing and asking them to assign them to a front but no fronts exist only to have their enemy invade their lands and create a now undefended previously non existent front that they of course instantly win oh and good news combat width still exists but because tile combat is gone this applies to massive states that hold millions of people but cant support a few thousand soldiers oh and ports arent needed for supply wanna invade an island halfway across the world with no ports well good news distance doesnt exist and your units will simply teleport invading japan as the uk is just as easy as invading portugal even if they have no ports for you to supply your units from oh and this distance doesnt exist also applies to colonialism so enjoy the fact that america and easily take new zealand just as easy and cheap as if they were finishing off oregon

i could go on for ages this is an unpolished mess of a game from a developer with no self respect or pride with fundamentally broken game play decisions made by out of touch developers who are probably going to charge you dlc to fix it in the future

before you try to build trains and guns maybe try feeding your populatiоn

#####

itll be great in five years

#####

played practically 2 full games so far and can say that even a year on this still needs a lot of work i would not currently recommend it

warfare is painfully terrible at first i was sceptical of the new army system and removing physical units from the map after experiencing it i honestly like it a lot more than i expected because micromanagement gets so tedious in other paradox games but other aspects of war make it completely unenjoyable for me first of all economic factors seem to not have any impact on war in a game where the economy is supposed to be everything you can run an enemy into millions in debt and they still are able to continue fighting like nothing is wrong and yet if you take too long to capture a war goal in an offensive war you are winning the game will force you to automatically capitulate to enemy demands from war exhaustion even if you have suffered no occupation minimal casualties and no economic damage naval warfare is also incredibly pathetic and lacking which is ironic for a game focused largely around britain in the 19th century

#####

came back to try this out after some dlc dropped to see if the experience improved it didnt this game is gorgeous shame it sucks

original review

like paying full price for a house but just getting a good foundation instead 

so far this game is boring tedious and without flavor consider buying later after a few hundred dollars worth of dlc comes out

#####

i feel like a beta tester to be honest

#####

the amount dopamine i get from making my gdp go up is dangerous

#####

sorry paradox until you fix this game im not buying another product from you

#####

im enjoying it but its got those trademark paradox bugs if you want a flawless experience buy the game in 6 months with a discount

#####

the beta is super fun cant wait for full release

#####

its a game without a soul right now 

paradox has overdone it this time with streamlining the game ive entered wars without noticing it diplomacy just happens and has no impact expect throwing up one small banner amongst 20 others trade and the economy are so abstracted that you just press the buttons that make the line go up theres really no thought nor strategy necessary to play this game

the game is also completely unstable lategame i have 16gb of ram and it eats all of it leading to crashes literally every 23 minutes by the year 1900 hopefully itll be a good game 3 years down the line but cant recommend it right now

#####

wait a year to buy
edit wait another year to buy

they cant even let you keep your save games between updates apparently there goes so many hours of games with friends

#####

my opinion of the game is as mixed as the overall review ranking at the time of writing this its also very subjective as is the opinion of everyone writing these remember that when reading these

tldr

it is as martin himself put it on a stream recently vic3 is basically if factorio became a grand strategy
im having fun and i loved vic2 it still satisfies that need even if the game feels unfinished in many ways 


caveat
list
 ive only done games as japan netherlands prussia and prussia released poland which does limit my understanding of how fleshed out everything is as is the case with most people writing these reviews anyway
 my favourite modern paradox game is stellaris followed by ck3 favourite older title is vic 2 what a surprise this should help frame the lens im looking through
list

bad
list
 flavour  fairly noticeable lack of flavour eventsjournal entries  youll get the land reclamation decision as dutchland fully commit to shinto as japan unite germany as prussia  other german countries so basically 1 key decisiongame mechanic per country
	list
	 saying that its a tad annoying but by no means has it ruined the game for me
	list
 vassals  vassal annexation only occuring via diplomatic play which requires you to decrease yup you read that right your relations with a vassal
	list
	 it makes sense since it gives surrounding powers the ability to intervene but i would like to see that sytem fleshed out and the honestly weird decrease relations requirement removed
	list
 war  the war system is pretty basic theres almost no way to influence a front outside of packing all your troops into 2 leaders one offense one defense and then go smash through frontlines if you have enough troops
	list
	 if you dont just defend and let them tire themselves out
	list
 ai  ai prussia needs to learn to be a bit more chill about unification they can just improve relations with all minors and theyll themselves ask to unify instead of getting absolutely smashed by austria  russia any time they try and absorb an opm through war
	list
	 its by far not the only problem with the ai but its the funniest one ive seen
	list
list

good
list
 the core loop is fairly fun
 im very much getting the nostalgia hit from vic 2 obviously its a different game but it satisfies that need
 using speed 5 in this game feels like a waste theres a lot to do sometimes its just busy work
	list
	 in some ways same as ck3 although there were some s5 times there
	list
 if you like optimising production then this game is for you factorio
 it actually runs on arm macos lowmedium settings at 12 resolution but very stable 30fps could probably make it look better but im fine with it for now 
list
 compares to ck3 with 317fps on same settings it makes a big difference
list
 you dont need ironman mode for achievements
	list
	 you still lose them if you attempt to cheat or swap country like ck3
	 but you wont lose your entire save because saving went wrong or your computer hates you looking at you eu4

 community
list
 no matter what paradox would produce the community was going to react in this mixed way damned if you make this a map painting sim damned if you shift focus away from map painting
 honesty its kind of tiring sometimes but if anything it shows how much we all care about the games paradox puts out
list
list

closing notes and thank you if you actually got this far

to everyone who played 1000 hours of victoria ii so have i look past your reverencelevel nostalgia to understand how many issues that game had with it
i have several thousand hours in dota ii doesnt make me a leading authority on it in fact it just cements how bad i am

the game needs fleshing out that much is clear but just like ck3 it feels like they got the fundamentals right rather than try to add 700000000 systems that barely work together at the start
this is a drastic change from how eu4 ck2 and even stellaris felt 
although unlike ck3 there is a lot of complexity in the game and i appreciate how closely some of the systems are linked together 


#####

fool me once paradox

here we go again  another cash grab by the pdox team  i was tolerant with euiv ck2 although my patience waned with euiv and stellaris  but im not going through this again

heres the formula  release a bare bones stripped down game which really has limited enjoyment or replayability with many key features missing  slowly over many years release dlcs which contain said key features players originally bought said game for  overcharge for them  rinse repeat ad naseum

im really kind of tired of this  the only option here is to do what i should have done with the other game releases  wait for a crazy sale and then buy it a deeply discounted price  the original amount i paid for this base game should have gotten me a relatively complete game  not a game missing 60 of the features that were expected to be in it

#####

how to even start with this game 

500 hours in and i now feel the need to speak up my normie views imagine the following 

the game is hard really hard for the first 10 hours at most after that the game pretty much plays itself its a complete mess 

the game is both refined and unpolished its easy to understand and extremely complicated its basically a walking contradiction 

i can play as basically every nation and get 1b gdp by 1890 as there are so many ways to completely break this game especially after 12 with how the new investment system works do you ever want to completely overpower everything in the game first tax the shit out of the people then try to get laissez faire asap and bolster trade unions congratulations you beat the game the fact that you can just remove military barracks for any revolution preemptively if you know where they spawn is peak game design 

theres literally only one way to fuck up and thats if you are overwhelmed by all the eyecandy the game throws at you over half of the graphs and buttons are forgettable or if for whatever reason your 100 men with 100 offence cant break through 10 guys with 20 defence but thats just genius game design to not snowball out of control problem is if you know what to do its not even hard to do warfare either spam crappy low tier stacks for naval invasions everywhere since the ai then goes completely ape and pulls mostly everything they have on those tiles where only a handful of your military is or you capture the capital asap sadly this is the only good thing about the ai since if you have a coastal capital they will naval invade it 

another fact that makes the game way too easy is that you can starve out basically every great power with a couple of ships just spread them around a bit for convoy raiding and boom britain just lost 200m gdp in a month and since the ai doesnt consider economical damage as a reason to peace out the war you can bomb them to the stone age pretty early on from which they can almost never recover 

but the main reason im making this review is to talk myself out of the rage for paradoxs policy of releasing early access games and then dropping dlc after a few patches which barely even changed anything in the game like seriously what i described above worked on day 1 and works even better now they release some interesting things but nothing that restructures the game to have any kind of challenge even the fact that you can earn achievements with mods and without ironman is already speaking for itself there are already many cheat mods for the game but in all honesty its not even needed if you arent gonna try to play to smallest mirco state that exists 

and the fact that this new immersion pack is gonna cost 15 euros is just beyond any reason 

if the game wasnt easy enough and basically every game ends the same the only thing really hindering you is the game itself namely the performance its extremely bad why because of hardware limitations nope its the game itself imagine my 2080ti and i9 9900ks and 32 gb of ram isnt enough to run it past 1880 without lagging as all hell paradox thought that cluttering the game with as many background information as possible is gonna make the game more enjoyable but think of this are the 213 manchu pop in my kanto state really necessary to be counted towards anything apparently imagine multiculturalism with tons of cultures migrating to you just for them to recognized individually instead of having something like immigration pop where all migrating pops are counted for 

another thing is that if you ever build too much the map gets cluttered in 3d buildings which also takes a toll on the performance same thing with warfare if theres ever a war happening which you didnt look at you get like 100 map notifications that there was a battle 50 years ago pretty genius 

all in all its a bit contradictory to play the game as much as i do just to leave a bad review but since im a mod player anyways and that there arent that many mods that really interest me besides the great rework it stays mostly vanilla 

so yeah i really dont recommend the game as it is i myself really love grand strategy but its just not worth it not even for one quick round as you will soon realize that the game forces you to play longer just because of the performance alone so dont buy maybe on a steam sale for 50 percent off but dont expect paradox to make it that easy for you im looking at you hoi4 with by blood alone

#####

a shadow of the game it should be made into the game it could be by dlcs that shouldnt be bought 

you should feel bad about releasing this kind of game paradox

#####

dont buy yet wait for dlcpatches
the economy is ok but a lot of the core mechanics and ui feel really unfinished
also there are game breaking bugs and the ai is terrible
best to save the interest for when its actually good
i regret buying it so soon

#####

early access game see you in 3 years

#####

a command economy plays 100 exactly the same as a laissezfaire economy thats all you need for a review about a deep economic simulator 
people are in awe because demandsupply and competitive advantage is moddeled in game ok
standard paradox buy policy here wait for a ton of patches and dlcs unless youre a paradox sucker like me thats right you know who you are

#####

legacy review from before 15
its a decent game but the devs have really shot themselves in the foot by introducing by far the worst combat system i have ever seen in a paradox game the economic mechanics are deep and interesting but despite what the devs might think warfare was a huge part of the victorian era so the warfare being absolute garbage to take part in is a gigantic downside that legitimately makes it hard to enjoy the game
updated review
since the 15 update ive found the reworked warfare system to be much more enjoyable than before and while i would still prefer a return to hoi4 or vic2 style direct control the new system provides so much more agency to the player and allows you to actually plan things out while i will continue to hold out hope for an eventual ending of the handsoff warfare its no longer the travesty that it was and i can recommend this game in good faith

#####

an unfinished shallow empty boring monotonous overpriced vessel of complete disappointment 

the only major expansion so far is releasing almost two years after release and this game totally lacks content flavor and things to do which you need in a video game the game feels like a passing of time simulator at its current stage and this makes my trust in paradox as a development studio deeply undermined

a game such as this is nowhere near its ridiculous price tag of 50 if paradox wants to release shallow unfinished games they should price it accordingly im tired of buying a busywork filled video game and waiting months just to have actual entertainment locked behind a paywall

for those looking currently for a good victorian experience play victoria 2 or play the medieval 2 total war mod dont submit to paradox

#####

its another paradox classic release a new version of an older game with 10 of the features and effort of said game overcharge for it and slowly release the other 90 of the game as overpriced paid dlc over the next 5 years

the entire business model of this company is to abuse its loyal fans and milk them for all the money they have

honestly either buy victoria 2 or if youre not already tangled up in the paradox paradox then give this one a miss

#####

the crash reporter crashed

#####

at first i hated this game i come from eu4 and stellaris and was used to a more empire building map painting gameplay loop i found it boring but then i actually learned how to play it and its actually very fun and keeps me coming back i like the economics and politics the art direction and sound design i think is its most underrated success the visuals and audio immerse me into the 19th century easily my favorite paradox map ui and sound design

its definitely still hollow and there are a ton of immersion features and flavor needed diplomacy is pretty bad and bare bones its a very limited amount of interactions and the war system is much worse than other paradox games but the potential is there with better diplomacy and war i could actually see this game becoming one of my favoriteseventually

#####

its a cookie clicker pretending to be a grand strategy

80 of the gameplay is clicking on buildings to build more buildings so that the gdp goes up

war system is a joke diplomacy is shallow there is no internal politics system
ui is abysmal it looks good on screenshots but is absolutely hellish to navigate

victorian lore nope spring of nations paris commune balkan wars not in this game go play vic 2 with hpm

updated as of 22 may 23

dont bother touching this its been half a year users delivered loads of feedback whats the response of paradox to make the game less shallow add flavour to one  country and hide it behind a 30 eur dlc price tag 

see you in 6 months

#####

if you played victoria 2 you probably wont like victoria 3
if you didnt play victoria 2 you probably will like victoria 3

#####

wide as an ocean deep as a puddle

#####

ive been waiting for this game far too long
lets see what ive got for 50 euros

bugs  plenty of them
some popup menus with half text half variables from the code
memoryprocessor usage insane high
as soon as im reaching around 80x the game starts to fail every now and then no matter what you do  just chilling or trying to mobilize all generals

lack of interest  basically the whole concept is to sit and click in different regions to build whatever you want  thats it
no events no content okay im lying  there are few like here is volcano explosion or there is some people died in mines but that is it nothing specified to country or specified to any historical event 

devs were talking so much about how happy they are to remove combat system  so all you have to think now is to decide what button to push for a general attack or defend just have enough batalions built and enough money in a pocket
on that your participation in any war is finished you can continue calmly build whatever other buildings you want
where are any events that could possibly trigger a war i dont know alaska calmly stays russian with no one trying to buy it until ai decides to declare war to have it fall of china opium wars  feels like it never happen etcetc
ai egypt conquered stambul in the first 5 years from ai ottomans that is another joke you may check on while you calmly build your buildings
for what we always liked pdx games is historical facts and events  this game doesnt know nothing about

your internal politic is as crazy and stupid as you can possibly imagine  just choose whatever law you want and pay attention to the groups involved so they want be too debuffed cancel serfdom in russia in first 2 years is even more easier than joining feodalism in ck2 starting for novgorod within a lifetime of first dux  which was always a huge joke in a community

relations with other countries are basically nothing  no diplomacy wars to make satelites any longer you either increasing relations or decreasing then make an ally or start a war

im certainly sure devs are saying now  guys wait for the dlc then another dlc then few more dlcs and we will add everything events trading politics we will fix the bugs and we will fix some crazy stuff happening around like you literally have built hundreds of sawmills which are fully occupied with pops but you are still lacking wood in thousands

however the game already costed 50 and how many dlcs should i pay for to at least be able to chill with building my various buildings around without the game falling down every 15 minutes
like whats the point to have a button mobilise everyone if it crashes the game and im forced to mobilise each single general one by one moreover the list of generals is long enough and you have to scroll from the top to bottom for every single one of thembecause after mobilising one the menu returns to the toppest and you need to again and again scroll and scroll

so after playing another 10 hours what could i add

the only option you have to play against ai who constantly buy every good from your market is the protectionism  export fee dont forget that the game doesnt have a button export fees on everything so you should manually click on every single good in addition to that you cant do so until you produce a good
without this a typical example would be
you produce 10000 of clothes
your pops need 7000
ai will be buying 10000
and you pops are basically lacking of clothes  walking around naked and angry

devs definitely have to look on adjusting hundreds of parameters
because the game doesnt make sense
so i want to build up my own country to produce all the goods to fill in my pops needs and get a good income from selling leftovers
but it is simply impossible
you are in a constant loop of lacking the goods
example
you built enough clothes factories to fill the pops needs
now you are lacking instruments to produce it
so you are building instruments factories
now you are lacking of iron
okay you are building iron mines
and guess what  now you are lacking of instruments which are being used in mines
and that is with every production line
moreover all of the buffs from the new technology doesnt help  they only make worse
because to apply a buff you need to use new technology method which again uses goods fex again instruments or engines or something else
but do produce engines you need to build engine factories which are again using this stupid instruments even more than the original buff you applied gives you

so you are in a constant loop of nonstoppable building
the only you do is clicking for different builds here and there nonstoppably
even during the war  because you have no any participation in it

this doesnt feel right for a grand economical strategy

if i want to play builder game i will play soviet republic or tropico or even pdx already has a great city builder simulator

#####

do not buy this game as of november 6th 2022

oh my god paradox how could you possibly release the game in such a state 

it is literally mind boggling you would put this absolute masterpiece of a game waiting to be fully developed into the hands of the consumers at this stage 

literally all you had to do was release it at the same time with an early access label to people who preordered and have us beta test it while you got your extra 612 months it needed

oh my god where to start


ive played about 10 playthroughs so far the most recent being 104

first 7 i just bungled and bumbled my way through the screens learning the core gameplay and what needed to be done with no real intent on finishing and willing to make errors but let me walk you through what ive learned so far of what needs to be fixed

followed by how much fun ive had so far in this broken gamestate



1st  the war mechanic is so unbelievably game breakingly bugged ill set aside the complete removal of tactical control for just a moment even though as a hearts of iron 3 black ice germany player how far from your roots can you get 

some examples of things that have happened in my playthroughs  my puppetcolony goes to war with a neighboring tribal nation but cant travel through my colonial territory on its border to actually get troops on the front this war has been going on 10 years now my puppet even has 3 borders with tribal uprising nation and me bankrolling them and they just dont know how to build a port to actually move troops there so endless blackhole of 1 million pounds and counting

sometimes you just cant invade a bordering province i had trabzon and needed to take ankara declared war despite huge huge infamy penalty cause it was so crucial to my russian objectives early game to encircle austria to have free reign in the asiatic steppes couldnt make a front line even though i could physically see a railroad between the provinces lore wise i said that turkey blew up the whole mountain range to make im impassible cause  this coupled with naval invasions being impossible is just insane

territories you have fully captured dont even stop colonizing and theres no way you can stop your troops from moving home or to a nearby across the entire atlantic objective so you have to micromanage them to go back every 50 days or less sometimes as the new land is being colonized and a new front opens with the same 2000 soldiers defending it every time


you can have a front superiority of 101 in numbers and 31 in techadvantage and it can stall out for a decade because theres only ever one tiny battle going on on the frontline even if its 1000 miles long  you just didnt roll high enough on the number of troops engaged in this tiny encounter roll 50x in a row

there are no defensive fortifications at all i just had a 300 battalion army storm gibraltar as france against 200 bats of defense fight lasted 6 days in a rice paddy and i won cause the battle was 3v3 batts and my tech was a little better          thus fell the rock  
in an era where defensive fortifications were the main deterrent for preventing ghastly wars in europe and a massive amount of the investment capital went towards fortifying lines of defense to secure borders the mechanic is just missing entirely

victoria ii combat was already the weakest part micromanagement of placing troops all over the world based on fragile supply lines and naval control lanes was difficult while actual command  control or bolstering your army nonexistent i expected a combination of something like crusader kings ii  victoria ii with a little hearts of iron iv what i got was a game so so so unbelievably bad it looks like a c tier gacha phone game developed in a 3rd world country that only plans on running for 6 months to scam people

im not even gonna do more than speedrun of how bad naval control is you cant sink enemy troop convoys navies dont really almost ever engage britannia rules squat and you can just completely forgo investment into naval units  all with limited penalties 

forget trying to put units where you want them thats out of the question entirely will not happen tiny little tribal province nearby blocks your access entirely which 

treaties  holy s how can the treaty system be this insanely bad oh my lord its bad like unbelievably so you can literally conquer the entire colonial empire of the uk as france but because you cant naval invade the province you have the release puppet cassus belli pressed their war score can never go below 0 and you need 100 to capitulate what it is literally impossible to take this territory literally impossible so the other option is take the capital ok goodluck ever having a successful naval invasion only possible in such niche scenarios like uk landing in 1836 china so now your war is unwinnable you literally cannot capitulate this adversary because you physically cannot capture the 2 little tile away from your incorporated colonial state being blocked by tribal folk and even if you dont ask for this demand to be accepted in the peace their warscore will never ever ever go below 0 which is neutral



2nd hahahahahaha the trade the trade the trade micromanage everything yourself but you have literally endless useless ui and nothing useful even the little things like monthly price report they dont even give you the common courtesy of at a glance being able to tell price up or down with a green graph up or down between the change just a coin that reflects huge changes so have fun reading every single one carefully every single month

no trade sorting of any useful type no filtering by profitable trade no alerts when profitable trades are available click through every single commodity every single week import and export and fix every single thing double fun when you set your whole economy up around free trade

this wouldnt even be that bad just obnoxious and needing polish until its 1870 and 5 wars are going on between different world powers all over and now whenever you open any trade screen it takes 20 seconds to load and 1040 more to click what you need to as it lags with a rtx 3090 on low graphics

and the worst part is victoria ii is my favorite paradox game out of all of them and this has the potential to be even better its just so so so unbelievably unfinished and halfbaked and needing work 

theres dozens of crash to desktops endless smaller bugs that arent playthrough breaking but so so so many core mechanics that literally are unplayable its like they never played their own title past 1840 once 

technology have fun with machine guns  electricity fully unlocked and optimized for use by 1875 the tree is so shallow and underdeveloped and clearly long playthroughs with any semblance of historical immersion or realism by the testers for the game were ever done the testers were probably so busy catalogueing bugs that it was an after thought to mention utter lack of realism

events and flavor

maybe in 5 years for 100 more there will be small parts of this 

or the mod community will do it for you again even though we will try to fix everything broken first and then have you derail all our progress with small idiotic almost meaningless patches


i reiterate do not buy wait wait wait 

paradox you should be ashamed for releasing this title in this condition

but the bones of a masterpiece are there and given time love and tens of thousands of unpaid modder hours and that gem will shine like the kohinoor stolen crown jewel itself so i wont bury your rating just leave this review as you enjoy my 80


edited i guees ppl see this in reviews so i fixed some grammar

victoria 3 is the longawaited sequel to victoria 2 a 12 year old cult classic although it was a buggy janky fundamentally broken mess the economy of victoria 2 was unique among games it featured a closed loop economy where every good bought or pound spent by one entity is a good produced or a pound earned by a different entity the entire thing operated and changed by itself you could not control it only influence it it had many bugs and design flaws but it was a truly unique economic system for a videogame the surrounding systems like diplomacy and war were simple and lazy in the old paradox style but just functional enough

in comes victoria 3 looking at it as a sequel to victoria 2 it disappoints in most ways the unique economic system is gone and the economy more closely resembles anno your goal is to grow your economy using your construction sector and your main activity is fixing the economic impacts of the last thing you did supply demand and prices change instantly nothing in your country happens without your input and you have absolute control over every production building in your country making new buildings and changing how they operate is your primary gameplay loop making you feel more like a middle manager than a country while balancing production methods in every backyard moonshinestill is fun once as a small country it devolves into tedious micromanagement quickly when playing anything larger than liechtenstein

the only thing that happens without your input is other countries setting up trade routes but this is mostly just infuriating because everything is in short supply and the ai is incompetent at growing their own economy these trade routes mostly just steal your resources and rarely if ever sell you anything of substance protecting particular goods could have been an interesting gameplay mechanic but it isnt you cant stop a good from being exported you can only embargo entire countries so trade boils down to you trying to steal resources youre short on the ai doing the same and you embargoing the ai if it starts stealing too many of yours devolving into isolationism becomes an appealing prospect if only to remove the micromanagement and instability

speaking of the ai in typical paradox fashion its terrible as a result singleplayer is a bland sterile experience you are playing in a sandbox with other kids but the other kids are just balloons with faces drawn on them it would be nice to believe that the ai will get better with some patches but this is unlikely given the reputation of paradox and victoria 3s game director the ai nations in victoria 3 are slow to grow constantly in turmoil due to mismanagement and regularly destroy themselves over the tiniest diplomatic disputes

those diplomatic disputes are probably the one aspect where victoria 3 actually has some interesting innovation most hostile interactions are no longer just a button but executed through a diplomatic play mechanic involving all major powers with an interest in the region diplomatic plays are a neat concept but they are sadly underdeveloped and let down further by the bad ai there is no real distinction between a small colonial engagement and major war in europe both become plays potentially involving every country with an interest committing their entire army its impossible to ensure a nations neutrality beforehand if you plan to simply befriend the other powers or convince them to stay out once its started good luck friendly nations will turn on you in a heartbeat during a play and major ai powers will join a diplomatic play for the most insane reasons the us will fight to the death to defend danish holstein in exchange for an iou china will sacrifice millions to keep an indonesian province out of dutch hands because they were promised war reparations the east india company will happily fight a war against its overlord over some border dispute between indian nations before magically returning to being an obedient dominion once the war ends

this entire experience is wrapped up in a ui more hostile to the enduser than a suicide vest tooltips can be helpful but the endless recursion of tooltips on your tooltips on your tooltips ad infinitum invokes an escherian feeling of endlessness that makes you feel more lost than before you started this wouldnt be as bad if these tooltips did not contain important information that cant be found elsewhere the game will only tell you the most important information at a glance such as the number of radicals in your country but make it impossibly difficult to find out exactly who is radical and what caused it

critics have said the game looks like a mobile game and while this is unfair to the gameplay the ui does lean heavily towards modern mobilefriendly ui trends lists and tables are frowned upon while grid layouts are preferred whenever possible the amount of information allowed on the screen at any one point is extremely limited forcing you to constantly swap between windows multiple lists simply cant be sorted at all and no list ever takes up more than a third of your screen width a full screen table with all the information you could want is anathema buttons are large and the ui scaling is very high by default unless you have a widescreen monitor in which case it defaults to unreadably tiny the game defaults to tree maps instead of pie charts suggesting that the ui designer had some very strong personal convictions about design without necessarily having the understanding of visual data comprehension to back them up

i have yet to mention the political system because it hardly matters unless you are trying to change a particular law thats affecting your gameplay like isolationism its possible to forget it exists entirely the interest groups controlling your government do nothing to stop you from changing the economy and eroding their power so the power of interest groups is just a result of what buildings you build rather than an interesting mechanic

ultimately the game is an exercise in making a line go up for the sake of the line going up every country plays exactly the same and there is no real payoff at the end warfare could theoretically provide something to work towards but the war system is so barebones clunky and dysfunctional that warfare is more frustrating than fun there is no micromanagement of units as that system has been replaced with automatic ai fronts but fronts split merge and disappear so much that the micromanagement is somehow just as annoying since the fighting happens automatically wars are heavily affected by arcane mechanics behind the scene that the player cant see or interact with such as the number of troops that participate in a battle or the direction a general advances the reward for dealing with this system is often lackluster since wargoals are decided during the diplomatic play phase and cannot be altered during the war

victoria 3 isnt a terrible game per say it is simply mediocre as a game and bad as a victoria sequel if it had been an earlyaccess indie game for 30 dollars under a different name it would have been received very well with praise for some of its innovative ideas and its potential as a released fullprice sequel to a cult classic developed by a major studio it is disappointing the arguments about its potential ring hollow in the context of a studio known for selling buggy halfbaked products that had potential but failed to deliver

if you are looking for a complex economic simulator this isnt it if you are looking for a game focused on diplomacy and war this also isnt it if you are looking for a cute annostyle economy game that you can play with friends so you can bicker over who ate all the tools in the market this is actually alright though buggy and overpriced

short version
leaving this review a bit earlier than id like but regardless id give vicky 3 a 710 maybe 65 i clocked a little under 700 hours in vicky 2 which was also my first paradox game and i think v3 is a worthy successor with the potential to become even better in the future for many people this future is already a problem tied to paradoxs dlc policy but though thats fair enough the continuing release of dlc isnt something i object to in fact im already looking forward to it the economy politics diplomacy and population mechanics are fantastic i like the new direction they took with warfare but it needs more work put into it the ai is standard paradox fare its unintelligent but i dont find it as offensive as the eu4 or hoi4 ai especially as those were on release id say this is an above average paradox release its certainly no imperator rome regardless of what some may say it gives me the same rush vicky 2 did in all the best ways

much much longer version
already v3 takes a lot of the core systems from v2 that made it so great and largely improves on them the pop system remains with in my opinion even more depth than v2s possessed thanks to the simulation of dependents meaning that women and children functionally exist and play a role now ive seen some people say that the transition from provincebased pops to statebased pops removes the actual depth and replaces it with an illusion of depth but i disagree the pops are all still there they still work the same all the religious cultural and economic diversity of the era remains and if anything has been expanded it is simply not as readily apparent when reading mapmodes though it can still be seen if you click on the states and examine their pops the diversity of pops not being reflected in mapmodes is its own much smaller issue but the pops by no means have less depth than v2

my thoughts on buildings are brief i like the change to full player control over construction and development the v2 capitalist ai was terrible at development and management and the player having complete control over their industry is to me an improvement your decisions feel more impactful and relevant than in v2

i think the same of the market system the complex spaghetticoded unrealistic single world market from v2 has been replaced by a series of national markets which must be linked using trade routes infrastructure and customs unions this is fantastic im not an economist i dont know if its a completely realistic and faithful interpretation of global trade but i know it feels better to me than the single global market did trade and markets also feel very impactful and can inflict sudden and dynamic turns on your gameplay as serbia i found myself suddenly kicked from the ottoman market destroying my economy and just as i was fixing it the austrians forced me into their market inflicting another blow i had to recover from your market is not static you must always be watching it and adapting to its changing conditions trading and building thats been the bulk of the gameplay for me and i love it ive seen people compare v3 to a citybuilder and in a way i agree with them however i dont consider that a negative thing v3 is like a citybuilder on a national scale with geopolitics included and i think thats fantastic

on the subject of geopolitics international relations in v3 have their ups and downs i consider the diplomacy a triumph a great improvement on elements taken from many other paradox titles including v2 eu4 and stellaris i adore the systems themselves though the ai makes frequent questionable decisions the war is well there i like the new war system i like the new handsoff approach i like the fronts i like how your commanders interact with politics and above all i like not micromanaging army stacks that said this is probably the area in secondgreatest need of improvement behind ai like every paradox game some limited player involvement in operational planning would be a nice inclusion but most of all i find the warfare a bit too opaque i was playing mp with some people recently and our moments of greatest confusion were always during wars why is my general only engaging with 10 battalions when we outnumber them 8030 across the front why is he engaging with low morale troops why do i suddenly lose a battle even though the bar went all the way in my favor it has wrinkles a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out but that doesnt break the game for me war and conquest were never my primary concerns

the political system is another marked improvement on pretty much every other paradox game interest groups are a great idea and well implemented you can really feel the power they have over your country playing a state that starts in a landowner stranglehold gives you a fun engaging challenge when it comes to reforming it really isnt as easy as a lot of the dev diaries and youtuber videos made it appear reform can be a slog and a struggle and as promised isnt always the best option at the moment political parties are good too and im glad paradox came around on including them but sometimes you can tell they were a late addition some of the ways they interact with igs are a bit jank but i imagine those will be easier to iron out than say ai or war ive seen objections to the fact that passing laws basically boils down to a series of dice rolls and i get the frustration with it but ive felt for a long time that most paradox mechanics are simply a series of dice rolls so it doesnt really bother me

lastly the ai oh paradox ai never change for we love you so much the launch ai is pretty dumb it takes weird states in peace deals and gets into fights it cant win but i wasnt really expecting anything else paradoxs ai has never been great especially early in a games life cycle but like most things about paradox games it gets better over time the hoi4 ai used to barely be able to naval invade and it still cant figure out the new supply system the eu4 ai often refuses to defend its land during war and can still hardly keep itself from debt spiraling every five seconds i find vicky 3s ai to be simply inoffensive most of the odd things ive seen it do have been more silly than frustrating i have high hopes for whatever lessons paradox can derive from its interactions with the now much wider playerbase and for how they can teach it to perform in the future

in conclusion victoria 3 is an above average paradox release major bugs are few and rare i find the game fun and engaging the systems have drawn me in and kept me hooked and i really feel like im presiding over a state of the era as i watch the engines of progress steadily turning while hopeful immigrants pour into my factories i get the same rush that made me love victoria 2 and made me a fan of paradox in the first place victoria 2 brought me into the grand strategy genre it drove me to buy eu4 ck2 and 3 hoi4 stellaris all of them and put in thousands of collective hours of gameplay victoria 3 isnt perfect but it is a good game it is by all means a worthy successor and it will only get better from here

30 years of getting enough iron mines to support your build queue 70 years of building nothing but railways and powerstations 0 years of interesting choices to be made

classic pdx game too boring and lackluster in the beginning wait till they release at least 10 dlc for this game to be viable

#####

i played euiv hoiv victoria ii  victoria iii
i own cities skylines crusader kings played some and stellaris
for most of these games i own around 5070 of dlcs

in other words i am not a stranger to paradox studios its games and its niche

this is the game i love the most but also the one that disappoints me the post

paradox is incapable of releasing a patch that wont crash beyond 1900

i have 16 gb ram nvidia geforce 3060 graphics card do not come at me with to upgrade your system

paradox get your act together until then i will leave a negative review

not that it matters to you

#####

this game is so lackluster every nation plays the same events arent engaging and there are no mission or decision trees you just spam laws tech  buildings and hope the revolution meter does not fill up if it wasnt for the popups you could run this game in the background

#####

enjoyed but theres a lot to work on and when they do work on it itll be locked behind a dlc

lets be frank youre either here because youve played paradox games before and wanted to see what vicky 3 is all about 1 or you are a fan of the genreera and wanted to dip your toes into a paradox game for the first time 2

1 if youve played paradox games before then you know the formula paradox releases a game that is bland barebones and uninspiring mechanics are buggy glitchy or outright bad at launch the game lacks content and were left really wanting to like the game but ultimately being disappointed
 however as paradox does they add content patch bugs and put out a bunch of dlc that we later need to separate into necessary to have a good time with the game and not really necessary but neat if you really want it 15 added major updates and much needed fixes and new mechanics 16 is promising much of the same eventually theyll start putting out dlc that ill wait to buy on sale and itll probably prove to be game changing and very enjoyable its just their mo and it appears vicky 3 is no different for all its worth i personally enjoy the game in its current state but i agree it is severely limited relative to its possibilities

2 if youve never played a grand strategy game and want to try a paradox game vicky 3 is a great place to start its one of their simpler games for better or worse and includes much of the ui quality of life that paradox has been nurturing over the years such as nested tips youll probably enjoy this game a lot more than the average paradox fan simply because youre not coming in with such expectations and paradox is bound to add a lot more content in the future just be warned that paradox is known for gatekeeping a lot of instrumental content behind paid dlc do with that as you see fit 

overall if youve read other reviews and youre still on the fence about it just buy it clearly the current negatives havent swayed your opinion and they are bound to get addressed over time if youre a paradox fan this shouldnt be new to you dont let it stop you if you really wanna buy the game wait for a sale if youre not convinced if youre new to paradox know that these issues come with the territory of playing paradox games the game is fun in its current state opinion and will probably only get better moving forward if youre still not so sure come back after 16 and see whats changed

edit 02072024
for those new to paradox i forgot to mention the incredible modding community paradox games usually encourage the steam workshop typically has a lot of mods that improve certain aspects of the game until paradox gets around to dropping an official patch many mods just add content to the game overall if thats what youre looking for

#####

edit let me add to this by saying i recommend this lukewarmly for people like me econ nerds victorian era geeks and fans of victoria 2 i dont consider this a good game btw i give it a 610 my primary reason for recommending it is that there are simply no other games like this other than victoria 2 i still think victoria 2 is better and i would recommend hpm over this but for so long people have made vicky 3 clones with rudimentary modding tools and now we have this that modders can build on its kind of bs but im still glad they made it 

as a modder a phd economist and a huge victorian era nerd this was my most anticipated game of all time

now normally i dont even leave reviews for these kinds of games with only 68 hours of game time but since the top review right now had 4 hours of gametime upon review i think 68 hours is more than enough

the majority of reviews right now are just saying this game is bad compared to vicky 2 after playing it for 4 hours and giving it a thumbs down ill actually compare the two in depth but for people who havent played vicky 2 victoria 3 is an incredibly high resolution historical simulator that has good foundations to be a great game but is horrifically unpolished and stripped down at launch

now to compare with victoria 2 point by point

bdiplomacyb hpm  victoria 2  victoria 3

this is probably the most stunning thing to me victoria 2 had an awful diplomacy system that involved clicking a lot of boring buttons to increase relations victoria 3 is essentially the same thing but you click less buttons however victoria 2 had the excellent sphere of influence system that vicky 3 should have built on not scrapped hpm went further and had excellent great war mechanics and other things given its been 11 years to go backwards on one of the most important aspects to improve of victoria 2 is really disappointing  i guess we will get it with dlc

bmilitaryb hpm  victoria 2  victoria 3

victoria 2s military system was awful and involved a lot of micro victoria 3 removes the micro but its still an awful system and is clunkier than i thought all you had to do was port over basic hoi4 fronts paradox i guess we will get it with dlc

bflavorb hpm  victoria 2  victoria 3

victoria 3 is so devoid of flavor its insane while each nation has one or two unique goals and 3 or 4 unique events thats basically it playing russia should not be as devoid of flavor as ethiopia i guess we will get it with dlc

binternal politicsb  hpm  victoria 2  victoria 3

im not sold on interest groups replacing parties its not bad but theres so few ways to interact with them after 11 years i expected better i do really like bureaucracy its a reasonable mana tool to have in the game authority not so much

bpopsb  victoria 3  victoria 2 and hpm
not much to say here more pops in victoria 3 that more accurately reflect the workforce i particularly like construction and shopkeepers

baib  hpm  victoria 2  victoria 3

the ai at launch is utterly horrific it feels like im playing in a dead world where nothing happens and on the odd occasion something happens it ends in a ridiculous circumstance

beconomyb  victoria 3  hpm  victoria 2 with caveat

now the most important part and ill say this if you are playing a planned economy in victoria 3 then the economic simulation is fantastic theres lots of things that need to be adjusted like the treatment of peasants not being realistic to the actual ruralurban migration  but overall it is excellent and thats the main part of the game and thats why i do recommend it

on the other hand there is no alternative to a planned economy in victoria 3 every economy is planned and i know theres lots of arguments for why this is but at the end of the day if im playing laissez faire or a planned economy it all feels the same to me

and that is a ridiculous thing in an economic simulation theres no rational agent investment 

all the other problems i mentioned are probably going to be fixed in dlc this problem of capitalist investment though is not likely to be solved as its game philosophy personally this breaks the game for me and i need to mod it

so overall im quite disappointed so why do i recommend this game because at the end of the day no other studio has the guts to create a game like this and if i have nothing to compare it to it is a one of a kind product and its a niche that im happy is being filled even if its not to my exact taste time to mod it i guess

#####

a reviewer labeled vic 3 as wide as an ocean deep as a puddle and i think that nails it right on the head

heres the thing victoria 3 is a good game at its core it captures most of the concepts that i wanted to make me happy enough to keep playing to me its done the bare minimum and given my knowledge of paradoxs business model i knew coming in that there were going to be features left out to be made into dlc further down the line

however what i am going to do is leave my thoughts here as a loyal pdx player of what exactly is wrong with vic 3 and how each of its largest three systems economics politics and diplomacy need to be improved

economics
this is the strongest part of the game the supply and demand aspects make sense and create a strong gameplay loop that gives you something to do at any given moment without the sd mechanics and the way it works at the moment im not sure id play the glaring issue however is that the economic mechanics dont move farther than that most features that are included are mostly static with no sliders to add customization for instance

 theres a noticeable lack of inflation despite minting being a feature in your budget if you had the ability to increase minting to run a surplus at the expense of inflation that would be amazing but its absent
 tariffs are static you cant increase the tariffs on specific goods to either protect more domestic supply or to corner the market of a rare good you can only use an option to protect domestic supply but the tariff is a set rate based on your laws

and chief among my complaints is the severe lack of consequence to any of your economic laws while i understand that buildings and designing your nations economy is the focus here every economy is a planned one laissez faire means the government you apparently isnt building on its own the capitalists are i guess it would take away from the gameplay loop but i cant help but feel taken out of the immersion

politics
politics and the interactions with your pops was my most anticipated feature while its cool to see parties rise and politicians take office ill admit that all of it feels so inconsequential which seems to be my common complaint with the game as a whole

the in government and opposition mechanic for interest groups makes absolutely no sense if im the us and the democrats are in office right now made up of southern planters and rural folk why is it then when the whig party kicks their ass in the next election i still get to say that democrats are in government and the whigs are the opposition the legitimacy barely makes a difference and if this is a serious political simulation then the whigs should immediately be transferred to the in government tab and the opposition should populate with democratic interest groups furthermore the opposition in general seems to have nothing going for it generally at least in american politics the opposition party tends to have an advantage in elections over the incumbent party why do some of these elections start with like 30 momentum for the opposition what determines that its baffling to see the whig party stay in office for 25 years its equally baffling to see the same president for over 20 years

these parties need to have more force not passing laws that the new party in power wants should be consequential to the player the president of the united states should not be the same damn person for over 24 years until he dies in office and is replaced by another random whig who remains for another 20 years while not passing any laws and winning elections with 70 every four years it just doesnt make sense party leaders should also be changing frequently so that there isnt a chance for the same political leaders to remain in office for far too long

diplomacy
its not the worst but i will always opt for eu4style diplomacy vic 3 has some similarities and they work for the most part the worst however is warfare now im not advocating for micromanaging individual army stacks like typical pdx games i think a dumbed down version of hoi4s front lines would work better than whatever this crap is 

not only is it extraordinarily difficult to know where you stand in a war but the battles offer no clear indication of whos fighting how theyre fighting where theyre fighting and how long it will take to stop fighting you have a front with 100 regulars and 85 combat advantage against 35 regulars yeah expect to make zero progress and see a bunch of tiny battles with like 2 vs 7 battalions and lose every single one for the next three years while you pour millions of dollars into a war and lose convoy after convoy without actually knowing where your trade routes are being raided because theres not one naval indicator on the map that clearly tells you where units are

paradox i say this because i love you you made the really bold move to remove the most prominent feature from all of your games for this system this is not how you win support for it

beyond warfare theres strength in the diplomatic play system i do like to see the dramatic countdown to war and getting a sense of who youre up against however i dont like that the defenders can add a war goal of their own and then rally a bunch of great powers to their side so that when you inevitably have to back down because youve overplayed your hand you literally have to concede as if you lost the war those should just be white peaces with a slight knock to your prestige or diplomatic reputation not enforceable war goals


conclusion
you might wonder why after all that im still recommending well thats because i actually really do enjoy playing vic 3 despite the glaring issues that sometimes make me very frustrated the fact of the matter is that pdx is 100 using some of these deficiencies as dlc for the future thats just how it is but there will also be plenty of free patches and content that will help this game really hit its stride at some point theres already several mods as well and i cant wait to play a modern day mod as vic 3 will almost certainly be the most accurate of the pdx games for simulating the modern world

vic 3 has a tremendous foundation that when expanded upon properly can be one of the best pdx games on the market for years to come its not there yet but with enough time im pretty confident it can be

#####

as of 15 victoria 3 is finally at a stage  that i would say where it should of been at release the revamp of the economy has added a level of complexity in line with victoria 2 making it intricate and exciting to master the military system revamp also made their new introduction of fronts to be something fun to watch and keep note of it is not too granular which could leave a sense of wanting if you are used to games such as hoi4 or eu4

laws also finally are something to consider and must be thoroughly planned through to shape the government to be more of your liking victoria 3 is a great game and now its on a firm enough foundation to go much higher

#####

the ui looks and feels like a bad mobile game individual sections are too large huge fonts and icons take up half the screen endless scrolling and 50 clicks and 35 seconds of scrolling to get relevant information a lot of times

the ai is braindead and does nothing half the game or does extremely stupid stuff which break immersion entirely italy when formed often does not unify the entire peninsula and never pursues austrian territories in italy ive seen italy ally austria immediately after formation more than once prussia is not capable of using the system pdox designed for the german unification and if it does even unify germany it does so by mindlessly conquering minor german states often pushing infamy above 100 and suffering countless coalition wars as a result realpolitik at its finest scandinavia forms 90 of all games i played american civil war either does not happen or the csa spawns with the entire east coast often avoiding the actual war even when it spawns usa never trades territory with canada and never defends texas nor expands at mexicos expense to current borders japan never westernizes or even does the imperial restoration ainu and sakhalin usually end up colonized by great britain or france more rarely russia taiping rebellion is successful more often than not and usually spawns in the northwest of china  theres many more such examples which completely ruin any sense of immersion

the war system in its current form is abhorrent the way frontlines work makes you want to altf4 every time a front split occurs armies sometimes teleport to their new destinations on front splitting meaning you have to wait 12 months to bring them back where they need to be battles and frontlines occupy valuable screen space right where the frontline should be meaning its impossible to accurately see where the frontline is just by looking at it assigning generals to fronts is a massive boring clickfest worst of all the game infuriatingly gives the side fielding weaker troops and advantage in troop numbers in battles meaning your advanced latest tech armies will often struggle against an outnumbered and technologically backwards enemy because the individual battles will give them more troops ai is shit ad upgrading troops meaning some major countries never upgrade past line infantry looking at you austria or skirmish if they were lucky enough to start with it

diplomacy is very lackluster and often feels like its more based on rng than anything else in diplomatic plays if the enemy backs down you only get your primary war goal with no way of enforcing anything else a lot of really basic demands which were present in victoria 2 are missing from the game subject interactions are nonexitent 

economy which was supposed to be the cornerstone of the game boils down to clicking market tab looking at what you are missing and building more of it very repetitive 90 of your gameplay will be spent doing exactly that loop

the only good thing about this 50 demo is the government tab which is actually fun even if laws are based entirely on rng sometimes id pass a 5 chance law on first tick sometimes i would never pass an over 50 chance law

i refuse to believe that after so many years in development paradox genuinely failed to see what a sorry state the game is in they gave us a barely working demo and charged us 50

im sure the game will get better with time but right now its a terrible game lacking basic features and with poor design in so many areas its not worth the price

#####

it doesnt really feel like im doing anything 

in other paradox games even if its just looking at a map watching units move it feels like im doing something yeah i can see how it might be fun for some people but i have no real genuine control over my armies i feel as though i have no genuine control over my industry i feel as though i have no genuine control over anything 

i shouldnt have 100 maximum control over the economy and i dont want that but it doesnt even feel like im influencing it i construct economic buildings resource gathering developments etc but it just doesnt feel like theres anything there it feels like all im meant to do is influence an excel spreadsheet 

there are no specific units or armies for me to control or micromanage in victoria 2 you had armies you had to manage their composition maybe i just dont understand the army in this game but i just give it a front and it either wins or loses 

it isnt meant to be heavily based on warfare sure but i shouldnt feel like a bystander in a war war is a consequence of failed diplomacy and economic stressors or whatever or maybe i just want to paint the map my colour but it feels like nothing it feels irrelevant 

diplomacy feels like absolutely nothing and one of the upcoming dlcs is titled sphere of influence that doesnt really give me a great feeling especially given spheres of influence were a major if not key mechanic of victoria 2 

come back in 10 years when its 10 on sale with all the dlc i guess

#####

as wide as an ocean as deep as a puddle

#####

this game has generated a surprising amount of controversy so while i normally dont bother with reviewing games i think its worth sharing my thoughts here given the focus on it and the difficult nature of evaluating this game which i would say overall is a flawed but still enjoyable game

for context i am a huge fan of victoria 2 and have played many hours of it outside of steam in addition to what is listed on my steam account in that context i do disagree with a couple of the decisions made in the development of victoria 3 but that being said the fundamental mechanics of this game in terms of economics politics and diplomacy are for the most part strong even if the game is also flawed as i see it there are 4 main gameplay pillars to this game which are varying in their level of polish and engagement for the player

h11 economicsh1 

this is the strongest point of the game the switch to marketbased economies from the unrealistic for the era global economy of vic2 is a big step forward and creates more interesting decision making regarding resource and goods production if you dont have the potential to extract certain resources in your land and you arent in a customs union with someone who does produce that resource you are going to need to trade for it which is limited by your bureacratic capacity so not an unlimited option or go about securing land that produces that resource either via war or diplomacy there is an argument that some resources are too common relative to history which can make the game a bit too easy for huge nations but for small and mediumsized nations the struggle to procure the resources you need to build your industry is real and engaging and tbf in vic2 if you had enough prestige you could just access goods from the global market anyways so big nations are always easier in this sort of game if you know what youre doing

the consumer and industrial good production chains are also far more complex than in vic2 and provide a constant need to think about how to balance and expand your industries to supply your market with needed goods for example in vic2 if i wanted steel i would build a steel mill which consumed coal and iron from rgos that i couldnt really interact with in vic3 if i want steel i have to build a steel mill which consumes tools coal and iron which to produce everything efficiently requires a tooling workshop iron mine coal mine chemical plant for explosives in the mines sulfur mine for the chemical plant logging camp for wood for tools railroads for transportation of goods to improve efficiency motor industries so the railroads have trains etc its much more in depth and requires more thinking on the part of the player to set up a successful economy since so many industries are codependent on each other in some way i can see an argument that it should still be possible for capitalists to build industries themselves it would certainly make things a little easier in the late game that said i dont think the player should ever be locked out of building factories like in vic2 laissezfaire as it is a key gameplay mechanic that should have player agency

h12 internal politicsh1 

the interest group system is at a baseline the most interactive internal politics gameplay mechanic paradox has created pops organize into igs based on their needs profession strata beliefs etc and those igs pressure or support you as you try to implement or remove laws and policies depending on the social and economic structure of your nation an ig that only represents 2 of the population might hold 30 of the power as is not uncommon with landowners in the early game in many nations the issue that remains here is balance the actual mechanics are solid but powerful igs as it stands are not dangerous enough powerful and angry igs need to be much more willing to revolt right now they are too willing to stand by as they lose laws and policies they like even happy powerful igs should occasionally come to you with demands if they think they can force the issue but these are balance tweaks that can be made and the mechanics themselves work well

h13 diplomacy and colonizationh1 

diplomatic plays are a great idea and are just the evolution of vic2s crisis system it feels accurate to the era that powers can choose to jump in alongside a smaller nation if it serves their larger geopolitical interests even if they dont have an official alliance or pact however there are balance issues at play here where it seems like currently major powers are a little too eager to jump in to help minor nations particularly in the early game this should probably be looked at and toned down a bit so that huge wars arent breaking out over minor colonial conquests similarly it would be nice if minor colonial conquests across the globe were treated a bit differently in the system compared to a nation trying to conquer a minor that borders a major power

i also like the ability to diplomatically influence nations into your customs union joining them with your market however it does feel like there needs to be a way to defend your customs union diplomatically as it stands you just have to hope that if you maintain good enough relations with them that they wont agree to join another majors customs union

h14 warfareh1 

this is undeniably the weak point of the game and where a lot of the complaints come from for one thing warfare is buggy ive had generals unassign themselves from fronts randomly and other bugs that make war unnecessarily frustrating

fundamentally though this is the one area of the game where i think the mechanics need an overhaul as opposed to just tweaking and balance i understand the move away from army micro as it did not represent early 20th century warfare well but the new system lacks player agency as the fronts are all autogenerated and the player cannot direct their generals much beyond basic attack defend and stand by commands what i would suggest is more of a hoi4 light system where the player can draw their own fronts if they wish and can direct attacks along specific approaches battle planning essentially manually garrison areas create fall back lines to defend etc i dont think the return of army stack micro is truly necessary but a better frontline system with more player agency is needed

the final thought i would note is that there is a valid complaint regarding lack of historical flavor for many nations that said ive always felt that mods were primarily what added flavor for vic2 so it isnt that surprising and nations do feel different to play already if they have different resource potentials interest group power dynamics and laws with tweaks to how impactful powerful interest groups are they would feel even more different but i would certainly welcome more historical flavor myself

if you played vic2 or other strategy games primarily for the economic components and internal politics i would recommend vic3 if you are more focused on war i wouldnt recommend it for you at this time fundamentally its a game with a solid economic political and diplomatic base that needs some tweaking to resolve its flaws plus a larger overhaul of warfare

#####

im writing this review on march 13 the day when version 12 was finally released so i can finally declare
h1 victoria 3 is now fun h1

we absolutely should criticize paradox for releasing an obviously unfinished product however update 12 fixed pretty much all the annoying bullshitry from the original version the ai is no longer lobotomized and plays aggressively laissezfairemulticulturaism is no longer stupidly overpowered performance and ui are massively improved with private construction taking out a big chunk of tedium from the game also the new war score system removed much of my frustration with the infamous war system which is a bhugeb win

tldr  the game is now what it shouldve been released as 45 months ago and its a pretty damn good game

edit another thing i havent mentioned is the bawesomeb change to not requiring ironman to get achievements it has been a staple of paradox game design for a idecadei since eu4 was released and until victoria 3 i never realized how awful of a mechanic it was people urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvft5bycasq24 clowned url this change when it was announced saying that it would make achievements pointless which they already are there is software that would unlock them for any game in one click instead it unlocked a goldmine of lost potential with achievements that are fair but tough and arent just excuses for cheese exploits and crashing your game to savescum the rng
i need to say that the current achievements are pretty unimaginative but we can see that devs would get much more creative later on as they did with hoi4 and eu4

#####

victoria 3 is finally out and it must be one of the most average games i have ever played in my life

heres the thing despite the negative review i am leaving i cannot deny i am having fun the game if you want a game about watching numbers grow and developing a country from a small agrarian whatever state to the global marketplace of the world this game technically fulfills that purpose i love expanding my lands and subjugating people into my empire i feel this game is slightly more flexible in its diplomacy than vicky 2 even the economy is slightly hard to grasp but once you do you basically play a game of balancing and satisfying the needs of your population government and army and it does this

however i cant deny this game is frustrating to play fundamental mechanics of the game leave a lot to be desired for starters politics are a chore having to play game of chances just to pass a law is way more infuriating than it sounds i found myself restarting games and reloading saves because i lost the chance game i also tried to boost my desired pops to mitigate the power of interest groups who i wanted to get rid of but sometimes those who you want to disenfranchise despite you doing your absolute best will sometimes for whatever unannounced reason come back and wreck your progress which leads us to the menus which are both ways too stuffed with useless info and simultaneously lacking information you would like to see the war system leaves a lot to be desired they wanted to automate it and leave the computers to do all the work but even so i found myself fighting with the game as i wanted to assign a certain number of battalions to a front to protect myself but i couldnt because the computer strips you too much from involvement and it makes war feel like its something out of your control theres also an astounding lack of content which makes countries feel a little too samey

i wanted to leave a positive review so badly because i did enjoy my time with this game but be reminded that this game costs 50 dollars not forgetting the other 20 if you havent bought the premium edition put in that the fact that paradox will eventually fix these issues with expensive dlcs that we cant even guarantee will be good or fix the game and well i just cant in good faith recommend victoria 3 especially not in its current form i do hold hope that paradox will address a lot of these issues just as they have with every other paradox title in existence but thats not today and whenever i see the game change ill change my review until then wait for the game to be more polished  


#####

if this were an open beta i would recommend it since they are selling it as a full game i cant

#####

didnt quite realize its game about balancing resources its great time waster to play whack a mole with production of everything

interface is quite frankly horrible crusader kings 3 and stellaris are piece of cake compared to this im not an ui expert but major overhauls needed im constantly spending time trying to find things rather than playing

ill give this game 6 out of 10 schmeckles for now it scratches that grand strategy itch but theres much room for improvement feels more early access than full priced game

#####

ahh vicky 3 finally one of the map games of all time

another terrible map simulator which in the future will use dlc spamming to rob us of our money all the while filling us with endorphins paradox knows my weakness well

its like city skylines but with a world map paradox once again promised mountains yet delivered molehills despite its flaws its pretty good

it gets a timid thumbs up from me its more addictive than opium and has stolen many hours from me that i could have used to increase my standard of living

the simulation aspect is great  the flavor aspect is poor  if you want it for the economic and political simulation its a buy  if you want it for cool events and location specific challenges beyond the simulation then wait  i like it for the simulation so imo its more than worth buying right now

every country effectively plays the same qing and prussia have the same progression choices the only difference is that prussia gets a head start the actual building up of a country is as far as i can tell basically flawless and the economic side of things works really well its like night and day compared to victoria 2 

building up a small nations economy slowly and specialising into filling a niche in a larger market feels great its actually quite fun to play as a minor nation something which pdx had never nailed before ive been really enjoying taking a forgotten region in real life and turning it into an economic juggernaut that draws people from all over the world greek superpower here we come

in fact my main criticism of the game outside of the commonly raised issues is that 100 years feels way too short i want to build my nation up through centuries  this is the only game where playing a smalltall country is engaging or rewarding

where things are pretty weak again is country flavor why should i play as austria vs prussia if the only real difference is the color on the map diplomacy why cant i annex a puppet who loves me why cant i destabilize other nations or support revolts and war why cant i reassign generals to other hqs why does every war turn into ww1 but with trivial war goals

while i wouldve liked more nation specific flavor thats remarkably easy to add for modders and it seems like pdx has made the modding pretty accessible

in my opinion though its much easier to fix these issues than it would be to fix the core economic simulation if the core economic simulation had issues so its a good sign overall for the state of the game

for all the flak pdx gets and frankly deserves you really have to sympathize with devs willing to wade through all the bs comments and day one criticism to still with a cheerful attitude respond to players and give updates about future improvements to the game

this sort of communication between fans and developers is why im confident most of the problems people bring up will be dealt with and why im trusting px enough to buy their spreadsheet simulators erhm i mean strategy games blindly

overall systems are deep and complex and im looking forward to various expansions adding layers of nuance to them im sure it will be super fun to play after 5 years and 1000 of dlcs

810

vicky 4 when though

#####

as someone who has put thousands of hours into victoria 2 and lead a major mod development team for it this game is a complete disappointment

it is as wide as a ocean and as thin as a puddle with very little flavor content with some important european great powers having less flavor then the first version of victoria 2 a economic system which is a deep downgrade from victoria 2 and feels more like something from stellaris with all the horrific micromanagement involved no automatic factory construction but upgrades are automatic i guess a trade system which has no ai control whatsoever and a war system which is effectively the most awful that paradox has ever designed 

i cannot under any circumstances recommend this game in its current state

#####

war system  not good halfway house so more like hoi4 would have been the best solution not full micro or the system in the game currently it should not have been an oversight a lot of the fun of developing your nation is to unleash it militarily on the world stage in engaging warfare i really really hope paradox understands this must be a top priority to change

diplomatic plays  good but the ai needs to interact with it better the setting that makes the ai target players more adds a good challenge with future improvements to the ai i think the design choice of locking all diplomacy behind the vic2 crisis system will turn out to have been a goodfun choice in the end 

economy  economy system is fine for me but some may not like it a lot of people comparing this to vic 2 i personally dont believe understand how simplistic vic2s economic system was dont want to go into why i think that here but to help those wanting the lassiez faires experience the investment pool if you balance it with your construction sector spending can give you the feeling of capitalist driven growth  tweaking manually where needed but the entire game plays like a command economy personally i dont mind this you can transition to relying on investment poolauto expand later the market system itself is an improvement on vic2s global market 100 

flavour  lack of flavour on a lot of nations but i suspect a mod will add lots of journal entries etc way before any dlc does

ai  france is op at the game most other countries are not very good i suspect this is to do with population growth not really being simulated how it was historically leading france to stay on top with its large home population

other  the release build has mp issues and ctds as well as some ingame bugs performance is fine for me but i run it on an ssd the map is extremely well done

summary this cringe to say because in reality it screams bad game but the game definitely has good potential however aside from the warfare system i think the game is ok and i think a lot of people have rose tinted glasses about how good vic2 actually was mechanically if i could leave a neutral review i would

#####

so this game is fundamentally about its macroeconomic simulation diplomacy is wack warfare is wack but holy shit theres nothing quite like the way politics and economy work together in this game the dev team is quite active and has been putting out good work properly fleshing out a lot of the core features of the game and i definitely think they have vision that said i think this game is still worth playing as is 

its not going to be very satisfying to fans of the warfare and map painting of other pdx games but if youve always been dissatisfied with the flatness of social simulation in other pdx games then this is absolutely for you victoria 3 definitely stands out as something much different from the other pdx grand strategy games

#####

ive waited a year before giving my verdict on victoria 3 i played victoria 2 for a long time and intensively so i belong to a faction that would otherwise be considered very critical it was already clear to me when it was released that vicky 3 probably wouldnt reach the level of victoria 2 and in fact the game was a skeleton when it was released all in all a skeleton with a lot of potential victoria 2 nostalgics should always remember how long it took for victoria 2 to achieve the legendary status among the paradox games that it has today

after a year victoria is in a completely different state than before the game has been continually improved in all areas the developers are doing their utmost and have taken the criticism of the military sector very seriously and made adjustments the prophecies of doom that victoria 3 is a failure like imperator are unjustified 

the game is still not finished it will need at least one or two more dlcs so that the vision that the developers have really comes close to reality for a change there are already numerous mods that now fill many gaps especially in the historical area the dlc colossus also shows that paradox has understood many of the criticisms and makes the south american region a completely new gaming experience

therefore a recommendation

#####

after 11k hours of victoria 2 27k hours of eu4 11k hours of ck2 and 400 hours of ck3 i can confidently say that this is by far the worst paradox game i have ever played
it disappoints in every aspect and there is absolutely nothing here that wasnt done better in victoria 2
many are saying that this is some complex deep economysociety builder games seeing those comments i really have to wonder if they played more than 10 minutes

lets talk about the games most important feature the economy which also happens to be its core gameplay mechanic
if you click on the market tab you can see the supplydemand of goods in your market
sort this by demand and then build the buildings producing high demand goods or import them
rinse and repeat for the entire fucking game because that is all there is to do
low iron lets build some iron mines low grain lets build some grain farms low infrastructure lets build railways
that is literally all there is to do economically in this game mind numbing building micro tedium
click trade tab  check demand  build high demand goods  repeat

another fun economic mechanic is that it is literally impossible to go bankrupt because of a bug being in default  maxed out loans with negative balance gives severe stacking penalties to your nation but these penalties randomly reset back to 0

one thing i really like about the v2 economy is that it is as micro intensive as you want it to be you can manually build the most optimal factories you can sphere countries that produce goods you need you can build factories producing said goods in your spherelings you can check the trade screen for global demands and goods produced in your sphere or you can just put a laissezfaire party in charge and ignore it the entire game
when you go to war you subsidize the economy and focus on your military if something really demands your attention you just pause the game
i never felt that warfare in v2 detracted from my enjoyment of the economy

but what about society if you click on your government tab you can see reforms you can pass go ahead and put the interest groups that support the reform you want into the government then start passing it
there isnt really a limit as to who can join the government which party wins an election doesnt matter because you can just invite the opposition into your government anyways

when passing reforms the most important thing is rng you will be spammed with events wickedness must be stamped out that either lower or raise pass chance initial pass chance doesnt matter i passed a reform that had 10 chance to pass which eventually increased to 50 i failed to pass a reform with 25 chance it dropped to 0
in victoria 2 you can clearly see who votes for what high militancy will make your upper house more likely to vote on stuff not a perfect system but at least youre not spending 20 years as the usa trying to pass universal suffrage
as korea i also saw some interesting time frames here such as the game predicting a reform will be passed in 36000 well at least the god emperor will be happy that the koreans have embraced agrarianism

diplomacy is pretty bad the ai only cares about taking treaty ports states with their main culture or obligations ai wont cooperate when it benefits them multiple ais attacked me with cut down cb due to high infamy but each declared their own war even though they could and should have formed a coalition
ai will back down even in an annexation war you cant join ongoing wars or add new wargoals during a war

as the usa i started a diplo play to annex my vassal the indian territories for some ungodly reason france who had good relations with me joined the indian territories in their war against me
after that despite improving relations they kept hating me and eventually took a treaty port in virginia i was unable to retake the treaty port because the usa apparently has no claim to virginia

on topic of ai behavior i noticed some interesting things italy forms in 1840 without modena
parma and lucca and the just sits there doing nothing and not conquering any of their cores this happened in 23 games i played and also in every yt video on victoria 3 i saw where the player doesnt interfere in italy the ngf isnt formed in 1870 and a bunch of random north german minors are still independent austria never collapses or loses any territory because of their massive army
the tai ping rebellion happens in north west china where the muslim minority is even though it was caused by a christian sect acw is nonsensical with states like ny joining the csa
egypt just like in the official paradox stream made some bold choices during the peace negotiations with the ottomans such as conquering istanbul and central turkey
extreme border gore in the americas with the usa colonizing canada and argentina and
mexican enclaves in the usa

forming germany in v3 is worse than in v2 in v2 you fight denmark for sleswigholstein then austria to get all german minors in your sphere and finally france for alsacelorraine this is pretty much how germany formed irl
meanwhile in victoria 3 you just passively annex german minors with high relations and can form germany without even fighting any wars the war i ended up fighting to form germany was against spain who did absolutely nothing the entire war

the war system is horrible you have no control over your armies fronts will split up randomly there is only ever one battle per front said battle can have dumb numbers like 30 vs 5 brigades even if both sides have large armies said dumb battles arent reinforced so you lose territory because of bad rng
for example with korea i lost a battle against china which split the front since i only had one general i had no way of defending the second front
said fronts where on the koreanmanchurian border so all of it was connected
you can often see front gore in narrow areas like italy or some indonesian islands
hoi4 can handle this by assigning units from the same army to different fronts but since you can only assign generals in v3 you can easily end up with an undefended front unless you have a bunch of spare generals sitting around
max combat width seems to be 60 so theres no point attacking or defending with more than 60 units at a time set your best offensive general to attack assign your best defensive general to defend and youre good no matter how outnumbered you are ai doesnt know this
of course and will bankrupt itself mobilizing its entire army

the ai still cant do naval invasions i had multiple wars against spain and usa who just never invaded i only ever saw one naval invasion with a tiny army
a warfare system without the ability to move armies on the map offers some interesting possibilities such as having multiple armies in the same province without them fighting a decisive battle which would finally allow for asymmetric warfare in a paradox game
of course paradox hasnt taken advantage of any of these possibilities after all youre supposed to micro your buildings
but im sure there will eventually be a 30 dlc to address these concerns

the military gameplay doesnt evolve its exactly the same in 1836 as it is in 1900 your units just have higher stats

to summarize this game is horrible with the only somewhat developed mechanic being the very basic and boring economy gameplay it fails in every other aspect and makes for a much worse experience than victoria 2 with gfm hfm cwe dod or similar mods or even vanilla

edit some people seem to think that i am the same ubik who worked on magna mundi
this is not the case i just happen to have the same user name
if you look at my steam account you can see that i have the german edition of wolfenstein
which i probably wouldnt own if i was portuguese

#####

having recently finished a campaign i thought it was time to give a brief review in summary i have found the experience enjoyable with quite a few exciting moments along the way 

there are quite a few negative reviews for this game as someone whos only ever played post 15 and as someone who never played the predecessor i dont really share the complaints the game works fine the war system does what i want it to i actually found it rather cool and wellsuited to the game and i had a fun time playing 

at the end of the day the game is a pretty solid financial  geopolitical similator set in the victorian era and i can only recommend it if those topics are of any interest at all 

as a side note i believe this is the first time ever i have finished a full campaign in a paradox game thumbs up from me

#####

worst warfare system ever made in a videogame

#####

disclaimer received the product for free from a friend who also loves the game
disclaimer 2 i am definitely not obsessed with the game what makes you think i am

victoria 3 is a social and economic simulator set in the victorian era from 1836 to 1936 where the omnipotent player you takes control of a country to hopefully steer it to become one of the greatest recognized powers in the world how you achieve such aims or whichever your personal goals are is entirely up to you be it by diplomatic means war trade economic and population growth a mix of them all and more

some of the strengths of victoria 3 are also an inherent weakness however as grasping the internal workings of your economy and how it impacts your pops can take time learn and sort of master nevertheless it is possible to build up quite the successful economies with high standard of living for your people if thats what you aim for though if one wants to feed the rich at the cost of a heavily taxed lower strata whos to stop you whatll they do start a revolt to overthrow the monarchy to establish democracy and voting rights because they cant eat bread just ask the military for some help

on the political front your country is over time capable of taking various routes to shape its political and domestic future will you retain the autocratic systems of traditionalism and serfdom beating down the poor to keep the godgiven rights of aristocrats perhaps youll establish a democratic government with equal voting rights worker protection laws total separation of church and state and more why have only men work when women can work too

or perhaps you might form a totalitarian workers republican protected by the vanguardists as each is given according to his need and all benefit from the dividends of business then again isnt it more fun to watch profits grow under a capitalist system as your average capitalist lives a lavish lifestyle did i mention you can work to completely game prices to ensure certain industries have huge profits and enrich their owners to impressive levels of opulence it can be quite fun

of course there are performance issues for the game new content to add balances to tweak and the 15 update is shaping up to significantly change the game bugs cause issues some of the war system needs improving and the occasional journal entry doesnt fire properly however despite all that i find that i have deeply fallen in love with victoria 3 despite its flaws

if you love politics economics social experimentation or the usage of the secret police to beat opposing interest groups into irrelevance in order to live out the history of the russian tsardom you may indeed love victoria 3 as well but theres also nothing wrong with waiting for a sale or waiting for a future update that adds even more content fixes and patches then again why wait for the next update when you can start empowering the farmers and rule as a singleparty state led by the rural folk who needs factories anyway

you get the idea theres a lot to do in the game a lot of challenges you could make and do and more the game may not be for everyone due to how complex some of its systems can be and may not entertain everyone but its certainly very enjoyable for those who love the kind of niche victoria 3 fills

#####

i do like the game the art the economy focused gameplay and the possibilities you can do the ui for me at least is a major improvement over vic 2 and the game plays well the combat is weak but ok not a dealbreaker for me

one thing that desperatly needs fixing and right now is a dealbreaker though is the radicalism system this is just garbage basically its the rebelmechanic in this game and how it works is that when bad things happen to your people they turn into radicals and when good things happen they can become loyalists however its broken to the point of being hilarious
while good and complex in theory the problem with the system is that it makes no sense in its current state people become radicalized by being fired from buildings which makes sense but it doesnt make sense if they immediately get a better job so if someone gets fired from the coalmine but immediately gets a job thats easier and pays 2x as much he shouldnt become a radical this is something that happens constantly as you build up your nation so if youre building a utopia where everyone lives in massive wealth you end up with massive amounts of radicals
the second problem with the system is that people only remember their very last standard of living and get radicalized if that drops but dont care where they came from so if you take a country of only the poorest peasant farmers with a living standard of 10 lets say and you make this country amazing with a living standard of 16 but then suffer a very minor setback and the standard drops to 15 you now have the most insane influx of rebels even though they all live much better than a few years ago it doesnt make sense 
this also has the problem that if you hold your living standard as it tends to never be 100 stable your country radicalizes rather quickly as every down tick makes them radical but every up tick doesnt unradicalize them

the result of this is that you always have huge numbers of radicals in the late game in my last playthrough i turned germany into the most insane powerhouse with a gdp of over a billion a massive army had the minimal possible taxes provided all the goods at low prices had all the laws the people wanted all institutions maxed out so people in 1880 or so had full healthcare pensions schooling aso could freely vote and much more in a peaceful utopia with a living standard way higher than any other country on the planet  and 13 of my population was radicalized on the way and i wasnt able to lower this for the next 20 years at all
thats just rediculous

if that gets fixed and lategame runs a bit better id call this one of the best paradox games

#####

the game is extremely bare bones and lacklustre because there are no historical flavours in this game the 1848 revolutions do not exist europe remains a giant dictators club without liberal influence whereas nationalism and reunification are seen as unnecessary by the population of the game italy cannot cede savoy for an alliance with france to liberate austriancontrolled italy

there isnt an imperialism casus belli that facilitates the conquest of indigenous nations the game treats primitives as if we are in the 21st century wherein we must respect the sovereignty of all nations is this the reason why the berlin conference in 1884 is not a mechanic in the game 

paradox is heading in a direction that fanatically rejects historical agency in their alleged historical grand strategy games even if they keep releasing dlcs to supplement the historical vacuum the game still cannot be compared to victoria 2 with gfmhfm 

i would not recommend getting the game in its current state better return to check it after 5 years after 10 or more dlcs are released and flavour mods are sufficiently developed

shouldve remastered victoria 2

the uncanny valley of victoria 3

if youre somehow unfamiliar with the term the uncanny valley is that negative feeling people get when they see something an image animation emulation etc almost human but not quite and it makes them feel ick see a circle with two dots and a curved line thats a cute smiley face see mark zuckerbergs carefully crafted and rendered avatar in the metaverse kill it with fire even though the avatar is objectively a closer representation of a human form we have a much more negative response to it exactly because its not close enough

i feel that something like this has happened to the release of victoria 3 it is so close to my ideal grand strategy game so close in fact that i feel it lies right in my uncanny valley for games its very easy for me to see all of its flaws that keep it from being perfect theres the sometimes frustratingly opaque ui the barebones diplomacy system and the somewhat cheesy governmentpolitics system

this is compounded by all manner of bugs that show this game was probably released just a couple of months too early easy typos in the game text crashes to desktop and finicky behavior of generals in a large war i somewhere saw someone compare it to an early access game and unfortunately theres a large grain of truth to that like many a paradox product theres many a criticism of that as a business strategy

but as for the game itself this is the closest game to my ideal grand strategy game that ive ever played

the economic system is incredible the pop based system just elegantly blends together so much of the game strategy into a cohesive whole i understand that the war system is very divisive but its nearly exactly what i wanted i dont think i will be able to stand going to war in crusader kings 3 anymore after this

the game has only been out a week and i already abandoned my wife and kids for more than 40 hours to finish my first game as tutorial belgium after the first patch i look forward to starting another campaign im definitely hooked despite its flaws yes i would highly recommend this game again and again

economy wise its a good game but war wise its a terrible one would be one of the best paradox games if it wasnt for the handicapped war system which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever the game needs a good bugfix and a reconstruction of the whole war system hopefully paradox wont do these with a dlc update or whatever

#####

i want to like this game i think that there are many good ideas and that both time and technology have improved since its predecessor to make this one better but i find myself having to give this a negative review

my tldr the biggest one is that i came for a capitalism simulator and was given a communism simulator that is still not deep enough to satisfy fully the second is that there are many bugs which remain to be quashed

before the bashing the good

1 its pretty for the most part i dont agree with the bright colorscheme of the world map but i dont hate it that dislike is pure preference beyond this its well done options to change how bright it is would be nice additionally the texture feels a bit too clean i have my gripes with v2s world map but it always felt like it had character

2 the economy is certainly more complex than v2s if primarily in how factories are managed i like the inclusion of multiple production methods the extra fiddly bits are enticing and allow for a more natural transition from lower tech to high tech it really impresses the idea that some technologies required a more developed market and couldnt just be snapped into action instantly it has more products but i feel like there are missing production methods for some items or missing products entirely medicine i think is the biggest outlier as its just opium and nothing else

the complaints

1 bugs yes the problem that have come out are less than terrible i havent noticed too many bugs but the ones i have noticed are gamebreaking there are the occasional crashes usually when switching around quickly and particularly when trying to colonize visual bugs when swapping screens the biggest one and the one which pushed me into writing this was when a cut down to size war broke the warexhaustion froze for everyone when one of the enemys allies hit 100 and it became impossible to peace out in any way but capitulation a war that i was barely winning mind you

2 the economic flaw and my real reason for me coming here is because this games market economy is hollow its a collection of functions spitting out numbers there is no price discovery no adaptation to existing situations there are no capitalists just you and you are controlling everything it makes for a system thats more tedious than fun especially when much of the expansion is mostly mindless find green number the magic goods coming into existence the inability of factories to stabilize at partial capacity factories either grow or shrink no balance or equilibrium to actually be found the absent automation in international trade as well as the absence of hard money instead using purchasing power which is created and destroyed periodically

to fix the economy i think they should do the following

1 add more detail to controls if we are supposed to have a command economy simulator then let us have total control including being able to set wages for workers add or remove workers to partial capacity especially when you actually have command economy activated

2 add in more automation especially if you have free markets as your law remove it when you enter command economy and have the others be various combinations and degrees of control capitalists should be able to create expand and contract industries as the market demands contrary to popular belief they dont just sit on their but and suck in money the invest and direct businesses trying to maximize profit and predict markets their relegation in this game is dreadful and boring their investments being given to the player as an investment pool isnt totally bad but the total removal of any automation and selfdetermination drags it down massively the biggest problem in automation is the lack of automation in international trade why should i have to start every single trade its pointless busywork that adds no real value allowing players to obviously break the rules and set overriding priorities is fine but it should be an option not the standard specific solution create 3 pools of trade capacity idle which can be used for anything and is used first automated which is set up to find the best deals on both imports and exports on its own dictated the trade routes that the player makes on their own and gives priority to keeping this allows them to purposefully import goods at a loss to support or subsidize their industries a player could define every trade route but they dont have to unless they are a command economy if you want a command economy make it feel like one allow capitalists and businesses to downsize automatically and if a business is running in the red allow the capitalist to invest to make his business more profitable say investing in building a new supplier or into building a new factory who will consume their products 

3 make money an actual resource money should be limited and not created out of thin out typically not having real money reduces the simulation and makes markets far less interesting it removes factors like inflation and deflation and the biggest one to me it removes the ability to make and control banks banking was super important during this time and the transition from gold and silver coinage to paper currency took place during this time being able to have banks create and expand credit adds much more interesting details to the economy and should be included if they are worried about the infamous liquidity crises of v2 they shouldnt having multiple prices across distinct markets alongside and international trade system which allows for any to any other without specific ordering solves it no seriously they have the tools to make them effectively impossible but have thrown out the baby with the bath water with no real money

4 bring back real prices and pricing and remove price caps currently the prices are set instantly supply  demand  constant  price thats it prices dont adjust up and down over time leading to equilibrium not actually being found and many factories and businesses being incredibly unstable one factory elsewhere is the difference between all of them being profitable or unprofitable this is exacerbated by the inability of factories to reduce their output and stay there instead of calculating them instantly make them move by steps a few cents a day at minimum assuming equilibrium isnt met and more if the distance between supply and demand is large this would make new factories less likely to instantly go into the red allow markets to stabilize more naturally and with partial capacity make it easier to keep factories running additionally the removal of price caps would allow for absolute shortages to be met eventually by sending a signal to the system or the wider world that the market demands it let supply and demand speak for itself dont try to do an end run around it combined with a stable or fixed quantity of currency it means that both inflation and deflation can act and be shown 

5 stop making new goods out of nothing seriously this one is just bothersome in that it allows you to run your economy with an absolute absence of goods its unrealistic and discourages the factories to try and find a partial capacity point to balance around those trying to buy goods which dont exist should not get those goods when the price and supply dont match up just select who gets how much at random the factory getting less than they need to work forces them to reduce throughput and bid up the price while also raising their own prices factories shouldnt want to run at a deficit so let them try to avoid running at a deficit its not black magic

i have more but cant write more here literally running out of characters next wouldve been making construction sectors and schools profitable followed by improving medical care ill stop here

#####

got this on launch and it was definitely undercooked in a lot of areas but in a year i have seen massive improvement just in free updates alone 15 is coming out of beta soon and has completely overhauled the military and goods system and there is still an expansion on the way maybe wit for a sale or the dlc if you want but this game is absolutely worth it at this point

#####

ive had enough
we as a community can no longer allow paradox to release half finished games and pump out fixing updates as dlcs with a pricetag on them
what they did to this game is terrible and must not go unnoticed
if you want to play this game i recommend not giving paradox money directly in any way

#####

it was released yesterdayi apparently lost over 13 hours of last 24 to it the diplomacy and warfare are a little rough but thats offset by the deep economical and social balancing act you find yourself in intend to build an arms factory to support your growing army time to expand the steel plant oh the steel plant became to big and unprofitable because it sucked up all the coal and iron time to expand the mines mines have maxed out the infrastructure of the province transporting all that coal better upgrade the place with trains trains need motors and steel back to working on that steel plant oh hey all this industrial expansion has empowered the working class and theyre demanding a place in your government nowetc etc

pushing the levers of industry to release the happy brain juice

#####

suffers from the same problem ck3 suffered at launch changed to appeal to a wider newer audience who were unwilling to play or unaware of the previous series title these changes surgically gutted features and complex systems that added depth and appeal for veteran audiences

as of now the game feels shallow and lifeless ai in my experience is really poor it struggles to execute wars properly or run a super profitable economy flavour is lacking most countries feel identical and so do their politics and no need to get started on the devs resistance to adding a passable combatwarfare system as they claim the period was one of the most peaceful times in human history despite the hundreds of wars and conflicts that took place including a world war

ill preface upfront that ive very much wanted to enjoy this game and have spent a lot of time with it it feels that this game is just another half baked release that is a stripped down version of a previous iteration of a series that actively avoids to build on whats came before just put a pretty new coat on it ripped the guts out of the game mechanics systems built in other grand strategy titles that came before it to create something new thats wide as an ocean but shallow as an eye drop when you think about whats missing from the economy diplomacy and some of the nonsensical arbitrary rules put in place regarding behavior of ai it gives the player the sense that everything that was quintessential about the era economic historic diplomaticinternal politics conceptually is missing

a game that is about economic expansion growth social engineering and investment in nation building some of the missing features make it feel like theyre intentionally bricking things until they can release an economy dlc  how can you operate in this particular era of history and not have the ability to stockpile industrial materials and use them as leverage against other nations got extra production and no one to trade with profitably the products just disappear into the ether autonomous investment is more of a mini game of deleting completely unnecessary buildings with no or low supply depleting construction resources and misapplying manpower quite often scale of usageprofitability of things like power plants and transpiration require completely unrealistic numbers of employees making them unprofitable and hard to manage while also creating a noprofitability loop that then affects industrial procurement of raw materials further deepening the cycle of economic dysfunction in the late game certain production  methods for industries are completely untenable because of these restrictions  eventually youll get to a point where the game just will not be able to keep up with industrial demand vs raw material extraction and youll be caught in a forever loop of shortages also no investing in subject nations industrial development what the actual duck this was an era where some countries fates were determined by the investments of other nations in their industries customs unions are fairly useless and free trade policies gives your locally produced goods a 15 malice against imports causing local industries to use imported consumables first over locally produced its doesnt make sense some of these choices leaving out some of these elements makes this game truly feel like theyve intentionally made it stupid to have the ability to fill in the gaps later with paid dlcs seriously no stockpiles your goods just go poof like magic trade deals are arbitrary in effect and really only useful for depleting your influence for infamy decay for a slight relations boost over time barely worth even having as a mechanic at this point custom unions provide damn near nothing economically and other than making your protectorate play infamy cheaper its nothing more then softening a military blow diplomatically later rather than doing anything beneficial for both countries financially 

diplomacy in this game is disgustingly pathetic even after all these hot fixes its still working as intended this is just a greater gripe about all paradox grand strategy games and their arbitrary restrictions on diplomacy in games how can one have international influence with low prestige this relationship in the game feels inverted i shouldnt be able to flex influence until i have enough prestige for people to recognize my influence why can we only have 1 ally till late game tech multilateral allianceswhich doesnt come till the later 23s of the game timeline wise post 1880s if you rush it in an era of grand multilateral alliances that started before 1836 come on really diplomatic plays in this game are so stupidly arbitrary in their complexity it genuinely makes me think that the devs were told to leave this area of the game as barren as possible to just make it work so we could pay for more depth later why the ducking truck can i only do one diplomatic play at a time why can the ai just straight up ignore truces and join plays the next day after signing a peace treaty if i cannot do the same what is the sense of not having the ability to renegotiate the terms of a peace deal or the demands in a war to better suit the desire of the participants dont even get me started on some of the war goals the ai chooses its truly a baffling sight to behold  allies are completely worthless for the most part their navies will participate but theyll leave 95 of their army demobilized and at home if theyre fighting another ai well its total war balls to the walls mode seems fair right puppets most of the time wont even bother to raise their armies during a war even when they are the diplomatic play target and are being naval invaded despite having greater forces than the naval invaders they will just sit at home demobilized and let them siege down their entire country if you get distracted too long elsewhere and dont intervene directly they wont lift a finger in resistance and the invasion will succeed the game also does not do a good job about warning you when your subjects are being naval invaded seems like thatd be a bigger deal infamy and negative relations malice from diplomacy is shared equally so even if you take a province in indonesia  the states of central america will be equally as mad about it as the local regional governments in asia and the european powers every move diplomatically is applied evenly and globally thats an unsophisticated crap implementation youre telling me they couldnt work out a system where if you punched another countries rival and stripped them of their colonies theyd be as mad at you as the country you did it too thats stupid  its not like they havent already done this in other grand strategy titles made by the same developer 

there is potential in this game but in its current state even after the so called big 15 update its still feels like this game is playing you one thing wouldve changed my review of this game 100 release this game with an early access tag its pathetic the state its in as a full release right now eu4 felt more polished at release than this and that was ehhhhhh at best at the time this is an unpolished turd its slightly more rounded now but its still looks and smells like a turd a pretty looking map painting turd but still a turd i understand the desire to remove old systems from a games new iteration to create something new but using it as a wholesale gutting of a system to make the most basic bitch system so it just works isnt innovation it screams of intentionally putting a hole in your boat so you can charge the passengers to fix it later 

i have to ask what is going on with paradox in 202223 this game cities skylines 2 age of wonders 4 why is everything youre releasing as a next iteration in a series a flaming bag of dog turds hope those investors are getting those returns on sales they must have been looking for to meet their portfolio expectations this year too bad it ruins your studios reputation and inspires contempt in your player base great year guys get it together for 24 please player experience over profits

when is the war dlc like it is so bare bones i can only assume they withheld the war features to resell to us later

#####

tldr at the time of writing this i currently have 24445 hours played in europa universalis 4 and 11341 hours in crusader kings 2 this is in all likelihood the last paradox game that i will ever buy as this games release state and the release state of ck3 have turned me off of the company in its entirety for several reasons in both eu4 and ck2 i learned to expect less from the release state of paradox games than how their marketing is portraying their games but ck3 and now v3 are so far below my already low expectations for content that i can no longer support a company that releases unfinished games

1 neither v3 or ck3 released with any content of note that made countries play differently from one another in v3 there are journal entries for the us and the ottoman empire that affect the direction that you play the country france prussia austria great britain in a game named after queen victoria nope you play them all the same and the only journal entry that you get in all of them is a laughably dumb journal entry where a character in your country is a serial killer that causes widespread panic that gives debuffs to your country that you can safely ignore until the rng roll you have little control over decides its time for abraham lincoln to be caught redhanded after killing his 20th victim there are an unacceptably small number of events in the game in my opinion and next to no flavor events

the developers have defended this absence of content by stating that their goal was for each nation to develop and play differently based on the differences in starting positions and did not want to railroad the player however given the fact that they as the developers can make the journal entries ignorable by making them not give penalties to nations if they are ignored or unmet this excuse rings hollow in my ears 

taking the example of ck3 and taking the plenitude of mechanical problems that need fixing in v3s current state that ck3 did not have i expect the earliest we will see any mechanics or flavor of note to be added to v3 2 years after release at the earliest as the dlc that did so for ck3 was released about 15 years after that games release

2 there are two very glaring mechanical problems that severely affect this game in a negative way i personally find the trade system to be acceptable if annoying in its current iteration but the lacking ai and war system are completely unacceptable for not only the caliber of game that v3 was marketed as but also what i expected from paradox given what i experienced in eu4 and ck2

the ai is nonsensically bad in vanilla v3 you can start as any nation in the game and become the highest gdp largest military in the game by 1870s1880s at the latest there are plenty of examples available if you search for such things one such that i am aware of is a player starting as laos a landlocked unrecognized nation in southeast asia that starts with a single state who didnt expand by a single province for the entirety of the game and became the country with the highest gdp and largest military the ai does not exist in vanilla and given that this game is based entirely around singleplayer vs ai to me this makes the game not exist this is not to mention that larger countries are willing to lose tens of millions of their citizens to attrition defending the interests of random unrecognized nation in africa so that when you try to play as a smaller country to give yourself a challenge you just get blocked by a major power like france who loses 10 million men to attrition and contracts their gdp by 40 just to stop you from making a single diplomatic play for no discernible reason this means you have to play with a mod anbeelds revision of ai to even have an enjoyable experience playing this game paradox should consider contacting anbeeld and negotiating to pay him 20k euro just so they can copy and paste his mod into the base game files that is how bad vanilla ai is

the new war system is both laughably bad in its current iteration and laughably easy to fix and it would have been fixed by a modder in a week or less if paradox was willing to be embarrassed by having a random singular modder in their community fix such a core mechanic in v3 in such a short amount of time they must have decided they werent willing to be embarrassed though as that is the only reason i can think of for why max_num_battles_per_front  1 isnt in the modifiable defines file for the game in vanilla v3 you can only have one battle per front and battles take approximately the same time from beginning to finish no matter what stage of the game you are in or what version of military building production methodline infantry skirmish infantry etc you are using this makes warfare an incredibly tedious and boring affair particularly in the late game as one thing that paradox did is they made it so that the more advanced military building production method you are using the less provinces you take when you win a battle modders currently have the ability to change the time for a battle to start the amount of provinces you take when you win a battle the stats of the various military productions methods and the amount of regiments that are in the front that participate in any given battle however as it is currently not possible to change the maximum number of battles per front its generally not worthwhile assigning more than 100 regiments to a front modders are currently hamstrung from totally fixing the warfare system and so are forced to put out bandaid mods using what they can change to make it more bearable in its current state how bad the current warfare system is is compounded by the nonsensical ai as the ai rarely has the capacity to upgrade their military building production methods to a better form of infantry so in the later stages of vanilla v3 you are generally fighting against line infantry from the 1830s with tanks and airplanes so paradox fixed this by making it so that if one side of a battle is using a better military production method then the other side gets to bring more regiments into the battle so you get to watch as your tanks and planes slowly lose morale due to base morale loss morale loss being the only reason you lose a battle while they slaughter tens of thousands of line infantry per week

3 the ui was marketed as being streamlined and easy to follow but is the most clumsy ui that i have yet to experience in a paradox game they replaced 30 map modes with 5 lenses so instead of the 2 step process of 1 find map mode 2 click or hover on province to see information you now have to go through an indeterminate step process of 1 find lense that probably maybe pertains to the information you seek 2 click or hover on province 3 hover over part of description that pops up that sounds like what youre looking for 4 repeat 3 for each nested description until you get to what you were looking for some information like population needswants are a 6 step process to find to the point that describing that information as hidden is apt but dont worry there are ui mods that you can download to fix the ui 

 notice how the modding community is fixing or trying to fix all the problems the game has i very much believe that paradox has become incredibly lazy in their game development all the while telling themselves that they are focusing on the core mechanics of the game because each of their games has such an active modding community that any problem can and probably will be fixed by the modding community no content or flavor dont worry there will be content or flavor mods for people that want it shit ai dont worry there will be ai mods for people that want it this might not be an openly stated opinion in their offices but given the release states of their 2 latest titles i can only assume this to be the case

#####

play victoria 2

#####

come on its time for you to play the over priced game that will release overpriced dlc for it to properly function

#####

victoria 3 feels like a step down from victoria 2 the war system has been gutted the economy system the main focus of the game has turned into a sort of menu hell with paradox mistaking micromanagment with endless menus the constant tweaking that needs to be done with every single building in every single state is not micro its tedious

and the worst part of it all is that you know paradox is just going to fix all of these issues for a 2030 dlc for features that should have been included at launch

the game was originally released in an unfinished state with every update it has seen major improvements and it keeps calling me back to it after the 15 update and with 16 right around the corner i can now comfortably recommend this to others i hope to see many more years of updates and expansions

the combination of how the game handles politics populations warfare and most importantly economy is quite unlike anything i have ever felt or seen with any other game no matter the size or goals of your nation the game keeps itself interesting

#####

ill change this review if my impressions change but its not looking too hot

the command the player has over the economy makes the game feel more like a city builder or playing eu4 tall as opposed to wrestling with a global economy the warfare system has severe issues and the diplomatic ai is bipolar but my biggest problem that is being brought up less and is probably never going to change is the ui

i honestly want to know what kind of heavy doobies the ui team was smoking when they designed this abomination of an interface there is no excuse for victoria 2 a game which is mocked by outsiders for being an unreadable pie chart simulator to have a more readable interface and legible map with more crucial information close at hand it takes the worst tendencies of ck3s ui large buttons lists that dont scale well and adds new issues of its own aesthetics are strongly favored over functionality summaries of important information are not compact the lens modes honestly feel like they shouldnt exist no really for gods sake why do we need lens modes

im once again finding myself rolling my eyes at the graphical improvements i dont play games in this series or catalog for that matter for the visuals i dont care that you perfectly animated a horse drawing a buggy or that the pops have cute little 3d models that look much worse than stylized 2d art would likely look or about water reflections or high resolution mountains this obsession with visual polish bleeds over into the ui which is so heavily stylized in places as to be painful to look at for extended periods the veneer of style does little to hide the fact that most panels look like a choleric coal miner projectile vomited buttons of various sizes all over the screen commands that are in the same subject area and should be close together instead too often require you to go back and forth between the relevant lens mode and another summary panel to get feedback on changes on large countries youll be doing this a lot with trade in particular the whole thing just feels slick and fake a lot of the art for buildings reminds me of a mobile game and the game is stuttering quite a bit for me on a 2080ti so im sure its not brilliant for people on worse setups 

the feel just isnt there victoria 2 which this game will be obsessively compared to until the end of time feels chunky and utilitarian when you get to grips with it though everything is a few clicks away often in a small window in victoria 3 some menus unnecessarily take up the entire screen the tech tree and laws are the biggest offenders here while in other cases like the trade routes map mode you have to scroll through fifty different goods in a tiny panel crammed at the bottom of the screen information screens often feature text with five to six different combinations of colors underlining font size and gradients which is not only hard to parse but fittingly evokes a circus clown motif

maybe i just need more time with this interface or something maybe ill get to that point where everything feels close at hand in v3 i am going to give it a fair chance my first impression now that i have my hands on it though is that i hate it and before someone tells me that im a fucking idiot and that the ui progress was in dev diary #263 or something just know that i dont actually give a shit i dont follow dev diaries i simply dont have the time if they dont want people to complain maybe they shouldnt make it suck so bad

edit id also like to add that the art for buildings and trade goods is some of the shoddiest art ive ever seen in a pdx game they all have garish colors are not easy to read at a glance and generally look like they were pulled straight out of a mobile game complete with rounded edges and drop shadows some of them like furniture factories look like dali paintings on the other hand many icons are way too small and lack sufficient detail good luck recognizing general traits at a glance you cant convince me that the art for trench rat trait isnt a shield with gorbachevs birthmark on it compare this to v2 which had simple consistent pixel art the technical and financial limitations placed on development actually contributed to a more cohesive and readable end product

#####

lately apart from hoi4 paradox has been kinda slow even unpolished with the other 4x titles
i never played vicky 2 but i had high hopes for this game and kept up with all the dev diaries

the promise of victoria 3 was a deep economic and diplomatic game with some wars and rp on the side
sadly it only partially delivers on the economics front and absolutely blunders on all of the others


it doesnt feel like a 4x game very much and id rather compare it to some resource management heavy city builders
and that part is actually very fun and addicting for me even if it doesnt really accomplish the feeling they were going for

diplomatic plays and nonmicromanaged frontlines in wars have potential but are absolutely terrible currently unreasonable amount of rng unclarity when it comes to mechanics and lack of control even when you do understand whats happening in them
im 100 convinced that the choice to give achievement in nonironman mode was made because they knew the wars are nearly unplayable and its unreasonable to ask you to go with it
the amount of countryregion specific events is laughable it has to be the worst one from paradox yet
internal politics is mostly just waiting for 1020 chance rolls to pass laws

other reviews mention the upcoming dlcs and fixes but im worried thats not coming
imperator had mixed reception like this and its just abandoned now
ck3 was good but not a money maker like hoi4 is and therefore has gotten 1 real dlc and couple minor ones in 2 years
sadly i think victoria 3 is now about as good as its going to get


but still there just isnt much competition in the genre and especially with the setting and gimmicks victoria 3 has and playing without warring is actually viable
and while others might disagree i think vicky 3 has the best looking 3d map so far

all in all if you like games with grain number go up  i build mill  pop happiness go up  i build workshop type gameplay and are willing to put up with or avoid cancer war mechanics maybe get it at 50 off

ill probably keep playing it on and off but for now especially for the price
25

#####

huh i guess time makes fools of us all the game is still bad now as apposed to being so easy that its mind numbing now the game has been made so managing your economy is grindy and time consuming the lack of flavor is still a massive problem with some nations getting more attention then others the military system i can say is a lot better than it was at launch where units would just teleport across the map the ai still gets involved in pointless wars that it has no business in overall some things have gotten better but a lot of other stuff just feels worse it used to be satisfying to see your economy zoom to new heights now its just a chore

#####

good base game there is nothing else like it on the market  that simulates national macro economics like it and if there is i would love to know about it however the warfare system needs a bit of work 

do not get the grand edition 
the dlc are simply not worth the additional cost voice of the people was passable however it was light on content especially compared to other games like eu4 and hoi4 and their dlc but i would allow the benefit of the doubt for the first attempt at a dlc the second however dawn of wonder is based on one day night cycle mechanic and it is hardly worth being a patch update let alone a whole dlc i just hope that sphere of influence blows the previous attempts out of the water but then again optimism and hope is how they sell these season pass versions

#####

everyone has there own tastes and for me this is my most played for the last year i do have some gripes with the game like the battle system that has been updated a bit but still leaves some people wanting more 

however i dont play this grand strategy game for the ability to world conquest but for the economic and political simulation the victorian age is well know for out of all of paradoxs titles vic 3 has made complex and versatile the government system like no other game which allows for a lot of roleplaying between the interest groups 

i have had the most fun in multiplayer with me and my friends roleplaying as major nations to split up the colonial world trying desperately not to step on each others feet we usually fail and send ourselves into global war ruining our economies

it does not shine militarily but victoria 3 shines in so many other places that works so well for what ive been looking for in a grand strategy game for a while now 

so i urge you to not take the negative reviews at face value and just play the game yourself

#####

revised at 33 hrs imperceptible shifts in your economy annihilate a days worth of progress in a save the game does little to warn you or present your options if you can get past that this game is more about managing buildings on your states than actually guiding a nation you can enjoy it until your save gets derailed by something off the wall  added bonus game crashes to desktop when you try to reload an earlier save

death by micro  the beautiful economic simulation of victoria 2 is replaced by tedious building management this overshadows genuine improvements such as diplomatic plays and the abstracting of war genuinely forgot internal politics was happening in each playthrough because the tedious building management was too critical to not having everything blow up in your face

i wish it was better

#####

good if youre the right kind of autistic

#####

i could type a long list of glitches bugs and other downsides that makes this game sometimes literally unplayable 

i still cant get enough of it literally its a problem lol this game allowed me to further many of my shortterm and longterm reflections about history politics economy sociology etc which i am already invested in academically and scientifically out of my gaming life it makes the gaming experience not only entertaining but also useful and enriching intellectually it doesnt feel like your time is being sapped out of time and space and into nothingness which is exactly how i feel after playing league of legends no hate though

debatingconversing about social facts with friends or hearing the news have become triggers to resimulate a victoria 3 play through and get down multiple rabbit holes of reflections definitely a game for specific personalitygamer type 

may i also add that i seeing the game progress in terms of development has been a blessing too on the other hand expect the necessity of having high performance gaming pc to be able to play at low graphics though

#####

so its alright not really a good successor to victoria 2 but its alright

pros
pretty
intuitive gameplay loop

cons
command economy simulator  no real laissez faire
military gameplay is just bad i recognize that the player isnt supposed to be the general staff but abstracting all military gameplay to the extent that it is done is just not engaging at least let us set objectives for our offensives

im sure it will improve over time as pdox games tend to do but i suggest waiting


#####

victoria 3 is the longawaited sequel to victoria 2 a 12 year old cult classic although it was a buggy janky fundamentally broken mess the economy of victoria 2 was unique among games it featured a closed loop economy where every good bought or pound spent by one entity is a good produced or a pound earned by a different entity the entire thing operated and changed by itself you could not control it only influence it it had many bugs and design flaws but it was a truly unique economic system for a videogame the surrounding systems like diplomacy and war were simple and lazy in the old paradox style but just functional enough

in comes victoria 3 looking at it as a sequel to victoria 2 it disappoints in most ways the unique economic system is gone and the economy more closely resembles anno your goal is to grow your economy using your construction sector and your main activity is fixing the economic impacts of the last thing you did supply demand and prices change instantly nothing in your country happens without your input and you have absolute control over every production building in your country making new buildings and changing how they operate is your primary gameplay loop making you feel more like a middle manager than a country while balancing production methods in every backyard moonshinestill is fun once as a small country it devolves into tedious micromanagement quickly when playing anything larger than liechtenstein

the only thing that happens without your input is other countries setting up trade routes but this is mostly just infuriating because everything is in short supply and the ai is incompetent at growing their own economy these trade routes mostly just steal your resources and rarely if ever sell you anything of substance protecting particular goods could have been an interesting gameplay mechanic but it isnt you cant stop a good from being exported you can only embargo entire countries so trade boils down to you trying to steal resources youre short on the ai doing the same and you embargoing the ai if it starts stealing too many of yours devolving into isolationism becomes an appealing prospect if only to remove the micromanagement and instability

speaking of the ai in typical paradox fashion its terrible as a result singleplayer is a bland sterile experience you are playing in a sandbox with other kids but the other kids are just balloons with faces drawn on them it would be nice to believe that the ai will get better with some patches but this is unlikely given the reputation of paradox and victoria 3s game director the ai nations in victoria 3 are slow to grow constantly in turmoil due to mismanagement and regularly destroy themselves over the tiniest diplomatic disputes

those diplomatic disputes are probably the one aspect where victoria 3 actually has some interesting innovation most hostile interactions are no longer just a button but executed through a diplomatic play mechanic involving all major powers with an interest in the region diplomatic plays are a neat concept but they are sadly underdeveloped and let down further by the bad ai there is no real distinction between a small colonial engagement and major war in europe both become plays potentially involving every country with an interest committing their entire army its impossible to ensure a nations neutrality beforehand if you plan to simply befriend the other powers or convince them to stay out once its started good luck friendly nations will turn on you in a heartbeat during a play and major ai powers will join a diplomatic play for the most insane reasons the us will fight to the death to defend danish holstein in exchange for an iou china will sacrifice millions to keep an indonesian province out of dutch hands because they were promised war reparations the east india company will happily fight a war against its overlord over some border dispute between indian nations before magically returning to being an obedient dominion once the war ends

this entire experience is wrapped up in a ui more hostile to the enduser than a suicide vest tooltips can be helpful but the endless recursion of tooltips on your tooltips on your tooltips ad infinitum invokes an escherian feeling of endlessness that makes you feel more lost than before you started this wouldnt be as bad if these tooltips did not contain important information that cant be found elsewhere the game will only tell you the most important information at a glance such as the number of radicals in your country but make it impossibly difficult to find out exactly who is radical and what caused it

critics have said the game looks like a mobile game and while this is unfair to the gameplay the ui does lean heavily towards modern mobilefriendly ui trends lists and tables are frowned upon while grid layouts are preferred whenever possible the amount of information allowed on the screen at any one point is extremely limited forcing you to constantly swap between windows multiple lists simply cant be sorted at all and no list ever takes up more than a third of your screen width a full screen table with all the information you could want is anathema buttons are large and the ui scaling is very high by default unless you have a widescreen monitor in which case it defaults to unreadably tiny the game defaults to tree maps instead of pie charts suggesting that the ui designer had some very strong personal convictions about design without necessarily having the understanding of visual data comprehension to back them up

i have yet to mention the political system because it hardly matters unless you are trying to change a particular law thats affecting your gameplay like isolationism its possible to forget it exists entirely the interest groups controlling your government do nothing to stop you from changing the economy and eroding their power so the power of interest groups is just a result of what buildings you build rather than an interesting mechanic

ultimately the game is an exercise in making a line go up for the sake of the line going up every country plays exactly the same and there is no real payoff at the end warfare could theoretically provide something to work towards but the war system is so barebones clunky and dysfunctional that warfare is more frustrating than fun there is no micromanagement of units as that system has been replaced with automatic ai fronts but fronts split merge and disappear so much that the micromanagement is somehow just as annoying since the fighting happens automatically wars are heavily affected by arcane mechanics behind the scene that the player cant see or interact with such as the number of troops that participate in a battle or the direction a general advances the reward for dealing with this system is often lackluster since wargoals are decided during the diplomatic play phase and cannot be altered during the war

victoria 3 isnt a terrible game per se it is simply mediocre as a game and bad as a victoria sequel if it had been an earlyaccess indie game for 30 euros with a different name it would have been received very well with praise for some of its innovative ideas and its potential as a released fullprice sequel to a cult classic developed by a major studio it is disappointing the arguments about its potential ring hollow in the context of a studio known for selling buggy halfbaked products that had potential but failed to deliver

if you are looking for a complex economic simulator this isnt it if you are looking for a game focused on diplomacy and war this also isnt it if you are looking for a cute annostyle economy game that you can play with friends so you can bicker over who ate all the tools in the market this is actually alright though buggy and overpriced

victoria 4 wen

#####

as much bad as i have heard from this game i was positively surprised by it i really like the economy system and the political system with how indepth it is compared to vicky 2 or hoi4 although the warfare really is not that great and really does need an overhaul so it becomes at least closer to what vicky 2 had is it a good game yes is it a worthy successor of vicky 2 no in its current state i would have to say vicky 2 still is better the warfare system drags the game down hard and even though the economy and political system are nice it cannot compare to vicky 2 just yet with a few updates and not dlcs we would have to pay for again this game could become a worthy successor but we all know paradox so i have already sold my house and kids to prepare for the 100000 dlcs i will have to sell my kidneys for to afford them all still good game

#####

i want to rate it postive but i get the same exact vibes i got from imperator over complication in annoying areas and over simplification in the absolute wrong areas if you played over 1k hours in victoria 2 youd understand exactly what i mean

#####

not worth it
the gameplay is basically about these steps
look at market tab
is something lacking 
import goods or expand your fabrics
is something not being used
export goods or expand some fabric to use the remaining resources
repeat 10000x 
the game is basically a micromanagement economic system where no matter what economic system you choose the capitalists are useless they do nothing without your permission you must decide whats built where its built production methods automation methods transport methods you even have to pay to construct private industries even if they are 100 owned by capitalists

#####

much better than it was at release

#####

after playing for over 150 hours i waited until the 12 patch to see if this games issues would be solved they havent 

the worst of which this is a game about waiting wait until a building is constructed then wait for the other one and then the other one you try to make it more enjoyable by constructing buildings that help you build things faster and yet performance is so poor that even at maximum speed youll have to wait approximately 5 or more minutes to finish each building the situation is terrible playing with great powers and it becomes horrible when playing with minors because not only the games performance falls drastically the more you play but you have a small construction sector where buildings take forever to finish 

diplomacy is horrible war is still in early access so the games most important aspect is the economy and its the same cycle of waiting for buildings to finish fun at first while you experiment terrible later when you notice almost all your game time with every single country consists of you looking at your screen doing nothing i had the hopes that implementing the private construction pool would make it fast enough to solve the issue but its still a long way to go

edit i see some people have considered this review useful so heres a freelc of what youll be getting with victoria 3

if that wasnt enough this revolutionary waiting mechanic permeates into everything 

want to change a law you have to wait quite a while until a meter fills up then a dice roll decides if the law passes or if you have to keep waiting for it to fill again repeat it until fortune favors you and if the current ruling group doesnt want this law guess what you have to wait until one that does it is strong enough because otherwise youre most likely going to have an illegitimate government that cant pass laws

want to go to war you have to wait for another meter to fill up did the war start you do nothing just stay there until your generals or the enemy start battles automatically and hope you win

i repeat this is not something you realize at first while you learn but with time youll see most of this game consists of you staring at your screen doing nothing besides clicking some buttons from time to time wheres the fun in waiting for a building while waiting for a law while waiting for a war while waiting for a battle so we can wait more while were waiting there are many games focused on economy that have a more proactive gameplay without sacrificing complexity but this is not one of them victoria 3 is best described as the most proactive idle game in the market

#####

after waiting for 12 years this absolutely does not disappoint

#####

the reason why im recommending this game is because overall its quite fun victoria 3 is immersive and offers additions to the the core system which victoria 2 didnt feature at all for example
 markets are now fractured and have their own prices for goods and services this much better since it gives purpose to levying tariffs aside gov revenues and simulates an ever more integrated world market way better 
 its much easier to track economic impact even though unpolished for example buildings show which goods they require for maintenance vicky2 hides that info behind a tooltip in the production panel changes in prices are teased i can much easier tell when an entire production chain runs into a budget issue because the supplies become more pricey 
 i like the additional occupation types for pops to have secular intelligentsia and the clergy vie for dominance over education is not only immersive it is a political choice because the way you deal with them alters their political power
 there are more types of goods and services to unlock in an increasingly complex economic setup which requires careful adjustment
 the way government balance works prompts good meta when playing vicky2 you often run into late game issues with govs all across the globe hoarding cash like mad they create a global liquidity problem lots of large economies leech money from weaker economies and even cannibalise their own markets vicky 3 instead wants you to spend your cash reserves these are finite according to a max cap that scales with your nations gdp  it might not be an accurate representation of the gold standard but works well for what the game intends to represent
 industrialisation feels better paradoxically the extensive micromanagement adds to the immersion transitioning from a rural workshop economy to urban industrial is better simulated goods like art services transportation its all what ive wished for in vicky2

the government mechanics are likeable at their core meddling with interest groups can be challenging if balanced right the demographics system has been deepened pops sport obsessions and taboos based on their faith and on trends this could be expanded upon by adding attitudes towards institutions or laws based on an ideology system and politicisation it would make for a nice comparison to the dominant issue system of vicky 2 and as a pesky liberal i also like the approach towards historical comprehensiveness tribes are featured as decentralised nations and unrecognised powers still undergo domestic politics

here are some things i dislike warfare is not the issue to me as a designer i value and respect the work of other designers and judge it on the basis of their intent 
 the game lacks historical immersion unfortunately unrecognised powers were not given special attention to eg with the naming of their interest groups and political parties i know pdx will fix this but ill probably have to pay for it
 the ui is pure horror nice at its core design not quite mobile gameish yet overly convoluted it doesnt present the information you want which creates confusion with the many panels you navigate through vicky 2 had an imperfect interface for sure but i wish vicky 3 would have built upon it its predecessor featured larger panels with more stats and charts to convey complex information you had to get used to how they work to find them helpful enough but it was at least an efficient hierarchy of information what it lacked though were charts for economics and its the same in vicky 3 neither can i check a pie chart telling me to which countries i export a selected good or goods in general nor from where i import them when i click on a building i cant tell to which markets pops or countries it sells the goodslist doesnt differ between actual demand and potential demand so i dont know the potential demand if incomes were higher you have to check another panel to get the info the ui wants to be polished but its not especially when it comes to economics i need more stats without having to browse through lists to access metainfo
 vicky3 doesnt feature inflation official bank rate or currency value although these aspects would deepen the games macroeconomics 
 and here we get to a difficult point enforcing player agency over the game vicky2 simulated degrees of player control over the economy warfare and in some sense even diplomacy what i really liked was the aspect of a population and its government wrestling over control but this dynamic has been thrown out the window instead of expanding upon and making it more interesting every economy feels the same economic and trade policy only change modifiers but taxes and ownership remain intangible autoexpand acts irresponsive to market stats
 all governments feel the same parties dont have any of the historical names they had in vicky 2 apart from the legitimacy system theres little palpable difference between a monarchy or a republic for a political simulation this is a nogo every election should confront me with a new government that wants to push certain laws and not just allow me the ability to reshuffle my cabinet for free 
 interest groups are a sad replacement for ideologies i wish the game would feature an ideology system by which the demands of igs would shift for example in a republic when new ideologies spread among their peer groups while in a monarchy certain igs would be immune to this effect ideologies should ultimately determine which policies and parties pops favour but instead they fancy igs solely based on their occupation it also looks like pops do care about laws independently but nowhere does it tell me what they want unless they spawn a protest group 
 in diplomacy id like to see the ui getting some polish foreign investment and influence should be more prominently represented when i check on a nations diplomacy vicky2 had issues with this as well

ive also got some recommendations theyre meant to be ideas for improvement
 allow the player to automate parts of the microeconomy by having a sort of ownership structure in place a company system could allow for easier factory management and a more stable economy companies own and allocate budget to their factories and are able to build expand and shut them down they can be owned privately or by the state as governments and pops are be able to acquire shares in them the percentages would define who gets to micromanage the factories it sounds odd at first but it would fix issues with overly repetitive usage patterns and make for a realistic style of economic managment all surrounding mechanics like automanage employment policy wages taxes production methods and foreign investment are perfectly compatible with this system
 macroeconomic decisions like up or devaluing your currency to fix skewed market prices managing inflation and deflation by controllable interest rates would make liberal economies much more fun to play now that the player is out of the micro he can delve into the macro there is a mod which already adds currency and bonds as goods with their own function 
 please allow trade routes to be automised what ive actually hated the most about this game is the manual trade it should be easier to just have markets integrated over time maybe through diplomacy and warfare but in such a dynamic economic system its far too much effort to babysit your trade routes
 introduce an ideology system that goes hand in hand with obsessions taboos and interest groups make governments more consequential and different to each other introduce an agitation system by which pops politicise or become apathetic

after all the game gets a warm place in my heart im a victoria 2 veteran and i can safely tell the potential at hand dont let this baby down pdx

#####

victoria 3 is definitely a get it on sale game maybe by then theyll have improved some things

the game itself is  ok warfare especially naval warfare is in a really bad place right now and needs work but the rest of the game is pretty good expect for the excessive amounts of rng i feel like im playing xcom with the amount of bs rng event rolls i get its immensely frustrating to get constantly dunked on by bad event after bad event

#####

cant recommend it paradox have tarnished a truly amazing legacy by releasing an obvious future revenue stream of a game the game fundamental mechanics have been broken since release each subsequent patch doesnt improve them but instead swaps one broken mechanic for another

just look at the games warfare system its funny to me that in the dev diaries prerelease the devs were talking about how warfare would not be an important part of the game in comparison to economics and diplomacy and yet theyve completely revamped warfare ingame because the system they shipped on release was so broken that it circumvented any need for the economic and diplomatic play they intended despite that and rework after rework there are still gamebreaking and frustrating flaws that make this game unfun they shipped something fundamentally broken and 200 worth of dlc and two years later maybe well have a playable game but this is my personal final straw with paradox

victoria 3 inspired two open source clones of victoria 2 you should probably play those instead

#####

welcome to victoria 3 a game improving on all of the previous shortfalls of victoria ii including but not limited to
too much focus on war and division micromanagement
too little interaction with the economy the economy does not correctly show how it works in the real world
not enough focus on the political landscape of the world the games depth on politics was as deep as hearts of iron iv
regional conflicts are not portrayed correctly and you regularly have to siege an entire country down to get a single colonial state

how does victoria 3 the longawaited sequel fix all of these issues

it entirely removes war its now as simple as button press go forward you cannot make actual templates you cannot micromanage anything there is no skill involved it is as simple as pressing a single button checking on it and being anxious over it once in a while

the economy was made more cancerous and less accurate theres no trading between nations unless the state itself sets up a trade route between them there is no world market there is no way for russian iron and wood to reach foreign markets unless a player decides they want to waste points into doing that the industry is essentially just a timewasting spreadsheet that is extremely boring to use i am not joe biden i can stay awake while playing a game but victoria 3 has so far been testing me in that regard

politics are just rng and the best way you have to interact with them is constant meddling with the industry you have to make sure that the political strength of one aristocrat does not overcome the political strength of literally your entire country over wanting a single law to pass but then you realize that the problem actually is that you get stalled and lose debates 10 times in a row prompting you to change out the law try to enact yet another one where the same thing happens this way through this extremely slow and agonizing process you eventually come to pass a law that isnt entirely suboptimal and does not cripple your country to the worst extend while i understand the accuracy of this having your entire future be based on a couple of random computer decisions is just unfun

peace deals are tailored to be as much of a pain to sign as possible more so than victoria 2 in victoria 2 at least you couldnt lose forcefully lose a war through having a single occupied province even though youve occupied 5 of your 6 war goals in this case if the enemy puts war reparations as their only war goal and you put 6 different states that you have as cores for reclamation for your score to tick below 0 the enemy needs to take over a single province from you meanwhile you need to take a province out of all war goals when i first saw this system i believed it was neat similar to stellaris war exhaustion but it however turns out to just be another pile of trash that paradox forgot to actually work on in the month it took them to take beta out of the games name

other than all this
they also change out roman numerals for arabic ones in the name of the game just to be inconsistent and annoy people
great wars never are fought every war essentially is decided before it even starts every great power can intervene in a random war between two tribes for absolutely no reason other than the fact that one tribe was the aggressor which as much as paradox shills want you to believe wasnt the case in the victorian era even in the first egyptianottoman war the russians only intervened at the very end of it and here is another problem with the game
you cannot enter a diplomatic play after war has broken out whatever you do you cannot start diplomatic plays while at war or while doing a diplomatic play you cannot add war goals while at war you cannot change any of the terms you started out with hell you cant even have more than one diplomatic play against a country at once
on top of all this there barely is any flavor in the game playing china is essentially the same as playing japan playing the uk is the same as playing france and the us
and after all of this after all this time with a new system and a new engine youd imagine that at the very least lag constant multiplayer desyncs all of those small random technical issues would be fixed to some extend no its even worse games lag and desync far more than they do in victoria ii and i cannot even begin to explain the amount of performance issues you have if you get even close to the end of the game the problem with unstable multiplayer is so bad that you cannot even use more than two mods because the version of the game somehow always turns out different

overall the game is basically the same as it was in the leak with minor changes and bug fixes id honestly rather play victoria ii even with its plentiful issues rather than whatever this excuse of a game is

tldr victoria ii is better than victoria 3 in almost every way the issues that are fixed from the prequel to the sequel are replaced by worse systems i had very high hopes going into this was extremely excited and even after the complete catastrophe of the game version that was leaked i decided to trust paradox claiming that they can fix the issues with the game within the month before release and then proceeded to get massively disappointed when i actually took the time to play the game
there is a project named openvic2 im sure many of you are not aware as its still rather small but honestly i would rather wait for that to be created than waste my money again on victoria 3 knowing very well that theres chances that itll end up like ck3 or imperator

#####

as a victoria 2 fan this game was something of an adjustment but overall i would say its a great addition to the paradox family of games review as of patch 112

for those who understand the paradox grand strategy approach to releasing new content than youre familiar with them releasing something of a diamond in the rough that overtime gets polished in regular updates and expanded with paid dlc the paradox devs are fairly consistent with maintaining their other titles for years after release so that should be something to look forward to that being said victoria 3 has some good mechanics and offers solid replayability with a wide variety of countries to choose from want to play as the maori and resist british rule in new zealand unite the ethiopian lands under the solomonid dynsaty or form germany italy or a new empire to rival the british crown

keep reading for some game play mechanics and suggested improvements

h1the economy you foolsh1

its economy first politics and military second the focus definitely shifted since vicky 2 but is overall a welcome change much of the learning curve has to do with choosing what and when to build resource gathering or refined good structures learning to balance this will enable you to continually grow and allow even smaller countries to contend with the great powers to an extent you can pretty much build refined good structures anywhere so long as you have the pops to man them that said you should manage your economy and construction to almost always be expanding

h1speak softly and carry a big stickh1

there is a new option when planning a war that victoria 3 offers called back down which allows a side that believes it is hopelessly outmatched to give you your primary war goal without conflict this can save quite a bit of time and helps stronger nations to ramp up the late game snowball 

combat overall is fairly different from titles such as hearts iv and europa iv wars now have frontlines where you assign generals to engage in battles to conquer or defend territory these can be recruited with different abilities as well as gain new ones over time instead of unit stacks in previous games you build barracks in your states and choose what squad equipment to apply with better options available as you advance through the tech tree the front lines allow for a more hands off approach allowing you to assign your generals and their troops to your battles during the prewar diplomatic maneuvers and update on the fly

h1life liberty or something elseh1

as the game progresses you can nurture interest groups who support certain legislation and are able to form political parties keeping them happy can give you benefits and upsetting them can give you penalties when they are able to be part of a formed government they can allow you to sponsor new laws  to be voted on that can give you new ways of shaping your population or economy you can choose to embrace a liberal or egalitarian approach follow the communist path hold onto the old ways of a monarchyautocratic rule or potentially take the so called 3rd way of modern governance

h1some room for improvementh1

that being said there are some things that i would like to see corrected in later updates or dlc

if you start as or end up as a puppet nation you may get trapped in a decades long war if both your enemy and your master are unable to create a frontline no border no sea route to naval invade 

the ai is not great with managing their own economies and after a few playthroughs you can rapidly outpace them in growth when playing a major powerhopefully to be addressed by devs in next updates

popsleaders currently only have a default clothinguniform set progressive techsyears dont seem to unlock this and can kind of put a damper on your immersion devs please include some of this in the base game 

h1tldrh1
its a good game that reimagined many mechanics from its predecessor in a way i enjoy there are some quirks but overall it has a solid base with a new flavor for this franchise that will have me playing again and again







#####

ive been playing paradox games for the last 20 years and this is probably the worst release to date considering how great vic1 and 2 were i feel im playing a glorified mobile game on this one just watching progress bars thats basically it build this and that to produce x
devs really ruined this game by innovating in the warfare system they underestimated an essential element of fun in paradox games which is to grab your armies and put them to march embark them into an overseas mission etc this is not just about giving the player agency but creating stories
sad to say but vic3 is a game that after a couple of plays you realize theres not much to do

#####

easier to digest than vic 2 but it will be even better once paradox adds 200 worth of dlc in the next 2 years

#####

crusader kings 3 was a game without enough features at launch it was however a functioning and fun game victoria 3 is not it is a bland and soulless cash grab 

i can forgive bad ui a wonky war system i actually kind of like the war system in theory if not execution and a lack of individualized content for minor nations 

i cant forgive a total lack of historical events whatsoever whether they be for nations or the world  

they will fix it eventually with overpriced dlc save yourself some money and wait

#####

i need more historical events also weird audio bugs be going on

#####

as of update 15 victoria 3 is meeting my expectations im enjoying it and i recommend it for fans of grand strategy games though maybe wait for a sale

lets start with the strengths firstly aestheticslly this game is next level with a beautiful soundtrack stunning map including animations and a playerfriendly user interface i really love loading this game up and exploring its unique audiovisual representation of the victorian era secondly as someone new to the franchise never played victoria 2 i really love the focus on population watching how internal political changes economic development and new technologies impact your nation is really interesting and provides a unique strategic consideration that i lovingly grew more attentive to thirdly and likely more controversially with update 15 i really like where the military systems are going with this game i appreciate how military intersects with victoria 3s chief strategic focuses though i believe the decision to engage in warfare should have more drastic consequences domestically

lets move into the weaknesses despite the gameplay overhauls hotfixes and recent paid dlc there remains a few persistant issues firstly there is a serious challenge in operating this game as it approaches the endgame everything gets slower and this really undermines the enjoyment of the game secondly though i recognize that there is a diplomacy expansion planned diplomacy lacks any semblence of depth and needs more attention lastly there is a general lack of regional flavour for the most part each playthrough is more similar than different which results in a lack of immersion given the committment of victoria 3s fantastic development team i expect much of these issues to be optimized and improved over the years to come but they are worth mentioning

#####

cannot bear the slow down after 1860 5 speed feels like 1 speed especially when i try to build sth or declare war

#####

probably understands dialectical materialism better than you do

#####

this is not victoria this is a mediocre glorified city builder at the best of times
building your economy and watching big number go up is the only remotely functional part of this game as diplomacy and warfare have been thoroughly neglected
even though expansion is beneficial to your economy i always find it hard to push myself to go through the torture of diplomacy and cryptic combat where your 30 units on the front will heroically send 2 men to fight the enemy and die before ultimately britain arrives to end you because they really want that obligation they will never use
calling flavour in this game surfacelevel is generous as within your first hour of play you will likely have seen all but the 10 or so countryspecific events you build your boilers explode you fail to pass laws because of rng and you research a tech tree that somehow feels more barren than its predecessor
you exist in this void of entertainment until the end game when the ai of the game completely breaks down as it is unable to build vital goods in necessary quantities and fall into debt spirals and endless civil wars

tldr buy only 75 off or if you hate yourself and want to watch the world burn

#####

victoria 3 is an excellent base for a potentially fantastic game i know people are pretty fed up with the concept of a barebones game dlc will fix later but thats unfortunately the current state of paradox interactive the most important thing is that this is a new game its not a onetoone sequel to victoria 2 it has some of the same music and shares a time period but thats where the similarities end instead i think paradox created an excellent standalone title that can be built upon in the future and can attract a new audience of fans

that said ill list some of my positives and negatives towards the game

positives
 intuitive ui with extremely helpful tooltips that allow little information to get obscured

fun and interesting economic sandbox in which even the weakest nations can carve out their own niche industrialization still requires owning specific resources but its much more fun playing nations like cuba or texas this time your economic focus impacts your political landscape focusing too much on an early agrarian economy might benefit you in the short term but hinder you once the question of banning slavery arises 
a complex political system its fun watching interest groups shift and fade over time i watched a powerful faction of landowners go from dominating my nation to needing to break bread with the religious sector to stay relevant enacting a slavery or serfdom ban while completely reshaping the political landscape of your nation different government types have a decent amount of difference though i hope thats further expanded upon i appreciate that its actually fun to play a democracy now

the market system allows you to expand beyond just map painting playing your hand right you can even create a small trade coalition of states playing as cuba i pressured haiti and a few other central american minors into joining my market this makes playing as a subject actually pretty enjoyable allowing you to create more miniature dense economic powerhouses

cons

the elephant in the room has to be addressed of course the warfare system is rough i dont hate it as much as others do but im not crazy about it either it baffles me that they didnt attempt an hoi4lite system or something like that i fully expect a complete overhaul of this system in the future

the ai is horrendous upon launch with nations making bizarre and seemingly random decisions ive never seen a nation like japan or qing attempt to become recognized my favorite was watching the us annex multiple chunks of central america and colonize africa while leaving northern colorado alone allowing mexico to keep it i hope this aspect gets fixed quickly as its my biggest complaint

tying into that would be the current balance of the game its currently a bit too easy to pull nations out of authoritarian hell and turn them into egalitarian paradises breaking free as a subject is absurdly easy and ive often found the overlord nation putting up very little resistance

ultimately this a great game that needs polish and updates to be fully complete if youre understandably sick of that model i recommend waiting for a sale down the road otherwise ive had quite a bit of fun with this game and can easily see my entire week being overtaken by it i highly recommend this game to any newcomers to the gsg genre while telling veterans to go into the game with tempered expectations

#####

update this game will not live up to its potential as its already starting with the predatory dlc im very disappointed and thus can no longer recommend this game its a shame but this game is probably going to be another imperator its rather frustrating that paradox keeps fumbling games that are set in time periods i personally find interesting and i suspect i wont be buying any more pdox games from now on after the dumpster fire that was hoi4 despite its popularity modern stellaris and imperator

original review below but i have revised my rating to a 310 and a not recommended


victoria 3 is a solid case for a neutral recommendation button on steam but i will give it a yes rating because i feel like it has the potential to soar much higher than victoria 2 ever did although whether it actually ends up doing so remains to be seen

to start victoria 3 has one point that helps its case industry this game is far superior in that regard compared to its predecessor it makes victoria 2s industry management look primitive it feels much more engaging personalised indepth and satisfying creating a complex market economy is what victoria is all about providing an incentive to colonise attack other countries and involve yourself in the classbased politics of your nation the reworking of the quality of life and investment pool mechanics were also sorely needed as you could safely ignore those mechanics in vic 2 and still achieve gp status without much fuss in vic 3 you feel like youre building a house of cards that becomes increasingly ornate yet could still collapse at any moment decimating your society in a way that could take decades to recover whilst in its predecessor this never really happened as someone who has hundreds of hours in vic 2 i cannot stress enough how much of an improvement it is this point alone is enough for the game to earn sufficient goodwill that i may ignore its numerous glaring faults

to put it simply the optimisation and combat system are terrible i have a potato pc these days and vic 3 has given me my fair share of crashes and blue screens particularly in the late game which im told is a common problem  it also takes almost ten whole minutes for the game to load most of this is on my end i get it but still i feel like it shouldnt be running this bad no other modern pdox game does so i feel it can be fixed with time emphasis on can it might not necessarily end up being addressed the combat system is also rather lacklustre it has the same problem hoi4 has in that pdox dont seem confident that they can design an engaging combat system this isnt really a problem for me tbh especially not in vic 3 where i feel like war is really not a pressing issue i mean its necessary but still considering that sometimes the other guy has some type of resource that you want and you may have a bigger stick its going to come up but if you play victoria for the combat then ive got bad news it was always crap even in victoria 2 you probably didnt notice because you couldnt autopilot it as much but this was just smoke and mirrors for what was essentially a predetermined outcome most of the time it was almost impossible to win as the underdog in victoria 2 no matter how skilled you were which took away from the games replay value and limited the skill ceiling in this regard vic 3 is a step up debatably but whatever they gained in replayability was lost in making it boring to play 

whilst this second complaint itself is minor in my view the technical issues are insurmountable and must be addressed if this game is to live up to its potential it needs fixes not predatory dlc think eu4 ck23 stellaris and hoi4 i really want to see it succeed victoria is my favourite pdox franchise

strikeif technical issues are resolved in future patches it could even be 9 or 1010 but as of now it is sadly a 510strike

#####

still no flavour for nations still buggy still broken combat might be worth buying in a few years

#####

tldr so far so okish they seem to have finished the correct 23rds of the game instead of the wrong 13rd like with imperator rome and most of my bucket list is adressed from victoria 2 

needs some work but a solid start

minor stability issues nothing unexpected on day 1 

economy is fundamentally more logical but needs some tuning and tweaking people who are saying victoria 2s was infinitely more accurate and realistic and better imo didnt quite grasp how victoria 2s economy worked pops spit into the global pool of things proportional to tech modifiers number of pops and the rgos they sat on none of these were flexible and there was a very very harsh first come first serve system in place on picking from that global pool so youd always run out of iron because surely theres not more iron anywhere right half the world couldnt buy guns or ships etc 

factory management is a sidegrade  youre kinda explicitly state capitalism which feels wrong but also thats what you de facto did in victoria 2 anyway the ui in victoria 2 for factories was a lot more concise though  although to give the new ui credit there are a lot more buildings now

war perhaps needs some work i like the hands off front systems but the balance doesnt quite seem there its silly seeing uberfrance bounce off of indochina twice pretty sure normal france should have no problem one battle per front is trash invading the usa and have a million men ashore opposed by 600k your battle for the month is 4 of your guys  ie 4 battalions representing 4000 men advancing into 16 americans  because rng said so 

diplomatic interests need a bit of an incentive not to go too far some sort of naval range limit or something i need to play more to say more here

radicals are very quick to anger and very slow to forgive especially since you unemploy a lot of pops albiet for a very short time upgrading production methods 

i also feel like im not doing as much as i used to in victoria 2 with influencing and sphereing however i dont have a good enough sample size of gameplay at this time to draw many conclusions

#####

game has already changed dramatically for the better since release complaints are to be had of course but i wouldnt have 600 hours played if i didnt enjoy it

#####

i love the economic and political part this game and i understand that war is supposed to be secondary which is fine and i actually like that but wars are so broken that it actually can ruin campaigns i naval invaded cambodia as germany and immediately i had 2 fronts one with the cambodians one with the vietnamese i only had one army there because of your stupid mechanics and the other one took 2 months to get there and i lost the beachhead because every time i advanced on one front i lost land on the other immediately so i couldnt establish a proper beachhead and the enemy had time to bring over its full force and push out the landing against my demoralized troops its actually so infuriating once i landed i had more troops in the area way better tech decent supply but lost the invasion and over a year of ingame time because of a game mechanic its insane to me that yall thought it was reasonable to do a dlc before fixing war like literally just removing all war micro and just having the computer decide the outcome would be less infuriating than this either let me micro or dont but this inbetween stuff is actually the worst of both worlds because i know i could win if i could just allocate my troops how i wanted between fronts but the game wont let me i love this game 90 of the time but im so frustrated right now so i decided to leave this please fix this love the game overall though

#####

i had previously reviewed the game back in october before the release of the new update and dlc and was generally disappointed in the state of victoria 3 deeming it to be a broken mess that lacked the polish and depth expected of a paradox game my conclusion was to simply wait for a few years and once theyve had a major overhaul and released about a dozen or so dlcs then itd be playable and despite the new update my conclusion remains the same do not buy victoria 3

the core mechanics lack of foundations
the core mechanics of victoria 3 are still struggling to deliver the basic essentials for an enjoyable strategy game experience the foundational aspects of the game are still some of its biggest issues with the game feeling incomplete and less immersive compared to other releases from paradox
a good comparison to another paradox game would be crusader kings 3 which was a hit at release and continues to be consistently impressive with each new addition whereas victoria 3 came out with a collective meh failing to grab the attention of anyone except the loyal fans who had been anticipating its release for almost a decade now since then its continued to fall at every hurdle which can be seen when you compare the stats between the two games with ck3 scoring a good 90 on steam reviews and hovering around 20000 active players at any given moment 3 years since release while victoria 3 stands at 65 and floats around 8000 active players after 1 year from release
economic a slight improvement but still lacking nuance
while the economic system in the game has seen marginal improvements since the release it remains overly reliant on simplistic line goes up gameplay the promise of a complex intricate and indepth economic system is not a reality in the current version of victoria 3 which leaves much to be desired besides spamming out construction sectors or attempting to change economic systems via the flawed political system
diplomacy and politics infuriating luck systems and ai struggles
political improvements are mostly only seen in industrialised nations leaving nonindustrial countries struggling through multiple civil wars to make meaningful progress political reforms are more easily enacted by forcing civil wars rather than waiting for the multiple ingame years to pass even the most minor of reforms which is what setbacks the nonindustrialised countries to a neverending game of political chance against a landowning class which has the deck stacked so far in its favour that every turn you stand a 50 chance of failing your reforms
the ai seems to struggle with this mess of a political system as well many playthroughs have left the world plagued by numerous revolts and civil wars that either never end or are so frequent that they create a chaotic and ultimately less immersive world
when it comes to diplomacy the ai struggles with even the most basic of diplomatic common sense the great powers are a constant threat due to them wanting to join every diplomatic play and war in every corner of the world many a game in south america is ultimately at risk of prussian austrian russian french british american and near the end game chinese interventions for seemingly no reason nor any gain on the part of the ai but when you want the ai to join your side it instead either demands ridiculous levels of compensation such as an entire state of yours to be given to them or they will abandon their alliancesdefensive pacts with you at the first sign of trouble
war system persistent issues
warfare in victoria 3 remains a disaster with frontlines constantly splintering and making certain playthroughs impossible the new update has attempted to rectify some of the problems present in the war system since launch by reinventing the wheel but has run into many of the same problems while still creating more the main problems with the old system are still there with fronts splintering albeit not as often and generals deciding to move to a different front or unassign themselves while your fronts are undefended
new issues have appeared such as the bug where manpower and morale drop like a stone and dont recover for months if not years making every war a victory rush the ai not knowing where to send units leaving fronts undefended ive seen many ai wars  civil wars where one country is blitzed almost instantly the number of units and the processing power needed to compute them moving around the map constantly has led to the game now noticeably slowing down in the midgame and slowing even more during times of war which makes it a slog where its best to tab out and do something else while fighting midtolate game as it takes too long to be enjoyable
performance woes slowdown in the midgame
following on from the previous criticism of the new war system taking a toll on the games performance the performance issues from before the update persist whilst the improvements made to the game in other areas have damaged performance even more the games performance degrades now more rapidly in the midgame and continues until it drags to a crawl once you begin to enter the late game regardless of your pc setup the slowdown becomes so severe that it renders the game unplayable a recurring problem that dampens the overall experience
lack of content unless you shell out for dlc a troubling pattern
the lack of meaningful content in the base game remains a significant issue prompting a reliance on dlc purchases to unlock a more satisfying gaming experience this unfortunate pattern raises concerns about the games longterm appeal and the need for additional investments to achieve a complete and enjoyable experience at the current rate that paradox is releasing dlcs we can expect to have half a dozen dlcs and versions before basic economic diplomatic and warbased systems are probably fixed and at levels that they should have been at release
flavour events a desperate need for enrichment
following on from my criticism of the dlcs the flavour dlcs are doing somewhat of a good job at making certain countries and regions interesting to play removing the bland feeling that every country had at launch however the flavour events touted as a source of narrative richness continue to disappoint while some improvements have been made the overall lack of compelling and diverse events for major and great powers leaves the gaming world feeling bland and uninteresting one example is how historical characters are only there to act as agitators politicians or military leaders with no special interactions besides having a button on only a few of them that leads to their corresponding wikipedia pages there isnt even an internal wiki for historical characters which fails to add substantive depth to the game
major issues still unresolved after a year a frustrating stagnation
perhaps the most disheartening aspect is the persistence of major issues over a year after release the promise of improvements and bug fixes has yet to materialise which has left many myself included frustrated with the lack of resolution and questioning the development teams ability to address community concerns
speaking of which the communitys recommendations including resorting to cheesy tactics or relying on mods to overhaul the game further emphasise the lack of content within victoria 3 it highlights a community in search of ways to inject meaningful experiences into a game that in its current state struggles to offer them ultimately it raises the question of whether the game can truly be enjoyed without having to rely on mods or workarounds
conclusion a giant brought low
in conclusion the hope for a contentrich future remains uncertain leaving us with a game that falls short of the grand strategy gem promised at its announcement the desire for a complete and fulfilling gaming experience remains distant if it were ever

#####

im gonna start off by saying victoria 3 is a flawed game as is sadly becoming the tradition for pdx releases they do have a roadmap for fixing the big issues before getting around to dlc so if playing a game fairly rough around the edges doesnt do it for you id wait a few months before picking it up with that said the game has still sucked me in and kept me coming back for more and more  something about the core gameplay loop of balancing the markets and making the gdp and sol lines go up is just worryingly addictive



#####

buyer beware this is a paradox game at release

the good
victoria 3 unlike other mapgames or grand strategy games if you like is primarily about building an efficient economy at times it can feel a bit more like anno than anything else the economic sim is definitely the most developed aspect of the game and the most significant flaw in that system is the ai is not as good at it as it could be so you will often find yourself the greatest producer of a few certain goods with no ai to trade with to plug those holes of you dont produce enough there is of course a mod already out that helps them do this a bit better 

the other significant flaw in the economic system is it is quite microintensive and the ui to do that micro is bad theres no real way around it the ui is a damn headache i swear one of the developer streams showed a more streamlined version of the building ui but i guess that wasnt ready by release

the needs work
the political system interest groups is quite interesting in how it interacts with the economic side of things but a bit too easy to game by the player have a problem with aristocrats simple solution research mutual funds and flip all of the farms to publicly traded companies now the only source of aristocrat power is undeveloped subsistence farms worked by peasants meaning they are largely irrelevant as these buildings simply do not earn them enough profit for them to be influential 

i can certainly see the potential in this aspect of the game and im hoping it will be balanced a bit more over time so that the the forces of reaction are not so easily paved over in the players path of upending the old order or whatever damn thing you want to do by the same token industrialists as in my us game should not be willing to let me switch to a command economy without a fight as the second you have a command economy their power is going to be totally annihilated as you turn every industry into into a state run enterprise i dont care how pleased the actual pops that make up the interest group are with my enlightened rule if im changing the country in a way where im annihilating their way of life then they should be up in arms 

generally i also think the armed forces interest group is much much too weak they should get far more power from just the fact that your country is dotted with barracks and naval bases

i think paradox also missed the mark in that the political system and economic system interact but the political system does not plug in to the diplomatic and war system interest groups and leaders can have traits or beliefs like pacifist and jingoist but these only affect what laws they support a pacifist industrialist government did not in anyway prevent me as japan from smashing the qing in order to take korea and manchuria at no point did i feel like my pops or interest groups had any particular care for if i was colonizing africa or crushing mexico under my boot in vicky 2 a pacifist party in government could be disastrous as your military funding went into the tank id like to see something like that or radicalism from pops backing pacifist interest groups fascist movements appear and dont seem to give a damn if im waging war against enemies both without and within 

as for the bad andor controversial

first diplomatic plays i certainly see the potential for diplomatic plays but the problem at the moment is two fold first weak nations are too willing to give up even when the demand is for their termination second and most important when they give up you only get your original demand this leads to situations such as the mexicanamerican war will end with mexico surrendering just one state at a time as you are locked into a truce after each surrender my thought simply let the player  ai designate war goals which are essential to player  ai aims this would help the ai be much more aggressive about certain goals getting the us borders uniting germany uniting italy retaking the levant etc there are definitely potentially interesting things to do for example you could as the us did in real life do a treaty with mexico where you take the entire west but give the mexican government money by accepting an ai demand for war repayments now there is no reason to do this but i could imagine a way where you could make such a give and take advantageous by having it soften the infamy blow from grabbing so much land

the other problem the biggest problem is the most controversial war now unlike many i actually do not have a problem with the idea of the warfront system i actually do not in anyway think the simulation aspect of the game is improved by letting me cheese the ai into attacking me on a fort or locking up the british army into crossing into northern ireland as i would do in vicky 2 im not actually sure if the strait crossing to northern ireland was even in base vicky 2 to be honest 

the problem is the fronts are finicky sometimes a front will break up into multiple fronts especially during invasions of places like italy and your army will choose to screw off to some totally different front that youre fighting in on the map and let every single one of those fronts collapse encirclements appear to happen but the armies stuck in them escape unscathed other than taking heightened attrition damage for a few months odd things like that 

again i am not against the system at all paradox combat has never been anything to write home about this isnt gary grigsbys war in the east there are complaints that oh all i have to do is have more troops with more tech and better generals and hope for the best okay and please listen to yourself the problem is that as it works right now it feels like a beta of whatever war system we will have 3 years from now i would like to have something in between let me designate war goals for my generals to aim toward and point them in the direction not dissimilar to hoi4s system when you let the ai handle it let my generals skill level determine if they want to try to do encirclements and things like that make these generals feel a bit more alive as it is their skills are important but only in battle not in how they act mcclellan is cautious but that doesnt translate to him being battle avoidant just a bit more character sadly im not sure how feasible these types of details are im merely a game player an ideas guy if you will

the last problem with the game is the flavor is a little flat for some places nonexistent i kind of expected that but certain things things that do have flavor do not work the way they should either 

lets take the us as an example though other areas also have this problemthe taiping rebellion should not be able to occur anywhere in qing china the csa will appear wherever the southern planters are powerful at the start of the game that is literally anywhere with a lot of farms so you can see an early game csa stretch from louisiana to new york it is also incredibly easy to avoid the us civil war entirely i outlawed slavery without a hitch in 1855 but i could have done it much earlier 

in the real world the power of the southern planters over federal politics was almost a stranglehold in victoria 3 they are an annoyance that you can marginalize in 10 years i did not in any sense feel like a movement existed to either preserve or destroy slavery i did not even bother thinking about which states were free or slave it only mattered in the sense that that labor for factories was harder to come by in the south so i avoided setting up factories there until i abolished it flavor like this i imagine is the realm of dlc hell maybe we can get an entire federal politics system who knows

im at the word limit so let me say get it if you need maps now i do dont if you can wait it needs time to cook for sure

#####

dark souls of macroeconomics

#####

im really ticked off about this game because theres a lot in here to like things that were headaches in victoria 2 are either made even worse through overcomplication or just made incredibly opaque to the point of brainless simplicity

i really hope this game gets more development its essentially if victoria 2 had a kid with anno 1800 and for the devs part they managed to take all the fun parts of anno 1800 and apply them relatively well the economic gameplay in a vacuum is compelling advancing production methods and making new goods is neat its just the problem is that economic system layers on top of a political system that is just as schizophrenic as victoria 2s system but somehow more opaque war is getting an update but is thus far completely limp in gameplay the concept of war being passive and more economics based isnt a bad one but as implemented now its tackedon and not fun

ive spent 40 hours trying to have fun in this game and im tapping out its been nothing but disappointment i gave it a fair shake i went in wanting to like it but its not good play vic 2 or better yet play anno 1800 instead by the time youve played through both games this one should have the development it needs to be good

#####

if i could get a refund i would this is the most boring paradox game i think ive played and no its not because warfare was dumbed downwhich lets be real was a stupid decision

ive played as an industrial capitalist country an agrarian serfdom country and an anarchosocialist country with such a wide array of political and economic differences youd think each playthrough wouldve atleast been somewhat different well no each of those playthroughs felt almost exactly the same beyond some arbitrary stat changes you cant even tell that your laws are having any effect on your country maybe when your passing a law youll get a random event usually the same few which have no bearing on your government whether it be an autocracy or an anarchist council
this is the equivalent to paradox removing all the trait events from crusader kings 3 oh sure you still get bonuses from your traits yet your lunatic king acts just like everyone else your lustful dwarf wife remains faithful while youre away and your ambitious scheming brother has no thoughts of treason 
while crusader kings 3 is also lacking in unique content the stories generated by its characters provide enough to return now and again after multiple unfinished playthroughs of victoria 3 i feel like ive already experienced everything this game has to offer why do i care to reach the 1900s with gas flamethrowers machineguns and tanks if i cant even see them represented why do i care to unlock fascism when it plays just like every other ideology why do i want to do another playthrough when every one feels the same

ideologies economic policies and laws need to feel unique like they actually have an impact on your society the developers balanced this game for roleplay in mind unfortunately they did not flesh it out enough to accomodate that maybe in a years time when the first expansion is out itll be worth it on sale though with paradoxs recent track record i doubt it until then i cannot recommend victoria 3 in its current state there are plenty of better economic and political strategy games out there like tropico or cities skylines


bthis portion of the review was in response to harzer roller enjoyer though i think its worth including in the actual reviewb

quoteharzer roller enjoyer
warfare was dumbed down bro before it was just abusing the ai and death stacking so deep wow
quote

harzer roller enjoyer  the ai in victoria 2 was easily cheesed especially in the late game if were talking about bad ai and exploitation though
ai in vic3 is just as exploitable if not more so conquest has never been easier in a pdx game easily invaded russia because they put all their conscripts on swedens border did the same thing again with finland in my second invasion countries will give me free land if i add on a few wargoals to a diplomatic play get any kind of navy and most nations are easily cheesed by naval invasions the one part of the military you somehow have direct command over easily breaks the automated system
also the ai has a habit of getting stuck into wars that never end because they have no means of attacking one another youll just have two sides mobilizedif they even have any soldiers forever draining their economy and unable to start anymore wars if theyre in a civilwar youre unable to interact with them want to conquervassalize a certain region sorry this nation is in an endless civilwar and you can never interact with them again ill take easily exploited micro over easily exploitedbroken macro any day atleast it would give you a break from the economy

oh and speaking of micro and economy i didnt touch on the insane amount you have to do with the economy god forbid youre not in someone elses market because having to micro importexport every product and make sure they remain profitable is just hell having to constantly micro building upgrades and make sure they remain profitable is hell the autoexpansion of buildings is legit worse than vic2 capitalist ai to the point where someone on the workshop already made a mod to fix it 


they failed the players who enjoy warfare in these games and they failed players like me who were willing to sacrifice it for better politicseconomics they didnt deliver on any fronts victoria 3 is just one big disappointment

#####

while i love the idea of this game and what it offers in terms of the actual game play it fails to deliver looking back on my time playing i can say i more often felt frustrated at the opacity of the goings on than joy in manipulating the levers

#####

i am really enjoying victoria 3

the economy is great
domestic politics is good
foreign politics is decent
the battle system is bad

i enjoy how the economic balance is set up so that you have to carefully consider your pace of industrialization and particularly as smaller countries you must consider sufficiently developing basic industries first
i enjoy roleplaying as a sleazy politician baiting interest groups with legislation that has 0 chance to pass so i can get their opinion bonuses at convenient times and generally using interest groups to act against their own expressed interests making them party to passing legislation that they actually hate
i enjoy using great powers to advance my own foreign policy agenda as a minor player making them bleed to make my own nation great and promptly abandoning them and never repaying them for their sacrifice
i really appreciate how the game incentivizes the player to game the system in a realistic way  methods popular in the 19th century and today economic balancing slimy political plays and great power leeches are very real phenomena and it is really cool that you can explore all of that and more in victoria 3

victoria 3 isnt easy and it wont let you take poland into space for free the same way a game like hearts of iron will ive played a number of games as japan and you really have to work to open up and modernize that country without starting a civil war it is extremely difficult to beat the historical timeline peacefully and oust the shogun and pass good laws before the 1880s giving you a great sense of satisfaction when you manage to succeed  since you really have to work to make progress

overall the economics and politics of victoria 3 are great but the military system is bad when it is even working and when it isnt working the frontlines will break your game with crashes and bugs if you want a game with a strong military angle then be very cautious when approaching victoria 3 but if you love games about politics and economics victoria 3 is probably for you

#####

really involved economic sim just what i wanted im having a lot of fun so far

also have people not realized you can change the ais aggression level for diplomatic plays in the game start settings its set to lenient by default set it to normal maybe harsh when youve learned the game im not quite at that point yet

#####

tldr at release avoid unless you are ready for bugs and want to play econ sim with a shallow diplo and war system

another paradox game another disappointing release i want to start off with saying that i wanted to like this game i love victoria 2 and have a lot of respect for wiz and the other pdx devs but as the game is now at release i simply would not recommend you pay 50 or more for this game 

the game does well enough in the economic and internal society parts of the game but the diplomatic and military side are frankly a mess i like the idea of the diplomatic plays and nonmicro war system but they are half baked right now and you can tell its for future dlcs and even the econ and pop system has much of its vital information nested inside tool tips that will be blind to most new players i guess its a step up from the black box that was the vic2 system but at least vic2 had a simple resources map mode vic3 makes you click into 3 or 4 buttons to get to one for a trade good and good luck if you dont even have the tech to harvest that good yet

and one of vic3 biggest flaw on release is lack of flavor the dev team states they dont want to railroad history and allow for alternative world maps to form that is commendable and great for role playing and replayability however that is not an excuse to omit many historical events that happened based on certain criteria within a country that would be easy to script if a italy unites in ones game it is hard to imagine the italian people in austriacontrolled lombardy and venetia not caring just adding a couple events around that would have shown pdx didnt rush this game to release and cared about player immersion and enjoyment 

lastlythe bugs now every game releases with bugs that need to be ironed out but i have ran into many that are game breakingruining mainly endless and unresolvable wars that the ai wont peace out of bc of the war support system just visit the subreddit and you will see tons of examples how this made it past qa is laughable

so in closing at the time of release i cannot recommend this game hopefully after updates and im sure dlc this recommendation can change

#####

is it perfect no
did i collapse my own economy probably

#####

against all odds this became my favorite paradox title what always continues to impress me is the remarkable overwhelming depth this game offers  i think the entire playerbase myself included came in trying to play like other paradox titles and were somewhat disappointed at first the learning curve is steep and war has enormous and frustrating consequences for the unprepared where this game truly excels is the manipulation of the background simulation  beyond just transforming the political realities of your nation you can shape the world around you through trade politics and diplomacy no other game will give me the high of making the united states my dominion playing as luxembourg after i manipulated the power of the south with my exports to make the north succeed from the south leaving them weak and the scraps of their expansion up for grabs nothing can top paying close attention to the uk to see when its empire has stretched it too thin and shredding their empire to pieces as an ethiopian principality because they cant reinforce its troops in kenya sometimes im in the mood to wreak some peaceful havoc as the danish watching prussia collapse because i convinced a city state to join my market and splitt a great power in two theres so many opportunities and maybe the greatest weakness of this game is the lack of flavor for small fledgling nations  and the communities fear of trying out the few that do i really do believe this is the most underrated paradox title out there i pray the company continues to invest more into this game and the community gives it a second chance this game pushes the limits of how much its players are willing to improve there skills  those willing to suffer through the learning curve will find a hidden gem unlike anything else out there

#####

if you think the best part of hearts of iron iv is the build up to the war and not the tedious micro management of the armies after the war starts then i suspect you will enjoy victoria 3 i love it



#####

its a very difficult game 
if you want more research speed you lose money 
want a bigger army lose money 
build the wrong building lose money 
my autism isnt strong enough for this

#####

game has improved drastically
economics can be understood thanks to the new ui
warfare actually works with very minor bugs the army doin silly tours around the state but nothing as obscene as the day1 version
nations are starting to act more as such and being active in colonialism and interfering against rivals
the new ui gives a lot of info making new decisions easy to understand

the game has in my opinion only 1 dlc left with sphere of influence victoria 2 may become obsolete because the features i miss the most are promised in sphere of influence  if they fix the last 10 years lag i think victoria 3 will be guaranteed to succeed with the latest patch i had a lot of fun i understood war i expanded without too many problems economy made sense and revolts werent broken but in 1920 everything got to a crawl please paradox just fix the late game lag
 and i will suggest this game more often to friends


#####

everyones favorite easter egg from hoi 4 makes a return where in the past an airplanes ground crew would commit ritualistic suicide if the plane they serviced got shot down now you get to experience an entire frontline throwing themselves off a cliff because your local opium addict decided to duel a war criminal in the middle of a great war fought over the independence of uganda 1010

#####

a solid fundation for a good game i have fun playing it now it feals like anno 1800 at the more macro level
i already see dlcs with more expeditions those are fun like anno 1800 and world wonders
balancing goverment is challenging more then war  rebels are real and can kill you i feals like in the democracy game with graphics

some cons
war mechanics  war screen need to be improved they took too much control from us i lost a war because generals occupied half of enemy country but the enemy siezed one war goal province for me i cant diract generals to retake it
naval battels  invasions feel like afterthought  game calls for a proper war screen

no military access i needed to declare war on my vassal to get access to its neighbour i was at war with on my vassal

diplomacy screen should be default not the market one when i leftclick on a country

2 game crushes so far

#####

i understand the controversy with this game but i still enjoy it a lot economics are very in depth same with politics however politics could use some more features like for example it takes almost no effort to abolish slavery as the united states because you can just kick the southern planters from the government all in all its a great game for people who like economics the rest of the game needs work and if you arent buying it purely for economics i would suggest waiting for dlc or updates

#####

not perfect but people are exaggerating hard yes it will most likely be better in 2 years from now but its perfectly playable as is having a ton of fun with it

#####

an unequivocal deficient piece of art that you might put tens of hours into it indeed after getting astounded by the beauty and the elegance that the game carries in the first look for newcomers there is no flavour whatsoever for the rest of your journey

surely the lack of flavour after getting into the game in addition to the sketchy and malformed combat system are the substantial however i should also mention that many nations in the game suffer from the absence of uniqueness in many terms

evidently its all paradox interactive and it seems like that truly always has been some sort of inevitable miscondition in which the success of many great games getting sentence to a suspension at least for the initial year in my book its all because of the lack of competition for paradox interactive there is no other studio to compete with this studio and there is where many problems came from it causes paradox interactive to stand aside release the unfinished piece of work and watch people how theyre complaining until decide to take action and actually fix the game whenever they please and as far as im aware it would usually takes couple patches

bottomline i do not recommend this game to you unless you are quite passionate with queen victoria herself or you are utterly enthusiastic about the 19th century

#####

i understand the middling reviews people have given but in my relatively short time playing ive enjoyed the kinds of decisions the game presents and the details you can dig into

why cant i hire for this building turns out theyre not qualified why are they not qualified theyre slow to gain qualifications because theyre being discriminated against so i can either build elsewhere or pass a law to reduce discrimination

if you enjoy chasing down those kinds of details theres a good chance youll find something to like here

#####

its a good start it has a lot of potential to be an amazing game right now though it needs work and can be annoying and senseless at times regardless im going to put thousands of hours into the game

#####

this is not victoria 3 but some kind of an ugly mix of imprerator  eu4  vic2
in short
 1the market and production part got both overcomplicated and simplified at the same time stockpiles were removed and the international trade stockpile for goods are artificially unlimited no longer can you buy the most needed resource to make it harder for other nations to develop on the other hand the compact building tab from vic2 was replaced with an atrocity of an ui which honestly makes it harder to navigate 
 2 wars and military are completely different from other paradox games and are annoying and clunky there was literally no point in replacing standard units with these semiautomatic dummies the main argument of the devs and supporters of this system was this is so devs could focus more on economics but as ive mentioned before  the economics degrated too they are not simulated like in vic2
3 map is ugly it is unbearable the moment you zoom out a bit it goes into fullpaint no opacity colours mode i can not understand how could one go from ideal complex and simultaneously simple map overlays of victoria 2 to this it is unbearable and confusing
yes
 4 lots of useless tabs that copy each others functions which only adds to the confusion and makes you waste time on thinking what is this thing for if you can do the same thing in the other tab 
5 bugs it is all about bugs i got involved into the egypt vs ottoman empire crisis and when the war broke out it showed that i am suddenly both the attacker and the defender instantly crashing the game 
6 colonization is actually better than in vic2 but is still broken the moment i colonized a region with 9k population it went into turmoil which is expected but now out of the sudden all of my well fed and happy citizens from my capital join radicals in 300k numbers daily because of a worthless piece of desert on the other half of the continent having some problems with the living standarts
7 about muh racism is bad and other stuff  i dont freaking care if i am being offensive towards a random nationality that existed 150 years ago but i dont  understand why should i get 5 factory output debuff for refusing to hire 7k people in a 700k populated region with unemployment in it it is literally the most annoying event ever  you either make your overwhelming major population unhappy or get a 5 debuff on factories despite the discriminated group not even being workers but freaking peasants
upd i just got this event for micronasian population of 017k people in japan 5 factory debuff for not letting 170 people out of 32 million population to work on these factories seriously paradox

8 playing as japan 1836 be like
somehow already have european level guns and conscripts including latest artillery
can invent railways in just a few years has already one click away from freaking paddle steamers
shogunate being nasty isolationists dont care meiji restoration is not needed
went and destroyed russia in a few clicks because my conscripts are somehow on par with top 3 military power in the world
all of this while playing as primitive nation no need to westernize or do any political manipulation just click a few times and bam you have modern army in a few years

upd you could not even get this one right lol note i am playing as japan so it should be another way around httpsprntsce4deyv8h7as

9 remember when each pop was able to accumulate money in a capitalist country and then become a capitalist and build something to earn more money if you allowed it forget it in victoria 3 capitalism is empoyment  you build a railroad and it generates 250 slots for employing capitalists httpsprntscl56myz_fa70q
there is no laissez faire like in victoria2 where you let extremely dumb but nevertheless at least present capitalists build their own buidlings and railroads here you are playing command economy 247 where these capitalists only generate investment fund  money which you then can spend on building whatever you want

httpsprntsc0vdvphciyzqa
httpsprntsctolpmddkotf6
httpsprntsctilj7nd1ndq
yes paradox i am sure that these 21k out of a 5mil population in the region are worth giving me 5 debuff on all of my factories in the region i got too fed up with this so here a mod that removes  this event httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2880140570

#####

friendship ended with aggressive expansion now playing tall is my best friend

#####

vic2 was just better in my opinion im addicted to the paradox franchise but vic3 did end up in bad taste sadly the military mechanics are so clunky and it just doesnt make sense for now the big factor is the economic and diplomatic but i think paradox missed out on this if they only gave the game more of a soule it could be one of the greatest games of the grand strategy games but its predecessor did an awesome job and i loved it

vic3 6410

#####

wait the games good now guys the game is good now im finally having fun 

in all seriousness it kinda has that feeling stellaris went through in the beginning from an ok space 4x into the titan of a game it is now i think were moving in the right direction yall

#####

im having a hard time both recommending or telling people to stay away from this game as of now i am super split on the game
on the surface this is an amazing game its seems right now this game might be paradox best release in quite a while i really dislike the new engine thats been used in ck3 and imperator but in this game it feels like they got it right i thought the game looked pretty bad from the prerelease videos but when playing the game it looks absolutely gorgeous i love zooming into the world and getting a feel for it
what works also works pretty well the politics system is very interesting and the marketproduction features are very deep and not something ive managed to grasp yet

however what doesnt work kinda tanks the entire game for me as of now there are two big negatives that really stands out for me
 the combat seems to have been an afterthought i realize paradox wants to try new things and improve and iterate on what has been tried and tested before but this combat system really isnt very fun or immersive at all i understand what they were going for but it really doesnt do it for me i thought the vicky 2 had a very well done combat simulation which could have been made easier to understand and streamlined butm whatever we got right now wasnt the correct decision i think
 the lack of national flavour and decisions made me surprised at first and just disappointed right now i understand that other paradox games are quite railroaded and that paradox wanted to try something new but as of now the game doesnt feel that historical the background setting and starting parameters are but after that its sorta up to you the player to create the history i guess thats cool in some ways but when you have 400 hours of victoria 2 heart of darkness with hpm this comes off as really barren with not less stuff to do

i am giving this game a negative rating as of now you can get this game and get enjoyement out of it but as of now this isnt a game that youll be sinking 100s or even 1000s of hours into the depth just isnt there except for in production and politics so buy the game at your own risk but see it as an investment

ill update this review in the future to see how my experiences with the game has changed with updates

#####

you can be racist

#####

as a initial release as a paradox game its not too bad does that make it a good game by itself nope 

we all know the drill by now shit game at release and good game a year or two from now but for now i cant recommend the game even though i do like it somewhat while i dont exactly care about units in warfare there are so many other factors that make warfare horrible great powers will literally sacrifice massive amounts of troops just to defend a random opm in an area they claim interest in economy needs to be fixed as well capitalism has literally been abolished in a victoria game lmao

paradox games usually get better over time compare stellaris 4 years ago and stellaris now if you want to buy it expect some barebones features

edit i have now played about 2 playthroughs of the game and seen about everything there is to it every country is the same

#####

i played it so you dont have to  huge congratulations to paradox for creating the worlds very first strategy game that for some reason has no strategy in it 

 very little replayability
 embarassing lack of flavor
 repetitive gameplay 
 dumbed down warfare seriously whoever suggested this system should be fired
 dumbed down economy
 worst paradox ai so far despite removing units
 ai actively annexes territory it doesnt connect to like hoi iv upon release
 decentralized nations such as in africa cannot be played at all
 painfully small amount of decisions to choose from
 dumber diplomacy no more joining an ongoing war 
 map painting is easier than any game ive ever played despite promises by the devs to the contrary now i guess we know why they showed as little warfare in their streams as possible
 tedious trade mechanics and for that matter tedious game altogether
 event spam worse than victoria ii
 50 for an unfinished and frankly barebones game
 99 of the game is queuing buildings 
 i cant even consider this a strategy game as no actual strategy is included within the gameplay
 there is genuinely a huge lack of content gameplay from the first 10 minutes to first hour in does not change at all as all of the huge changes dont actually alter anything 
 this one goes out to all the people that decried and insulted everyone who had concerns with this pile of trash before it got released
 soundtrack is fantastic
 i do genuinely like the map and new graphics
 easier focuses compared to victoria ii aka i can easily promote migration or national values in a state
 unlike victoria ii i can tab out without issue
 it gave me the motivation to actually write a lengthy review
 it was mildly more interesting than looking out of a window

in a nutshell  unless you like sitting around doing nothing all game then dont buy it until a huge stellarislike overhaul which changes the entire game to something worthy of the designation game i dont know why paradox insists on removing the gameplay from its games but this felt like a queuing simulator no matter who i played as and it was quite honestly the blandest experience i have had in any video game to date the game screams identity crisis to me on the one hand it wants to be an economic and society simulator and yet ultimately what you get is this really contentpoor experience where the economy is somehow less fleshed out than victoria ii and in fact feels more a cheap knockoff of the anno 1800 system despite removing the biggest black hole for paradox ai warfare the ai is in no way improved over any previous title and in fact i would argue it is a lot worse given the ai makes bizarre choices to send its entire army to some obscure country while losing to a major power the game lacks content it lacks love and above all it lacks any resemblance of a strategy experience overall it feels like a paradox game where they removed half the content made the other half harder by getting rid of important features and then slapped a major pricetag on it because its a game most of us never expected to get made if this was not a victorian era game if this was not made by paradox if this was not part of their grand strategy series then maybe i could accept this actual lack of content and purely lazy design 

lets kick off warfare by quoting bismarck one of the most famous german leaders of this period  it is not by speeches and majority resolutions that the great questions of the time are decided but by iron and blood

warfare  if like me you were looking for a continuance of the victoria series or indeed the typical economywarfare balanced game you get accustomed to with paradox then you came to the wrong place friend in fact i would argue you couldnt be further from what you are looking for since this has perhaps the least warlike system of conflict i have ever seen in any strategy game that i own first the good news a baby could understand it now the bad news a baby would cry if you handed him this pile of crap because warfare is boiled down to 3 buttons and constant monotonous dice rolls in which you have no influence whatsoever no i am not exageratting in their quest to make the worst war system in any strategy game to date they have removed all player inputs into warmaking your ai general chooses the worst possible terrain to fight in and sends his smallest army against the enemy well guess you lost because your number is smaller than the enemy one conflict can quite simply be boiled down to who has more barracks and thats virtually it if there is in fact deeper mechanics at play well then call me sally because i sure cant see it one huge issue i saw in the first 10 minutes was that if you occupy a colony the original owner can continue to colonise new provinces meaning you have to constantly come back to occupy them the peace system which they patched in hearts of iron over a year ago is still fresh in mind here as the ai will annex territories that make no sense like egypt annexing macedonia from the ottomans within 5 years of the game start america decided to visit africa with a vengeance and within 10 years had conquered around a third of west africa

this is actually one of the unique times where i can point to imperator rome as an improvement because they actually had a system that pandered to both philosophies here you could either let the ai run around and fight for you or you could micro and decide precisely where he goes rather than do any of that they claimed to have spent the majority of their time creating a system that in simple terms mimics a mobile game you click your army you click on the enemy country and if your number is bigger than them well there you go you won thats all there is to it risk civilization and as already mentioned anno 1800 all despite not carrying the same clout as a paradox grand strategy game somehow does better than whatever this junk is i dont even think its insulting to call it that either because clearly little to no actual effort went into this system it genuinely feels like it was designed and programmed in one single day by a game named steve that they pulled in off the street let this be a lesson to any game studio making a similar title the removal of warfare is not an acceptable replacement for a sufficiently programmed ai i will admit though i should have seen the warning signs when the legions of youtubers throwing out positive praise of the system at conveniently the same day and same time of day no doubt due to the stipulations in their agreement with paradox for prerelease copies 

diplomatic plays were touted as a great alternative to war but they are not tense whatsoever because without the threat of a challenging war as something to occur if it fails it makes it nothing more than a formality that seems cool at first but the more you do them the more you feel its really hollow they are also painfully easy the puppetry system for example as long as you puppet a non great power you can annex them within 5 years this is a problem because spain for example is a power that loses its great power status and as say france you can puppet and then annex them in an extremely quick fashion which definitely should not be the case by simplifying things and removing the risk from warfare they have gone in the completely opposite direction by making map painting easier

perfectly crafted to ruin the lives of grad students

#####

it was fun for the first 2 hours

the worst part is when you realize that this is yet another skeleton to build dlc on like imperator rome and that nothing changed since the leak youd expect paradox wouldve worked twice as hard to develop their game and make it much different from the leak but instead they just kept it as it was

ignoring the criticisms they received by the majority of its userbase to instead get high off their reddit userbases adulation will get you exactly this we called it on the war system but the loud voices of the minority kept drowning ours out too bad they cant do it today and stop our reviews from being published

maybe try listening to criticism next time

paradox lets us down once more


edit he doesnt know i play with mods and attempt to make them 

speaking of which paradox just shot down two of my mods that changed the mess that are ukrainian city and state names a mixture of russian ukrainian and typos and respectively gave it historically accurate ukrainian and russian ones this couldve been completely avoided by importing the dynamic names system from ck3 since they already imported the 3d characters from it that i personally dont mind

if we cant even mod the game to our hearts content then what are we to make of this game

the toprated mods currently on the workshop are mostly if not all from those that played the leak and mantained it to make it stable what does this teach us if it wasnt for the leak the game wouldve been abandoned very early on if not for the pity of victoria 2 veterans for it 

just take a look at laggy the late game is it was like that in the leak too and paradox tells us that only now they discovered the reason of that what about the typos in the code messing up the ai this release wouldve been even more of a disaster like imperators though the difference is that vicky 3 has a loyal vicky 2 fanbase while imperator was a completely new game with no previous fanbase to keep the game alive with their modding

i dont know about you guys but i want the game to be worth my 50 bucks not be an investment for the future if a multimillion dollar company needs to have mods fixing the game then perhaps they should hire those modders to do their work for them instead

do you want an actual game made for modding thats amazing by just itself has a sensible dlc policy and is worth its money then try rimworld if one person can do what a multidollar company couldnt in 20 years then you seriously need to reevaluate who you give your money to

#####

i dont know what is happening how it happens or what my actions signify

#####

a little light around the edges but hands down a banger game and is in easily paradoxs best release state yet a lot of the nitpicks and ui issues have already been ironed out in patches and while new content is still guaranteed to come its worth picking up now to play around with for a good chunk of hours maybe not for those looking for a 1000 hours straight away 

note this one is very beginner friendly which will instantly piss off the more eu oriented paradox fans who enjoy watching 50 youtube tutorials before even starting the game or restarting the game 30 times so that sir roger rng fartinhaus agrees to their defensive pact and they can have a perfect 88th run snoozefest as portugal

#####

global financial crisis simulator

#####

this game is a chaotic romp through history where political groups act out a monty python sketch and your attempt to manage it all feels like herding cats through a laser pointer convention while juggling flaming top hats 1010

#####

with the latest update a lot of bug fixes and gameplay tweaks have been made and some issues addressed the devs are actively improving the game making me semi happy but there still is a lot to do

#####

im surprised the reaction to this game has been so poor especially considering how positive victoria 2 is seen perhaps it is rosetinted glasses at play perhaps a more fundamental break in what direction paradox is taking things in it feelsundeserved of the hate 

for those of you who did not play victoria 2 especially the base game release if going by the reviews youd be better off picking that up i cannot stress this enough this would be a mistake victoria 2 was a good game great even but after over a decade it shows its age on its sleeve the game is unstable crashing multiple times a game the economy system is oblique and frankly nonintuitive and the politics are somehow rigid for a sandbox game 

victoria 3 solves most of these problems the game is vastly more stable than victoria 2 so while you may want to save once and a while its hardly the imperative it was for its predecessor the economy is still indepth but is actually presentable in a way that makes it possible to discern what you need at a glance politics are the perfect blend of sandboxy allowing you to pick and choose reforms and shift around the interest groups in play and yet those same interest groups mean you must plan ahead 

the biggest complaint i see is about the combat system victoria 3 combat is significantly different from basically any other paradox game and that makes itcontentious i personally like it because war was never my particular interest in victoria 2 but i understand why others dont it does in some ways feel incomplete 

overall while victoria 2 may be a complete game its also old and unstable victoria 3 i can safely say as someone who has poured several hundred hours into each has given me more enjoyment as of late with the dlc and updates hopefully the game will continue to improve until its seen undisputedly as a worthy successor

ive never played a vicky game before and i just love this one  its big epic deep totally engaging and very educational  as much as ive enjoyed sid meiers civ games they seem mild compared to this masterpiece  where the game really shines is in managing your economy and internal politics  you cant just make big decisions and enact laws on a whim you need to have some powerful interest groups supporting you  also sometimes enacted laws can upset people like how i had a lot of unhappy campers after enacting the propertied women law and they tried for years to get me to repeal it    

im really impressed at all the thought the devs put into the economic system  by comparison in civ if youve researched a technology and have the requisite resources generally speaking youre good to go  in vicky3 however after researching the technology the real work begins  for example railroads  once researched you can setup railways in your cities  however do you have coal lumber and steel  if not you need to setup coal mines lumberyards iron mines and steel processing facilities or import those resources  how about engines  if not you will need to import them or setup engine workshops  if youre missing any of these things then youre going to see the infamous little red box denoting shortages and productivity hits   whats more setting up resource gathering operations does not mean instantaneous resolution  you need to wait for employees to start working in those operations and bring the productivity up then wait for the resources to be transported to where theyre needed  anyway i could go on with other examples but i think you get the idea 
 
concerning the economics of vicky3 balancing the budget is a very unique challenge ive never experienced anything quite like it  it can be nerve wracking in the extreme but very satisfying when you get it right 

the visuals and artwork of vicky 3 are breathtakingly beautiful  you can see whales swimming in the ocean clouds floating over your country or even things like the widespread devastation of the krakatoa eruption zoom in on your cities and you can watch them slowly transform from agrarian hamlets to sprawling early industrial metropolises with corresponding sound effects  

also worth noting that the games music didnt phase me much at first but really grew on me after a while especially as the themes seem to get more majestic as you go  maybe the game could benefit from cultural music dlcs but im completely happy with it as it stands now  it fits the games atmosphere perfectly  

i know more than a few people were unhappy that the military in the game seemed to take a back seat but for me its fine  after all in vicky3 youre a high level politician and policy maker not a tactical general  you basically manage the military infrastructure and allot them what resources you can spare call them up when needed and let your generals and admirals do the rest  also worth noting that investing too much in the military before you have the economy and infrastructure to support it is the fast track to bankruptcy  my only minor complaint is that maybe the game could benefit from more visualizations of your military formations perhaps coming in a future dlc but honestly im fine at the moment with the system as is  

speaking of dlc ive been playing japan and its maybe a bit immersion breaking when you see a painting of europeans when special events happen but im kind of assuming we will see some cultural pack dlcs at some point  concerning japan im really impressed with how vicky3 showcases their rapid and radical transformation from medieval shogunate to a modern society and ive been learning a lot of history in the process  

anyway this review has gone on longer than i meant it to but i would leave you with a paraphrased comment someone made in the prerelease hype days it will be a complex game and i probably wont be very good at it but will still enjoy every moment of the experience  d

thanks for taking the time to read this

#####

imagine eu4 with a superficially more complex economic system but somehow even shallower military gameplay and you basically have victoria iii 

declaring war and the military gameplay is very obviously deliberately stripped down and intentionally annoying as they blatantly intend to sell you a dlc or two based around fixing that issue in the future

diplomacy is also equally abysmal and as others have said it is basically a command economy sim unlike victoria ii unlike other paradox games however theyve made no real attempt at bothering to hide the fact theyve intentionally made many aspects of the game really quite rubbish in order to scalp you for more ducats in the near future

cant really change any laws cant really do much of anything with an uneducated population by default most countries have banned migration by default for some reason so unless youre playing a moderately powerful european country it is very possible that any building you construct just loses money

essentially youll spend most of the game sitting around

#####

in short the combat system is disappointing the ui is a mess and the core mechanics do not do justice to its predecessor
this game is worth 2999 max not 4999

#####

a secret educational tool on leftist economics

#####

day night cycle dlc  this thing is going nowhere

#####

so vicky 3 is here what about it well victoria 3 is a society builder game and despite what some might say it is a fairly deep and connected game in some but not all areas more on that in a bit when it comes to economics victoria 3 is not a realistic interpretation of victorian economics at all but neither was victoria 2 what victoria 3 does right with its economics is making them all connected and giving the feeling of growing and developing a real economy in the era which goes a long way considering this is all the game currently has to offer in most cases when you start you will usually begin by building many different buildings to help your economy grow researching technologies to get laws that you can pass to get more buildings or techs to change production methods to help grow your economy its a fairly interesting gameplay loop and it can at times be very rewarding when the game itself works as intended

victoria 3 is a gem in the way that it makes itself appear like a very deep and complicated game and dont get me wrong in some aspects it is however the game constantly falls short just as you are starting to get deep into it while i was playing i kept finding myself running into many things that seemed odd or were just very bland an example would diplomacy on first sight it seems very deep especially when tied into the diplomatic play system and how the ai can react depending on the situation however after about 12 hours of game time its clear that the diplomacy is ok and best and very shallow at its worst when dealing with other nations mostly in diplomatic plays there are only a few ways to get them involved the primary way being diplomatic obligations what are these well imagine prussia is about to go to war with denmark the danes naturally dont want to get rolled by the prussians and their chances of winning on their own seem slim so they tell the french hey ill owe you something if you help more likely than not if you didnt  yourself for good relations with the french which many times still isnt enough france will without hesitation or care in the world throw itself into the fray sending waves upon waves of men crashing upon your borders oh you withstood the professional army well i guess i should just sur sike here comes the conscripts baby total war for my danish brothers do not misunderstand me the victorian era was an era were maintaining the balance of power was very important to the great powers and this was sometimes done by force as we can see with the crimean war however to the extent that i am seeing in game where every war i fight is a life or death war where conscripts must be raised even if it is for a nation as small as denmark in many cases in real life the balance of power was upheld by pen and paper just look at the 1878 treaty of berlin for as deep as diplomacy is meant to be and the fact that war is supposed to be the last resort in many cases it feels like the only resort there is no real deep diplomatic dealings you can do with other nations outside trade agreements there is no diplomatic dealings to settle a war before it begins there is nothing it is so bare bones its almost laughable that they marketed it as if it were deep

this sadly isnt all though lets have a quick fire off to see what else is wrong with diplomacy war diplomacy and war itself

ai constantly backs down from diplomatic plays even if their very independence is threatened this also goes for native uprisings and revolutions i once took greece as the ottomans without firing a shot likely story

ai will throw anything and everything at you for the smallest most insignificant nation in existence

war is not properly explained generals constantly enter battle with smaller amounts of troops than the enemy even if you field the larger overall army modifiers are poorly explained and usually put deep within hidden menus such as why your men enter battle with lower moral etc

terrain and seasons are very bland as far as the game is concerned it is always summertime so there is no debuffs to movement in say winter in the italian alps spring in russia etc none of that matters its just random modifiers assigned when the battle starts

you cannot add wargoals mid war you cannot give allies land before during or really after wars you cannot join wars in progress i feel like i dont have to explain why this is an issue in a game set during the victorian era

lack of any real diplomatic options whatsoever when it comes to discussing peace preventing wars or modifying the outcomes of wars treaty of berlin style very very shallow you essentially see a nation with a green thumbs up and say i choose you

there is no scramble for africa no treaties nothing ai barely if at all colonizes

revolutions of 1848 what are those never happened never seen hungary revolt yet havent see any semblance of turmoil at all during the so called spring of nations this brings me to something else this game is in desperate need of some railroading the japanese empire almost never forms the ottomans are replaced by egypt almost as soon as the oriental crisis as none of the gps get involved at all even if you have high relations with them in most cases its clear the devs somewhat intended this with events but it just doesnt happen american civil war is never normal most times the csa is just the us east coast taiping heavenly kingdom more often than not is spawning in the most islamic parts of china and do you know why this happens its because these rebellions are meant to fire off where ever this in unrest yea im sure you can see the issue with this as well

the border gore is outside of this world thanks to the lack of railroading i have seen several times where the british just let the chinese ban opium

revolutions when they do actually happen are actually pointless as they only change one or two laws they are never actually true radical revolutions if the ussr ever forms it is always because of silent reform that the tsar must essentially do himself

the railroading doesnt need to be 100 like hoi4 historical ai but its clear that this vicky 3 ai is dumb as rocks and clearly needs someone to hold its hand hell i got so tired of watching the ottomans get eaten entirely by egypt that i had to install a mod for it on launch day

there is no late game content essentially nothing the world just kinda does its thing no berlin conference no colonial conflicts no nothing the game just goes and it just does and it makes me very sad i can safely say that after engaging with this game the steps they took for war were a massive over correction and there needs to be at least a small amount of micro if not that at least of the love of god make the diplomacy deeper in regard to these things please

this game launched as a foundation as many people say but is the foundation even really there i was constantly supportive and excited for this game only be given absolute mid this game does a lot of things better than victoria 2 but the thing is that victoria 2 has been around for 12 years and it has mods it has things that make it a deeper experience that has grown on people for over a decade and its like paradox didnt even care about at least trying to make seem like a preferable alternative to victoria 2 at launch i am literally on day one praying that there are some mods soon that can turn this into a better experience than what ive unfortunately gone through so far conclusion did i spend 80 on this game yes am i sad about no will i keep playing this game sadly hopefully pdx can patch it up or at least the modders personally i dont think this game will be abandoned theres too much at stake for them to do that at least thats what the cope in me is saying

#####

its a neat game but its no victoria game
 vicy 2 had a great economy system with only two expansions most interestingly the laissezfaire or capitalist economy in victoria was incredibly challenging but also rewarding gameplay vicy 3 is set up to need several and contrary to their policy on wars they wouldnt dare let you not have a choice opting to bypass the opinions of the capitalist pops
 the market systems are interesting but so underwhelming that it feels like it was basically implemented in order to sell dlc gone it seems is the global market with countries taking priority positions for your goods now you have to set up trade routes vs letting pops try to figure it out
 wars being almost completely out of your control diminishes player agency within the game ai meddling in and seemingly able to reach every single war is incredibly tedious
 unit diversity is on a vertical progression track with there being almost no reason not to click on the next unit so no more switching up the ranks to suit the environment they will be fighting in
 there is no real diversity between nations outside of skins and their starting power gone are the days of trying to organise and then westernise your country just play afghanistan and become a super power as if youve always been a unified nation capable of challenging the uk at its prime

overall its a paradox game in 2022 a bare bones platform ripe for dlc hopefully modding can do some good with it

#####

after some patches i can now finally recommend this game its a game about the era of industrialization with a focus on the economy and politics diplomacy and warfare are there too but theyre abstracted you play as the spirit of the nation your function is to select research chose groups or parties in the government pass laws like do you have foreign trade at all have elections allow slavery allow immigrants in or out and so on which is influenced by the interests of powerful groups in your country most importantly you build industries select production methods for them and create production chains you build sawmills cause early on everything needs wood including your people who use it for heating then you start using better tools for samills and you need tool factories which need iron and you extract iron using tools then you find some coal and use it to make steel and you use steel at tool factories and now tools are cheaper and your sawmills are more productive but you dont need wood as much now that you have coal so maybe you switch your furniture factories to producing fancy furniture that only rich people buy now your industrialists who profit from factories become more powerful and back new economic laws which were previously blocked by agrarian landowners

what ive described is a very basic idea of what happens in the game there are plenty of resources in industries unless you start as a major country you wont have some of these resources or your economic laws and entrenched interest groups would make this journey different one thing people complain about is lack of flavor as in country or culturespecific events and tasks it would be nice to have stuff like that but the countries do feel distinct due to their unique starting circumstances and also major countries all have some unique events going on for them most notably usa and ottoman empire

plays well on steam deck but id recommend using a font mod like roboto or san francisco the issue is not even with the fonts themselves but with a lot of text being light grey on top of dark grey which makes it hard to read with a smaller resolution

#####

if you are new to history games especially paradox games victoria iii is something you should not be playing first i am a massive fan of paradox and will always be if you are new i would highly recommend you try ckiii first to get a glimpse of paradox games then start moving towards more complicated games like hoi4 or eu4 if you want to get the most out of them however you should get the dlc subscription it is so worth it but back to victoria iii it is very tedious and hard to learn like hoi4 and eu4 it will take around 50100 hours for you to fully understand the game enough to play it regularly at first the game was super confusing and unnecessarily complex however watching tutorials and just throwing myself into the game learning it via baptism by fire really did help me understand the complexity of the game once you sit down and read the journals and figure out how to properly manage an economy the game becomes rather easy if youre playing minormajor powers politics are also confusing especially the radicals and loyalists system but once again keep playing the game and you will learn it the warfare mechanics when the game came out were bad but after paradoxs new update reworking it i can honestly say that now the game has massive improvements overall the game is in its first phase of reworks and updates and in possibly 23 years this might be a game close to matching with eu4 once many more dlcs are added

victoria was beautiful when i first witnessed her
it was love at first sight we had a lot of fun i enjoyed the time we had but i was a fool blinded by her beauty i ignored her flaws believing she will change but she never did it is part of her character i can only blame myself after multiple back steps i have to end it invested 50 dollars in this relationship and i feel ripped maybe ill try again in 5 years and update my review

#####

it is a little rough around the edges but the core mechanics are well though out i really love the way they have modeled the free market and really like not having to micro my units like in victoria 2 i can see this becoming one of the best paradox games of all time but as with all things it will take a little patience 



#####

buy it in 2 years if you like good games
buy it now if you are lonely and miserable nerd like me
or alternatively you study sociology or economics me
goodbye

edit it ok now you can buy yes

#####

latest update is great content is awesome and i like the new army changes so why the bad review in the last hour my game has crashed more times than the entire time ive owned it since launch its also the second time i havent received my dlc content from the expansion pass and had to put in a support ticket to receive it

#####

ok this is just a quick review i would need a lot of more time to fully grasp everything but so far

 performance is pretty good loading times at least for me are fine
 the said several times it is more focused on the society and economic aspects rather the the military so keep this in mind i would not be surprised some aspects got overhauled later but now it does work fine
 the tutorial is pretty good not on the same level as the ck iii but does the trick most of the time there was only a handful of times which i got confused on what exactly the tutorial want me to do
 this is a huge and complex game so expect some rough edges

#####

i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone but the most diehard grand strategy fans

in its current state victoria 3 is an alpha game priced at 50 euro strewn with bugs and obviously missing features which paradox will sell as exorbitantly priced dlcs years after the games release for example foreign investment mechanics are totally absent according to paradox these will be added later alongside an expansion  which is strange because you can download totally free user made mods that add foreign investment to the game right now go to the steam workshop search it up hit subscribe and youre good if some random guy can add foreign investment to the game as a little hobby project then how come a professional team of veteran video game developers cant the answer is that they can they just arent allowed to by their corporate overlords

thats all too often the modus operandi of this company release a half finished broken mess of a game then slowly fix it while demanding hundreds of euros for expansions to turn it into what it shouldve been at launch

with that said you might wonder why i have so many hours in this game if i dont recommend it thats because the games foundation is solid and as its essentially based around watching numbers go up its i entertaining i its i addicting i its i unique i thats why you can play it without being bored it is not however i good i diplomatic plays is a fine concept but why are they so limited and restrictive why cant we interact with our puppet states why arent power blocs or crises a thing the production of goods and building system is solid but why cant we do foreign investment why cant factory owners control their factories production methods why cant we stockpile resources for example to prepare for wartime war is a critical component of any grand strategy game and is present in a somewhat useable form but why is there no evolution of how war plays out pitched battles evolving into trench warfare for example why cant you field more than two ship types in a navy at the same time why has the issue of frontlines splitting and being left undefended which can easily cost you months of ingame progress still not fixed why are battles just aggregate numbers fighting aggregate numbers without any nuance why is the system so arcane and opaque and why is the ui so lackluster confusing and ugly despite paradox having a decade of experience designing them why are internal politics so bland and gamey i could go on and on and on but you get the point the foundation is solid but theres little more than a wooden shack built ontop of it

and oh my god the performance isb atrocious b even on a powerful machine beyond the games recommended specs the game slows to a snails pace past 1900 onethird of the games timeframe past 1920 its essentially unplayable

as a silver lining i will say that the game has improved significantly since its launch especially regarding the warfare system and nonplayer economics and dont get me wrong i dont want this game to fail i dont want this company to fail i really really really want this game to be good because there is so much potential here but it isnt good its far from good its a buggy unfinished flavorless directionless mess of a game that future promises and duct tape fixes cannot excuse

dont buy this game if you want to play victoria 3 go sail the high seas and come back in a couple of years lets hope that by that time the game will be what it shouldve been a year ago

#####

still rough around the edges but a fantastic core hope it gets the support it deserves to find greatness

#####

unplayable in its current state game breaking moments happen that ruin your game like randomly losing all your vassals unable to push all your demands on enemies by them conceding before war only 1 of your demands would rather go to war for all my demands kind of the point of taking the infamy unable to push all your claims only some of them obvious bug etc

just not a finished game unfortunate but with paradoxs track record its to be expected

#####

a great way to learn historical materialism

is the war system as currently enacted perfect  no  is the game currently perfect  no  is the game currently fun  heck yes  im looking forward to seeing how the game continues to evolve over time but overall its still a pretty great game in its current iteration

#####

was so excited for the release of the game and extremely disappointed after playing it for a few days gameplay is repetitive for every nation the lack of control over warfare and troop movements is terrible and some economic features dont make sense why would your nation continue trading away resources when you already lack the resources how are you trading something you dont have and decreasing a nonexistent supply i was introduced to victoria 2 on youtube and liked what i saw but decided to wait for victoria 3 terrible mistake on my part although victoria 2 has its own flaws its still better than this abomination i play hoi4 eu4 ck3 and vic3 and this game is honestly the worst of the bunch

#####

a better politicaleconomic simulator than vicky 2 but things that youd think would be vanilla have been left out so they can sell them back to you in 20 dlc sphere of influence is selling me foreign investment as a feature that i could pony up for if i wanted it and not like an integral part of the simulation between getting features from vicky 2 sold back to me piecemeal the dearth of bugs and unintended effects im over it
heres something that sums up the game there are several complex factors that might lead your pops to revolt standards of living dropping due to goods getting more expensive or pops losing their jobs to newer production methods political friction discrimination etc but one catchall solution to revolts

just dont build barracks in any state but your capital just dont if there are no barracks in any revolting state and your capital cannot revolt the rebels have no armies there is no simulation of armed civil unrest they can only march down to their local barracks and convince the regiment of soldiers there to take up arms so here it all falls apart due to unintended interactions and you can rule like north korea safe in the knowledge your doomstack of armies can crush all dissension

#####

this game is a dissappointment on all fronts

unfortunately the developers wanted nations not to be railroaded so they didnt add any flavour events or decisions even to major powers like russia russia has one 1 nation specific journal entry the warsystem is nothing short of agonizing as the player has no input whatsoever on the armies and the armies themselves are represented by camps on the map a massive visual downgrade from every other pdx game the ui is terrible as an example all trade goods are crammed into a single interface at the bottom of the screen which means the player has to search for the good first managing larger nations takes up tedious amounts of time because crucial information like infrastructure and state modifiers are not displayed in building menues interface hopping is frequent and takes alot of dynamics out of the gameplay

please do yourself a favour and wait with your purchase until this game has received one or more overhauls in the next few years saying this game has potential is nothing but admitting that its current state falls short of all expectations the vic2 community had for it

#####

victoria 3 is what could be a very positive experience with some major downsides some of which are intrinsic to paradoxs model of game release it does succeed very well at its main purpose of being a simulation of economics and politics in the victorian era and those are by far its best parts but is dragged down by two problems one of which is simply lack of content the truth is the game has barely any change between the various nations both in gameplay and in flavor a representative democracy like the usa will play exactly the same as and have exactly the same events and objectives as a expansionist monarchy like imperial russia this severely bogs down replayability as besides setting some personal goals and challenges like turning a minor nation like tibet into a world powerthere is simply just not much new content if youve played one nation in vic3 you have played them all the second problem is just the honestly god awful war combat system paradox games are known for complex hard to learn mechanics but my lord the combat system in this game is the most needlessly bloated yet oversimplified thing i have ever witnessed and it seems to try and obfuscate itself the more you try and understand it maybe im just bad or stupid but the best way i can describe it is you gather your soldiers into armies then give those armies an order such as defend the frontline or push the frontline forward and then once a battle commences the games ai takes over and starts playing risk combat while smoking metric tons of meth there is also no way to control the at least general direction of where your armies move they could be at your enemies capitals doorstep and decide to take the rural bumfuck farm province next door instead anyways vic3 seems like a game that will be pretty good in 2 years light 610 its fun but id wait

#####

the game is fun until you lose your first war even though you are absolutely crushing them the ways in which you can be forced to surrender are absolutely unrealistic really enjoyed the game at first but unless the devs fix the war mechanics i wouldnt recommend buying it

#####

wide as an ocean deep as a puddle

the game is messy not plausible and cheesy this is a real disappointment for me personally

probably worth getting it on sale 5 years from now after a ton of patches

#####

ok let me start off by saying this games my crack i love watching my poor little portuguese empire grow up and slap france and the brits in ww1

heres why im putting a thumbs down though

1 an entire session in this game is meant to run for about 8 hours from start to finish issue is by the 20 year mark the computer is processing so many numbers that you start seeing a slowdown itll only get worse as the campaign continues i have a good pc and id wish this game had a performance mode or was better optimized and honestly i find it unacceptable its a flaw in every single paradox game

2 unintuitive ui i dont want to get into it but its a nightmare to find anything ive seen youtubers that play this game daily for content fumble around looking for a specific piece of info or system

3 the infamous paradox dlc issue this game barely has two dlcs at the time of writing and one manages to make the game even more frustrating while costing 15 bucks and being a glorified culture pack for france forget getting the full experience if youre not playing france the other is a day night cycle and a skin pack for the border of the map this feels like a joke i paid to get the expansion pass expecting decent content out of it i already stopped buying dlc for stellaris and ck3 because of how blatantly overpriced they are and the frequency theyre released and now that last dlc in the pass better be really good or im just not buying these games anymore

i cant stress how much i love this game but damn between being an rng fest poorly communicating what things do the slowdown that turns a 6h run into a 12h slog these absolute dlc misses i mean for crying out loud hoi4 completely revamps entire game systems and adds gameplay to nations that dont have any vic3 slaps an extra thing on top of a system that needs tweaking changes a few things in said system and calls it a day pay us 15 bucks now

ill give it a not as bad as imperator10 get it on a deep sale

edit yep glad i thumbed this game down in the recent patch they apparently tweaked the british ai to be a bit smarter in its colonizing it now is much more prone to starting a colony in the kenyan corridor which was the prime way of preventing francebritain from colonizing south africa what boggles me the most is the fact that portugal starts with colonial exploitation and not expansion heck in all the runs ive done so far ive never seen the option to shift to anything that isnt no colonial affairs the government laws system needs an absolute overhaul heck why not have focus trees like in hoi
countries like portugal feel like they can only play one way to be successful starting with one construction sector and no wood production which is hilarious considering theres an entire island named wood madeira didnt get those central south african lands and are now missing lead forget making a large modern army didnt get colonies with oil thats the motor industry down the drain go back to peddling sugar luxury furniture and clothes and tea

its an amazing economy sim but the margin for error when playing smaller countries is so narrow germanys pretty fun though

game review dlc  10 

jokes aside imagine you take a giant chocolate cake right everyone is aware its a chocolate cake looks very very beautiful on the outside and you cant wait to dig in then you turn the cake around and realize half of the cake is missing and the inside is vanilla despite saying its a chocolate cake 
you call the baker and say hey im missing half of my cake and its vanilla not chocolate
baker says sorry we kinda ran out of money while baking it but well sell you the rest of the cake for triple the price of your current one in a few months or so 

this is what victoria 3 is its a giant pretty turd it has imperator syndrome where the game looks very good but then you take a bite and you have poop in your mouth i understand every aspect of the game and how to manage it properly it doesnt make it any less boring or egregious 

it has become the new normal to accept this kind of behavior from paradox 
oh yeah the game sucks on release but it will be good eventually as long as people buy it initially they probably wont abandon it just wait for some dlc to fix the issue 
so why do we accept that they sold us half a cake and expect us to buy the rest of the cake over the next few years

also why does paradox never do any real testing of their games its usually only a super small select group of people who all align with paradoxs woke ideology and in doing so enforce the games shambly structure paradox needs testers that will go yo man not gonna lie this game is absolute dog water and the warfare system is horrible heres how to fix it 

i had a funny feeling in my gut based on the strict gameplay embargo up until around 12 days of release that this would likely be a giant turd even the dev streams were extremely buggy or heavily scripted full of commentators who were super boring or awkward to watch 

i wont even mention the steam forumdiscord echo chamber anyone who mentioned the game would be bad got shunned or silenced into submission apparently difference of opinion is extremely frowned upon and wanting the game to release in a finished state is too much to ask for

this doesnt deserve to be called victoria 3 it feels and plays nothing like the previous titles and is stuffed with woke ideology like communism being the most effective form of government it might be good in a few years but as of right now its a steaming pile of disgusting swamp water i could go on and on but the more i think about this game the more irritated i get

#####

an overhated game for sure
it has flaws no doubt and is far from perfect but still nonetheless incredibly fun

but for the love of god
add flavour

#####

tried a couple hours during a free trial weekend and i just cant recommend it its bland its boring its unintuitive it seems to lead nowhere and the choices you get appear feverishly limited

quite disappointed as a paradox fan overall hoping to get a good experience out of a niche era this definitely wasnt it

#####

personally i enjoy this game it is certainly an economic simulator things could be better in the game and some bugs ironed out but i am enjoying it

#####

there is simply no good alternative for what victoria is

no other game exposes an economicgeopolitcal simulation of such granularity and polish as victoria does
 goods pops cultures all simulated ive once won a war by raiding convoys of an enemy country which completely broke their economy its not even hardcoded that you can do it instead you can do it because economy is simulated and you can do a lot of things with it
 pretty decent diplomatic interactions and diplomatic maneuvering phase at the beginning of a conflict which simulates geopolitical poker as sides try to pull others into the conflict and force enemy to back down by intimidation
 war is okayish not very developed a bit confusing at the times but the war is not so much about war its about achieving what you want by cunning diplomatic maneuvirng and building up your economy

i kinda feel like the negative reviews come from high expectations victoria is an ambitious project its hard to deliver a good geopoliticaleconomic simulator but once again i simply feel like victoria outclasses any other project available on the market

is it a perfect game no there are things that could be further developed a pattern that we see with every paradox game
but its going in a good direction and its evident that devs listen to the feedback as they actively work on the parts of the game that were pointed as weak spots by the community

#####

has potential all i can say

#####

this game is decent for the most part

the issue will always be the combat as the combat system needs tweaking as well as the ai needs to stop joining in wars that logistically makes no sense for instance why does russia need to join in war happening in south america its 1860 theres absolutely no way russia would be interested in a war so far flung from home little nuisances like this can be changed in the game to make a much more immersive experience for the player i still recommend the more we play this game the more it can be fixed

#####

me starts war with someone as an attacker has a deficit on majority of stats due to the fact that its a defensive war they get bonuses as a defender 

ai starts war with me as an attacker doesnt get any deficit whatsoever and actually beats me while having negative 100 small arms and other supplies

the ai is completely rigged in the fact that they can be 50 million dollar in debt and have absolutely no resources and still beat you while you have a surplus of anything game is trash and it shows paradox can suck a dick

#####

so far this game is terribly flawed other people who are smarter than me have pointed them out better than i could like the war system the ai etc etc
but what i find myself longing for is the incredible realism vic2 had sure some things were limited to make the game playable but most of it is really realistic if you wanted to expand a factory you either used the resources you had on hand or bought it from the market if you wanted to defund your military in order to enhance your nation you could do that if you wanted to build buildings slower but not less in numbers you could do that if you wanted to make the rich richer so that they can build your economy with you you could do that if you understand what i mean its that vic3 has none of those aspects instead of realistic ways you can shape your nation you have tiers for your taxes tiers for your military and tiers for your building instead of it being your money and your funding how quickly you build up your economy its a number that goes up by building things a limit instead of a slider if you see that you cannot afford all of those buildings to be finished so quickly be it oyur taxes are already maxed out or your naton is too unstable you can either pause it completely or reduce the funding where your buildings will take longer to complete and you can only build less buildings 
this of course is not everything i dislike about the game but it is what nags me the most overall this game will suffer the fate as other paradox titles do we will wait for a few months get a dlc that improves something and then we wait for another we repeat this until weve spent over 200 bucks on a singular game just to make it playable only because paradox has a monopoly on grand strategy map games

#####

i have tried my best to like this game but its just a disaster the new update made it better but that is because the bar was so low to begin with it feels like every nation plays the exact same its a boring mess of trying to micromanage in many small menus i guess its a good economy simulator but this is not the legendary grand strategy game we were promised while the idea of having generals lead a war sounds cool it does not work sure the new update somewhat fixed the naval invasion wackamole but the frontlines system is still terrible and feels more rng dependant than eu4 chances are they will fix it through slowly implementing hundreds of dollars of dlc

#####

the warfare sucks and i feel like i am doing nothing

#####

ive had this game since day one and the release was disappointing but i came back to it recently and they have worked out a lot of dents especially the combat in my opinion the game has had a rough first year and i played but did not enjoy it but the new updates have really brought more depth to this game regarding warfare and diplomacy though theirs still grey spots the game is heading a healthier direction i wouldnt get this game for full price but instead wait for a sale i also recommend avoiding flavor packs besides the recent one with south america since ive heard good about it hope this review was helpful have great day

#####

ive played victoria 3 more than any other game before actually reviewing it for launch and i kid you not when i say i have never once felt bored too angry to go on or as if something was too frustrating to look past victoria 3 has genuinely made me feel like an excited child running back to his game to continue playing and getting more and more immersed and hyped as various mechanics all of a sudden just click 

this is likely going to be the most complex strategy game youve ever played and its going to take you hundreds of hours of gameplay to fully understand all of it but once you do even before that happens actually victoria 3 offers a strategy experience like no other and despite a few shortcomings which i hope will be remedied in the future a strategy game like this only releases about once or twice every decade and when the launch version of victoria 3 is as fantastic and addicting as it is right now i just know this game is going to have an amazing future

#####

i absolutely hate the new war system wars are such a boring affair now no strategy and no visuals of armies clashing with such a beautiful map its a real shame to be missing out on cool war animations its just this number vs that number a lot like risk nations have zero flavor why there should be missions to guide nations along their historical path or alternating paths if you choose as it stands every nation is essentially the same i also find myself missing the old factory and market system from vicky 2 capitalists dont build anything laissez faire is nonexistent for some reason you just sit there creating buildings all game this seems like a real step back from the original games

the one notable positive is the map its really well done if only the mechanics were done with the same care

please fire whoever designed this god awful war system

update after more play my original review stands the war is absolutely awful war is a huge part of the game prussia is constantly at war the us and france have quite a few conflicts and the uk pursues wars globally there is just no excuse for the system being so bad 

this game most reminds me of those idle games for your phone where you build buildings and just sit and wait then you do it again then you go to war this number vs that number and then back to waiting on the building completion bars 

furthermore there are surprisingly few ways to play the game being multicultural is always better than being a slave nation having no religion is always better than being a religious nation and the list goes on every nation you play is a rush to become multicultural because its just better than the alternatives this makes every nation experience roughly the same there arent many tough choices since more often than not one option is just objectively better than the others every nation either becomes a liberal democracy or you just fall behind

micromanagement sucks for a game that abstracts so many systems somehow the micromanagement is tedious and unavoidable if you play a nation with lots of states youre in for a nightmare since every economy is a command economy where only the state builds factories mines and farms 

im just so disappointed do better paradox

#####

oi bruv its chewsday innit

















#####

this game could have been great the warfare system is so messed up i outnumbered the enemy by literally 5 to 1 in brigades for some reason my ai generals that i have no control over aside from attack or defend decided that oh ill attack these 7 brigades with 3 brigades like what the country that im attacking literally has militia and i have line infantry but i lose nonetheless the economy in this game is extremely easy compared to vic 3 as japan you can just build shit tons of coal and iron mines because why not also there are civilian factories thats what they are they also reallllly try for you to be a good guy in the game in japan i have to allow women to vote and make a republic in order to have the meji restoration how does that make sense and when it comes to the trail of tears the decisions are you really going to force these people to move thats kinda mean you can also just get rid of slavery in the us and serfdom in russia from the start of the game because fuck it who cares 

btw i have played victoria 2 eu4 ck2 ck3 hoi3 hoi4 stellaris victoria 1 and i even played imperator so for all the people saying oh you just hate paradox or you dont know how to play no thats not true

#####

tldr a good game could even be a great game but i cant recommend it at the current price wait for a sale 

video review

httpsyoutube_s9ekdc2jvo

#####

has some major problems but is still one of my favorite paradox games the economy system is very fun

#####

i dont usually take the time to write reviews but ive seen so many just insane bad takes on this game that i feel i should write a positive one to help balance them out it would be a shame if the negative response victoria 3 has received from certain sections of the paradox fan base discouraged them from continuing to develop this game before you think of me as a fanboy ive never really trusted paradox since i bought imperator rome on release 

victoria 3 benefits from a narrower focus than any other modern paradox game other than hoi4 which results in much better modeling of that shorter period and unlike most other paradox titles the historical simulation remains reasonably accurate throughout the entire game this is something that their 
 secondmost recent crusader kings 3 mostly fails at applying a sort of high medievalesque system both before it had come about and after it had gone away  as for the muchmaligned new warfare system its arguably the greatest innovation paradox has come up with in years in victoria 2 i would actively avoid fighting wars due to the micromanagement that they required and in the end the abuse you could subject the ai to made wars trivial if you were willing to commit to it if youre the kind of player that likes to manage all their battles army movements and conquests personally like a sort of 19th century alexander the great the new system might be something that pushes you away if youre that kind of player nothing wrong with it really virtually every other paradox game allows for that playstyle even requires it of you paradox cannot make an ai that can compete with a human on even footing and it probably wouldnt even be desirable for them to do so as long as creating component ai opponents is not possible making the player use the same system as the ai is an inspired way to make peer conflicts uncertain and exciting it puts the player in a sort of similar headspace to what real national leaders must have been in did i pick the right man for the job did i allocate enough resources what if the enemy does something we havent anticipated rather than just baiting an extremely predictable computer into attacking you in the mountains i hope that paradox implements a similar system into crusader kings 3 and perhaps even a stellaris sequel both of these games are stuck with the increasingly antiquated move a stack of guys around until you bash them into the enemys stack of guys method of warfare

the one major complaint i do have is how the investment pool operates the idea that your capitalists simply hand their money over to the government and trust them to spend it is absurd your capitalists also show a distinct lack of initiative and are more than happy to just sit around waiting for me to upgrade their ludicrously profitable tool workshop when they should be more than capable of doing it themselves this wouldnt be so bad if the game didnt already make an effort to model the limitations of the state with the new warfare system i cant directly order my troops around but i can order a privately owned business to adopt a production method that will bankrupt it if how to move my battalions is my generals choice it should be possible to offload the question of how to move iron to the steel mill to the owners of the mines 

i also have one minor complaint victoria 3s societies are far too happy to change this is absolutely a gameplay thing people like to be able to click buttons and see the green line go up but becoming an egalitarian society without any kind of racial or ethnic prejudice in 1850 is a genuinely impressive feat considering nobodys achieved it nearly 200 years after the games start date im not saying it shouldnt be possible in the game but it should be more difficult the forces of the status quo need to be a little stronger to make triumph over them rewarding in return maybe once you get the ball rolling subsequent progressive reforms might come a little faster

at the time of my writing this review this is the paradox game that has impressed me most with its state at release with none of the dlc or expansions that are surely yet to come victoria 3 is a rare example of real innovation within a strategy game franchise its systems are deep and complex while also being impressively transparent reasonably intuitive and not too difficult to learn i hope this trend continues with future paradox titles

#####

if you wish to give your nation a glorious thriving future if you wish to navigate your people through times of change and reform if you seek to shape a rural society into one of industries and machines victoria 3 is the game for you 

rating this game is so strange as it is so different from other paradox strategy games vicky 3 leaves the military to the side concentrating instead more on the socioeconomic part of ruling a nation and this seems to have disgruntled a lot of people 

i can partially see where the critics come from as the word id use to describe the combat system is functional at best bland at worst the game also had a rocky start at the release there were a lot of bugs and most systems werent as polished as they should have been and i agree with those who say the game was released unfinished 

still to this day i find negative reviews dating from back then and i read plenty of hateful comments towards the devs in the forums that i feel are mostly undeserved the game has deeply changed and for the better the devs worked hard and patch after patch they reworked most of the unfinished features and after a couple hundred hours of play distributed over more than a year the game is at a state where i would actively recommend it 

there is in fact a lot to appreciate  
the visuals are among the most appealing in the paradox catalogue with your villages growing into big sprawling cities with trainlines roads filled with cars and zeppelins in the skies 

the economy is one of the strongpoints of victoria as there is an intrinsic satisfaction in developing the production lines within your country and seeing your gdp go up you might choose to become the leading producer of clothes at a global level set up cocoa and sugar plantations and live off exports or maybe you just want to produce copious amounts of opium and sell it all to china 

with big changes in society come big changes in politics as well with dynamical interest groups gaining power at different points in the game that will form parties and push for specific laws this process might lead to a more open society with pensions and women being allowed to vote or maybe a ruthless dictatorship where every dissent is suppressed 

if you wish to push the might of your country around the world stage you wont declare a straight up war youll start a 
diplomatic play where if your opponent doesnt feel so confident in fighting against you and the requests are reasonable enough it might decide to give up and concede whatever you asked for without a bullet getting fired 

the overall sensation is that of shaping a society as youll lead your people through the winds of change brought by rapid industrialisation and sudden cultural shifts that is the reason why i find the game appealing and why i keep playing it 

my main criticism is the overall mildness of the geopolitical component i wish there was a little less focus in developing internally and more incentives towards building a global empire and fight with the other great powers for the control of strategical reason these thoughts seem to be addressed in the upcoming dlc sphere of influence and i might change my mind in the next weeks also late game performances are quite bad but seeing how other pdx games like hoi4 years after release still have such problems doesnt make me positive that these issues will be fixed any time soon   

overall i really enjoy victoria 3 and i feel that not all the criticism this game has received was justified this game has unlimited potential all the game systems are now consolidated and are just waiting to be expanded and the future looks bright if what ive said has interested you id say to give it a try the game is fairly cheap on sale and in my opinion the experience is worth the money

#####

its basically a flavourless techdemo it works for the most part but its just bland less railroading apparently means just not having custom historical events its a sandbox not a historical simulation and its not even an interesting sandbox just one that works on the most basic level

they will of course fix it while locking many features behind dlc as they always do spitting out half a game and selling the fun parts for 30 a piece is just a trashy buisness model but us paradox fans are used to it

update with 15 on its way it will be goodish game still severly lacking in the flavour departement but slowly getting there

#####

the core gameplay is fun thats the most important thing there are some real pain points in particular in ui and warfare but you have the option to mostly avoid them it can be a bit frustrating to actively avoid some parts of the game in order not to have the experience ruined most likely they will eventually be changed but they might not and the review is for the game is it is 
avoid the bad parts enjoy the good parts the game is fun and the core economic simulation is by far the best and most realistic in a pdx game to date

#####

this game is tragic

speaking here as a long time paradox fan ive put thousands on thousands of hours into their various titles including viccy 2 id like to go on at some length i have a lot of thoughts but this game doesnt make me angry it makes me sad and sadness doesnt beget long rambling rants from me ill keep it brief

the economics are fundamentally a command economy whatever johan or the neckbeards on the reddit want to tell you this makes them wildly unstable buisiness cannot dynamically shift production models to adjust to new goods they cannot make internal developments the game takes a marxist view of history and your mileage may vary on that but the sum total is the economics whilst not quite as terrifying as the jesus take the wheel fiscal policy of viccy 2 still fundamentally fails and this is a problem because its supposed to be the core gameplay loop

nations do not feel different the world is empty and generic russia has 1 unique flavor event just to give an example

the warfare system is catastrophically bad and this is where all the neckbeards dismiss me as it not being the focus of the game and the peacedeals are worse i was dragged into a war between bavaria and prussia as austria my generals were destroyed in detail either by attriting away or bringing 56k stacks into battle perhaps there is a reason theyre doing this the game gives no feedback i had higher stats too and had done more research than prussia i checked

the war was going extremely badly but i couldnt ask for a white peace because i wasnt the negotiating power if i capitulated i would have to give up my bohemian lands the heart of my economy i could not seek a seperate negotiated peace prussia was willing to accept a white peace but bavaria would not ask for one because they wanted to liberate some tiny  fuckoff germany city i was therefore held in the war for an entire decade bankrupting me at which point bavaria capitulated on my behalf 

i dont care if its not the focus of the game wars happened in this period and all the excuses in the world does nothing to address that with warfare micro removed the game is more frustrating and more bare and what you have to replace it is a command economy about as deep as an anno game

this is not as some people claim fixable with dlc johan made core decisions which are not now reversible with regards the warfare and economic system 200 dollars of dlc and 5 more years wont fix this i tried so hard to enjoy this i gave it a chance i preordered even after having read the dev diaries hoping it would all somehow come together it did not and after 6 years instead of a faithful iterative sequel we got this boring exhausting mess 

gods i need a drink

 
update


after my recent drunken stupor i decided i didnt really do my own thoughts or victoria iii justice in this review partially thats because i had no idea anyone would actually read it ive decided to spend the next few days picking away at the game and going into greater detail with my thoughts in the comments if youre interested a please remain stationary the nice men in white coats will be along shortly to treat your patent madness and b please subscribe to this thread for updates read bottom to top to avoid temporal mismanagement

#####

honestly this is the best economic simulator on the market like the global economy of real life i don like it but i play the stupid game anyway 

maybe ill build a tool factory to bad i dont have any tools to build it id have tools if i had any what are you looking at argentina huh stay away from my gold ill fight you to the last drop of peasant blood if i had any god damn it 
wait a minute you have gold and peasants lots of both i see lots of reasons for things to happen to you oh britain will protect you because they are pissed off i stopped selling them my tools i never had ok ill wait cause we both know the british are notorious for not being able to afford a meaningless war sooner or later they will do something incredible and stupid then when it all said and done they will look over at the great and mighty chilean nation and wonder why i have some much gold 
then my mighty chilean people will become british and i will refuse to play a new game for six months i know how this game works next time i play itll be the us who kills me maybe if i am lucky and shake thing up a bit france will kill me if i am truly blessed ill be surprised attacked by russia thatll be interesting and totally out of no where

#####

as it stands i think this is already a very good game with the potential to become a masterpiece with future patchesdlcs

it offers a different challenge based on the country you play as as france your economy basically runs by itself you can always improve it of course and you can take on most great powers while swiftly colonizing africa as lanfang adding a single level to your construction sector can crash your economy if you are not careful and you need the help of qing to fight most of your very weak neighbors
too bad the game lacks a bit of flavor right now so most differences between countries lie in how to mechanically run them instead of how their specific history develops

the economic system is very good with many synergies to be mindful of when building your industry a lot of variety production methods in particular and an interesting trading system to complement it
the budget screen is also very clear and easy to manage with various taxes and governmental wages to balance the books

on the other hand the war system is pretty buggy right now my few crashes and reloads have all happened during wars but in principle it brings a breath of fresh air to the grand strategy genre finally allowing you to give generic instructions to your generalsadmirals and let them take care of the details after all the main focus of the game lies elsewhere

speaking of which aside from economy diplomacy and politics play a big role with the former you set your stance on basically all international relations both friendly and not while war is just a extreme tool to enforce your will with the latter you control internal affairs by engaging with different interest groups and enactingrepealing different laws and decrees
both systems need some polishing but for the most part they work pretty well

finally theres the tech system with the tree split in three main branches production military social with both active and passive progress 
no complaints here choices are meaningful and variety is good without being overwhelming

as in victoria ii the core of the game is your population which heavily influences your actions in every aspect of the management of your country 
if you havent got enough workers you cant staff your buildings and without the necessary qualifications the more advanced production methods are useless
if you havent got enough soldiers you cant fight wars and if you are forced to conscript civilians your industry is in for a tough time
if the standard of living of your pops is below their expectations they are discriminated or you try to enact unpopular laws be prepared to face a revolution
if the average literacy of your people is low say goodbye to efficient research

the ui can be both a boon and a pain using nested tooltips you can dig very deep in the intricacies of the game without being overwhelmed by walls of text on the other hand some important info could be more readily available

the tutorial is very good some parts feel unpolished but in general it does a pretty good job of explaining how to do things and most importantly why to do them

on the technical side graphics are very good particularly when zooming in on the map also the ost is great apart from the nice remastered songs from vic2 preorder bonus the new tracks are very well done with a couple of excellent ones you can also listen to them on youtube anyway

so summing it up if you can afford the price and are not afraid of some bugslack of polish id say go for it right now
personally im already having a lot of fun and i cant wait to see how ill enjoy it even more when its improved next big patch will be released by the end of the year

#####

i have over 500 hours in eu4 and hoi4 i even have 180 hours in fucking ck3 of all games and vic 3 was so lacking in depth that i could barely make it past 10 hours before i got bored there is a massive lack of content for virtually all nations the only time i had fun was playing as the ottomans virtually no one else has any flavour events any real goals its tragic not to mention the warfare system feels like that belongs in a mobile game its tragic i love pdx games i love the victorian era but i cant love victoria 3

#####

multiplayer is totally and utterly broken despite assurances from paradox that it wouldnt be and they apparently regularly played multiplayer themselves during development

#####

fancy idler

this game scratches every gaming itch i have i had been watching it since the messy release and waiting for an opportunity to arrive where it was in a state where i felt i would enjoy the hell out of it ive always enjoyed pretty much all of the paradox suite of games but id say this one has very quickly become my favorite i love the simulation this game delivers and the althistory silliness that can happen ive made an ultracapitalistic presidential republic spain a militarist sokoto caliphate and most recently i had a blast with japan achieving the meiji restoration achievement

normally i hate randomly generated systems in games with almost no exceptions however v3 has somehow achieved a way to make it feel fair the events that are purely bad dont linger for too long or they are there to present a reasonable challenge the difficulty varies all over and i wholeheartedly appreciate it the challenging starts that ive tried genuinely feel fun for example egypt is a race against time to build up military to defend against an eventual ottoman attack and im not good enough yet to figure out how to do it without ruining my run i actually enjoy playing all the way through to the end when in eu4 ive only ever done that once the soundtrack is absolutely without a doubt my favorite soundtrack in all of the paradox suite of games i have had a lot of fun so far and i think that especially if the development keeps going in the direction it has been i will continue to have more fun i definitely feel good recommending this game

#####

its a clicker game that needs a lot of work especially the war system but worth a buy on sale

#####

wars are too abstract

#####

this is a most wonderful game luckily for me i like the fact that war has taken a backseat in favour of focusing on the trading and relations aspect please keep in mind though that if you play this game military expansion and conquest is not a game priority while you can most certainty conquer your enemies ruthlessly the game is meant to be played primarily through construction and especially the market 

to new players make sure you really focus on learning the market because that is the difference between a successful and a disastrous playthorugh

dear readers

paradox dlc policy

well you all know paradox and its dlc policy its horrid and sad but whats really terrible is that we the community are the reason for it yes i know they are making dlcs to milk us out and its their fault to do that but on the contrary its not their mistake and problem but ours why since we as the community and players allow this we are the people who still buy the products even though we complain about it and because we are doing that they take advantage of us and use it for their greedy personality 

so how to stop this well its harder than it sounds we should step together and stop supporting it thats why we should build our spying network and support rebels get together and tell them that we dont want to support this scheme but as i said its harder than it sounds still i hope that one day we will be able to do that

victoria 3

we all awaited the release of this game and we finally got it last year i was really happy as soon as i saw the announcement i waited and looked into the dev diaries it was perfect but that the release came and i was disappointed as never before for a game it was bad some months later they released a new dlc hopes were better but it was still a letdown 
the game is just an economic simulator with a small background and thats all that it is watching graphs and awaiting to rise them we all know what was really the focus of the victorian era yes it was money and economy but also the control of the world and its resources the mighty empires had a long history and were at the top of the world but at the approach of the victorian era the empires became dominators of the world and new empires started to be born which lead to the modern world
like i said the game doesnt offer that gameplay but you are more a tycoon of a country than their leader i cannot recommend this game and i wont the only saviour is the dlcs but as i mentioned earlier thats also a huge problem

endword

dear community please let us step together and stop this milking of the people who enjoy history dont buy the games unless they fix them and release them as they should be and for the love of god dont preorder citiey skylines ii

#####

i dont know how else to describe this but moving from victoria 2 to victoria 3 was one of the creepiest experiences ive ever had playing a game before its like if you woke up to find everyone you love replaced by stiff animatronic versions of themselves  yes visually it certainly looks like an updated version of victoria but then you get halfway through your first campaign and realize that every other nation on the map has done practically nothing at all for the past 50 years i legitimately never interacted with another nation without initiating the encounter myself very odd for a grand strategy game

theres no newspaper or events to keep you informed on whats happening on the global stage either the political parties are extremely simplified and often align themselves with interest groups and ideologies that make no sense for them sure its neat to see freud and marx in the game until you realize that they dont actually do anything except add some modifiers and kill each other in duels

i wont say that i didnt have any fun at all i did but its also incredibly soulless compared to previous paradox releases and  for some reason just left me feeling really unsettled afterwards victoria 3 rests in an uncanny valley where it tries to present itself as deep and historical but it most certainly isnt 

someone should probably do a welfare check on the dev team to make sure they havent been replaced by aliens or something

#####

as it stands i wouldnt call it a full release game and feels more like a beta to an early access game 

pros 
 the map looks nice

 diplomatic play seems like a direct upgrade to victoria  2 crisis although i believe it still needs more fleshing out to do  ex make a flashpoint region 

 the economic portion is very well though out and you can observe your economy in a clearunderstandable manner vs victoria 2

cons
 the character design sucks and is one of the ugliest i have seen it would have been better if they never added it since it just takes away from dev time

 there arent many content andor mechanics in the game its blatantly clear that paradox wanted to implement lot of these fallouts with future dlcs  with dlcs being 2030 each doesnt sound too exciting  

 for an era that had lot of military conflicts including ww1 the game is really lacking in warfare the no micro aspect doesnt bother me but the lack of depth for warfare does  ex no stockpiling your weapons for a big war you just press a button saying attack and wars dont feel impactful 

conclusion 

again it feels like a beta to an ea game i would just wait for 23 years when pdx releases dlcs for it

#####

im a 2200 hour veteran of hoi4 and a casual stellaris enthusiast it took a long time to understand the controls of victoria 3 i feel competent and comfortable after 33 hours which is not something i could say for hoi4 3 i never played victoria 2 so everything was dramatically different than the other paradox games i had experience with 
i gave up after a few hours and left it for a few months after coming back and giving it the ol rambler try i find it is honestly the best introduction for those new to pdx games

thank you bokoen1 isorrowproductions laith ludi et historia and obviously kilian experience you taught me how to play

#####

victoria 3 is a great game and truly delivers on the promise of victoria 2 so i am a bit flummoxed by the mixed reviews one problem folk might have is that this isnt a particularly easy game and the interface does need some work as important information is buried first 2 times i played i absolutely tanked my economy by making every production increase immediately upon unlocking the technology only on play through 3 did i really begin to understand the games core game play mechanics 

at its heart this is an economic and political simulator to grow to take on the great powers you need to balance several things

1 first you need to expand your industry but construction costs money and workers and industry takes raw materials these raw materials you can trade for but that costs convoys which require ports and ships which again cost money and you will only ever have so many of depending on your number of coastal provinces so you need to balance resource expansion logging cotton etc with industry with finite resources to do so particularly early game

2 your pops want things so you need to keep prices affordable lest radicals tick up which can lead to turmoil in your states and decreasing the effectiveness of your economy this might mean trading for goods you dont have access to again eating into your limited convoy bandwidth you also must decide whether to export goods for a better price and money vs keeping lower prices to keep your people happy and both your overall tax rate and whether to employ consumption taxes on specific goods which can be lucrative but means less of your population will get their needs fulfilled increasing radicalism sometimes expansion needs to come at the populations expense but its all a tradeoff particularly early game until your economy kicks into high gear even then its a matter of continual fine tuning as new industries unlock with technology and as you add strains to your economy with increased costs for you army navy and colonies and as the demands of your population increase

3 the other way you manage your population and ultimately unlock greater economic opportunities are through laws this part of the game is brilliant you have competing interest groups in your country and they dont typically want what you want so you need to use the tools at your disposal government formation events decrees etc to empower the groups who will pass laws which invariably upset at least one of the other groups different population types have affinity for different groups which also plays into their power or clout as the game terms it it doesnt seem to be a hard and fast rule but generally if you have a of peasants landholders will be strong whereas increasing industry will increase the number of capitalists who will be aligned with industrialists for instance you can only pass laws when there is sufficient clout from the groups supporting it and they are in government so transforming the shogunate for instance is not going to be a quick task even when you can pass a law its not always wise to do so as at times the result would be so unpopular with powerful groups that it can lead to civil war trying to open your borders with lots of peasants for instance as with other parts of the game there is a balance in how much to pursue incrementalism vs pushing

this essential balancing act to get your country on the right track economically can be challenging and is a large part of the fun in the beginning it might seem a little bewildering which i think contributes to the mixed reviews once you do get the economics right you unlock a whole other aspect of the game which is colonization and diplomatic plays colonization is particularly well handled effectively multiple powers can colonize decentralized states they start with little more than a port and gradually expand until there is nothing left to colonize whats nice about this system is that even if you are late to the party you are not completely locked out though with that said you dont want to be too late to the party you need to balance your populations demands grow your economy to be able to afford to colonize why colonize well mainly because its helpful to get the additional resources to fund your industry and keep your population happy especially since for later economic developments absolutely need goods like rubber and opium which are virtually impossible to get enough of in the open market

similarly youll need oil but colonization usually isnt enough here as there are only a smallish number of producing states this is where diplomatic plays come in as you force smaller states to join your market puppet them or conquer their states outright these plays escalate to war but before that other powers have an opportunity to weigh in so as a middling power you can easily find yourself facing off against britain or russia in a diplomatic play if they too have interests in your target you can always back down and lose prestige etc or you can go to war which incidentally costs a lot of money its a smart system and a lot of fun particularly once you become a bigger deal in the world and can throw your own weight around the escalating need for goods means you never feel too comfortable even as a great power pushing you to expand 

this brings us to warfare this gets a lot of hate but the frontline system i personally think is much better than moving little soldier icons around the map and realistic to the time frame its not hands off particularly where there are multiple fronts naval invasions etc yes a lot of whether you win or lose will depend more on 1 your industries ability to supply your troops 2 your technology and 3 the size of your armies but this is realistic and accurate to the time period again i think the response here is a little overblown and some of it perhaps rooted in an aversion to change to my mind though we should be rewarding innovative thinking on paradoxs part in creating a system tailored to the time period vs a rinse and repeat of their same mechanics from other games with that said the splitting of fronts that happens can get a bit annoying at times and is hard to deal with without having many generals so more polish would be welcome similarly having to assign each general to a front is a lot of unnecessary clicks and concepts like fortifications and supply are missing overall i like the base warfare mechanics but its fiddlier than it should be and could be deepened  

the other major complaint thats lobbed at the game is lack of flavor and there is some truth to this but i think the frustration is misplaced older paradox games were full of flavor on launch but wonky in terms of mechanics with lots of hardcoded nudges to keep things from going off the rails historically more recent paradox launches tend to ship with polished solid gameplay mechanics and then layer on flavor in dlc or rely on mods i think in large part people who dont like this assume the entire reason is economic but i think they miss how hard it is to create a well thoughtout and balanced base game which both ck3 and victoria 3 are on launch in contrast stellaris for instance had tons of flavor elements on launch and half were cut multiple means of interstellar travel etc because they were impossible to balance into a clean game play system with a functioning ai and system performance the more systems you introduce the more complex the solution and harder to deliver on time and budget my sense is that paradox has settled on a model where they invest more in the core gameplay up front to release a solid base game which they can embellish over time victoria 3 is a sold base and will get better still i have nostalgia for v1 and 2 but this a better game every facet of what made those games special is here represented in a way thats deeper

#####

as of 762 hours in the game i can say i enjoy it at the moment so i would recommend if you enjoy a socioeconomic strategy game
might change my opinion in the future though

as of this review there are issues with ai midlate game perfomance and crashesdo not hover over the uk markets sell orders

#####

victoria 3  a generic market tycoon
if you like a generic market tycoon go for it otherwise take care this game brings just a lot of big empty shells on the table next to the market sheet

theres so much you can click but the game elements arent well connected with each other and  do lack content whats there is superficial and bad implemented so the features feel unimportant except watching and balancing the market through importexport and buildingupgrading factories its not worth to set another focus for me than to the market the game even kinda forces me to do so btw this isnt clever enough to distract me recognizing the emptiness of this basic framework which should be filled up with content in the next 510 years 
for now i say this is bad game design

 as i told except for the market theres no life in the game and that what made it into the game has quite no meaning who cares about my neighbours or even what the world is doing besides watching from time to time the gdp rankings who cares who is leading another country you cannot direct interact with no royal marriagesfamiliar connections friendsrivals etcwho cares a detailed random guy of an interest group who i cannot interact with there are a lot of other examples of meaningless things in the game

a word about the ai the ai is yet bad and quite generic like the country ai without making either historical based or otherwise clever diplomatic decisions the front ai and behavior for generals on both sides is often times incomprehensible and screams for help dlc  

well due to the lack of favor and content i find no connection to the game as a whole and its victorian timeframe 

after imperator pdox lost me again out of similar reasons 
definatly no recommendation

if im still alive when they did put all the content in i may change my evaluation

a few words to paradox 
paradox was once a great creative game designer one of my favorites im playing strategy games for 35 years now and there were companies including paradox who made masterpieces out of great complexity but even out of mini games like so many were around in the 80s and 90s rarely even today 

what has changed paradox is no longer a great game designer which appears to be for victoria 3 and previous acts for some years now i wouldnt even call it a game designer  anymore rather than a creator of modularputtogether half filled content who seems to be not driven mainly by natural creativity as you find only at some indies nowadays 

its branded creativity and soul are lost the most important factors which could establish a connection between the artists work and its fans a fan recognizes if something isnt real the product tells you i as a all time pdox fan recognize something big changed in paradox like a conversion to someone who has to deliver only commissioned work considering a lot of artifically limitations while just producing its work limitations which wont let pdox do anymore good stuff 

but as to take protection for the game designers and hope in paradox i dont doubt in its creative potential either from fresh personal or the old guard who is still on board but it seems a mostly free development of a full game ending in a v1 isnt possible anymore
how could they let me tell you im a musician and composer and if i should write a song for someone who wants me to leave out some parts notes and arrangement at first to sell them later even as a mage i would only write the nullified shit without free creativity those game designer guys are lost as this buisness model cancels arts in game design so pdox should rethink its strategy if theres any interest in arts at all and making higher profile games in the future

go for more money and grow this isnt bad at all but please find a way to let the designers do their job beeing much less affected by business strategies in historiy there were some very good and full games delivered in v 10 which could greatly sell afterwards some expansions that will even happen today if you start to write good games again and sell dlcs to make it even better 

but your business model became to sell dlcs to fill up an empty v1 gamethis smells the fan and it smells so bad it may work in the short term and you make millions but in longer terms you will lose more and more reputation fans and at the end the race for cash

as an all time pdox fan i will give you once again a chance in the next game to make it better but this will be the last one after a row of disappointments

be more clever and rethink paradox please

#####

a visually rich  deeply involved game the map is beautiful  the airships trains  ships are handsome  do not look like ugly rust buckets  a step up from the appalling  mediocre eyecandy hoi4 has been subjecting us too  i strongly recommend you watch the videos it is subtle  nuanced beast which will kill you if you dive in blind although doing the tutorial i got sweden to #3 but i still didnt know what i was doing

the game is closer to europa universalis than hoi4ck3  it is much more about people  commerce than war i personally love the detailed economy but i work in economic development so its my thing  

looking forward to loosing 1000 hours into this  mods will be coming soon from me to be sure

the worst parts of all recent post ckii reddit hype games combined 

shiny buttons and mana and mechanics starved of depth to a wafer thinness no wonder the mags gave them good scores every copy sold is in game journalist mode 

spend construction mana get factory buy construction mana repeat it feels like a timesink the sort of blatant skinnerbox gameplay that plagues phone games

the world market no longer exists which should be a good thing but instead for some reason translates to individually instructing your pops to buy english shoes rather than just trusting that they will import shoes if they want them badly enough 

the negative reviews on this page from other users do not encourage me concerning the future of the genre or the company pdox is sure to take all the worst advice as usual

 if your complaint about victoria ii was that it was inaccessible rather than chinamen are buying so many tailcoats its destroying the world economy or national banks literally vaporize consumer savings i submit that perhaps this genre should not be accommodating to you but i am no longer the customer of choice for a company which is determined to make itself mainstream at all costs even if it means making the gsg equivalent of a mobile game

would not recommend

#####

dont worry this game will be fun after 2 years and 4 dlcs why cant paradox release a game thats fun on release oh cause money thats why

#####

我p社本来应该正式版更新的东西移到12月更新是吧信不信我飞到瑞典吃你妈贡品

its boring repetitive and stupid i love it

hehe line go up

its not perfect yet but it has so much potential and it is really unique i can only recommend it already

tldr worst garbage ever created in the history of everything combat is trash diplomacy is trash economy is trash this rectal growth makes imperator rome looks like a masterpiece

update so after my first completed playthrough to year 1935 did my impressions change

hell no

i have quite a good pc and yet in endgame the game runs like pacifist towards a recruitment office i am sick of this pdx ineptitude and all the mouthbreathers out there excusing this it is a standard pdx release go munch on a grenade

unlike other pdx titles this game has zero replayability zero in my playthrough i started as austria and immediately released bohemia and played as it in 1924 i have formed a danubian state in the process i have crushed prussia austria russia italy ottomans great britain and france often facing two major or even great powers in one war while almost constantly running green numbers and full gold stockpile maybe i should play as an african or asian nation oh wait every nation has the same tech tree same buildings

i am afraid we have another imperator on our hands the game looks indepth and complex on the surface but as you dwell deep there is not much to do some features that made victoria 2 unique like private funding are completely missing from the game here you only get a stash with money that get depleted first before your national reserve thats it 

combat is the worst we have of all paradox games and that is saying something you recruit a general he gathers troops you give him offensive and defensive order and that is it the values do not indicate anything sometimes you have numerical advantage way better tech and still lose while sometimes you crush any opposition under identical conditions and for those who chant ad nauseam this is a game about economy and trade not combat  no it is not shut your stupid mouth the game does not offer any indepth trading or economical systems that you can explore it is all surface dressing that is meaningless

there is no difference in technology  a tribal country in africa has the same tech tree and same units as western countries and research mallus only because they have not built any universities meaning they will research only 2030 slower than say usa also they are oddly super literate with literacy 30 which is more than russia i know that russia is not currently the most popular country but cmon

all this heavily smells of dlc whoring  yeah yeah we will improve as we go for a modest fee of 1999 every few months no pdx enough is enough you have raided my wallet with eu4 you raided my pockets with stellaris but no more

this game is a huge disappointment for me but lets face it with the state of the gaming industry what was i really expecting

the music is nice and the world graphics too except when you zoom to the map view which looks like jackson pollock vomitted a rainbow

310

#####

you know its bad when they change from roman numerals to just 3

#####

you are at war
you are decisively winning the war
your enemies armies crumble before you
you occupy and pillage their lands uncontested
there is nothing they can do to stop you
you have occupied their capital and left them in shambles
you have lost the war

#####

i played victoria 3 at launch then put it aside because i found it boring i returned to the game during the holidays and i found that in the meantime successive patches and rebalancing had turned it into a fun games  with plenty of rough edges and room for improvement

at its core victoria 3 is an economic and political simulation your countrys political and social makeup directly influences its economic performance and vice versa by this point in the games development i find the ways in which the two systems interact fun interesting and believable 

other systems dont work so well with the controversial new warfare mechanics and diplomacy merely serviceable at this point victoria 3 is also short on countryspecific flavor still games improved a lot in the last year or so and the company seems committed to continued development

#####

paradox im a fan and i hope someone at the company reads this review with the understanding that it is written by someone who loves their games eu to hoi stellaris to mount  blade ive been around for a while but this game left with me such a deep sensation of so close most of this stemming from specific design choices that i cannot fathom beyond the complaints filed ad nauseam about the bugs and incomplete nature of the game at launch not to mention that lack of actual rng for passing laws i have to complain about the diplomacy and war mechanics in a game covering an age such as this to have diplomacy and war mechanics as hollow as this is so confusing and it seems from the most recent updates some realization has been made that war is a confusing and frustrating mess that could have been avoided by just keeping the same unit based system that exists in every single other game made to this point why not have a very similar system around supply maintenance and new equipment but put the units on the map and grant direct control all of the confusion around fronts and generals transfers and mobilizations could be easily controlled for by just making the units i simply cant fathom the decision behind this as for diplomacy how is it possible that weve kept the diplomacy no more complicated than eu4 yet somehow less challenging and more frustrating how is it that i can barely comprehend the intentions and actions of my allies yet almost surgically predict what my enemies want to do i have spent some time save scumming a game of france to death just to see what variables are at play when it comes to my enemies decisions and its incomprehensible ill take saves back years tinkering with different diplomacy timing relations with the british yet without fault when i have 0 infamy and look to dominion a small state in west africa that they have no diplomatic ties to they join their side what is most annoying is i am a player who truly finds the economic aspects of the game far more enjoyable but the few times i look to war and diplomacy to expand out the flavor of my experience i find myself chewing on naught by bland white bread

with that said i will still recommend this game what can i say im hooked but i just hope that even for a second someone at paradox will consider what ive said and what many others have said and for once just listen to what your customers are asking for

#####

argh this game puts me in a difficult position when it comes to rating it

in theory i should really like this game  it has everything i usually love about a paradox game  but there are just too many things which annoy me which really shouldnt exist as problems

1  why cant you select individual provinces  and why cant you see what terrain they are  there seems to be no sane reason not to allow you to select and view the details for each individual province  maybe eventually they will stick that feature in  but it seems very odd to leave it out

2  there is significant political bias for a game based in the 1800s to 1900s  if you try and play as a traditional conservative monarchy the game gives you so many penalties that simply arent realistic  the game essentially pushes you towards liberalism leftwing politics opentolerant societies  which is fine for like one game  but what if i want to play as a hardcore right wing nationalist nation  the outcome to the military and the economy just isnt historically realistic  and it is very annoying  i can win easily if i convert to communism asap and pay my workers enormous salaries and emancipate women immediately  but it gets very old to keep doing that every game  i cant work out if the designers did this deliberately or possibly subconsciously  maybe the designers are all leftwing luvvies  maybe they mistakenly assume most of their players are all leftwing luvvies and pander to that  either way this political bias does go a long way towards ruining the game for me

it has the potential to be brilliant but it needs a lot of tweaking to get there

#####

its a paradox game it will have bugs and issues at release if that bugs you then wait but if thats not a issue for you then buy the game it is  fun and engaging normally i get bored of waiting in games or not doing too much but in my first play through of the tutorial i found myself excited to just see numbers go up and be an arms dealer to the world 
tldr
overall paradox did a good job with this game it has issues such as missing events and visual bugs etc but it will only get better as they work on it i recommend 1010

#####

see how happy the people are in the cover art for the game they lived in a time before video games before they could be disappointed by victoria 3


as is the norm with paradox games at release its a mile wide and an inch deep nothing is explained everything is broken somewhere deep in here is a good game waiting to be made but its not here this feels like the spiritual successor to imperator in this regard

#####

a bit slow but very cozy diplomatic and economic conquest is a refreshing change from hoi mechanics are complex with farreaching consequences but nothing to out of order military development could use some work

#####

if you dont get hard from seeing numbers go up then i dont recommend this game

though if like me you do then its a good buy

#####

sold opium to the chinese colonized africa put children to work in coal mines and destroyed my own economy 
1010

#####

just one more opium war

#####

victoria 3 has a fascinating economic system to it i like the idea of nation gardening and i am in love with the xix century the era of progress and struggle for a better tomorrow and where you can see the old world start to become similar to the world it is nowadays as the old regimes struggle with liberalism to maintain their power

having played 11 my problems with the game are the following

   1  the world is static

everything seems quiet and nothing really seems to happen internacionaly i am aware that you can change the ais aggresiveness but that just tends to create weird stuff like russia trying to conquer the state of hamburg in 1840 or the uk making a diplomatic play to annex upper canada

you will rarely see a japan that underwent the meji restauration or the american civil war or the crimean war victoria 3s world experiences little change

i find myself staring at the screen managing prices and waiting for stuff to happen

   2  events are rare and missable and the flavor is very hard to find

stuff that should be important to your country ruler dying or a politician retiring is relegated to a small notification box at the corner of the screen where it will just mingle with other useless info such as an indonesian minor state improving relations with you

if my ruler dies or an ally breaks our trade agreement i want the game to make me aware of it through a proper window not some notification in the corner

some events go to the notification box while others become bubbles which you may miss if you dont click them

events in this game are quite stealthy

when they happen soon enough events will start to loop i have seen the mine disaster event already a lot of times in a single playthrough

nations have little to no flavor spicing things up this leads to the problem i mentioned at the end of the 1st point since countries have little flavor there is nothing leading to big era defining moments such as the crimean war

   3  politics

11 improved the politics system of victoria 3 with the legitimacy system  currently it is still a bit buggy and you can basically form a stable goverment out of all the ig including everyone in it and giving you a 100 legitimate government a sort of rainbow coalition

i think with a patch or two they can fix this

laws however do need some restrictions

 it doesnt make much sense for your country to be a kingdom organized like an anarchy with a command economy that follows a free trade policy having acess to an extremely robust welfare system 

there should be restrictions in place to prevent this since the people who want a monarchy and voted for an anarchy should be at odds and not accept this creating strong movements to attempt to bring their prefered outcomes

while the rng method for passing laws isnt very fun it would be made a bit better if when a law is debated and makes progresses towards being passed you would get an automatic event without having to find little bubbles 

   4  diplomacy

the diplomatic plays are really cool however they need be expanded and worked on to give more options such as offering to join another countrys play in exchange for something i would want

that being said normal diplomacy is really bad
to even interact with another country you need to either be in the same region or have an interest in their region or where they hold an interest it feels weird that you can only interact with countries in this way

defensive pacts are shallow and the ai can without warning get rid of agreements be they defensive pacts or trade agreements 

   5  military

the military aspect in this game is sadly the worst in any paradox game i have played

when the mechanics were announced i was pretty optimistic and excited 
they wanted to try something diferent from the same military mechanics of crusader kings europa universalis and victoria ii

but as of now having actually experienced iti can say that they should have stuck with the old and safe mechanic that always worked so far directly controling the units

managing units would have added something to be done while your buldings are being built and your laws are passed an element of active strategy moving the units into position recruiting and managing them like the other games etc

battles arent engaging enough looking at a battle screen where you have no input on what is happening and are basically just watching this boring bar progress to the left or to the right dictating wheater i win or lose sadly is not fun

   6  unecessary 3d character models

the decision to make 3d character models i think was a huge mistake that amounts nowadays to basically a huge waste of dev resources both during development and will probably continue to be a weight on the healthy development of victoria 3 as the devs waste resources making models for the baby abominations and for characters lacking proper models
they could have done something more appropriate for the xix century static portraits of the characters that gradually become black and white photographs as the game progresses

i hope that one day victoria 3 will be worthy of the legacy of victoria ii but as it stands now it needs a lot of work and probably needed some more time in the oven
sadly when it does get fixed this is a paradox game which means that said fixes will come in dlcs

#####

this game has made great strides lately and i find it super fun the warfare and diplomacy needs quite a bit of work but the way laws and the global economy work are just fantastic i feel really engaged and like im really improving as i continue playing

honestly its pretty good with a few caveats

war is really really really really bad i would say avoid it if you can really detracts from an otherwise good experience you have very little control often i would lose battles not knowing why as the game only readily shows your moral numbers but more often then not battles are decided when the battalions run out of men not shown readily in the battle screen rather than the visible moral stat i dont have an issue with that specifically but the information isnt as accessible as it should be all in all losing warsbattles that you have basically zero control feels really bad and unfun 

i want to clarify that i dont need to see the little dudes running around or to play move the army stack simulator but i just want more meaningful input and control so all things being equal when i win i feel as if i earn it and if i lose i feel as if it was either through my blunders in theater or because i shouldnt have gone to war in the first place

the ui can be clunky to use for instance its really hard to tell your factory employment and output at a glance in victoria 2 you had that big menu with every state with factories you could see profitablility upgrades and employment number all there  if you had more than like 4 states you could scroll but it was all still pretty straightforward in this game you have to open the buildings screen see how every factory of that type is doing nation wide as a range mind you in a little sidebar menu then expand to see what states have this type of factory then click on the specific state to see the actual numbers for that factory it gets old real fast i really dont like having to click into like 4 submenus and scroll like 8 pages worth to do basic gameplay 
to which point i should mention the bar at the bottom of the screen which is essentially the macro builder from eu4 with some more functionality i personally feel like it hijacks my screen and take up so much space 

im not really sure how else to put it and its obviously very subjective but the uxui is very clunky and irritating to use in my opinion 

the game itself seems pretty fun and im definitely enjoying it but it needs work which im sure will come eventually paid or not

flawed but fun

#####

game is simply mid wait for a sale if you debate on purchasing it dlc is a fraud so dont buy it but adds good free content overall can be boring a lot of the time so get that youtube ready or music definetly needs a certain type of person to enjoy this game even more than the average paradox consumer

#####

is this game flawless  no but given the recent trends with paradox i had my bar set pretty low for victoria 3  as a 20 year veteran with paradox i can see a very solid foundation for a game here  so far the worst flaw ive heard about but not yet experienced is the lack of player agency in warfare but a drastic overhaul of the system i do not feel is warranted  this is about what i would have liked in victoria 2 so far i can fairly easily and quickly balance my budget and stabilize the economy  so far im into i think my third play as prussia and ive got a balanced budget and paying down my debt and i had fun getting to this point

#####

alright so i had a feeling this would be gdp simulator which is perfectly fine victoria 2 was good at that and it can be fun but when your ui needs you to go on a scavenger hunt just to find the population needs screen and youre left in the dark why your pops are radicalizing at an absurd rate i think you have some fundamental issues the game tells you how to access all their little footnotes which involves hovering over some text for 5 seconds which then leads to more text you have to hover over once more to open theres issues here 

now i am someone who loves to go full on trade and econ in eu4 i love swimming in ducats even if im  minor power i want to wipe my tears with dollar god damnit but this game is just bad at it its more tedious than fun you will spend half your time at speed 5 because theres nothing else to do or paused as you try to figure out why your economy is tanking there is no middle ground here there is no slowing down to speed 2 or 3 cause youre locked into a relentless series of wars after you misstep and get a coalition formed against you in eu4 there is no slowing down so you can micro tank divisions to create vast encirclements on the eastern front like in hoi iv there is next to no engagement here

i know the devs said that this title would not be focused on war but its the victorian era this era had some of the nastiest most violent wars in history its wars created and broke empires i will list them off and i dare paradox to wave a single one of these off as a small ground war that had no consequence 

crimean war
us civil war
franco prussian war
russo japanese war
world war i aka the great war

industrialization made these wars all the more deadly industrialization is what allowed these empires to eventually field armies in the millions and yet here i am fielding a few hundred battalions a battalion is like 5001000 men each as france or russia in late 1800 my battles only end up being a few dozen battalions at once theyre small scale and more importantly theyre automated theres no daring encirclement as austria against an angry russian invasion theres no stalwart defense by a prepared denmark against germany none of that instead you get to watch your numbers get thrown against there who the hell thought this war system was alright especially when you have a hegemony campaign option which means you have to go to war

paradox essentially made a game where you build your economy but then nothing to do with said economy in eu4 you build your economy to raise larger and larger armies and fund your conquests struggling to match your foe leverage your excess income to hire mercenaries or raise more regiments so you can win the war to enforce a pu natives uprising in your colony send a few regiments to be ready to suppress them hoi iv you build your industry to have the production capacity to build the equipment for your unique division templates that you will use to fight ww2 your civilian industry builds infrastructure so you can construct faster move faster build railways build factories all of this for your army what does your economy do in victoria 3 number goes up population goes up wage shitty war if army smaller you die game over or of course number goes up population goes up dont wage shitty war because system is trash do nothing game over and of course ui trash cant figure out whats wrong economy crash go bankrupt game over

just you wait guys knowing paradox they will sell a war revamp in an expansion for 20 dollars they literally sold a grand edition which essentially prepays for the first at the moment unnamed expansion gee i wonder what that will be

#####

the economic and social simulation is fun albeit incomplete the warfare and diplomacy simulation is totally broken and needs a lot of work

ive mostly been playing the canadian minors and everywhere you look theres stuff missing the fur industry is nowhere to be found in the game despite the description of the hudson bay company referring to it the catholic church is not a faction in quebec despite quebec being 99 catholic the mechanism by which you can annex other canadian minors is opaque and the checklist says you need newfoundland you would have to take it from britain which you dont

on the other hand you can send peasants down into hellish mines and factories to line your own pockets so thumbs up

#####

its ait

#####

i gave it a shot i really did what i found was the base for a long string of dlc necessary to make this game fun paradox youve done it again

#####

number go green
satisfaction go up

#####

for just 60 dollars you can colonize africa and prevent african children from starving

#####

i spent an entire day learning the game only to realise there was nothing to it

it has the veneer of complexity but its just complexity for the sake of it it doesnt actually matter

im sure there is a complicated system that decides how wars are won but so what you cant interact with it

there is a stupid amount of pop information and its all modelled but doesnt actually matter and ignoring it doesnt really affect much

micro managing your factories is the game its not fun but that is all that there is its like playing factorio without the belts and inserters and the only thing you need to do is place more buildings to feed other buildings where or how doesnt matter

its a mess of inter tangled systems that at the end of the day dont matter at all

i was so excited for vic3 im so disappointed this has imperator vibes all over it half finished intentionally so they can shove all the dlc to actually complete the game

#####

if this game was real france would never have built the eiffel tower because they would have been too busy working for 2 years to build a wheat farm to make 6

update

the recent hotfix added back peasants and unemployed to the macro builder as separate ui options but did not provide a way to combine the two while this is a significant improvement from the disastrous change of the previous patch you still have to switch backandforth between the two metrics if you want to know the real number of available pops

original

the recent patch introduced the biggest antiqualityoflife change i have seen in a paradox title

in victoria 3 the core gameplay loop involves identifying resource shortages and building structures to either extract the resources from the earth or manufacture them in all previous patches the macro builder allowed you to see which states had unemployed pops that could work your building because it makes little sense to build a manufactory in a depopulated state with no one to work it

in the colossus of the south patch the developers obfuscated the number of unemployed pops through a tooltip that you must now hover over thus you have no way to quickly scan your hundreds of states to determine where to plop down a particular building this makes the most basic element of the game now extremely tedious and wasteful for no particular reason it truly baffles me

#####

warfare is horrible
cant direct generals warfare reduced to click and wait
troops are all the same victoria 2 had troop xp and they could rise in rebellion if radicalised
cant manually assign troops to general it is automated and very nonsensical no player agency
devs decided it would not be a wargame despite the game covering hundreds of wars including taiping rebellion us civil war and ww1
navies are abstract and are also not represented on map unless a naval battle ensues 
individual ships in the fleet seem no more than a number with even less unique importance than in victoria 2

#####

it really pains me to do this

i will start with my opinion on the game as is its fine thats all this is possibly their most anticipated game ever and its decent for a couple playthroughs but it feels bare bones however im leaving a negative review because i can no longer support or justify a company that takes advantage of its fans in this way for those who dont know the last few paradox games have followed a different business model than the previous ones when the game is released you dont buy a full game you buy the bare bones most basic framework of the game most of the time its ok but nothing special and at worst imperator the minimalism kills its player base almost immediately

the game only becomes what it should have been years later after 5 20 dlcs come out we all complain about it but we buy them anyway what this means though is you are not buying a game for 50 you are spending around 200 if you want the full package and im sorry recent paradox games are not worth that much even with all dlcs this will be my last purchase from paradox unless they start releasing full games with meaningful content from the start and i suggest everyone else do the same

#####

as someone who spent thousands of hours on paradox grand strategy games i love this game i didnt play victoria 2 so my review is without knowledge of its predecessor

pro
 interesting economic simulation with price reflecting demandsupply
 innovative diplomatic play where you engage in diplomacy before war i really like the idea
 simple but decent combat gameplay where you are required to engage in only strategy deployment
con
 the game is enjoyable but buggy atm
 military gameplay is good but still largely unpolished
 some mechanism is confusing such as vacant jobs  assimilation
trivial
 insufficient tax capacity early game warning is a trap
 this game taught me why export tax was needed
 why conservatives acted like taliban every time i progressed toward woman rights

#####

despite all the hate that vic 3 has received ive personally really enjoyed it it adds nicely to the ground work laid out by vic 2 minus of course the combat

what ive enjoyed
vic 3 absolutely shines in its economic management i found it far easier to understand then that of vic 2 economic system with just as much complexity it feels satisfying to build a strong economy especially when you overtake one of the great powers it has the advantage of making smaller nations as fun as the great powers of the world
its politic system feels like a great foundation for a potentially great and interesting political system however as of current it does not have the same level of complexity that i would like compared to that of the economic system however i feel it is aqueduct for now

problems
now for the elephant in the room combat is sht however i do not feel this takes to much away from the game as it is not the focus of course i would like a revamp of it at some point however it has never really been a huge issue for me and the way i like to play
another glaring issue is the ai it feels a bit inconsistent on how it reacts to the player especially when it comes to diplomatic plays the only real way for ai to change its attitude is by infamy it does not really react to if you improve relations with the country or not
my final real problem is with migration pops only migrate to other countries if they are in the same market or a mass migration event happens now this makes the new world kind of annoying to play as all of the countries have fairly low tech and pops so it can be difficult to industrialise and thus raise your standard of living enough to have mass migrations
the game also feels a little shallow when it comes to journal entries and as a result the countries dont really feel that different from one another


final consensus
the game is really fun and better than vic 2 despite what the die hard will say about it however the game does need polishing to a large degree which im sure paradox will put behind pay walls but overall i would recommend despite my pc not being able to hand past 1880

post script
i highly suggest getting the game on discount if you can and to use the great rework mod

#####

this weekend the game is free to play and i was about to buy the grand edition actually did temporarily put it in my cart however i thought id first keep on testing the game a bit more seeing how much ram is being used almost 16 gb for a mere map game is too much i did lower the graphical options to medium which made the whole game crash
after rebooting my belgian ironman save is corrupted eu4 provides a backup but victoria 3 doesnt do that so ive lost everything

this exact same problem was already there when the game was released see eg
httpssteamcommunitycomapp529340discussions03489753940071247322

so its great to know before buying that this gamebreaking bug hasnt been addressed at all in more than one year dlcs on the other hand have being released at a frantic rate of course

its an extremely slowpaced game we simply cant afford losing our saves like that this is a clear dealbreaker

#####

this is paradoxs most systemsdriven game it needs a lot of refining as is the paradox way but it is growing into their most interesting game yet

#####

i have been playing paradox games since the launch of the second hoi3 expansion in 2010 before eu4 and before ck2 i know every paradox game inside and out victoria 3 is mediocre it reminds me of eu4 at launch basically an empty game with only one thing to do in eu4 at launch the only thing to do was go to war their was pretty much nothing else and then in 50 years from the game start you would own europe and then you restart in victoria 3 the only thing to do is build buildings and then 50 years from the game start your economy is 100x better than the best ai so you restart 

in hoi4 especially in multiplayer their are two phases to the game first is the buildup to war you minmax your economy you minmax your focuses and minmax your infrastructure all with the goal of making the biggest and best army before the war the second phase is the war you use all those armies you built and put your economy to work victoria 3 is like hoi4 except they cut out the war part and the entire game 100 years is the buildup phase you have access to a few simple buildings the prices of the goods they make and you minmax them for 100 years and the game ends the buildup phase in hoi4 is fun and i would often practice my buildup dozens of times in preparation for our groups twice weekly multiplayer match but to make an entire game about minmaxing some simple buildings is questionable

there is fun to be had in victoria 3 the buildup is engrossing for a few hours but there is no payoff i was looking forward to trying out the new war system but it is so shallow and so boring as to be unusable i have no doubt as many reviews have pointed out that after a couple years and 120 of expansions most of these systems will be removed and reworked and the game will be a 910 just like eu4 has become but i am rating the game today today i cannot give the game higher than a 610

i am disappointed in paradox they can do better
