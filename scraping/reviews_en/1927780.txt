dude wake up its 2014 we are playing galaxy life again

#####

youre as beautiful as the day i lost you

#####

the goat the father of clash of clans

#####

nostalgia hitting

#####

pros
galaxy life better than clash of clans
10 fps 10 is big number
30 of peoples bases are abandoned and destroyed
the user interface is unusable and glitches out all the time
tons of bugs that make the game unplayable like coins and minerals disappearing
cons
nothing
just like the good old times 1110

#####

it is as beautiful as the day we lost it

#####

wake up babe its 2014 again

#####

i remember creating a facebook account just to play this game























#####

why yes i have played galaxy life in my childhood


























#####

if youve played galaxy life you might like galaxy life

yes i know that sounds dumb but that means you havent played galaxy life galaxy life used to be a flash game and it was awesome until ubisoft said fuck you and shut it down

today however galaxy life returns just how it used to be but with steam integration

for those that dont know what galaxy life is it is the precursor to many games like clash of clans
i cant factcheck this info very well but galaxy life existed at least 6 months before coc and i dont know of any other popular game like this the game hasnt lost its charm and as of writing most of the annoying bugs have been fixed 

#####

i used to come home from school and play this on facebook when i was 10 yeah im turning 20 this year and i still cant wait to play this game again 31st of august baby lets run it back

#####

new achievement unlocked restored childhood memories

#####

i cant believe this game actually came back

#####

i like nostalgia 

#####

thank the lord its back

#####

clash of clans but not for losers

#####

nostalgia and war crimes

#####

nostalgia factor is on steroids with this one

#####

the servers aint even working yet and it already gets a 1010 from me

#####

why yes i have played galaxy life in my childhood


























#####

im 11 years old again 1010 everything is the way it used to be  even the bugs the game used to have are back

#####

nostalgic yes 1010 
fps 4 yes
works yes 
server issues yes 

final rating yes10

#####

i literally have spent a decade making jokes with my brother and friends about this game being released again and here we are best game of all time easily

#####

the servers remind me of my childhood
its currently unreachable

#####

this was a negative review at first due to the game its state at that time

the developers have succesfully put galaxy life back to its former glory

it is obvious that it has been a product of love where a lot of effort went into

despite the tough launch and lot of feedback the devs kept working on it

#####

the good old days

#####

my childhood 

#####

h1 why yes i have played galaxy life in my childhood h1


























#####

man the memories i get from this game such a nostalgic masterpiece
i hope that in a few months the current problems related to server connections and simpler ones like the ones related to friending people and not being able to send gifts will be solved this can really improve as a game 

ps an fps upgrade wouldnt hurt

#####

literally my childhood


#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review and it gets 300 likes and 100 awards that he will buy me a case of beer some vodka and 1 kg of lemon so im just gonna leave this here

мой другигроман сказал что если я опубликую отзыв и он наберет 300 лайков и 100 наград он купит мне ящик пива немного водки и 1 кг лимона так что я просто оставлю это здесь

#####

#####

i got banned 1010 game

#####

its finally here after many years waiting for it to comeback after facebook totally recommend

#####

ah the nostalgia

#####

it is a very nostalgic game and if you are in for the nostalgia then this game might be interesting for you so was it for me
but i just cant overlook its problem in the modern age

edit they fixed the fps limit the game is caped at 60fps now

another complaint i would have with the game is that it is very unbalanced in my opinion when it comes to attacking or i am bad in attacking but ask the general player base not me comparing this game to clashofclans for example there are just no real good or usefull troops to use when attacking it takes so long for a unit to destroy a building especially resource buildings that by the time your units destroy one the time has almost run out or a turret defensive building will have killed almost all your troops so you dont even have the amount of troops to destroy the rest of the buildings 
you might argue that you should just upgrade the troops but even if you do the upgrades on troops are so minuscule that by the time your troops are good damage and health wise they are either very expensive 

example
marine from lvl 6 to 7
cost 400  2200

or that by the time you can use that troop your starbase is on a higher level ie your opponents have stronger turrets thus negating the upgrates in clashofclans the scaling of the upgrades scales better with the power and cost of the unit this game favors defensive gameplay so much i dont even think it is economicaly viable to even attack

this game might have pioneered the system with having colonies but the game has been design with such a long upgrading time  it puts clashofclans to shame after getting 3 colonies the waiting time to even do anything on one skyrockets when you upgrade buildings past the mid tier levels 

oh boi i sure love to wait 4days and 12 hours to upgrade my compact houses to level 10 and what is that my colonies only have 1 worker well i sure cant wait 3 years i know i am exaggerating to upgrade the next one

i understand if you make a game that is free grindy to entice players to use ingame premium currencies but this just is too much


the changes that i would like to see is the game to
 have a balance update on either the units or the buildings
 i dont have a sollution to how to lessen the waiting time of upgrades to buildings but make something  it really kills the drive of playing the game when you have to wait 5 days for a building to finish just for the cycle to repeat


overall i do not thing the game is bad it has a place in my heart for ever
but i just cannot play this game as it was and is now sometimes things should just stay memory but this game really is an exception when it comes to the style of town building games and i want it to succeed in popularity as it did back then but i dont see it happening if the game stays as it was

really big thanks to the people making this game possible to play again in 2023 you guys really brought childhood back now please make it last

#####

since nobody will read the reviews ill say in this review im gay and i love crossdressing as a femboy

#####

i love the part where it goes dudududu dudududu dudu dudududu dudududu dudu

i want to thank the community and developers for bringing back to life again such an important game for the childhood of many of us 3 the game needs many improvements but i hope the team will continue the project and improve it
gameplay 1110

#####

ahhh a classic facebook game where you click and wait 

its a nostalgic reminiscence of the days back when these type of rts tower defense games were vile and greedy 5 minutes left or less you can spend a few resources to speed up otherwise use premium currency which takes a long time to accumulate 

the game is ridiculously unbalanced posing as the dollar store clash of clans this is the exact type of desktop game that influenced mobile games to be slow and tedious so youd only play it for like 15 minutes then forget about it the next week 

back then in the golden age of facebook youd actually have to worry about constant attacks on your base which causes you to lose potentially all resources but seeing as only a handful of people plays it as a trip down memory lane youll be safe even if you exit beginner protection early 

if you never ever played this before keep it that way if you have played it before nothing really changed so i encourage galaxy life veterans to try this game again for a few minutes and appreciate how far online gaming has evolved compared to this pathetic excuse of a time waster

and no this is not an idle game you have to actively do stuff and passive resource generation caps early

i still cant believe this game got reincarnated i have spent tons of hours playing this beauty on facebook thank you galaxy life  steam

#####

before i played galaxy life i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

i remember playing this around 2012 and all of those friends whom i played with this hits pure nostalgia and i highly recommend playing it the gameplay is still the same as the one back in facebook too

#####

what can i say childhood nostalgia if developer does a great job i could see myself playing it alot

#####

old but gold 1010 even if servers are not up yet

#####

better coc

#####

this game was my childhood its exactly as i can remember i played this game alot in school and after school i had like 7 colonies

but somehow its capped at 30 fps and sometimes regularly cough it drops to 2024 fps maybe some performance optimalisation in the next updates because i think all of our systems can run this game easily at 60 fps minimum and im missing the original galaxy life hud the cartoony beigecoloured hud not the new ugly scifi themed hud but all with all im very happy that this game is back and alive

heres a list of updates i wish its coming to the game
performance optimalisation
the og classic cartoony beigecoloured hud
maybe some hd textures for the buildings as for the hud
when you are going to start a war most bases are destroyed maybe a fix for that

but as i said im really happy that the game is back and alive and im looking forward to the upcoming updates

#####

better than clash of clans

#####

the gods have heard me prayers

#####

i like this game more than league of legend

#####

awesome game great nostalgia

#####

while this game is very nostalgic to me i do wish that this game could do much more then its current state but first ill start with the good part interesting towers units mechanics landscape story i love stories a very response staff team ive noticed several qol changes here and there i really liked this game when i was a kid but now ive grown up and i was shocked that i saw this game came back to life i remember their servers were down back in the old years

today i spent several days playing this game checking on my base and whole lots of other stuff however i did had a unpleasant experience the most notable problem for me that ive been experiencing is the lag it lags when you place troops the game often freezes during replay mode i did not have a good time but thats not all there are also other stuff that bother me

the game is filled with micro transactions everywhere it might as well end up being a pay to win game which im not very happy about how exactly many items that require chips can put you to an unfair advantage which can break the balance of the game one very notable example is battle support lets say you found a really strong base around like max if your a beginner you can just simply drop a nuke on that strong base and call it a day congratulations you beated a veteran and became a millionaire yes you can actually encounter maxed bases when your attacking as a beginner theres absolutely nothing to stop this or anything to limit the use of battle support you can use this advantage infinitely even the game encourages you to do it while this sounds pretty neat it is really unfair and really sad

but thats not all the upgrades in the laboratory the final tiers require a badge purchased in chips the prices are ridiculous how do you get chips exactly you can remove obstacles to get a chance to get a single chip youre gonna need 2000 more or you can pay to speed up the process and make your life easier again this can be really unfair to all the players especially with all that time trying to log in everyday just to get a few chips

theres also like unique troops that cannot be built at the barracks or some other training ground like the mercenaries thats also unfair since you have to pay chips to get them and they cant be trained with gold or minerals by any means they can be used anytime and they are really broken they bypass warp gate limits and you can stack them you can even strike an attack on a base with 100 win rate you can also buy extra time in battle with chips you can control everything all you need is chips chips can be brought with money this is crazy

also ive been experiencing log in issues at random times the game just doesnt let you login and i had to restart the game multiple times just to log in theres also various bugs but i appreciate the commitment the staff puts in helping you out i also have a mixed opinion on materials like the star battery used to upgrade your star base theres stuff like daily rewards but still try out this old game if you like just becareful with the issues ive said dont get your warp gates destroyed

#####

tu tu tuu tuu tu tu tuu tuu

nostalgia adrenaline pumping through my veins

#####

nostalgic beauty
but they need to upgrade the grapics to 4k and give 60fps support

#####

1010fps

#####

only the og players know this game 1010

#####

     















#####

well certainly didnt expect to see this again

#####

galaxy life will be back certainly its just a matter of time 

i literally played this all my teen age until the servers dropped out or something i dont remember well but the game died for apparently forever but now here we have it now again and its f amazing

h1 pros h1
list
    its perfectly same game as i remember
    the same gameplay easy and understandable for new players
    supports online as before for clan wars and battles
list
h1 contras h1
list
    sometimes the servers are inestable
    there is a little bugs for now
list
h1 qualityprice h1
its free to play but it has ingame purchases so it can be pay to win whatever it has been like that always

h1 conclusionh1
i recommend you to try this game whether you have played before or youre new player its a nice game and the community is gradually growing just be patient with the bugs although they dont make the game unplayable they can be annoying at times

i hope developers fix the bugs with the time it would be fine for us

#####

back to childhood

#####

brought a tear to my eye

#####

tbh i didnt think id ever see this again crazy

#####

nostalgic

best game ever made all my childhood a lot of bugs to correct but its only been 8days since its out so its fine i guess
if you havent played it yet its not too late dont miss this chance

update  3months later less bugs but still many bugs
update almost a year later  still many bugs wtf are they doing

#####

old memories brought back to life

#####

this game is my childhood however it barely works and keeps crashing undoing progress while still consuming itemscurrency which is extremely infuriating

#####

when ur only friend is elderby

#####

1010 even if the servers aint working

#####

bgive this game a chanceb

this game isnt exactly made by this developer company infact it is a revival project from a massively popular game from 20112016 made by digital chocolate and ubisoft the premise of the game is like clash of clans but this game came before coc which came out in 2012

the game does have p2w features yes but it is merely to finance the expensive servers and there have been many highlyupvoted suggestions in the discord server to remove some of the p2w features many updates are planned to keep the game fresh and alive with great attention to design and detail even if the games engine and infrastructure is incredibly dated and complicated to work with for the developers

the games artstyle and music is iconic and incredibly nostalgic if you played the game years ago and is truly the pioneer of the genre millions of players play today 

phoenix network plans to revive even more games such as battlefield heroes and battlefield play4free which are also highly missed games please check out this game if you can

#####

i love this nostalgic feeling 
i want to play more and more but its only available for pc pls android and ios

#####

never thought that this game would be revived and published on steam this really brings back memories of the old facebook times i really missed the amazing games back then and one of them is galaxy life

too bad this republished version has too many issues the game crashed every time i tried to open a loot box mission progress was not saved properly etc i guess it makes sense since galaxy life is an ancient game but if you want to reboot a game i hope you can at least put more effort on addressing these major issues otherwise the reboot would be rather pointless

#####

yoooooo classic facebook game letsssssssss fcking gooooooooooooooo

#####

coc sucks galaxy lifecoc

#####

wake up its 2014

#####

nostalgic og

#####

still a lot of buggs but hope is going to be like it was once

#####

this game is too good for us and the servers

#####

since nobody on galaxy life community will read the reviews ill say here im gay and i love crossdressing as a femboy 

#####

galaxy life saved my life

i am 31

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt play nearly as long as some of you with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

#####

ah my childhood

#####

kind of sus when my anti virus says that the game is asking for webcam permissions i blocked it but its a bit sus

#####

h1before i played galaxy life i had a small pp no friends no gf depression and no life these things havent changed but the game is pretty goodh1

#####

please make this banger on mobile i swear this beats clash of clan prime easly make it mobile 

#####

i shed tears of nostalgia when i heard the music and saw the intro after so many years

#####

#####

best game nostalgic af

#####

cant log to their pathetic platform cant start playing cant delete my account 
phoenixnetwork looks like low tier scammers

#####

the best game in the whole galaxy for sure

#####

gigachad game thank you for bringing it back after so long

#####

alien feet 

#####

great game brings back nostalgia from back in the days
give it a try

#####

my favorite moment from the hit game galaxy life is when the games main antagonist firebit an antagonist is a character in a story who is presented as the chief foe of the protagonist is about to take over the whole galaxy but then the player stops him and says im not gonna let you harm any more of galaxy life and then he proceeds to eat firebit alive this game changed my life forever and i would recommend it to anyone

#####

exceptionally buggy expect a lot of progress disappearing due to server issues 

nostalgia do be hitting different unfortunately

#####

nostalgia is real with this one its awesome to see this gem brought back from the dead from almost 10 years ago ive been playing for almost 8 months now and there were some bugs in the beginning but those have mostly been addressed by the developers and they do an awesome job at maintaining the game 3

#####

little orange people

#####

very broken but nostalgia

#####

still feels the same as it used to although its hard to get frens in this game if you dont have any frens playing with ya

#####

fun nostalga buggy and poor game design

#####

best game of my childhood

#####

calm down everybody its just a beta

#####

great game remember my childhood i love playing it despite it lags af

#####

used to play this back in 2014 on a website lost my progress all the time now playable with an account
good memories from the past 1

#####

nostalgia

account creation and login still kinda janky

#####

i like the small orange beetle men

#####

i thought i would not play this game ever again but there it is

#####

my favorite game from when i was little would always recommend to everyone

#####

its galaxy life what more needs to be said

#####

played 2 hours waited the other 3 on server fixes recommend


#####

brings back memories and really fun to play again after all those years 3

#####

in its current state it can barley be considered playable but i do hope to change that and post workarounds

i find the game loves to have connection issues and rewind task progress while keeping your planet progress unchanged i went from completing 710 to both that and 510 to rewind back to 510 task missions seem to have their base 7590 destroyed already but destroying it counts as a win against the full base and upgrades the defences while you are at low levels

the game can be fun and recommended but to make things easier on new players i say wait a year before downloading otherwise you will get a buggy and kinda playable mmo that does not deserve the treatment of bugs which it contains

i only rate it a no as i think its not fully ready for the public but i will say play at your own risk as progress may be skewed

#####

its just one of those games where you place stuff wait real time for a building to be done and fight other people it looks good and plays okay but i rather not have to spend real time for things to build so i will pass

#####

i remember playing this game a lot when i was a kid im so so so happy it got revived after flash died rest in peace flash

#####

games had sever issuses since launch 
has been unbalanced for troop cost since base game on fbtroops cost double after one upgrade
heavy on the pay to win aspect 
no new features for long time fans 
social tabs dont work correctly 
been out since august and game is still in same state
new halloween event locks the game in the battle screen have to completely reset every wave if you can beat the first wave lmfao goodluck v unbalanced 

all n all im sure alot of people are here because they where expecting the nostalgia from 2012its not here i was super excited to see this gem again but im not waiting a year before a server patch is the only content released gaming is different then in 2012 this game on steam is a inde game in early access no disrespect to the devs but the game failed once on facebook and im slowly seeing it happen here seems like a money grab for a game that has nothing to offer long time fans other then 30fps laggy severs and unbalanced combat 

510

edit may 6th 2023
troop costs still double after each upgrade
defensive bunkers are fucking op as all hell
waiting over 45 mins for troops just for them to be cucked by mortars or defensive bunkers
why does the mortar do 2000 damage level 1 itsthe heaviest hitting turret in the game and it just so happens to hit everyone like what
i still stand by everything i said in previous review dev did respond didnt like my it failed once comment and swears its a great game even though im the  one playing it i may seem like im coming off harsh but its been what 10 years since its original release and i really dont see how its so difficult to readjust troop coststats or add more in depth systems like troop equipmentspecialisations considering there aliens and there main means of colonisation is war yet there all pretty basic only diffrence with troops is some have more range no defensive stats or abilitys to deffer troops all infantry are useless even in early game air troops are so much more powerful then any class of troop that end game bases are always just zeplin attacks which are notprofitable at all each zep costs almost a million coins lmfao

#####

game itself is good 
fix the imminent reboot taking away half a milion of my coins and reverting progress every day its not that hard

#####

damn missed that game for so long still amazing game recommended for sure

#####

what can i say little me playd it on facebook and the soul reason i created a facebook account now it is back and on steam of all places this game brings back so mutch fun times i had games like this are timeless and will stick with you till the end of time simpel put i adore this cute game from the past and i can not be more thank full to phoenix network for bringing it back to us i higly reccomand this game

#####

only galaxy life

 dororo#9232

#####

used to play this a looong time ago very nostalgic

#####

cute for the first 90 minutes
i see it brings feelings of nostalgia for a lot of people i feel like ive seen it before but ive never played it until now
i get bored easily and ill probably stop here for now didnt really keep my attention and interest  but i wouldnt blame it entirely on the game
generaly speaking within 90 minutes yes
i like the systems mechanics look and feel
im sure theres a lot more to it and id love to see it some other time
the concept alone of cutesy lil alien guys takin over galaxies is fun and exciting and it has even more going for it
give it a go its worth at least a chance its very likeable

#####

imagine if clash of clans had
 every single quality of life feature removed
 made everything low quality
 required a nasa grade pc to have more than 10fps maybe
 crashes every 42 seconds
 had 10 builder bases
 tripple as many different ressources to lose track off
 looks like straight out of 2007

and its still better than clsh of clns in every conceivable way

#####

absolute banger of a game played this back in 2012 very nostalgic very good was like 200 something level but its ok cuz i was longing for it a lot so i am very happy very good game i give kiss to the developers

#####

just so nostalgic


#####

great job with making the game alive again it would be better if it was a mobile game though because its easier to play that way i dont think it would be so hard to do that after that maybe doing crossplatform stuff between pcmobile to spice things up maybe anyways i appreciate that you people made me be able to play my childhood game again

#####

#####

ah hell ye the flash vibes be returnin

#####

this game was not ready for release a lot of the basic aspects of the game such as gifting or the academy have not yet been implemented the servers do not function properly and the game is filled with bugs that causes crashes or makes you lose valuable resources such as chips or coins
the devs should of delayed the official release and kept this game in beta until they were atleast able to fix some of the missing aspects and bugs

#####

i played this game when i was a kid and its a really great game would really love if it gets added on phone as well just like last time so i can enjoy grinding money along the way and the best thing is you can play with your friends and help them out with resources and supplies to complete missions and protect their base 

i am really excited for this game to be fully out

loads of bugs par example sparagon and firebit are both burned down by other players and my current quest is to loot 700 coins from sparagon but its still a beta
servers are to small hard to play without interruption of cant connect to server

i spent way too much time on this game long time ago time to do it again

#####

whooh the game of my childhood i started to play games when i found this game which i was playing on facebook browser before the game was closed everybody got 1000 chips everyday so i maxed out my base i was very happy untill the game was closed now when i see this game again i remember the old days but its not hyped as it used to be

#####

used to play this game on elementary school and i had good memories with this game so i hoped that it wasnt just the nostalgia that made me thing the game was good but when i launched the game and played a bit it was still the same solid game

#####

game good stupid little aliens go commit genocide and then play on a swing very fun servers are shit tho since they are working off some internet explorer engine and public bathroom wifi im feeling a strong 9 to a decent 10 traaaaan sition have you given this game a try did you love it did you hate it what would you rate it you are the best you are the best what should i review next

#####

great game

#####

this game is just like youd remember it from 2014 just with a few balance changes to make it better i have a few suggestions though however despite them i just wanna say the games pretty good i just wanna help make it even better

1 allow you to move buildings that are being upgradedbuilt its kinda annoying not being able to do that and getting stuck waiting 2 days for it to be done

2 if a base is 100 wrecked remove it from the list of quickcombat targets its kinda annoying to flip through a bunch of corpses just to find someone to fight

3 if possible id like some new models for upgraded towers a lvl 1 sniper tower looks the same as a max lvl sniper adding some extra parts like antennaesatellite dishes or more armored parts could make them more distinct

4 back in the day you could see whoever attacked you and counterattack them and that seems to have been forgotten or left out please allow you to at least see how they attacked you as this could tell you much better what your weakspots are

5 this is a pc game now not a browser game anymore adding some shortcuts to build stuff get to the store or just to upgrade could be nice but it would be especially nice for combat as you cant place troops in a semicircle and thus add more distance to them right now

6 nitpick itd also be pretty nice if using the quickcombat option started you off in spymode cause right now theres no use for those spyballs you have to waste chips on speakin of it would also be nice if you could just buy them for gems or coins cause like i said theyre pretty useless in the way theyre used right now

7 itd be nice if you could see what level your friends buildings are cause although you might now what level they are and what one they should boost they dont so they might accidentally boost the wrong thing and waste their help action on a tower that wont give as much as the others

8 and finally itd also be nice if friends wernt able to boost construction on things that are already completed cause seeing that sped up 0 sec message hurts my soul

again this game is pretty good but there are some parts that just annoy me

#####

i love to nuke my friends maybe thats why they stopped talking to me

#####

its been 48 hours without galaxy life i cant go ahead with this any longer my mental state is in complete and utter pandemonium i cried myself to sleep 4 times today i feel paranoid that galaxy life  may never come back galaxy life has the only thing that brings me joy in this cruel life for so long now and i wont be able to recover mentally or financially if its gone ive spent over 7000 on galaxy life this week alone i even bought 500 worth of starling stocks because i trust galaxy lifr i told my mom through tears and she yelled at me calling me a failure and saying she knew she should have been on birth control although galaxy life being down has had its positive impacts on me my iq has increased by 40 and ive been thinking more critically when i saw the server unreachable page i vomited i just hope they bring it back soon i even started praying again ive been a dedicated christian for 12 years and i began to pray to god in hopes that they can bring galaxy life back soon i had to learn arabic to pray to allah i hope galaxy life comes back soon i dont know how much longer i can take this

#####

50 hours of playtime ago i posted a negative review about the state of the game and its numerous bugs 60 hours later most of the bugs i cited were fixed however as more and more bugs get fixed more and more get discovered  added

slowly albeit not steadily the game is being fixed allegedly however weeks after its official release i wouldnt even want to call this a beta or an early access as some core features remain absent guild wars only work a 15th of the time and some glitches are game breaking  this here is my own experience 

after having moved a colony using chips p2w currency it got moved back to its original location the next day having reached out to the modmail in dc i did get a refund however ever since they refunded me my game is an absolute completely unplayable mess as every time i try to spend or when i gain chips game crashes every time i try to pick up ressources and coins in my buildings game crashes when i try to recycle props on my planet game crashes crashes crashes

in 60 hours it went from bugged infuriating experience to a completely broken one

#####

damn

#####

all my childhood friends are gone but the game itself was back again

#####

awesome that it is finally back it is still in the beta so there are still some bugs around

#####

very good glad to see this game back

#####

best game ever

awuga

#####

was a good game back then even better now

#####

it is in my fair opinion a better game than coc because of how nostalgic it is how nice it feels to unlock something what cod kids would call a streak but this isnt cod and those are more likely power ups for your raids how cool it is to just clean up your plain without paying gold or stuff but actually recieving something like items and premium currency

but

the beta has issues with people not connecting servers for hours and lags a bit well if it is a nostalgic feature to slow down the game because pcs werent as powerful now stop it

conclusion is

i want to see this game in several years with an still active fanbase but it certainly needs more fixing to achieve that

#####

tu tu turu tu tu turu

#####

delicate game

#####

good game very nostalgic

#####

can you help me find firebit  i believe he has some sort of cloaking device that is preventing me from finding him i have to find a decloaking module to find and defeat him once and for all

#####

game was one of the games of my childhood but i cannot recommend this game due to how the game is not exactly playable at this state 

what to expect currently bugs the undoing of progress and the difficulty of even playing the game due to the servers for galaxy life would recommend not to play this until a few months has passed 

what you can do if you do want to play it is just continuously upgrade your buildings nothing else

#####

gotta say its a fun little game
at first i wasnt rlly engaged into it  but it turned out rlly fun  i dont rlly play it all the time but its this charm of it that even if ur super busy u can log into it for 5 mins and do tons of progress by just tellin workers what to do
grind is good  u just keep wanting to upgrade more  invade more and gain more in this game units are all diffrent and battle itself is strategic  u cant just mash everyone into one ball if theyre same lvl as u or close or else theyre gonna get blasted by bombs or if weak units are alone they gonna get sniped community is rlly nice too havin lots of love for such a small game
now the bad things and even if the game is good it still has allot of them servers for the love of god  servers  they keep crashin or not workin or turn on shields randomly or turn off when i had some its as much as on launch but jeez
also i understand if u pay more for unit is better but between them theres a rlly big fall  u know and kamikaze is not rlly good for any situations now the biggest problem is player count 1000 is a good number for such a game but last month it used to be 2000  i think its cuz allota players quit and their destroyed planets keep stayin when i wanna launch an attack i only see destroyed worlds from which i cant get any xp or gold anythin i think good solution would be adding bots or somethin that is equal to player lvl  also it would be good  that fully destroyed world isnt being searched up for battle

but thats all i had to say  its pretty nice 710

#####

galaxy life is like a game of space dodgeball except instead of balls youre dodging lasers and alien invasions as you try to build your own intergalactic empire

as the player youll find yourself playing the role of a budding space explorer who must build up your own planet and defend against hostile alien attacks

and let me tell you nothing makes you feel more like a space badass than upgrading your weapons and blasting away at an alien horde

but fear not because you have your own army of quirky little aliens called starlings to help you defend your planet and conquer others

of course the game isnt perfect sometimes it feels like youre stuck in a neverending game of whackamole where the aliens just keep coming no matter how hard you try to fend them off

but despite its flaws galaxy life is a fun and addictive game that will have you glued to your computer screen for hours on end

so if youre looking for a game that will make you feel like youre the ruler of your own galaxy give galaxy life a try just make sure to watch out for the little green men

#####

if youre here because you played awhile back may as well pick it up its free

if youre not its essentially clash of clans but worse in almost every way clunky ui bugs crashes poor unitdefense balancing idk is coc does it better among a bunch of other little things that have me personally go no i dont want to spend any more time on this

#####

my childhood flashes before my eyes each time i load the game up and i love every moment of it d

#####

fun fact before this game coming to steam i used to created multiple accounts to add as a friend in order to help building planet real quick  xd

#####

that nostalgic feeling when you play this game 
the old ui and low fps ah yes classic

#####

game is heavily reliant on having friends which is poorly coded and doesnt link you with your steam friends
and ive gotten like 3 helmets and 2 toolboxes and each time it dropped game forced me to refresh and items got deleted if you played this in the past  dont play it again dont ruin good nostalgia
and newest bug i encountered  restarting my game removes like 10 of my resources and all my chips each time i clear obstacles to get 35 chips i lose all of them next time i log in

#####

very nice
performance drops a lot as you build your base bigger but if you go fullscreen its fine

#####

too buggy dont recommend it in its current state

nevertheless its a very good game hopefully it becomes playable soon

chad galaxy life  virgin clash of clans

#####

facebook version was better

#####

i spilled my starcoffe111

#####

write a review for galaxy life

#####

best computer game in history of history

#####

i played galaxy life as a flash game when it came out for many hours 
instead of updating the game making it more complete high resolution this is nothing but a copypaste of the old code slapped with not a single effort to make the game good 
as soon as i open it i am met with unfixed graphic bugs extremely limited ui settings poor optimisation loading times 
and the same microtransactions 
010 worse experience than playing it on launch not worth

#####

runs like fkn ass but ill prob still play it

#####

legendary game  everyone should play this

#####

this game is just like it was in 2013 it is amazing

#####

hasnt been in the oven long enough

#####

i would love to give a positive review even if it would have been just for nostalgia reasons but this games servers are on another level of bad and losing progress out of the blue happens all the time

i hope the servers get better but this game is a hot mess and i am sad to see the state it is in right now

#####

fun but servers kinda bad rn
very nostalgic

#####

we are so back

#####

great game still beta has bugs but its fun and strategic

#####

awesome game

#####

exceptionally buggy expect a lot of progress disappearing due to server issues
im not recommend this game i miss old galaxy life way back 2013

#####

this game was my childhood 20142016 highly reccomend playing think of clash of clans but less pay to win simpler and theres a frickin ufo galaxy life is my far the best base build game the world can offer and im super thankful it was salvagable from ubisoft

#####

this is a top tier game pure nostalgia so glad it made a comeback hope they keep updating it to modern standarts

#####

amazing memories 3 thx

#####

fun game but i hope they get the connection issues fixed

#####

its a great game and it realy has the nostalgic feeling

#####

nostalgia

#####

its as good as it once was and the developers seem to always be patching and balancing new things the only real issue is that i sometimes get server connection issues the game runs much better after the latest update which unlocks the framerate

#####

its back somehow i played galaxy life like 10 years ago and managed to upgrade everything to max level without spending any money so it was a real shock at the moment i saw the announcement that they were planning to shut down the whole game i was angry and disappointed because i had put in a lot of time and effort

so i was really surprised to see galaxy life on steam and i have know idea whats happening here and if gl is now planning to stay but im playing again curious about what the future will bring us tho d 

i did know that a fan based game was still in developing created by the fans of galaxy life but it had a insane amount of annoying bugs and progressing was nearly impossible so its good to see a way more stable version keep in mind that there are still a lot of bugs and in time those issues will be fixed by the developer so dont stop playing just be patience because gl is so much fun

#####

its a fun relaxing war game build your bases upgrade troops and no pressure to buy anything up to you if you want to buy attack other players for resources join alliances for more action in wars

#####

yes

#####

bueno luego de los primeros meses donde los servidores estaban constantemente en mantenimiento

finalmente puedo recomendar este port de galaxy life los desarrolladores demostraron que están dispuestos a expandir el juego y no solo quedarse en el molde así que espero ver en un futuro una gran update

#####

best game ever

#####

the moment i saw the art style i immediately thought of kixeyes backyard monsters this i like a lot playing it for awhile it is a nearly exact clone which i have no problem with since the original is dead

bad this should be single player until they have servers seriously i spent 80 of my playtime getting server errors and having to reload over and over

if they make it possible to actually play the game then ill upvote

#####

i did not know this game was back online i remember it got down in 2015 still i am happy to see it back online cant really connect yet tho since it was one of my first games that i liked on fb lol and i remember playing it a lot since it does have some satisfying gameplay loop still for an honest review this game is just like clash of clans should i say clash is like this but it never got popular enough to support itself and only the dedicated player base got to support it main problem a game like this has the very long and sometimes boring way of upgrading building finding the right parts for stuff its always tedious to do and can take a lot of time also if u wanna actually buy them with credits is a bit costly some minor things are that some powerups are to weak or to powerful coughcoughnuke some troops take to long to train
overall this game it fun for investing some time on it since it does have a lot of features and different gameplay elements for other types like it so i say give it a try 


#####

very cool game 
i very recommend since its free 
lots of nostalgia
active developers

a lot of bugs you have to deal with
a lot of spilled coffee on the servers
hope it does not get abandoned again

#####

goat

#####

they took the code from projects that had effort put into them reborn slapped it onto some shitty server with no further development and called it a day
this game stops being playable due to any progress constantly being reset whilst the money you put into making it is gone as well
dont play if you dont want to get annoyed

#####

d


#####

nostalgia overdrive


#####

countless bugs dont really affect progress but just annoying sometimes due to flash but other than that sooo good

#####

came for nostalgia 100 recommend

#####

i almost cried seeing this game back the only thing that could have been better is if i could have my old account on facebook back

#####

nostalgic for anyone who look for friends for batteries do not hesitate to add me 

#####

#####

buckle up because this is the most exciting game youll never play

#####

amazing game straight from my childhood

#####

i do think this is a good game but there need to be some huge balance changes especially bunkers since they are way too strong when you get to about starbase level 5 almost everyone is using falcons in their bunkers which are flying units that can wipe out armies in seconds i did the maths in some steam forum post and i dont feel like doing them again but there are only 4 units in the game that can actually hit flying units bazooka wasp falcon and colossus and even among them only two wasp and colossus can actually do anything to a swarm of falcons and the colossus is a very lategame unit which unlocks at sb level 7 on top of this a given base can have up to 4 bunkers which together have the same troop capacity that you have at maximum the difficulty of a given base is purely decided by what troops they put in bunkers and this alone means most troops in the game are never going to be used to make bunkers anywhere close to balanced the troop capacity in them needs to be reduced by at least 90 and they could even get rid of one or two of the bunkers entirely sure you could use things like missile or meteor strikes but each one needs to be crafted and its just not feasible at all to use 8 meteors per attack just to get rid of bunkers also missile strike for whatever reason doesnt hit air units making it pointless against mass falcons anyway bunkers are the single main reason i stopped playing this game and the game is almost unplayable while theyre in this stateadditionally high level resource buildings take a good while to destroy even with several high dps units attacking it if you couldnt speed up the attack to 4x nobody would want to play this gamelastly youre put at a big disadvantage if you dont have friends especially if you like me dont like adding strangers as friends on steam you lose out on one of the bunkers which can only be filled by friends getting builders and stuff is slow as there are several items you can only get by helping friends or by paying premium currency and one of said items is required to upgrade your starbase already by level 3 and even then youre relying on rng to get these itemsthe sad thing is ive found that best way to get resources in this game is to train bazookas they have the best range in the game and find spots in high level bases where they can chip away at resource buildings without being in range of a defensive building no complex strategy with 6 different troops placed perfectly at the perfect times to wipe a base just put bazookas where they shoot resource buildings and wait

#####

so nostalgic

#####

its awesome and nostalgic
love it

#####

i was obsessed with this game when i was little used to play it on facebook this brings back lots and lots of memories too bad i lost my main account 

#####

good game like the old only have a problem i cant agree my friends

#####

probably older than 90 of my viewers

#####

fun game

#####

i used the base design tool and worked on my base for 1 hour and right as im almost done the game server crashed so i designed my base again using the base design tool worked for it for another hour and the server crashed again i tried designing my base 5 times already and the server keep crashing every time im almost finish with my base

i spent 750000 gold for the observatory then the game crashed and took all my gold but the observatory was not there gathered enough gold again to build the observatory the server didnt crash when i closed the game but when i open the game back up the observatory wasnt there and so my gold so i just decided to upgrade my buildings soi upgraded my reasearch lab thing and my camps i closed the game normally i opened the game a day later and the upgrade didnt and the money isnt there

this games server is so ass today i cant even attack or train troops because every time i press the attack button the server crash and then my troops are magically gone im just so done with this game it makes you work for something and not even reward you for it and then they take your resources so they encourage you to use online transactions to buy chips and to instantly upgrade your buildings so that it actually upgrades


edit they fixed some of it

#####

child time memories arent enough this game is bugged as hell the only thing that keeps me is nostalgia

#####

servers are some freakin nightmare crashes all the time my longest session took somethin about 1520 minutes progress goes backwards after every crash so for now game is not even playable thats a great game servers are only issue here waiting for fixes for now i do not recommend

#####

we have no life
 only galaxy life

#####

i guess its just nostalgia but servers not reliable saves rolled back and a myriad of weird things

#####

this game is unplayable
so far i played this game for over 170 hours most of them during beta tests when entering game took you 10 hours but that doesnt matter after that long time i experienced a lot of bugs
losing war even after winning it
losing same war a few times adds in example 2 losses instead of 1
losing millions of cash and minerals because of star coffee while collecting it from houses and mines
and one recently getting things from my planet deleted such as lvl 8 houses or mines
at this point this game is unplayable even after sending a lot of reports with videos about losing stuff i got no response
so screw you

huge edit

after some time game had a few big patches most of them fixing bugs mentioned above you can now play without getting mental breakdowns because of lost resources leaving you far behind others keep in mind that game still has a few isuess that most probably will be patched in the future furthermore game received update adding new content to the game giving hopes for even longer gameplay possibilities and overall enhanced experience would recommend

#####

dont spill your coffe

#####

when i found out that galaxy life is to come back and work again i felt a great joy and a will to live i was waiting impatiently for this day and finally it came the game from my childhood was added to steam and it worked  well then i saw server unreachable at that moment i had a heart attack i just couldnt take it it was too much of a shock for me luckily i woke up on the second day in the hospital the doctor immediately informed me that the servers were already running so i quickly went home and started playing the game however showed the same error from time to time i was depressed i did not know what to do with myself this game is my life i spent all my pocket money on these magic chips 19 fortunately they fixed this error then my life took on new colors again i felt the joy of the game my orange men did what i wanted they worked for me all day and night but then the worst happened my eyes saw a new problem namely reload my condition worsened i even saw a doctor with it he said that i should go to a psychiatrist but i didnt do it because i had to upgrade my compact house when i did and collected the money my deepest reload nightmare came true and the money was gone along with the level i got i couldnt sleep all night thinking about it to this day she cries in the evenings thinking about my colossus who died this way without even going to the battlefield i hope this bug will be fixed and i will be able to sleep well overall game 1010

#####

been playing this for over a week now somehow the network is still very unstable 
it resets every few mins bugs bugs bugs 
im just going to take a break from it it is not playable at this time i had resets 5 times in a roll and lost all res from upgrades from bad game network connections 

for example i have 200k res and 400k money i click on colonize and instantly it needs to reload once i reload the money is gone but the building hasnt start it or i click on collecting resources and money then click one of the buildings or friends planet to help and it froze righ there once i reload all the collected resourcesmoney is gone and is no longer collectable for another while at this frustration rate i can not recommend this to anyone

#####

great game but wouldnt recommend it atm due to the current money glitch that makes your cash disappear after forcing you into a reload

#####

brings back childhood memories 

#####

the houses on my main colony and mines are now somehow not producing resources wtf

whenever an error occurs the game crashes your last few seconds of progress is gone but the gold youve spent doesnt return wtf

a straight port nothing remastered even the shitty facebook mechanics

love it
still havent colonized planets tho

#####

nice

#####

nostalgia tripl

#####

this game lacks of optimization its so laggy i think it has to do with fps limit on this game or something idk
just make it smooth to play so we can enjoy it

#####

awesome nostalgic game recommend it to anyone who used to play it or is just scrolling by doesnt take too much attention but you can near always do something to progress

#####

best game ever

#####

aaaaaaaaaa

#####

my whole childhood in one game 3
