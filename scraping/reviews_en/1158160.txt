edit okay i had to change my review at least until things get fixed

ive put some more hours into coral island  the more i played the more it frustrated me i just cannot believe how the devs would think that fully releasing this game in its current stage was a good idea the story ends exactly at the same point as in early access nothing about it got developed any further you help out some specific npcs  then youre getting greeted with a wip message in your quest log several items lack descriptions  only say tbd

the npcs keep forgetting everything ive finished year one  every time i talk to the npcs they reintroduce themselves to me as if it was my first time meeting them 

mini games from events  cleaning the ocean bring game breaking bugs with them you lose your tools which you cannot get back again  since there is no manual save option you dont have the ability to load an older save file so then thats it because no tools  no things you can do

previously i thought this release patch shouldve just been a bigger update for romance since thats all the devs really added but even that is bugged to hell heart events are not triggering your partner still says the same generic lines they even congratulate you on your marriage with someone else  a week after you married them 

i treat coral island as if it is still early access because lets face it thats what it is  i planned on at least finishing the shrines  building friendships because those should work but those things do not work due to bugs

so yea dont advertise this game as 10 when its not finished dont make new players pay more money than early access players when they basically get the same version of the game 

fix the game actually finish it  then we can talk about recommending it again
_______________________________________________________

disclaimer generally i do recommend getting coral island but this is more of a neutral review

coral island is fun i clocked in over 60 hours during early access  found many things to do without getting bored
the world looks lovely the artstyle is amazing  the characters are well written you truly feel like part of a real breathing community the game also doesnt shy away to discuss serious topics like divorce or coparenting but at the same time it also provides many funny homages to 90s sitcoms

i also appreciate the qol settings like making days last longer or making enemies in the mines passive unless you hit them first
these settings provide us more control over our cozy escape

though at this point i have to point out that coral island shouldnt have left early access because the game is clearly not finished yet half of the games story  mechanics will be released in 2024 when it shouldve been part of the 10 update the merfolk lore  romance isnt finished part of the general map is still off limits interactions between the player  npcs arent fully fleshed out yet multiplayer isnt available either

so the current full release is actually just 05 version of the finished product keep that in mind before you decide to purchase coral island

#####

i recommend this game with one caveat there are important sections of this game currently missing ill cover those first then hit you with the good stuff

h2 the bad stuff h2


any real storyinteraction with the spoilermerfolkspoiler is not in game
being able to finish the spoilergiantsspoiler story line is not possibleinability to fully enchant tools
completing some offerings at the lake temple currently do not give any reward for completing the setno spoilerdig sitespoiler and no spoilersavannah accessspoiler
autochest currently busted tends to crash on pc

the more nitty gritty that i believe are cardinal sins for farm sim games
inability to split stacks of items in inventory
online ordering does not have buy more option which allows you to hold right click to multiple at a time
autoharvest sprinkler has far too many menus why can we not just right click to receive the crops
im sure there is other things i am forgetting

h2 the good stuff h2

graphics are great
plenty of fish fossils artifacts to discover and donate
tons of different crops
plenty of upgrades for toolsseedstreessaplings
farming gameplay loop is what you would expect
fishing minigame is actually pretty dang good

ending thoughts
you can run through a whole year in coral island and have a fun time i sunk hours into it and i was a backer it does bother me some of the key elements for this game to be considered full release 10 is completely missing know what you are getting into before buying i would recommend it but hopefully some of my opinionsthoughts help you make an informed decision on whether to pick this up now or wait a bit for updates

#####

this really sucks to write ive been a part of coral islands development since donating to the kickstarter and playing since alpha this is a game full of love for the genre charming and beautiful art and great gameplay ideas ive loved playing this game throughout the years and seeing it evolve over its lifespan i was ecstatic when they announced that 10 was coming but us alpha players were also confused because the game didnt seem complete i held out hope that 10 would release with all the missing content and bug fixes we wanted

however it is not finished not at all there is so much content that is obviously missing there are countless bugs you encounter on a regular basis and the amount of typos in dialogue is just unacceptable 

theres still a bug that occurs in the winter festival that renders your game unplayable by destroying all your tools and the devs said the only solution is to restart from the beginning  by the time you get to winter youve put a minimum of like 20 hours into the game  

new bug fixes break old functionality you currently cant use online shopping something that was working since beta content you unlock in the game has no function entire buildings and shops that seem theyd have some use dont do anything  theres a taco truck at which you cannot purchase anything theres a recycling plant with its own map icon that does nothing why 

devs are also frustratingly uncommunicative and ignore qol feedback thats been highly requested since alpha missed tool swings drain stamina there is no ability to save outside of sleeping for the day this part is particularly egregious considering how often the game can crashbugs can happen the overall story doesnt really go anywhere and remains unresolved

i cannot fathom any reason why they would claim this is 10 except maybe as a way to prevent early access saves from being overwritten with patches so people can play more its very clear the difference in polish between early game content and later game content

like i said this sucks to write there is a talented dev team with passion at work making questionable decisions this should not have been released as 10 if this game gets the updates it so desperately needs to complete the content and fix these nasty bugs id happily recommend it as of now however i cant

#####

i like to think of myself as a lover of the life simfarming sim genre ive played and loved many iterations of harvest moon and animal crossing over the last fifteen years i sank hundreds upon hundreds of hours into stardew valley and dabbled in the rune factory series where i could because of budget constraints worlds dawn was a cute little addition to the genre and had a super rich story to go with it my time at portia and my time at sandrock have seen their fair share of time played as well it goes without saying that i definitely have my favorites but truly

none have ever held a candle to the place that coral island holds in my heart 

i was part of the alpha testers ive logged just shy of 350 hours of playtime on the alpha version and ill probably double that easily now that early release has arrived the journey of the last fifteen months to reach this point has been wonderful and incredible 

coral island takes all the best traits of the above games and polishes them until they shine with a brilliance that is brighter than a supernova sure you have your standard chosen one premise which is prevalent in many of the aforementioned games above but its not in your face about it you inherit the farm from your grandparents who happen to be alive and well and living on one of the other nearby isles enjoying their retirement the tasks set before you initially are all centered around the towns economy and the townies efforts to drive up tourism again to their wonderful little town the game play is very akin to stardew valley and story of seasons pioneers of olive town in regards to farming mining and gathering more so the latter of the two as the game goes on 

the trait that sets this game apart from the rest

hands down its the fact that you get to scuba dive to clean up the ocean floor and restore the coral reefs its such a wonderful mechanic that ties in to many of the other aspects of the game 

the visuals are stunning for a game that just came into early access and the ambient sounds offer a level of immersion i havent felt in a long long time ranging from birds chirping to monkeys calling out through the jungle to the more subtle sounds of the ocean lapping at the pier or shore the sound of your surroundings as you go through the island on your errand of the day make it easy to forget that youre staring at a screen starlet town itself is cozy and well situated and the townies themselves feel incredibly organic they all have different expressions and their outfitsonce the game is complete will vary for each season and certain festivals ill admit to having a few favorites among them and im very much looking forward to when the romance mechanics go live 

the shining gem of this game is not the game itself however but the devs they have been nothing but open and transparent if things get held up due to not working correctly not only have they been open to suggestions and criticisms alike but they take time to interact with their fan base when time allows im so proud to be a part of their community and to have done my part in helping them make this game the best it can be 

if you havent guessed i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a lifefarming sim with a twist i can only hope that youll grow to love coral island as much as i have

#####

if you like stardew valley harvest moon dating sims bikinis abs mermaids and animal crossing mixed with southeast asia youve come to the right place

#####

q is this game worth it
a yes

q does this game have content
a yes

ill number every activity you can do before buying because everything in this game is unfinished at this point in time its mostly a presentation of a game but personally its a very good one and i like it so far

1 farmingcrafting biggest piece of land ever a lot of crops fruits and seeds limited crafting but good one at least

2 romance max 5 hearts with 3 events every now and then solid characters and pretty unique youll fall in love with any of them raina the best btw 

3 dungeon stardew valley copy with their own weird af mechanics really really bad combat content is till level 40 deep dungeon max no bosses yet

4 fishing a fish shadow will pop up and youll have to minigame it easy and pretty simple a lot of fishes

5 bug catching solid game youll see insects and you gotta dash  snatch em all a lot of insects 

6 diving you gotta find mysterious relics activate shrines filled with multiple interesting mechanics most interesting activity so far not saying much about it cuz it contains mayor spoilers #aicompanionlove

7 museum animal crossing type actually its based off of it instead of an owl you get a cute blondie

8 animal farming chickens cows and horse for easy riding harvest moon mechanics 

9 decorations solid game you can decorate your house in so many amazing ways you will love the way you can decorate your farm and house includes japanese style decorations

10 travelling you can throttle run faster and dash the map is unfinished there are shops that exist that you wont know they exist unless you bump into the shop yourself map doesnt even recognize those places 

11 fast travel quite puzzly you unlock fast travel to each travel point by doing certain tasks if you know you know

12 story interesting you probably already know what type of story this is with the kind of art these characters were drawn

13 seasonal events broken 

14 save the town stardew mechanics of donations to magical beings 

15 secrets

tldr solid 6070 hours of gameplay to see everything the game has so far less if you spam dash less if you do exploit strats

so in the end i recommend the game if you wanna support the devs if you wanna play the game and have fun mind you there are bugs and audio glitches like 2 hours without the calming looping song every farming game has you may get stuck smooth run for me textures completely blank one character is a ghost has no face and no dialogue but you will see her walk around town rank will be updated in the future you can rank once so far also no keybinds nor controller support leveling is unfinished too you can only unlock rank 1 skills mc male looks horrible and clothes are pretty bad

my opinion this game with every mechanic they added properly implemented and story finished itll be the best farming game made till this day but that may be 3 to 5 years in the future so it is what it is

#####

i recommend buying this game but not now in its current state the game is so far behind to be called early access and for that price i love the town  the diversity of npcs and the scenery yet the material is just not there yet the npcs keep saying the same things the holidays are not finished and most of the objects int eh game still has no use i played to see where i can go farthest and i have to say you just keep repeating the same tasks mostly farming in about a year this could be a good game but not yet 

ps the game is a lot similar to stardew valley like a lot even some of the dialogues of some npcs are exactly the same it would be better if the characters were more original i cant help but think about how the game exactly like stardew valley in 3d there are one or two different aspectsfeatures like diving but the similarities are too much

#####


id give the game a thumbs up and say it is worth buying but i would give that suggestion with some reserve  the game is now released and you need to know it is not a complete game  there is a fair deal in the game that is not finished  no it is not like the stuff is completed and waiting for a dlc to expand on it  it is flat out incomplete

for example you can have children in game but they do not grow up  i consider that complete  them growing up can be a future dlc or patch or something  however things like the merfolk who are in game are incomplete  you meet them they show up in the list of people you meet but you can not gain any affinity with them and none of them ever really seem to have anything to say  they really seem to have no purpose in the game outside of some story line progressing and there is no real reason for them to even be in the game as it is  this is an incomplete addition to the game and one of many examples where i say the game is still in beta and is not ready to be called a release game  cant have an entire city in the game with mostly nothing to do in it and call the game complete

so with that said buy the game if you like farming sims it is still enjoyable as that  but it seems like the game is only 80 finished so understand it is not a complete game in any sense  buy the game as a beta game and consider it early access because that is what it is  and being it is only 80 complete i suggest only buying it at 80 price or lower if you can  pay for what you are getting and not what they are promising you will come later

example of things that are incomplete maybe the devs will read so they can get some ideas on what needs to be worked on

sprinkler attachments  only works sometimes  seeds it is better at and gets most of the time but fertilizer it is 5050  you always have to check to see if it did what it was supposed to  i have never repeat never had it add fertilizer to every patch  i always need to clean up after it

auto chest  another 5050 addition to the game  works awesome 3 or 4 days in a row and then suddenly stops working  leaves completed items in the machine and you need to fetch them yourself  does not reload machines when it has materials  only used 2 of the 4 aging barrels  you get it they never work completely

speech  3 times i had someone refer to me as playername  macy on more then one occasion has told me how much she loves being married to me  while sweet my actual wife lily might be upset about that  lily one morning asked me what she should bring to the fair tomorrow when the fair was next week

cut scenes  only happened once but still  when the town reached rank a i had the big cut scene to celebrate reaching rank a  about 7 days later i had the same exact cut scene celebrating the town reaching rank a  didnt we do this already

writing  it seems at times it is incomplete or they hired an overly emotional teenager with no real life experience to write the parts  for example in one cut scene leah professes her love for me and i am given two options to reply  option one i feel the same and option two i dont feel the same  there is no option 3 that there really should have been one for even more so that when asked this from her i was already married  when i say i only want to be friends she runs off crying  where is the third option you know the one that should be in game because ive been married to lily for 2 seasons  one that says something along the lines of i really like you but i love my spouse  now you see why i said a child wrote the options  no adult option to let the person down easy  not convinced  many times in cut scenes you are asked things to give your response and the only options you are given are disrespectful answers or smart ass answers  like one with mark and a dog your only 2 options are be rude and be really rude how about one to be supportive of someone trying to help a stray  only crappy disrespectful answers that a kid trying to sound cool would give

speaking of writing  every errand you do gets the responce thank you  seriously  you could not write a few random responses for it and cycle through them  back to letting the kid write this  where is the ive been looking for this or the i can now make the soup ive been craving  build the trap to catch that butterfly  make the wine etc you get the idea  something instead of a basic and bland thank you every single time would be nice 

basically writing as a whole is incomplete and not completely proofed  also letting an editor look over it would have told you some responses are just completely lifeless the writing is basic and incomplete in a great many parts of the game

npcs  there are so many that have nothing to say  if they have nothing to say stop with showing me there is something to say  nothing more annoying them clicking to talk to someone and getting they have nothing more to say or you dont understand what they are saying  if they have nothing to say or i dont understand what they have to say do not give the speech option at all  you are wasting the players time and no one likes that

useless areas  the deep forest with the monkey  outside of finding some scavenables and a lot of hardwood it has no reasons to be there  it is completely unfinished  the peak at the top you can get to somewhat early breaking the boulder  ive run up it at least 30 times  nothing to pick on the ground no insects to capture cant even fish off the edge why is it there  the dungeons in the ocean  maybe i just missed something but what the hell is its purpose  just to collect more trash once you clean up the ocean  

pet peeve time  we live on an island with the dirtiest most disrespectful of the environment type of people on the face of the earth  i clean the beach it is dirty the next day  i clean the ocean the next day it is cluttered with water bottles and tires and all sorts of trash  how the f do these people produce that much garbage every single day  we do no need those ocean dungeons when the pigs on the island will make sure there is always garbage all over the place  seriously once you open the otherwise useless ocean dungeons trash should stop appearing in the ocean and on the beach  at least that would give those dungeons some reason to exsist even if a lame one

there is more incomplete about the game but just wanted to point out some of the larger ones ive noticed  but again as i said the game is an early access game and not a complete game as advertised so when you buy it keep that in mind  and with all that yes i still suggest you buy it  it is a good game  hopefully it will be better when it is finished and actually ready for release

#####

you can modify the speed that time passes in the game i can finally do everything in a day that i actually need to get done 

edit after sinking another 60 or so hours into this and getting at least all the way through the seasons i would definitely still recommend this the fishing minigame isnt impossible the improvement of your gear isnt super tedious and after gold not even so necessary tbh and the biggest issue i have is the occasional stuttering there was a resource that was pretty scarce to get which was aggravating but then i unlocked an area that had a great deal of it so now its just refinement of my farm and all that 

i do hope that there will be increases in size for coopbarn though i cant imagine why not when you have to purchase two llamas when you get the one but of course the game is unfinished so im sure there will be lots of changes still perhaps one to deepen the caverns as well certainly some more fleshing out the mermaids is expected as they never have anything to say lol 

most of my time in game besides tending to my ludicrous amounts of artisan products is to gather up all the missing museum items still out there there are a lot of different kinds of fish and they are very seasonal and there are a lot more locations to fish than you might realize but still as someone who played stardew as a very fishing heavy game i dont mind spending the time fishing at sea though i do adjust the time to go a little faster even 50 gametime fishing is a little slow for me

as for story and quests and bugs and all that well ive played just about every harvesting sim game that has come out since harvest moon for the snes i know how the general story goes and can accomplish it rather well yes coral island has a interesting cast of unique characters but the story is about the same as youd expect from what i can tell its not fully finished and is lacking in some rewards for finished shrines and whatnot but honestly the finishing of the shrine itself is enough for me 

there are some bugs with the dialogue but honestly it could be worse maybe im much more lax in my demands for a game maybe i skip about every other cut scene because the story specifics dont honestly matter that much to me or maybe they put this out a little more unpolished than the should have all things considered did i get my moneys worth yeah ive got 100 hrs in this thing and paid what 25 so at almost 25cents an hour i got my moneys worth in time spent having fun

will you god only knows but i do know that i stretched that time out as long as i could per day i think theyre like 45 minutes long at 50 speed thats bonkers i can play one week in game for a whole afternoon man i just love that mechanic so much

#####

the game is not finished

heres 2 examples
1 you will reach a point where a main quest says wip
2 the list of dateables on the store page shows 28 characters but the text mentions 25 singles that is because 3 of the dateables that are listed right on the store page are not actually dateable yet you can barely interact with them at all

it was released from early access with an increase in price but nowhere on the steam store page does it say that the game is incomplete you have to go read through the updates to find that out it is deliberately deceptive and should not be tolerated

updating the game with more features is fine releasing an unfinished game and then finishing it in updates is not

#####

its a good game dont get me wrong but if youre doing a 10 release have the story line finished

#####

i have been having a lot of fun over 40 hours of it with the story gameplay and design of coral island  but i do not think it was ready for early access release

light spoilers below

i am someone who plays a lot of games in early access i like being ahead of the crowds and helping devs as they finalize their game and then i get to be excited when all of the updates come 

this game takes some of my absolutely favorite parts of harvest moon and stardew valley throws in a smidge of animal crossing and a large dash of something entirely its own the mechanics are fine minus a bug here or there and there are so many incredible characters in the town to get to know the story is immediately intriguing and every day youre wondering what new and exciting thing about the town youll learn of

my biggest gripe is that there are dozens of aspects or items that are either discussed by characters or that already exist in the game that simply are not playable until some later updates or the full 10 release i know this because 1 some aspects literally say they wont be available until 10 or a later time and 2 i have gone to the discussions a bunch of times with a confusion only to find out that something just isnt in the game yet there is also no indication when you have reached as far as you can go with the main story line quest which had me wandering around  for ages in case i had missed something 

to me early access shouldnt mean half the game hasnt be implemented but heres the game with all the large noticeable gaps it should be heres the start of our game as we develop more help us sort out bugs and playing issues as we implement more items and aspects in semimonthly updates and you can sorta tell that certain areas will play a big part in the future releases i would rather have lower playable hours with this main story line if it meant more completion within it ie giving me spring with the festivals and one of the various mini games mentioned being able to upgrade one essential tool which is not an option at the moment a certain map that would keep us from going insane in one specific area etc

coral island has absolutely incredible potential in terms of sandbox farmingcrafting games the base is there the story and characters are set and exciting and the uniqueness is a joy so it is incredibly frustrating that it was released at a level where you the player have no idea what is going on when youve reached the endpoint of the story line or where to find something that does not yet exist

the good news is i believe the devs are planning the full 10 release in 2023 with an update in between now and the full release so hopefully there wont be too long a wait until some of the more basic needed aspects come into the game and once that happens everyone should fly to buy this game its going to be fantastic



#####

stardew but everyone is hotter

#####

while i do recommend this game i also recommend people wait until maybe q4 of 2024 or early 2025 before picking this up there is several missing features in the game that make it a hindrance to play if youre waiting for those specific features to be in the game for anyone that wants to play now regardless get it on sale in that case i cant tell people to pay full price for this until it has implemented the missing features

#####

im writing this for ea version of the game so if dealing with unfinished product is not your thing  stay away for now and wait for a fullgame release
getting this out of the way from the start  lets see what we have so far
another stardew valley  harvest moon clone
yes an no
coral island has enough uniqueness to stand on its own in farming sims genre but enough similarities so not to feel lost going in blind
3d is a nice twist for me other people will feel more in their element with this anyway  looks good
visuals are awesome music is very nice i keep humming along the main theme through the day story  enough is there already to keep player interested in getting to know more and theres a promise of fleshing it out in the future
gameplay  very very familiar in its basic elements but with some new things thrown in here and there you get to clear the land plant tend and harvest your crops raise animals fish mine also  catch bugs and critters and clear trash yes theres an environmental awareness message tied in and some people will find the way its done somewhat or very controversial  i dont mind bad guys painted dark as coal in games
a lot of areas to explore tons of activities to do  you will find that days ingame are going too fast even when you put it in slomo
as for npcs interactions and dating aspect of it  did i say already about amazing visuals same goes for this part everybody is absolutely ilovelyi and dateable and many nondateable characters are just plain bgorgeousb and selection is just delectable who needs sims when you have that
now to the negatives
bugs tons of bugs and glitches also typos and other minor and glaring linguistic errors that even i as a notnative english speaker who makes a lot of mistakes myself find offputting at times i encountered gamebreaking bugs once or twice had to start another save 1 time and just restart the day here and there some other people have different experience
a lot of features are not fleshed out some are just hinted at so many areas are not done yet some are there to walk in  but just empty often you have no idea without asking community if something is not there yet or not working properly or something else entirely some aspects of the game like fishing and catching bugs are just frustratingly difficult at times in current state for people who dont have lightning reflexes or have older computers or both missing textures memory leaks loading issues stuttering here and there but a lot of it is expected when you dealing with early access and from what i see  developers are working on the game diligently so hopefully all that will be dealt with in time
so  bottom line
would i recommend this game  yes even in its current state
ive got over a 100 hours of play time out of it already and theres a promise of more fun to come and the price is not too big for what we have now with again hopefully a bigger and better product in the future
this game has a lot of potential and i would like to see how it will turns out at full release
but remember  early access is not a full game and not polished game
if you are ready to deal with current and possible surfacing issues  go ahead if not  wait
if you get in  you also can have a say in how coral island will look and work in the future developers do listen to the community so its a chance for you to participate and make your voice heard
i will definitely play more with new updates not saying that im putting it off a the moment and very eager to see coral islands full release

ps i did get the game as a gift from one of my friends  so heres a big thanks to this awesome person  you know who you are 3

#####

let me preface with a very simple statement i really wanted to like this game i would not have paid full price or played as much as i already have if this wasnt the case

right now i tell my friends who have coral island on their wishlists to not buy it
the game is released as in i assumed it was playable in its entirety play the whole story and expereice a full game
i we you cant do that right now im writing this right after hotfix v10945 came out
the story cant be finished there is no spoilermerfolkspoiler storyline and they are an essential part of the mid to late game some romance scenes are not implemented  you cant marry certain characters yet and there is no indicator for that
quests are marked wip in the questlog because they are not implemented 
the game crashes regularly for a lot of people i only encountered this since the recent hotfix
character illustrations are not implemented yet or sloppily cut out with white edges where they should not be 
some of the achievements are at 00 rate because they cant be completed at this point in time 

go look up the 2024 roadmap for coral island and be surpirsed by all the things not included in the full game release and decide for yourself if you should buy now or wait if and when they will finish their fully released game 
they also release 2 hotfixes a month since releasing the game trying to very slowly unbreak their broken game 

i will play further if my savestate lets me and might edit this later on but rn im not happy with the state of coral island at all

 graphics 
 you forget what reality is
 beautiful
 good
 decent
 bad
 dont look too long at it
 msdos

looks decent for a farmsim game and has cute and emotive characters and animals the pets in particular are adorable 

 gameplay 
 very good
 good
 its just gameplay
 mehh
 watch paint dry instead
 just dont

this is why you play the game have played sdv for hundreds of hours across multiple platforms played harvest moon religiously as a child and this games gameplay in my humble opinion takes the cake easily 

 audio 
 eargasm
 very good
 good
 not too bad
 bad
 im now deaf

music is fairly good but i will admit some of the tool usage sfx seems a little rough around the edges sometimes 

 audience 
 kids
 teens
 adults
 grandma

anyone can play this game but i do feel that the game touches on enough complex topics such as environmentalism parentalspousal grieving loss of culture and others that perhaps best suit individuals who have had the ability to be somewhat educated on the matter first

 pc requirements 
 check if you can run paint
 potato
 decent
 fast
 rich boi
 ask nasa if they have a spare computer

not a difficult game to run but it does look good enough and there are enough interacting systems that i wouldnt be surprised if some older computers started to have difficulties in running it 

 difficulty 
 just press w
 easy
 easy to learn  hard to master
 significant brain usage
 difficult
 dark souls

only thing in the game that i have even remotely struggled with is the fishing and that feels about right not a difficult game by any means 

 grind 
 nothing to grind
 only if u care about leaderboardsranks
 isnt necessary to progress
 average grind level
 too much grind
 youll need a second life for grinding

you have the same kind of community boardstyle offerings that sdv did but way more of them with some pretty cool final rewards the grind isnt intense and the wiki is updated fairly often

 story 
 no story
 some lore
 average
 good
 lovely
 itll replace your life

i personally think the other major reason to play the game is the story not necessarily the overarching narrative as thats fairly cutanddry but the stories in between characters more than any other farm sim that ive played before the people feel like they have relationships and lives obviously given the scope of the game youll get several repeated lines from the same character over time i am pleasantly surprised however that seasonal variance events you have completed and even just a long enough wait and i am constantly being greeted by new dialogue and cutscenes the devs really went to town with the cutscenes that serve no purpose other than to show the residents of starlet town going about their daily lives arguments laughs gatherings grief all of it its these wonderful little moments that make the games characters feel fleshed out 

 game time 
 long enough for a cup of coffee
 short
 average
 long
 to infinity and beyond

my game time is inflated by many nights of falling asleep with the game open but this is a game much like many other farmsims that you can easily spend hundreds of hours in tons of stuff to do and customize with only more being added as time goes on 

 price 
 its free
 worth the price
 if its on sale
 if u have some spare money left
 not recommended
 you could also just burn your money

as my hours played may indicate i believe that this is worth every penny

 bugs 
 never heard of
 minor bugs
 can get annoying
 ark survival evolved
 the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

the bugs have gotten much better than when the game first went ea and in my first save i lost a core part of the game in multiple locations because some flag somewhere didnt proc and i missed out on further quests teleportation pillars and more on my second serious save those issues largely seem to be resolved although visual glitches still happen here and there i have had a cutscene appear when only half of the quest is finished but not sure about whether finishing the quest will still work as intended

great game overall im beyond excited for the full release and i hope that the devs get all the love in the world 

big game tip lower your in game speed to 50 in the settings there are several ways to get energy and endless ways to spend it youre gonna want the extra time 


#####

too much dateable candidates will riot if theres no option for harem ending

i love it dont get me wrong the aesthetic and visuals are great but i dont think the devs should consider this game as full release when it is clearly not im nearing the end of year 1 and have encountered crashing upon quitting to desktop running on an rtx 4070 with 32gb ram it has gotten to the point where i have to force shutdown my pc just so i could turn it off 

its concerning considering that most dev diary updates are mostly about adding new items clothes and cutscenes thats nice and all but at least fix the bugs first that museum pickstarter cutscene when you get the brush just completely stopped working and you dont get the complete content 

the game has a lot of potential but like other gamers im worried that the devs will fail to deliver since they rarely respond to reports

#####

i am currently in year 2 of this game and i have thoroughly enjoyed it
my main frustration is the lack of knowing what has been finished or not by the team
1 players cannot complete the diving taskline and are stuck with the task
2 understanding where to go for festivals as most of the time nothing comes in the mail on where to go
3 on the flipside we receive mail as we progress that more animals are unlocked but find out when visiting the ranch store that they are not ingame yet
4 unlocking the craft for the loom but again cannot use it because sheep are not ingame yet
 just to list some examples
it is currently confusing for players on what is playable until finding out in the moment
the only other minor complaint is there is a bit of a lack of content for early access however i still have some things to do ingame after reaching year 2

i will say the game is worth it
the art style is fantastic i love that there are many characters in the game and a big list of marriage candidates
i love the implementation of diving
one huge advantage of this game already is how fast the game is it is one big loading screen when loading the game and after that going in and out of buildings is super quick
i have experienced some bugs to be expected but i have not crashed at all which is really appreciative
i will absolutely be playing again on full release

for the people complaining about it being like stardew
news flash

bstardew is not original either it is a direct rip from various aspects of many harvest moon games concerned ape says sob

people love stardew because it is so many of them and the best parts combined with modding abilities

others are complaining about well early access hiccups wait until full release then no ones forcing you to play right now 

h1now for my review h1
this game constantly shows you how much love the devs put into it you see the characters do so many various animations they hang out together have conversations the families can be seen playing at various areas of the games maps such as the volleyball court

everyone has personal backstories and are unique a fan favorite seems to be suki who has stretch marks and is dealing with leaving kids father and self improvement

theres someone for everyone

this game has the best of the farm sim game genre in it with extras such as animal crossing activities liek bug catching and diving

no matter how you want to play it is viable 

wanna farm farm
wanna catch bugs nonstop catch bugs
wanna only fish fish
wanna gather and mine only do that

you can easily make money off all the side activities you can make your farm into a huge bee sanctuary and flower garden if you want it can literally be anything you want things also place well beside each other no annoying gaps like in animal crossing decorating

the hair styles freaking suck but they are adding more and sculpting them right now for players if you look at the discord and see the daily lists the devs post on there of things they actively work on its absolutely amazing and exhaustive they are putting so much effort into this and if you crash a lot and ask things the discord devs from the game will personally reply a lot or ask you for your crash reportssave files to fix whatever issue with very quick times its the middle of the night for them and one of them is currently looking over my broken file after the patch this morning that seemed to break a lot of ppls save files

the festivals are fun and have mini games that are new to play with the villagers and you can see a lot of signs and notes in game about how the devs plan on putting something there

this game when it is done is going to be amazing it will have high replayability due to the massive amount of characters in it to choose from and how you can really just do anything and have it be a viable main activity for your farm

if early access is going to bug you and the chance of needing to be wiped and starting over will end it for you then please just wait for full release

if you dont mind it though and still just want to test the waters i encourage you to really take your time to talk to people multiple times and take your time looking around and watching the animations and things cause its so so so lovely

i have played so much i played alpha and tested as well and i never rlly see any conversation repeats  

theres also the universally liked gifts that are easy to craft

there are problems sure but they are being fixed controller was so lovely to play with in alpha but a patch broke it and its still currently being repaired 

if you just take some time to look over the dev diaries on the discord and really appreciate the potential this game is truly amazing

spoilerfree review 80 hours of alphaea
 large variety of dateables 25 of diverse characters with different personalities
 unique diving feature clean the oceans and recycle people 
 great lore  island backstory 
 great developer team very active discord constantly updating fixing bugs etc a for community guys
 lacking interactionimpactful cutscenes awkward choices dialogue and lacking in engagement
 lack of tutorialshelp a lot of times youre given things with no instruction since theres so much to do in the game it can become very confusing andor daunting to figure out what to do next or how to do something

backed this on kickstarter and have been playing since early alpha the game has an amazingly diverse cast and adds a twist to the lifefarm sim genre by taking an island setting and adding mystical lore diving to save the ocean and much more its got the familiar farmingranching of harvest moonstory of seasons games the dungeoncave mechanics similar to stardew valley and the wide variety of home decor and customization of my time at portia the music is very fitting unobtrusive and honestly makes me happy every time i hear it lots of soft pianos guitars a bit of islandy lofi if i had to describe lol my only concern is that there seems to be a growing list of things being added to the game without much refinement to what is already available as well as the growing list of 25 dateables many added on by popular demand which im thankful for variety but also concerned that there will be lack of depth to each character and i wont be able to connect to them similarly to the blandness of sos pioneers of olive town

thankfully the developers seem receptive to feedback as they even have an ingame feedback button and a dedicated channel in their discord im excited to see this game develop further 

lastly there have been many people who claim that this game is basically a copy of stardew valley i wont deny that there are similarities but its really just superficial at best its in the same genre pulling from many different games while keeping its own creativity i wouldnt say that stairway games has done anything groundbreakingly different but theyve created something unique here and its worth checking out if you love lifefarm sim games

#####

i hate posting a would not recommend for this game because as you can see ive sunk a huge amount of time into the game i really want to like it and one day i might be able to recommend it but that day isnt today this game is to put it as gently as possible just not complete i kickstarted this game and the planned release was quite some time ago and they kept pushing the release back to make sure the game had the polish it deserved for all the polish it was allegedly getting i was really excited for 10 so i stopped playing the early access so i could experience the game as it was intended this my friends aint it

so you might be asking what exactly isnt done with the game and ill make a list of some of the things bothering me most in no order at all this is not even almost complete list of things missing from the game at this point

1 there is a library for which you are supposed to be able to collect and donate books and lost pages supposed to function a bit like the museum there are no books or pages you even unlock an item that allows you to find the books nope nada no books
2 there is an underwater area and the npcs dialogue is broken they all just say the same silly sentence over and over the sentence doesnt even make sense i have completed the underwater storyline and there is nothing to do there there are job boards you cant interact with shops that dont sell anything etc
3 datingromance its broken or nonexistent i have given the locket the indicator of romantic interest to several characters nothing has changed or triggered falls very flat for a game where they made a huge deal about the dateable and romanceable characters this is wild
4 the town rank i have done everything that is currently possible to rank the town up the town is rank a and progress meters are partially full and hung up in weird places it just looks like an afterthought again the literal main story line is to improveheal the town and the rankingprogress for it seems to be an afterthought
5 combat neither challenging nor fun arduous at best leveling is rough and you never once actually feel in danger from the enemies there are quests to fight enemies that literally arent in the game
6 the lake temple offerings ive completed them all half of them didnt unlock anything at all i guess i got a steam achievement for it but nothing in game like it indicates
7 initially there were skill trees for the skills is this game andthey totally dumped that there are skill buffs now and you can collect every one theres no choosing involved and no stronger buffs
8 the kickstarter talks about a function to improve the town thats not even in the game and it shows there are large areas of the map that you cant interact with and they just look like heaps of trash that youre supposed to revitalize or something but you cant theres a huge run down recycling center that does nothing but look nasty right in the middle of my rank a town
9 the town baddies have a quest line that didnt finish im not sure the bad guys also seemed so lackluster that the game would not have felt different if they took them out entirely
10 theres a ridiculous amount of named characters that youre supposed to be able to interact with that have no function theyve put in a you dont understand whats being said placeholder text for these characters

so with all of that why would i play 170 hours well because i want to love this game i kickstarted this and have been excited for it for and because i didnt know all of these things were broken they said 10 release and finally out of early access and i got so excited that i tried to ignore the huge heap of unfinished things piling up as i played but it is not something you can get past their new road map puts any meaningful update another 4 months away which still doesnt address half of the things on the list which means this game is going to be half baked for all of 2024 and theyre not really trying to fix that or even acknowledge it theyre developing it like its still in early access because it essentially is it was so far behind estimated release that they just called an arbitrary update 10 and hoped for the best but at this point we all know this isnt a 10 and it hurts

tldr this is currently a halfbaked game full of promises made yet to be delivered consider it early access and you might be okay i dont recommend playing or purchasing until the end of 2024 at the earliest

#####

my beloved wife keeps playing this game she loves it a lot and even posted her progress on her social media oh not to mention she also keeps telling me the story of the game and the new updates of the game thank you very much for making my wife happy

#####

anyone complaining that this is just like stardew has clearly never played a farming sim before and clearly dont understand what a farming sim is also just so yall know stardew isnt the original farm sim harvest moon came first then rune factory then stardew 

and the goal of a farm sim isnt originality its making a charming game that people can play to farm craft and raise animals if the game is feeling especially extra you can fight monsters or romance characters the hardest part is the making the game charming and quite honestly coral island has done exactly that the character designs are lovely the animals are absolutely adorable the music is gorgeous and i am obsessed with the mermaids the characters also have very evident personalities which can be rather difficult to do with such a large cast of characters 

the game is still in early access so theres a lot you cant do or unlock just yet but theres also a lot you can do also i love the fact that i can give my girl mc super short hair because a lot of games with character customization doesnt do that and its very upsetting lol im gonna be raising so many farm animals and romancing that mer prince xd 

keep up the awesome work devs the scenery in the game is gorgeous

#####

not recommended for now because i find it to be deceitful to selladvertise this game as full release
had they put this out same price and labelled it early access i would definitely recommend this game hands down i find it very enjoyable and it has so much potential but i am worried that they consider this full release when it is clearly early access and again that is just a deceitful way to go about selling this game
 
since they consider it full release does that mean they are cash grabby and planning to start charging people for dlc to complete the game like many other farming sim developers end up doing since they consider it full release does that mean they think the game is fine as is and just plan to put out small updates and bug fixes going forward because that is just not enough and if that is the plan the game is not worth 30 or really worth my time 
what they have here is promising and leaves you wanting more but frustrating when you grind to hit a certain goal and realize it feels underwhelming and unfinished there is not a current updated road map and i could not find anything online like a blog that is up to date where the developers allow people to make suggestions and update us with what they are working on next i like it but definitely concerned about the future of the game since the current state is what the developers feel comfortable selling to you for 30 as a full release

this is not gonna be a very objective and informative review but i promise its heartfelt 

back in may i was fired from my job of 6 years and my already crumbling mental health took a huge nosedive into the darkest of territories 

after a while i reconnected with stardew valley and played it obsessively feeling like it was my only lifeline as usual though after a while i started wanting to play games i didnt know inside out that would give me the same comfort and hope that stardew does ive never found a game like that in the genre despite my searching 

i initially didnt want to play coral island despite having it in my wishlist because i thought it being ea would ruin the experience and leave me unable to judge whether i liked the game or not boy was i wrong ive had this game for 3 days and played 25 hours already 

the story is reminiscent of stardew yes but there are just enough changes that i dont spend my time playing comparing the two in my head im just immersed in this beautiful vibrant island doing my chores talking to people diving mining foraging not fishing because i actually hate the fishing mechanic in this game but im gonna have to suck it up at some point if i plan on finishing the altars lol 

im taking it nice and slow exploring and learning the world new recipes new quests theres a lot you can do in game despite it being ea which is amazing considering how little it costs by comparison being inside this universe has really been a huge serotonin boost for me and being on my farm and about town has been such a welcome diversion from my thoughts i cant wait for more features to be added to be able to experience the full extent of the island 

so from the bottom of my heart  definitely buy this game you wont regret it 


#####

i have never been so stressed out in choosing who to romance in a farming sim before everybody be looking fine af

#####

ive sunk countless hours into farming sim games of all kinds beginning all the way back with gba harvest moon series an experience that i can say with pretty high certainty is shared among fellow indonesians who are also into farming sims this games developers included for most indonesians hm is the reference point when talking about farming sims much more so than stardew valley or any other later iteration of the genre its not even close all indonesian news and reviews of coral island that i have seen unanimously compared the game to hm series instead of sdv thus when i read english reviews saying that the game is mostly an sdv copy its actually pretty funny because sdv itself was intentionally made as an hm clone with more content and an improved gameplay experience the same can be said of coral island and im not complaining

most of the base game mechanics in coral island are shared with hm and sdv but there are lots of additional content even in the current early access state you may farm mine fish scavenge items raise animals make offerings donate to museums celebrate festivals all of the things you can also do in many similar games however it also has a unique environmentalist flair with the ocean trash collection and recycling mechanics as well as extensive arrays of plants animals and items to farmraisefishcatch though some will not be available until future updates not to mention the diverse npcs to interact and develop relationships with

art stylewise its not particularly groundbreaking but the mixture of 3d models and 2d illustrations in this fits perfectly i like that the game doesnt go for chibilike aesthetics and gives a more realistic proportion though still cartoonish to the 3d models the landscapes of the land and the ocean are done beautifully and i really love the shiny wet rendering of the town during rainy days the music can be better but at least its comfortable enough to listen to

for all its similarities with other farming sims coral island is still a charming game with its own personality do give it a chance if you love farming sims in general or have been wanting to play one but dont quite like hmsos and sdv aesthetics

#####

hey everyone                                                                                                                              03142023

before i get into things here i want to state that coral island is still a prerelease game so things are likely to change quite a bit as the game continues to be developed the game itself is beautiful and the story is well written theres quite a lot to do in it already i really want to recommend this game to others but it seems that with every update the developers change something to make it increasingly more difficult to actually follow the main farming quest line

ive been playing coral island since the beginning and i have a lot of time invested i want to start off with a couple of examples in this latest update the price of a the smoothie and green smoothie dropped from 14000 and 16500 each down to 1500 each now that might sound fair however i cant buy a cup of coffee at rajas coffee stand for less than 15000 and yet i can not brew a cup myself in less that two days when i sell  a cup of coffee i receive less than half that amount  im sure the argument to all of this would be that in reality the middleman always takes hisher cut to this my own response would be to open a food stall or maybe allow locals to pay a fee to come and pick their own produce those are real things too by the way an entire keg of coffee yields one cup of coffee  one cup two days 

im afraid to see what theyve nerfed the price of cactus jam down to after i spent so long working and saving to be able to pay the 30000 per seed price to finally produce it  im still waiting on that crop to come in before i can even find out cactus seeds are no longer available at sams during the fall but my crop still appears to be growing and my spare seeds are still in my storage 

with each nerf to the players potential income the answer seems to be to buy more farm animals and make more machines until your farm no longer resembles a farm but some bizarre outdoor specialty grocers 

on a previous update the cost of wine was nerfed by a huge amount not only in the actual payout but in the time it takes to produce it it seems that a number players had figured out that they could become wine barons if they just focused on grapes and kegs that change made sense

everything you purchase on coral island is so ridiculously over priced  clothes seeds kitchen appliances furnishings  with every new update it becomes more difficult to figure out how to pay for seeds equipment and furnishings it appears that the only one not allowed to make money on this island is you 

the last couple of things i want to comment on are the length
 of each day and the inability to save the game yourself  

now this isnt my first farming game and yes i have adjusted the slider for the length of day all the way down to 50  i have the barn and chicken coop fairly close to my house but running the few feet between my home and these barns is 10 minutes putting down 8 pieces of hay picking up 4 eggs petting 8 animals and milking 4 cows takes an hour at a run half a day to water several crop plots this is not accounting for harvesting crops either ive done these things in real life i can fill an entire basket full of eggs and put feed out in a matter of minutes as far as watering goes i have a huge garden and it doesnt take me half my waking hours to do that in my opinion the game play needs to allow for a larger decrease of speed for each day i dont want to take away the full speed for those who like the challenge but im already sprinting all day everyday 

lastly game saves the only time you get a game save is when you go to bed at the end of the day if you crash between the sleeping and waking loading screens all the previous days work is wiped away and anything you accomplished the day before is gone thats right there are no autosaves after key events like the cherry blossom festival or the mermaid cutscene so if you crash at anytime before the next bedtime you just revert back to 6am that morning and have to do it all again if player saving is not something thats going to be implemented then periodic autosaving should be a thing

as i stated at the beginning this game is visually beautiful and the story is compelling the npcs and their stories are unique and getting better all the time character creation is as well i just find this game way to grindy i dont want to have to sprint everywhere because of time constraints this doesnt allow me to actually enjoy the beauty of the island or learn its stories it also doesnt motivate me to stick around 

the economy needs some reworking for sure  our characters story is that theyre a 3rd generation farmer or at least gardener and we communicate with our family back on the mainland via mail 

were i able to reply back to my family i would imagine it would look a little something like this 
 
dear dad 

i hope everyone back home is doing well i miss you all if its not to much trouble can you send me some seeds please see the enclosed list sam is really ripping me off on some of these items and i dont think i can afford to continue growing crops here if i have to purchase from him 

all my love 
           saphia 

ps also some sweats and tshirts would be much appreciated thank grandma for all the goodies


as it stand now i would recommend that anyone whos considering paying for early access might want to hold off and see if some of these issues get corrected in an upcoming patch or another update before spending any money

   happy gaming everyone
                     saphia

tldr the game has tons of potential but desperately needs a few more months of solid work and bug fixes to be in a state that is worth 24 usd wishlist join the discord and keep an eye on it for now 

i wish i could leave neutral reviews because i actually enjoyed the game but it needs lots of work there are plenty of reviews that rightfully praise the good aspects of coral island so i wont do that here im just going to talk about the things that need to be considered before spending a good chunk of money on this game

bno controller support or accessibility optionsb
in addition to no native controller support there is currently no way to edit any keybindings in the game this has become an issue with some people who do not use wasd or dont use qwery keyboards there are a few custom controller layouts for steam deck currently but there are still issues with those and in some cases you are still forced to use the trackpad which can be a problem with the already awkward interactions 

when you are low on stamina the screen becomes desaturated which can cause some visual issues for certain people there is currently no way to turn this off in addition to this there are cutscenes with flashing lights in them while skipable its still an issue as there is no photosensitivity mode as far as i am aware 

bno tutorialsb
at the time of writing this review there are currently zero tutorials in the game coral island makes the huge assumption that the player is familiar with other games in the farminglife sim genre from what ive seen in the discord there are people struggling with everything from fishingbug catching to removing placed objects like chests and scarecrows another issue is that some instructions are delivered to you by mail however you can not reread any letters sent to you nor are any of those details listed in your quest log 

bdiversity feels like a gimmick  customization is lackingb
at first i was really excited to see another game with a lot of inclusivity but then i got to character creation there are 3 body types to choose from feminine masculine and one with no defining features of any kind which is kind of weird honestly sliders would have been better face types are also tied to these body types so theres no mixing and matching the faces tied to the other body type are basically a second set of masculine faces pretty disappointing at the end of customization theres a page to enter your preferred honorific but it doesnt matter you are referred to with neutral pronouns regardless of what you choose you also only get a choice of very short cropped or wavy bob hairstyles for all genders i think the devs need to take a look at the dreamlight valley avatar creator for some better customization ideas 

bcontentb
i understand this is an early access game and therefore will be unfinished however this game currently feels more like prealpha as far as stuff to do goes if youre only looking at the basic gameplay loop gathering and selling then its perfect anything more than that though is severely lacking character dialog is bland festivals are unavailable certain crops needed for quests can not be accessed and there are items in the game that are available to purchase but have no functionality or model there is no clear indicator that any of this is not in the game yet many people on the discord are confused by being unable to participate in the festivals and thinking theyre bugged or doing something wrong because nothing in the game said otherwise other ea games ive played have had notices pop up when you start them saying what is and what is not available or they add text notes on items stating their functionality is currently still a work in progress i spent about an hour looking for fruit trees for a quest only to finally resort to digging through discord for an answer only to find that they arent even in the game yet more transparency is needed from developers outside of discord stating what is and what is not working in the current build 

developer priorities also seem a bit off they have multiple tv shows with tons of dialog and full on references to other games and a whole crab rave on the beach but we dont have controller support basic tutorials or a working calendar kinda frustrating 

beconomyb
the economy in this game is rough crops dont sell for much mining tends to feel like a waste of time and fishing is extremely slow bee hives and pickling jars are available however theyre almost not worth the cost to craft them recently lower level honey was nerfed to near pointlessness and pickling jars process goods so fast that you basically have to just stand there and do nothing but insert materials into them constantly which again is barely worth it i was lucky to get even 80g per item seeds cost almost as much as you sell your crops for so profits are tiny i had better luck selling foraged items and extra artifacts i picked up while diving 

mining is a bit of a nightmare not only is there a good chance that you will encounter a floor with zero ore or resources other than stone on it but sometimes breaking a rock will yield nothing basically just a waste of your energy this is in addition to the fact that if you accidentally swing at air instead of a node you waste energy explosives are a good alternative to manually mining but cost ore to make youre pretty much always going to be running at a deficit of something whether its materials or energy and it just doesnt feel that great 

bskill point systemb
this is unfortunately probably the most pointless system in the game a lot of the perks you can get are either totally irrelevant by the time you unlock them or actually make your life harder for example theres a perk that will give your crops a 10 chance to grow faster except its applied per crop so youll have a ton of crops growing at random speeds which is absolutely annoying then theres the perk to sometimes keep tiles youve watered hydrated into the next day this sounds great but is quickly made obsolete by sprinklers it also doesnt trigger nearly enough to make a difference since i usually ended up watering over that tile anyway once i got an upgraded watering can 

the only perks that seemed worth it were the combat perks flat damage increase and increase to critical hit chance sprint speed and double harvestorecatches everything else was very meh or just frustrating to deal with 

bbugs and localization issuesb
ive heard from a number of people that the translations are very very bad however ive also been told that humble is handling localization so who knows im just going off of what others have told me i play in english and there are tons of grammar spelling and bugged dialog issues sometimes character dialog will display code in place of their script theres also a character that shouts into your eyeballs in all caps except for when he says your name yes yes early access i know but it really makes connecting with characters difficult 

recently there was a bug introduced by a hotfix that deleted everyones inventory this included chests and if you were to log on and save your game you lost everything permanently the devs did a rollback and got most people their stuff back but some people lost important items such as tools that can not be repurchased anywhere forcing them to have to start fresh in addition current patches have made the game extremely laggy for certain players even with graphics set lower than normal coops are also causing crashes upon interaction these issues are honestly what is making me take a break from the game i dont want to suddenly lose all my progress because of something that was supposed to fix another issue 

uh i hit the character limit so i guess ill stop here thanks for reading

#####

steam deck compatible i have yet to have any issues with the gameplay

be sure to edit your steam deck controls first because you will be unable to open your inventoryquestsmap with the initial control settings there are a few control layouts already available to choose from made by the community if you dont want to make your own

i got this game assuming it was stardew valley but with nicer graphics if that was all it was i would have been content so far im actually happy its a lot more than that

while it obviously takes a lot of inspiration from stardew its taken things in its own direction and even managed to make a lot of the basic stardew stuff feel a lot better there are reasons for the island to be run down and to need your help things requiring magical solutions rather than magical solutions being given for what are really just issues of funding most of the time

unfortunately it seems the devs have focused on the stardew aspect over the bits that make their game unique and fun the fact theyve finished the 4 mines before the ocean segment shows this to me the ocean mystery is so much more interesting than the mines especially as they have barely populated the mines the enemies are frankly boring which is sad since the combat feels fairly nice thankfully theyll be advancing the ocean storyline soon

there are also some odd little bits here and there which make me wonder if they are just translation issues like the giants which are on average much smaller than humans and so not giants at all

overall i still think its a good game and i like most of what theyve done i just question some of their choices in terms of priorities

#####

game isnt finished this is the exact same build as early access but they just added a few shirts and rewards in the museum the game is still buggy on pc and consoles have it even worse the fact they scammed people into buying the game by calling it the full release speaks volumes the game is fun and has so much potential but the story is not finished relationships suck no romantic dialogue until literally after marriage you still cant progress past a certain town rank which isnt the max level npc cutscenes are still being added which again means the game isnt finished and bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs if you can deal with various glitches and bugs then play the game but dont get your hopes up with the story because several storylines including the main storyline literally say wip on the quest log i still recommend the game because its a great farming game just not finished they shouldnt call this 10 full release when its literally the early access build seems like a money grab to get money from console players ive bought this game early access on steam and bought it again on ps5 when they announced the 10 full release and was very upset seeing its the exact same buggy incomplete mess shame on the devs

this game will be great unfortunately i got hooked then realized its got a long way to go its basically stardew valley but i prefer the colors and graphics here the mining is not worth itrewarding yet the story threads are not yet complete you cant romance yet festivals arent fully fleshed out

its early access i get it i just got real addicted and then got to the point where i cant do much more yet its incomplete but you can just tell its gonna be perfection just torture waiting now

#####

i think i agree with the general consensus of the comments here i love coral island and whats in the game currently is worth the asking price but calling it complete when there are sections of the game that are currently in the game that are not complete is kind of deceptive

i dont think as some comments do that your kids growing up is a measure of completeness in a farming sim for one thats often not a feature in many other farming sims of this ilk  harvest moonstory of seasons kids only grow up in one or two games of that series i dont think stardew valley kids grow up etc if coral island kids never grow up then thats a design decision the devs make that is actually pretty standard for the genre and id have no problem with that if they decide to give us more great but thats just gravy not the meal

its the merfolk where i have to take issue dont get me wrong the actual story aspects of the merfolk area seem to be done  you can do the whole plot down there its all functional but you cant interact with any of the merfolk meaningfully  you cant give them gifts their hearts are locked so you cant earn affection and either most of them have no dialogue or theyre suffering from a known bug that occasionally afflicts the main townies toocharacter has nothing more to say today either way you can barely converse with them also this is my personal nitpick but im not pleased there is a very eligible bachelor in agung and hes not romanceable if we only got one male and one female merfolk romance option i could understand that but two female options and one male option feels like people who want the masc romance options are being cheated a bit for no reason especially when agung was used to advertise the merfolk alongside a female character who is a romance option  it feels like we were built up for potential merfolk romance with a character who was never actually meant to be on the table compared to the aboveground stuff the sea feels pretty empty

none of this would be an issue with an early access game and frankly i trust the devs to put out the rest of the merfolk content in due time so im not too worried about it i just find it blatantly incorrect to advertise a game experience as complete when you knowingly have incomplete aspects in the game i would either have held off the 10 release until the merfolk were also finished or i would have kept the merfolk area locked off until it was finished so that everything in the game was actually complete i feel like the dev team went with a compromise that unintentionally makes a false promise of a complete experience while there are still incomplete aspects

i love this game and i think everyone should play it i think the only real issue here is the advertising of it not the content thats currently in the game or what hasnt been completed yet the devs have been working hard and releasing updates regularly i have faith the game will be in a state that can genuinely be called complete in a reasonable amount of time i just wish it hadnt been labeled that way earlier than it should have been because its forced people to have to add asterisks to what could otherwise be wholehearted recommendations

note as should not be surprising when major content is still being worked on the game has a number of bugs that need crushing again i have faith in the devs that these will be dealt with but part of the reason these are shocking to see in a game labeled complete is that normally a complete game would have full attention being given to bugs while again coral island still has major updates being worked on so bugcatching is not yet the main focus i personally havent run into any really bad ones others have if this concerns you you may want to hold off a few more patches to get it or at least back up your saves occasionally but ive got nearly 130 hours in this game both before and after 10 release and i havent run into any major bugs so its very possible to play without problems even in the current state just be aware that its not as guaranteed as it would be in any other game marked complete just yet and make your decision accordingly

eta after checking more into the games content i think i may have misconstrued the complaint about kids growing up i thought this meant kids growing into adults which only a few farming sim games most notably harvest moon a wonderful life do but looking at coral island i think the complaints may have been about having babies that justnever leave the baby stage that is definitely not standard and genuinely a little disappointing seeing the unique sprites for your children with specific spouses is one of the only real draws to having kids in these games since childcentric content in farming sims tends to be pretty sparse so i would agree with the complaints after all in that i would at least like your kid to grow up enough to have a distinct appearancepersonality maybe even enough to go to school with the other kids thatd be kind of a time paradox but lets be real i dont think any of us as players are going to care about that plot holes  better ingame content

#####

the potential of this game is astronomical its beautiful as well that being said wait for full release or if you must play sooner wait for a sale

ive finished the story line rather quick mostly drawn out by the massive amounts of grinding the game has currently as of now the characters are rather bland although very easy on the eyes the story is nearly nonexistent though has massive potential cant wait for some backstory and a slice of life update would be nice to interact with thing around town sit on chairs get blurbs of info when snooping through houses and more dialogue its very similar to stardew down to the hat mouse expect its a monkey here but there is only so much a farm sim can do to be different

overall it will be an amazing game but i recommend waiting until full release to spend your money

#####

over 300 hours in coral island in ea so far fantastic game highly recommend there is tons of content already in the game and 10 coming real soon the love for the game these devs have shines out farming is incredible decorating is amazing the npcs characters and story lines are so in depth each having personalitiesrelationshipsconflicts etc truly incredible game the graphics are beautiful sounds effects are great going through each season is wonderful and feels like each one has a different purposenew things to growplantexplore  the eventsfestivals are loads of fun there is so many different things you can do each in game day without being forced to do one or the other bug catchingfishingmining and more pets to adopt well worth the price i never get bored with coral island and i was so happy  with the addition so far of the 2 dlcs for a charity event so we could help something so important   massive thumbs up to the coral island team fantastic game

uinformationu
     game autosaves when players character sleeps in their bed
     when the players character runs out of stamina they do not faint but instead the screen turns gray and they walk iveryi slowly unable to take any further action
     at 2 am if the players character hasnt gone to bed yet theyll be automatically teleported there and itll transition to the next day only half of their stamina will be restored 
     gameplay involves farming woodcutting mining foraging scything collecting fishing diving combat crafting cooking bugcreature catching social affection increasing minigames and unlocking new areas
     technically theres no difficulty setting for combat ibuti one can elect to have hit to aggro meaning the enemies dont attack until the players character does combat is very easy and might be a bit boring for those who want challenging enemies 
     player can unlock fast travel points after advancing to a certain point in the games story then unlock imorei points as more things are achieved in the game
     npcs can only be gifted items twice within a game week with the exception of if their birthday falls on that week 
     players character can date all romanceable candidates at once but can only marry one 
     players character and spouse can have two children of unknown gender
     the beginning of the game has a very basic selection of clothes and furniture but after increasing the towns rank ieach timei the selection gets new items the towns rank can be improved 5 times 
     the museum wants bugs fish sea creatures critters gems artifacts and fossils 
     a ps controller works for most of the game but i found a need to use the mouse when 1 buying naming and placing farm animals 2 placing buildings on the farm and 3 decorating the house

upraisesu
     nine languages supported thats a lot of languages for an indie game 
     accessibility options for dyslexia and colorblindness in game settings
     sort of genderneutral body type in character customization along with mx honorific 
     several afrotextured hairstyles in character customization 
     biga map to explore with several places to unlock including a whole underwater map
     after achieving certain things for the merfolks the players character can obtain a merfolk transformation for underwater only of course which allows the character to move much faster under water but also has the lovely effect of playing disneys ithe little mermaidi songs in the players head 
     town map has all the shopestablishment hours listed so the player doesnt waste any time having their character go all the way over to a location to check if theyre open 
     everything is very detailed and visually appealing my favorite was definitely the games version of halloween aka spooky festival because the decorations were really awesome 
     ia loti of characters and romance options 28 there is bound to be at least one character that appeals to you if youre into that aspect of the game i know i had trouble choosing who to marry because i liked several different characters 
     excellent diversity not just regarding raceheritage but also other social minority groups nonbinary rep thicc rep disabled rep 
     items are clearly labeled what theyre for and whether or not theyve been donated to the museum or used as an offering 
     a metric fckton of adorable pets to adopt all with their own unique portrait art and everything lots of cats and dogs with a couple of bunnies and foxes and one lizard 
     strong messages of environmentalism with undertones of anticapitalism 
     a lot of indonesian and other southeast asian island cultural references

ucomplaintsu
     actions expend stamina even if they dont hit thus say your character misses hitting a weed with the scythe it drains stamina anyway 
     bug report noahs quest bonfire has trouble triggering after doing an internet search it seems that for most people the scene triggers at complete random rather than when its supposed to a day after receiving his letter and it did eventually trigger for me but a ilong timei after
     bug report according to the official wiki noahs 8th heart event is supposed to trigger outside the tavern between 1800 and 2100 but the event triggered for me at 920 am  
     possible bug report according to the official wiki ninas 8th heart event is supposed to be able to be triggered between 900 and 2000 which is odd given that her invitation for a dinner party mentions tonight sure enough the event cant be triggered until 1800 and either the official wiki has a typo or the time in the game is bugged 
     bug report i couldnt get the second part of leahs 6th heart event to trigger checked both the official and unofficial wiki for info to make sure i was doing things right i just dunno what was going on with that steam discussions didnt have any helpful suggestions i eventually gave up 
     bug report while trying to make spider tempura for some reason the bmagnolia green jumperb does not qualify despite the recipe saying any spider
     bug report mangoes cant be gifted or handed over for an errand 
     known bug report sometimes machines dont release the finished item for example my aging barrel wouldnt release wine that i made the first time i ever made some according to other players sometimes restarting the game fixes it and it did for me you icani save by ending the day itheni restart from the title screen if you dont want to lose progress it makes no difference 
     the player doesnt get to choose their characters own background story occasionally their character receives letters from their grandmother talking about family life back home as someone who has severed ties with her parents i found those elements of the game really cringey 
     only ionei pet can be adopted i really hope that changes in the future it seems like a waste given how many adorable pets there are at the shelter 
     occasional typos 

bimportant noteb this game is technically still unfinished despite being out of early access it is complete in that it has reached all of the ioriginali goals promised for the kickstarter but a lot of iadditionali content still awaits the devs have a roadmap posted on their official site listed below and as of when this review was posted still plan to add multiplayer features more merfolk storyline merfolk relationshipsromance child growthdialogue savannah access and several other misc additions 
bis the game playable without the additional contentb
yes the game is playable and still fun but unlocking the merfolk kingdom is a bit empty when no one can be talked to or befriended there one of the goddesss rewards is savannah access which the player cannot receive right now supposedly the giants storyline is also tied in with the savannah area so thats unfinished 
but if want to get to the fun by all means go for it you wont be able to get all the achievements but theres still plenty of fun to be had i have over 200 hours on this game iwithouti the additional content so theres still iplentyi to do in the game you can always come back to the game once the rest of the content is out as well

coral island is a love letter to the farm sim game genre if you like harvest moon stardew valley rune factory dinkum etc youll enjoy this game ive followed this game since its kickstarter and the devs have always delivered im quite happy with their roadmap and cannot wait for 10 release kickstarter reward delivery i do believe this game will continue to be updated and worked on over the years to come 

the good the qol impovements are absolutely amazing this game was really thought out well the graphics are lovely the npcs are great and interesting and theres so many of them i love diving and cleaning the ocean i like the bug catching and fishing systems 

needs improvement patch times currently are awful combat is a little 1 dimensional but that will be overhauled in an update i sometimes struggle to get my character to hit the correct object and i randomly turn around a few bugs like these i think will be fixed if they arent already 

the setting is really amazing i love the animal and crop variety the npc variety and the environments there is a decent story line with a nice mystery attached to it more to come in upcoming patches

this review was written in early access some features have changed since v1o has been released take this review with a grain of salt

i want to love coral island i really do i backed it in kickstarter been beta testing it and ive seen it come a long way the art style is gorgeous the music is great some of the events are interesting and the townsfolks dialogue for them is fun some parts of the game i have a ton of fun with like the diving but other parts make me feel like playing the game isnt worth it

the mines are so tedious it makes me want to give up because theres so little reward for all that you do in there the rng with ore mob drops and geodes is abysmal youll go through the entire mine and get one or two mob drops you need for one of the bundles the ore is a bit easier because you can find one vein per level and leave because there wont be more than those few nodes from what ive seen

the dialogue feels clunky in some parts and other parts there simply isnt enough especially for heart events it feels like i get one or two lines of dialogue for working so hard to level up friendship with everyone 

the minigames are hard and some make no sense with the controls  looking at you ring toss  the fishing is difficult while i find it fun there are a ton of people who cant fish because of disabilities and cant complete bundles and the museum because of it i have carpel tunnel and other problems and i can hardly play coral island more than an hour or two before it really wears me down

there is a lot of confusion whether or not there will be accessibility features as the devs have stated that they will work on it when they get time but its been asked of for two years and no one on the dev team seems to want to talk about the elephant in the room

edit accessibility features to the mini games there is an accessibility tab where you are able to change a number of things including font hud size and different color blind options i dont want to fault them for where they did good and i apologize for making it seem that way

machines feel like a waste some machines you can only put three to five items in and it makes the game slog on for much longer than it should because you usually need a ton of those items for qol craftables  coal and glass for bombs and vortex bombs are so useful when my hands get tired 

with the way things are i dont see myself picking up coral island for a while every time i boot up the game now that i finished diving i stare at my farm and wonder why im playing when everything i do takes so much time it feels more like a relief instead of a reward

the game doesnt feel finished the content that ive been excited for releases in 2024 with the price increase and the fact that they will be updating the game for a while i would wait to buy this game until its closer to completion

nov 17th update from playing a few hours i can see a lot of the problems still persist dialogue still feels crunchy the mines still feel like a chore there is a single ore vein with a few nodes of resources per level if youre lucky and mob drops are still abysmal theres no saveauto save which can be annoying but the fact that the game crashes so much at the moment makes you lose hours of progress randomly 

it really feels like the game is still in betaearly access and i still cant see myself picking it up seriously for a while 

#####

buyer beware this is being called a 10 release or full release but it isnt there is still a lot of important content missing from this game before it can be considered a full release if you progress in the games two major stories you will literally reach a point where it cant advance because its just not in the game yet the pet system is very incomplete you can have children but they cant grow yet we are still missing dating mechanics 

make no mistake this will be a great game when it is actually finished however do not be fooled by it being advertised as 10 or full release when its more akin to early access getting a major update my recommendation is play one of the other many cozy games that are complete and come back in 2024 once this game is actually ready

#####

stardew valley sandrock and animal crossing all mixed into onequite addictive

#####

dyslexic font this review is a little different than most i have loved the game so far and the biggest thing to me is something i found in the settings for accessibility this game has brought to my attention something that i did not know existed and profoundly has changed part of my life in the accessibility settings there is something called dyslexic font which i never knew existed i am dyslexic and i cannot tell you how much of a difference this font has made after changing the settings to use this font i literally got emotional while reading it was almost effortless which reading has never been for me i dont know if this is something i would find in other games maybe ive just never paid attention but coral island was the one that helped me find it and so i want to sing their praises humble games i would like to thank you so much from the bottom of my heart for adding this

#####

its just stardew valley

coral islands a farm simulation game thats still in development as i write this your character moves to a tropical island where they start running a farm and get involved in the lives of the depressed locals as a soulless corporation tries to buy up the island

just like in stardew valley

you go into caves in the woods near your house to fight monsters and dig up metal to upgrade your tools or geodes that you take to the local blacksmith to break open and reveal treasures

just like in stardew valley

theres an empty museum its up to you to refill by finding jewels and ancient artifacts

just like in stardew valley

theres a supernatural helper wholl open new areas or unlock extra features after you give them all the things in certain groups of items they ask you to find

just like in stardew valley

theres a festival where you can get free friendship points with everybody in town if you add something really tasty to the potluck soup

just like in stardew valley

the highest upgrade for your tools is made with a magic purple metal

just like in stardew valley

swinging farm tools uses up energy but swinging swords mysteriously doesnt

just like in stardew valley

the general stores closed on wednesday

just like in stardew valley

basically its stardew valley with better art and a few areas where they go one step farther like besides fishing theres also a bugcatching feature or like how sv talked about mermaids living near the beach this game lets you go scuba diving and actually meet them

but me ive already played the hell out of stardew valley im not super excited by a game that obviously took all its cues from a game ive already played the hell out of

if you liked stardew valley but wished there was a bit more content or a few more romance options this is the perfect game for you it does what im sure it set out to do and it does do it pretty well this is a good farmlife sim game with a lot of things to check out

but if you were satisfied with the game this is based on and already sunk hundreds of hours into that like i was coral islands just more of the same

#####

add gamepad controller asappppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp pleaseeeee

edit 23042023

im glad i can change my review to positive after some time devs did a good job with working on most of the issues i had at the beginning the game is finally ready to be called early access there are still some bugs animations object clippings no icons etc but its fully playable and not disappointing im having lots of fun this time thank you 


it took me some time to decide whether i want to rate this game positive or negative but as a game developer myself i think itll be way more reasonable to give this title a thumb down for now

tldr  as most of the negatives say it has potential and beautiful artstyle but thats all for now



im a kickstarter backer i was super excited to back the game and i was actively waiting looking at the devs updates etc the 2d artstyle  stunning the ui  absolutely beautiful and then i got the game super hyped and gave it a huge chance as i spent almost 20 hours in it on one save in 2 or 3 days

as for 3 years of production kickstarter page says the work started in oct 2019 16mln  on kickstarter and more than 20 devs working on the title i would expect way way more and ill list down the reasons why

1 the game is very demolike in current state theres a lot of content lacking and its funny because the game lacks details that you get at the beginning of the gameplay like you enter the mines fight the first monster and the dropped item doesnt have a model you pick it up  oh its a slime goo cool its got an icon it couldve been literally a purple orb and it would be ok but no its just a placeholder model for every lacking drop in game orb with game logo texture

2 as everyone already said  its a stardew valley copy and i would be okay with that but ive got another problem with this aspect the devs decided to copy the storyline from sd  ok they didnt have to invest this much time in thinking about some mechanics because they were already created in sd but what did they invest this time in then i cant find a thing its ridiculous how the game lacks basic things like simple models but its got hyperrealistic shader on the surfaces to show its raining you can even see the raindrops in water but then you go chop the tree and see your character behave like its made out of rubber while holding an axe and literally glitching their head into the tree some effortinvestment decisions went definitely wrong here

3 tutorial doesnt explain anything theres a lot of things i didnt know how to do and another couple things that i knew how to do just because i played stardew valley and remembered the mechanics how do i fish in this game it took me a lot of time to realise how its so unintuitive i had to discover it by accident but i literally put my fishing rod into chest after couple tries and took it out after a whole season to give it another try waited stupidly for something to happen and oh boi it seemed to work

4 the game isnt really encouraging me to interact with villagers theyre pretty i love the illustrations concepts and stuff but yeah i can feel no difference if i speak to them or not just whatever i can live my own farmer weirdo life without speaking to a single person for whole season

5 a lot of content not implemented and the game isnt even informing you about it i just got to know about some of the mechanics not being implemented yet because i read one of the negative reviews i thought i missed something and needed to unlock for example ii tier of skills now i know that the devs didnt even add this yet cool

6 the graphics well yeah the 2d art is beautiful the icons so cute the 3d for environment and animals its okay but the characters hmmm some of them dont look like their portraits id say i was sometimes shocked its the same character when i clicked to speak with them

7 and speaking of which the villagers portraits theyre beautiful the artstyle is so pretty so the thing i have to ask why are they so unpolished its ingame content and its one of the first things i noticed a lot of strokes outside the lineart artworks being weirdly sketchy in comparison to super clean and smooth ui also pixelated scalling of character portraits in calendar so disappointing as its not a thing that takes a lot of time to polish

8 the animations are poor as i mentioned earlier they need a lot of polishing

summary
having in mind that its early access not demo that the game is 25 that it made 16mln  on kickstarter that its produced for 3 years now that theres so many devs working on it
i must say the only great thing is the ui not ux but yeah the ui is clean pretty and theres nothing i can complain about i could learn a lot as a uiux designer myself thanks jonathan as it says on stairway page ui artist and the icons super cute and the animals models also super cute

i dont mind it being strongly inspired by stardew valley as it has some unique content and vibes which i really enjoy but all the other things make it just so disappointing and hard to enjoy

other things need to be polished a lot before i give it another chance right now id say its unplayable to get a full game experience its in the stage where it should be shown to qa team not for ea backers people who paid for the game

#####

i am really enjoying this game but i also find the incompleteness of it frustrating  i understand that its in early access but its still extremely incomplete  i am looking forward to when its done because i think its still way too early to even be considered early access right now  more like alpha or beta testing

#####

in beta test 262hrs
im totally in love with the game its not my first farming game and im sure it wont be my last there is so much to do its insane i should point out the bias if youve played stardew and the like youll know the mechanics of this game loved stardew but the coral island graphics wow love them 
im not sure what the learning curve of this game is just because its not my first rodeo but there is nothing i havent explored im literally just sitting on my hands waiting for the next update which looks absolutely stunning btw 

so would i recommend short answer  yes im so excited that i backed this early longer answer  as long as you are going in with your eyes open that this game isnt complete youll have a blast hitting development walls can be frustrating but its completely worth it and i literally cant wait for whats next gods how many hours am i going to end up playing this game

#####

coral island is harvest moon story of seasons stardew valley and a tiny bit of animal crossing all in one  this game has surpassed my expectations and i have a lot of faith in what will come in the near future coral island is worth trying out if you have enjoyed some of the previous game titles ive listed above the game is in early access at this time so there arent many things available compared to the full game

coral island is awesome the graphics are beautiful there is a lot of townsfolk that are diverse i feel like this is the modern version of stardew valley with a twist of the island life coral island is a breath of fresh air with uptodate beauty

my favorite feature is time adjustment sometimes playing farming simulation games can feel very quick the day feels like 5 minutes and it doesnt seem like you can get a lot done but you have the option of going the intended time or slowing it down by as much as 50 i recommend doing so at the very beginning because it is encouraged to get to know the island and meet your neighbors i also enjoy that the map is fully loaded in no more running away from the farm and into the void waiting for the game to load a different section of the island and that makes me happy the map will feel overwhelming huge because everything is loaded in so again slowing down the time even by 10 or 20 will help you do have access to a map everything about this game is smooth and i am loving it this game hasnt crashed on me and i have everything at the highest speed 

if you are feeling conflicted on deciding to purchase coral island while in early access then i hope i can stir you in the right direction it all depends on your motive if you are interested in datingmarrying festivals or story completion then i would recommend you to hold off until after there has been a few updates because the game is in early access a lot of things wont be available so if you want a more fullgame experience then i suggest being patient

 if you are interested in the overall gameplay farming fishing ranching etc then i recommend buying the game there is plenty to do

farming there are seasonal seeds that you can buy there isnt much to farming it is the usual till plant and water then sleep and repeat there are other things you can do while you wait for your crops to grow

foraging as you walk around the island you will notice flowers mushrooms and other plants like such that grows around the island make sure to pick them up i didnt focus on that too much but some of the items come in clutch when you need a bit of energyhealth to continue through the day without landing in the clinic

ranching starting off buying a coop or a barn will be a bit expensive so i recommend fishing and farming to rack in the money and once youve got that rolling you can invest in barns and coops ranching seems like the way to fortune at the moment it may be a slow start but it will pay off

mining i have enjoyed mining in all farming simulations but this is definitely my favorite like stardew valley the mines have monsters that resides within i am not sure whether its because the game is in early access but as of right now there are two different monsters that can spawn what i appreciate the most is that in other games it can get so overwhelming with a big number of monsters to fight off when trying to mine you wont get swarmed unless you go running around each monster like livebait

diving i love everything about deep diving going under the water is so beautiful this feature wowed me so much in the water you are supposed to heal coral sites but there are things you can find you can mine rocks collect trash make the enviroment better and catch creatures

fishing fishing in this game is not too hard in my opinion it isnt hard at all once you get used to the mechanics fishing is a great source of income while you wait for your plants to grow especially in the summer time you will thank me later

catching you can catch a variety of bugs in this game there are two ways that you can catch bugs you can sneak or you can dash without it noticing with the dashing it could a bit of a risk of spooking the critters but with practice you can get it done i personally dont go out my way to catch bugs it usually happens when i am foraging at the time or travelling across the island for whatever reason

all in all i love this game and to think there is a lot more coming to coral island makes this purchase so much worth having i love this game and i cant wait for the next update

#####

i love harvestmoon
i love stardew valley
i love animal crossing
all in one in coral island love it
add some more unique coral island feature rather than just copying existing games
spoiler and pls add multiplayer spoiler

this cute little game has big ambitions and honestly it could be a good game even in its early access
it even could be a great game
the atmosphere and mechanics from the games it draws inspiration from harmonise well feel like they belong together nothing clashes or tries to steal the spotlight
it is being updated regularly it has gone through a lengthy alpha phase before being released so surely all the game breaking stuff is gone right
it is a game that only needs more content and polish to be ready for an awesome release right

well let me tell you about my past three months with this game

all is well in the beginning new game new adventure
launched the game got through the intro started getting to know everyone did some basic farming work i am having a blast
until a few hours later the game started freezing during the only save point the game has when your day ends and you go to sleep
the first time after waiting for 10 minutes task manager no jutsu managed to save the day
next time it happened i lost the day and had to redo the entire cherry blossom potluck
crashes became more and more frequent loss of progress became more and more frequent
i did the tree planting festival four times before it finally managed to advance
since then i am stuck on day 24
the games crash log generator has yet to succeed making a crash log
its been me trying every couple of weeks for three months and some game patches now

both people on the community hub and i still have the same issue
the game was in alpha in 15 months and is now in early access for almost 8
and still people lose their progress with some having to keep separate backups of their save files because they just can corrupt over time

i am sorry but this game should have stayed in alpha if something as basic and essential as saving correctly does not work i could have understood that after hundreds of days and tens of thousands of crops and other items this could happen but after just a few hours

it is such a shame because the game is really really fun otherwise

#####

if you are a fan of stardew valley then youll love this game  please be aware that this game is still very much in development  there are some bugs and there are some areas that are not available in the current build  i cant wait to see this game continue to grow

#####

20 hours in no bugs or crashes

if you loved stardew valley who didnt this game is very much inspired by that and might be for you

runs on the steam deck at around 5060 fps now to figure out a better set up for the controls

when i first started playing coral island i named my farm and my chicken after my cat chimcken nuggers i played the game for few hours but due to the bugs i encountered i decided to just wait for the games full release this year my cat died and ive been since very depressed shes a pandemic baby she kept us sane during tough times my pride and joy the day she left was the most painful day of my life

one day i felt like playing coral island again and i accidentally pet my chicken twice a message poppedup saying chimcken is feeling happy today i was surprised i cried i was happy and sad at the same time

i continued playing coral island a lot and named all my farm animals after our pets and my passed cats nicknames it makes me happy that the game is telling me theyre happy today and ive been working hard to earn money ingame to give them a better life a beautiful farm my cats passing still pains me but im just grateful i have coral island with me right now i love the games art i love that we can decorate our farm and house i just hope they add more options when decorating as its sometimes hard to put stuff my towns rank is currently b and im waiting for the new animals to come 

so far this game has brought me joy and has supported me during the day when i feel extremely sad

#####

as no one is gonna read my review anyway this game made me find out that i am a lesiban and im going to cook myself into chaems heart 

#####

i got this game in early access and really enjoyed playing it there were a few bugs but the story was good and the bugs were manageable

i was a bit surprised when they announced full launch as the game is no where near finished in my opinion compared to what was promised on their kickstarter page i was most looking forward to having the kids grow up and the island hopping backer goals considering the kickstarter raised 16m i was at least expecting the kids grow up backer goal to be in the main game for launch

i am looking forward to see what is to come but advise holding off spending money on this game at full price at least until it is a bit more fleshed out with some more of the original backergoals achieved

combines the best of animal crossing museum collection with stardew valley cave system farming ranching community centre packages and shares the important message of cleaning the ocean without being as insufferable as most green advocates

#####

this game is so good i didnt refund it after finding out it was on game pass 1010

also those complaining about the pride flag you should probs go outside

#####

i would recommend this game to those who love the story of season sequels
what i love about this game are 
 good graphic eq i love the detail that developers added to the crops moving and shaking while we were walking or watering them
 good music of course
 lots of sexy npc characters for the story of season kinda game i mean like damn not gonna lie abt that
 the detail of npcs routine i found that they were doing yoga volleyball fishing etc
 and also i love the rain graphic when the rain hits the wooden board near the beach or hits the roof so real the board and the roof look so wet like its something real

and people what i love most is that indonesian made the game and as an indonesian as well i am so proud for this game proud of their work all we need is the complete version hope they will release it soon enough i cant wait

#####

this game is a love letter to stardew valley the way stardew valley was a love letter to harvest moon coral island truly captures what makes this genre and stardew in particular so fun and engaging a lot of love and time has been spent on the environment characters activities diving and core gameplay loop everything about this game is genuinely fun the combat the farming activities the bug catching the diving getting to know the townspeople especially uncovering the lore behind the island much like the secret notes in stardew they made a very smart move here by tying the lore into the core gameplay loop with raising the towns ranking by performing activities such as diving donating to the museum and restoring the islands status by donating items to the goddess and completing bundles fast travel anyone youll find lots of interesting additions here that feel like stardew and animal crossing combined into one ultimate form  besides diving and bug catching check out the laboratory in town as soon as it becomes available to you youll find some very neat things at this vendor i can assure you to boot the game devs appear very involved in their creation and the roadmap appears solid i have absolutely fallen in love with coral island its residents the music and the experience there is not a more sincere and heartfelt love letter to stardew and this genre out there if youre thinking of giving it a chance then i encourage you to take the plunge youll find that this island is a home away from home much like another farm i know

#####

let me premise this not recommended with a big not yet

reason i do not recommend
nothing is finished nothing

expanded
there is no way to play this game without encountering a road block be it festivals mining farming animals romance and relationships the new diving feature animations building crafting quests etc just as an example i needed hay for my animals and built a mill to make hay except the mill is not fully implemented and doesnt work without a silo this was an extra week in game to get all the required materials for the silo so effectively the mill is useless without the silo this is not the only instance where something is useless or not fully implemented i do not feel this game was ready for ea as not one single aspect of the game is complete 

reasons i say not yet
the game is inclusive lgbtq friendly and diverse characters
the road map assuming its followed promises a really good game
i am excited for various aspects to be fully implemented such as diving which is a new feature to the farming genre
the characters are absolutely amazing and i want to get to know each one of them
the map is really well designed and im enjoying learning to get around it

expanded
there is not one aspect of this game that is missing that im not looking forward to i may be written off as impatient but i really do love the premise of this game as a nonbinary player the ability to choose a nonbinary character option really stood out to me the characters are all unique within the game and i immediately fell for the shut in computer nerd again how ever im also going to have to make many saves because i absolutely love the majority of the romance options honestly this game has some of the best offerings in terms of romance options that ive seen the bones that have been released are good bones theyre just lacking a certain meat that i would expect from a new game to the genre lovers of the genre myself included will probably spend hours playing the unfinished game because it contains the basics of what a farminglife sim is but im concerned about people who are new to the genre and are met with an entirely unfinished product

stardew meets animal crossing with hot singles in your area

recommended but id like to see more

i consider myself a connoisseur of the farming simulation genre to the point where i amaze myself by how snobbish i can be sometimes  never letting my overly critical point of view spoil the fun for me all that i am going to write in this review comes from a place of love for the genre and immense respect for the creators

i find no point in giving feedback on matters that will be improved along the way such as bugs glitches and lack of animations for an early access game the community is vibrant and it constantly provides the necessary information for such imperfections to be fixed over time

however what bothered me as a person in love with the genre was that the story mechanics and gameplay did not shy away from outright copying a prominent giant in the farming sim universe stardew valley coral island fixed many things that i consider flawed when it comes to stardew valley while simultaneously using the exact same formula for other aspects with minimum to no changes

a big aspect of the farming simulator genre at least for me is the community aspect building a farm raising animals and planting crops doesnt mean much when you have no one to share them with this is one of the many reasons i consider rune factory 4 the best choice when it comes to modern farming sims simply because the characters feel like breathing living individuals  members of a community i can help to improve the quality of life its a saviors complex at its finest i know coral island nearly nailed that aspect the characters are fun to be around the character portraits are stylish and generally pleasant to the eye and i actually care about getting to know them  which is a huge improvement from stardew valleys npcs whom i purposely avoided as i consider them hollow husks of what could have been lovely people in a small community in the middle of nowhere however i will admit that there were so many characters in coral island that they were incredibly hard to keep track of overwhelming me on my first few days when getting to know them

as much as it pains me to say there were one too many similarities with stardew valley to the point of throwing me off without spoiling anything for the average reader the storyline at least in its current state follows an identical formula to that of stardew valleys similarly there are some gameplay aspects that simply do not add to the overall experience  why are there three types of trees that produce three types of seeds why can i tap said three types of trees for their three types of syrups  some choices feel mindless to me which certainly is not the case having seen the passion behind the production of this game

all of this boils down to the fact that if i wanted to play a 4k version of stardew valley well i would not play it mostly because i do not care about stardew valley in comparison to other choices in the farming sim universe i am a minority and i am well aware of this fact but even without being invested in stardew valley it is hard to ignore that it constructed a very concrete formula that works wonders for it but feels weird and alien when it gets implemented in an entirely different game studio and overall universe

the islandtropical setting is not something new to the genre but i would love to see coral island implement features that one can find only in said environment instead of copying aspects from stardew valley inspiration is important but it needs to come from multiple sources in order to be constructive and helpful 

i love to see such a wonderful community work on a game like this and i cannot wait to see what the full version will have to offer

#####

you have 500 played hours in stardew valley you wish you could play it for the first time again or maybe you wish it had more brown people enter coral island

#####

stardew valley in 3d

#####

i want to quit my job and just keep playing

#####

long story short that what is in the game is pretty but unfinished

long story long  i knew it was early access but i admit to being annoyed with the current state of the game i am in a near constant state of confusion on what to do and how to do things and then having to google the problem and learn that it was not implemented yet then why do i receive mail for it example you get a letter that you have unlocked sheep but they are not actually in the game yet you get dialogue that you should put something in the potluck but it is not actually implemented yet you get story quests that are actually impossible to complete right now but you wont know this unless you actively google it which is just straight up annoying to me  it looks beautiful but the things that are already in the game are just not finished like certain furniture or clothing items that you can buy but not yet display or wear i dont understand why they put it in the game already to begin with it is annoying to spend money on a lamp just to learn that the item is broken and you cannot actually put it in your house yet if something isnt going to work yet then dont add it to the game yet i rather have 10 furniture pieces in the game that actually work as intended over having 50 of them and most of them not actually working 

as of today i am not aware of a date for when they expect to finish the game and frankly it could be years from now
i have all confidence that the game once completed will be amazing but at the same time i regret buying it this early

#####

i have poured so many hours into this game  it is truly everything i want in a cozy game  farming mining fishing catching etc  its got it all  the visuals are stunning  the island is breathtaking and you can see the fine details when visiting npcs houses  

that being said it is not complete  the storyline is nowhere near done and there are far too many bugs  dont get me started on the inability to save as we want to  it has crashed on me multiple times and i lost a full days worth of work  it crashed even after saving and did not save the 10k i had made  things go missing when trying to decorate the house  mermaids have no storyline  you cant interact more with your husband  the babys room cannot be decorated  babies cant be held and interacted with  they do not grow beyond being a baby in a crib

even though it had these many problems and frustrations it is still a delightful game if you are willing to put up with it  

i am now at a point where it is getting boring because the storyline isnt going further and i feel like i am in a rinse and repeat phase  so i am putting this aside for now and hopefully soon the devs will release the full game

#####

so for everyone saying this is a copy of stardew valley stardew valley is a copy of harvest moon please grow up

the game is heavily inspired on stardew though from the layout of the map placement of things how the game works etc the plot is way better written and less silly theres a lot more characters to interact like a lot theres a lot of menus that tells you everything you need you can see a lot of different sprites as soon as you unlock them the farming system is like stardew but better not only you reach farther but theres a lot here that only eixsts in stardew if you add mods which is nice

for a game not yet complete i feel it has a lot of stuff already finished the map system is very well done the fishing is easy and interesting but not absurdly boring or difficult there are more things such as bug catching the museum actually makes sense the community center actually works and its not delapidated the core concepts stardew has this game have too but the game feels more organic with less loading screens and its beautiful in its own right

in the end comparing them and saying what is better is just like trying to compare factorio with satisfactory with dyson sphere program the three games are essentially copies from eachother but all of them have its own differences making them unique and interesting to play

if you like stardew you will love this


this game is also lgbtq friendly and thats awesome representation is important especially in a small community like this game depicts
i know theres a lot to unpack here but i can say this i have 10 days ingame and that took me 5 hours take that as you wish but the game is good interesting and has a lot of mechanics stardew doesnt and those mechanics and new concepts make this game stand on its own 

do not think youre buying a 3d stardew valley youre buying a game that plays similar and has similar mechanics and setup but in the end you are playing a different game made with a different budget and with a different art style in mind and frankly it was time for us to have some 3d farming games it took way too long for other games to appear 

i totally reccomend it buy it play it if you dont like refund it
just a heads up the three hours limit may feel waaaaay shorter you will fall in love with the game pretty fast

#####

buyer beware calling this game version 10 is disingenuous at best much of the content that was implied throughout early access has now been pushed to post release with no obligation to deliver it this is version 05205 will a few weeks of polish

see that awesome looking savannah at 230 in the 10 trailer thats just one of the many things that is not in the game

#####

game is good so definitely a recommend but im terrible at reviews so heres my adhd ricochet review list in no particular order
list
     graphics good
     amount of npcs great
     things to do good
     optimization of harvestingwaterfarming in general terrible it bugs me so much
     b island b size great
     town size bad theres just too much wasted space
     individual building design great but it really bugs me that nothing feels like it belongs together and holy cow why does every house inside look like its a multi million dollar interior with modern ascetics
     what do you the devs have against apartments why them peeps gotta live at the inn call it what it is
     the island looks completely unnatural like every thing looks great individually but for a game that wants to use the environment as the main plot device it sure doesnt look natural in the first place
     eldritch horrors coming from the ocean amazing
     scythe use great
    character customization awesome but needs more face and eye shapes
     could use better price balancing between sell and buy prices of items vs farmed goods i feel like i sell my stuff for too little compared to the price of things
list

that is all for now thank you

#####

from the moment i bought this game i have no regrets playing it 90 hours in and im still not bored yet

what this game offers
1 plenty of npcs interesting dialogues and heart events
2 farming fishing diving mining catching bugs and even adopting pets
3 designing my entire farm landscape and the interior of my home
4 monthly seasonal events festival games and shops

absolutely recommended

#####

the game has gone from early access til 10 release way to soon its still only about half way done

#####

exactly the harvest moonstory of seasonslost in bluestardew valley mix ive been hoping for

#####

i really love this game because it has almost everything i dreamt about my old time fav harvestmoon i wish the developer will always develop this game with love i wish you success and full of joy

#####

take this as more of a wait and see im clickbaiting this as negative so people will actually read it

10 is a misnomer this is more of a 08 release the bones are great wonderful art style tons of stuff to do in theory charming conservationfocused story generally interesting characters and why are so many of them stupid hot

the problem is that tons of player complaints have gone mostly ignored since beta lots of issues of accessibility and qol in the gameplay loop such as minigames being very difficult for those who cant click fast or inability to just type in how much of an item we want to buy these are things that have been talked about by users for months and have yet to be addressed 

theres also a general polish issue lots of typos and bugs nothing on the level of the horror shows youve heard about this year but it gets noticeable pretty quick it also shows in the general lack of balance in unlocks stuff that should clearly be unlocked at a lower or higher level given the stuff its needed for hardwood being the main example unlocked way too late these are yet more things that have been talked about by users for months with no address to the complaints

basically my advice is give it a few months to see if they iron out the issues or just keep plugging along adding more stuff to do if they go with the first path then ill be able to change my review to a glowing positive one which i really hope they do

#####

i honestly love this game and am addicted to it there is a lot of potential waiting to be used to make a wonderful game the island the mermaids the people and their stories the mermaids the cute animals and great farming and of course the underwater part with mermaids

however
there are a few bugs and details in the story that just make it hard for me sometimes i think the worst thing for me is how loveless the cutscenes feel i get that some do not contain the players presence to show how life on the island goes on  even if we arent part of it those are great and i appreciate them but the ones where we partake especially the later heart scenes just feel weird like nothing in these scenes makes me feel like i form a bond with the characters nothing even insinuates that they started to develop feelings for me until i proposed and gave them a locket then the heartscene before marriage arrives  absolutely wonderful go for mark because holy f and then no cute interactions no further dates nothing why i am dating them they said they liked me why does it not feel like that at all where is the worry mark has for the player being safe if he does not speak to me sometimes
and why is this a supposed full release if there is no completed story

its just really sad because i play games like these primarily for the villager interactions and they just have no consequences for my life on the island at all even after being married my partner can stop talking to me or get angry for no reason what is that supposed to be about 
also the thought that all those issues will be fixed one day just for me to have to restart the game because i did not get to experience those improved thingsfrustrating

i love the game but i have to think of it as early access this is not a full experience play it if you wish and have fun bc it is really fun but do keep in mind that it can be disheartening at times

#####

you say this is a stardew valley ripoff i say stardew valley is harvest moon ripoff

#####

this game has blown me away the amount of things to still unlock is unreal this really isnt my kind of game but yeah i highly recommend it

#####

theres a lot of potential and theyre promising much so im excited to see what kind of game coral island will be at full version release i am really hoping to see the devs actively polish the existing content in between content updates ive encountered several minor bugs and typos although none that hindered my progress in any meaningful way 

while i recommend it especially for people who love stardew valley do be aware that theres a lot of content still missing from the game but you probably know that already since youre considering buying an early access game

#####

i absolutely adore this game but there are a few things id like to point out for anyone just in case its something its not your cup of tea

pros 
 absolutely stunning character art and diversity this is one of the few games ive truly felt like the inclusivity wasnt forced or anything the characters are all done so well with an amazing amount of story and art overall i just adore the designs and how well they fit with the game it doesnt feel preachy or half hearted like some game companies cough hoyoverse cough 
 the storyline and game play are also really fun before anyone says oh but its repetitive yeah buddy its a farming and cozy game thats the gameplay get it through your head the range of plants you can get is super cool and its something i havent seen in other farming games such as stardew or sun haven 
 the bits of culture from south east and south asia are so heartwarming to see as someone from that area it feels incredible to finally see something familiar in a game the npc giants and the mermaids are all designed beautifully and i adore how the royal family of the mermaids are based off of asian folklore 
 also compared to other games i feel like it isnt as grindy the prices for upgrades arent atrocious and neither are the requirements for upgrading 
 they say excuse me when you block their path idk why i like that so much i just think its cute 

cons 
 after being married your spouse will only mention the marriage for the first few days and then it just kinda stops i feel a bit saddened with the romance because i was hoping for more interactions and dialouges but it just got left you dont have the option to kiss your spouse as far as im aware in game unlike stardew they also just kinda revert back to old dialouge after a while 
 theres this weird glitch where you can see the production icons during loading screens its not major but i do understand that these kinds of glitches can be annoying to people 
 some of the animations for the mermaids are funny but i believe that will be patched in future versions 

to anyone reading this the version i am playing is 10 i believe or 11 ive forgotten sorry please keep in mind that the developers are still working on it so please be kind ive seen a lot of harsh reviews because of the bugs and so on but have patience i really do think that the biggest negative is the lack of consistency in the romance aspect but otherwise everything is actually all good ill update the review in the future hopefully happy playing everyone 

#####

great game its the best marriage of harvest moon and stardew valley with devs who clearly have a ton of love and respect for the farming sim genre the artstyledesign is great and the game itself is full of things to do 
one note for pickier players out there as of now the game is still somewhat a work in progress but its regularly updated and the team has shown no signs of planning to let us down so maybe wait until 2025 for a smoother ride if youre inclined but it really is still super fun asis and very worth a play

#####

h1 really beautiful farming simulator game h1
the characters design is fantastic all minigames on festival were so fun and engaging
this might be one of the best farming simulator game ive ever played and id say great job devs and team for creating this game

h2 but theres 1 really important feature missing h2
its b manual save b 
i really hope devs add this feature so we can play anytime we want without worrying we need to go and quit in middle of the game

again thank you so much for creating this amazing game 
i have no regret buying this game from early access

#####

i say all of this who loves coral island and the new take it has on the genre i find the game enjoyable for the most part and have played a lot of it and have enjoyed a lot of it the new 10 update should not have been the full launch the game is not finished it isnt even close to finished its a small studio so the launch with all of the bugs is expected and understood but there is an incredible amount of them many important parts game are still missing such as friendship with merfolk or romance with them the merfolk village is pretty bare pets being able to roam the farm etc etc etc this update does not feel like a 10 release its just an update to winter and romance its not the full game if youve been waiting for the full release to buy wait a little longer

#####

when i bought coral island i thought it would be just like one of the games i purchased but never played because i felt that i could never allocate some serious time to play because i am actively engaged in my job still i gave it a try because somehow i miss playing 

as a solo mum whos by the way also a gamer before i was blessed with a little one im really occupied these days from managing my time to balance housework and baby care to working diligently almost the entire day to provide for my bubba in short im very busy to the point that i dont have time for myself anymore

the day i bought this game i just opened it for a few minutes just to have a little peek on how it works to be honest i was not that excited later that day after my shift i put my baby to sleep and started playing this game i was really happy and a bit emotional i guess because i suddenly remembered the times i played stardew valley back in 2021 when i still dont have a baby and i got lots of time for myself i miss that feeling you know but dont get me wrong i love my son more than anyone could ever imagine my point is this game brought so much joy to me i got excited to play again after a long time

whenever i put my baby to sleep instead of hitting the lights off and calling it a day i will spend few more waking hours becoming hyperfixated on this game because it relaxes me and yes its kinda addictive and there are lots of things to do in the game even though its still an early access i did experience a crash just once when i was doing a diving adventure healing the corals but its alright i liked the graphics its very cute the characters are also adorable especially wakuu my astrophysicist babe lol i did finish some of the quests explored the town and met lots of attractive characters fought fluffy monsters in the cave and ventured under the ocean and right now i am very much focused on decorating my farm i had a great time playing this game thats why im very excited for the upcoming updates this would definitely be my me time from now on

i would recommend this game to people who just like to chill relax and lose touch with reality for a while

#####

b coral island b is great game that does a lot of things right while still in early access it has offered many patches hotfixes big updates and over 100 hours of content and more to come there are countless of romancable npcs a lot of farming foraging mining fishing i diving i and you can practically do whatever you want your farm area is huge even enormous with many possibilities that attack your creative thinking to do either something crazy or go simple it has a storyline or multiple for that matter that are interesting and exciting enough for you to follow and engage in everything about this game is borderline perfect  from the sound design the astonishing graphics design to every last bit of what it has to offer

this is not a stardew valley clone and dare i say it is different enough for you to enjoy both games equally 

as i recently moved to steam from game pass where i have amassed over 100 hours as the game pass version is couple of hotfixes behind i couldnt be happier to support the games developers in their many endeavours to come

do i recommend buying the game in its current state i absolutely i

#####

i think this game has the potential to become the best farm sim game out there but it was not ready for early access the first ten hours or so seem pretty great but then you start to realize how empty and unfinished the game feels this game has a massive scope the number of characters is staggering but everything feels so lifeless especially once you get into the typical game play loop you will be ecstatic for the first ten hours which will then turn to sadness as you realize the pretty exterior is empty
this game should have waited another year for early access

#####

im in love with coral island and everything about it i put in 150 hours before it was even fully released im afraid ill lose all my friends and my family when it comes out oh well itll be worth it

bfollowupb i lost everyone im happily married with yuri tho

#####

everyones hot can i marry jim please
banger dilfs

#####

it farm i like

#####

ive seen some reviews call this a rip off of stardew but clearly it pays homage to the concept while building on formula i started playing several months in to early access so i benefited from several of the updates that they have already released the game play is enjoyable and familiar enough to not really require any form of tutorial the fishing is not as much of a chore as it is in stardew which i know can be controversial but i greatly appreciate it as it was one of the collections i always struggled with

im excited for each update and to see the offering fill out it is quite fascinating to literally watch the game be built while i am playing it such as the building out of the underwater sections  which is a fun new angle to the genre the game already has fully captured my attention and i can only look forward to the final product i also look forward to getting this on my portable gaming systems as well as i can imagine picking it up to play in short bursts whenever i have time

#####

ill leave a positive review because im really enjoying this game but id say to not buy it at full price yet because the game is still unfinished and has some bugs that can affect the gameplay a bit

the art clothes and furniture customization variety of content and quantity of characters is really nice

i hope they keep updating and improving the game because ive been enjoying a lot comfy farm games ftw 

translation to ptbr is incomplete and i had 2 or 3 bugs during special events which is disappointing because i wanted to watch the cutscenes

#####

im not immune to big muscly men with scars on their faces

#####

did not deliver the content they promised at launch like the merpeople and children growing up now theyre saying they will release the rest of the content throughout the next 3 mayor patches and there is still no news about the first one despite 4 months having already passed yes there is a roadmap out but with no timetable or estimates seems to me they rushed the release of the game despite it not being finished just to cash in as much as possible before slowing down development to an almost standstill

#####

i love it its like a dating sim  stardew  animalcrossing im gonna be hyperfixating on this game for the next few months

#####

as expected this is another farm sim very similar to stardew valley but updated theres a plot of land you get to clean up and farm and grow various things meeting and talking to other residents theres even a mine too relaxing game and i totally recommend to other players who love games like these

#####

its a fun and relaxing game and has a lot of potential
but ill waiting until v1 to play it again



v10 now available
its time to restart the game

#####

this game has come so far over the time i was an alpha tester and into the early access release i have about 36 hours into the game as an alpha tester and i have thoroughly enjoyed every hour of it i love farm sims and harvest moon introduced me to the genre this game has taken everything that made harvest moon and stardew valley great and has made it even better the art style is so cute and bubbly and reminds me of slime rancher ive seen criticisms from other reviewers that state that this is just a stardew clone but lets not forget that stardew is a harvest moon clone theres only so much you can do to make a farm sim new and different and i think that with the addition of rehabilitating the coral reefs it adds a new element into the game that is not seen in other farm sims

i love how many different varieties of plants and crops there are to grow that is something that i have felt could have been improved upon in other games in the genre and it adds so much to the game just by being able to plant and grow exotic fruits that are native to the games location which is southeast asia i particularly love the more exotic fruit tree options such as dragonfruit playing games where the options are carrots potatoes and apple trees does get a little boring over time so having so many different options and new crops to grow is such a breath of fresh air

plus the art style is just amazing and i love just looking at the item sprites in my inventory the art team did a fantastic job making everything look so bright and interesting i have never seen fruit and vegetables look so delicious haha

if you find yourself getting bored of farm sims after a while due to the repetitive grindy nature of them here really is no shortage of things to do on coral island you can farm mine forage hunt bugs catch fish raise animals including peacocks and other exotic animals later on and decorate your farm and farmhouse with furniture wallpaper and flooring i am so glad they included bug hunting fishing and artifacthunting to complete the museum to the game because thats something i loved doing in animal crossing i do wish the bug and fish descriptions were a little more informative or were a little more interesting but its a fun feature nonetheless

i am also baffled by the amount of inclusivity when it comes to the characters and townies in the game its so refreshing to see so many people of different backgrounds coming together in a community and i also love that there is representation for lessabled individuals which is not often seen in video games i appreciate that you have the option to select mr ms mx or fillinyourown when creating a character the developers have clearly put a lot of thought into making the game a good experience for everyone and have made it so everyone can relate to their character in terms of identity which i think is important when making a simulator game like this

the reef diving feature is one of my favorite additions and i can see myself working hard to clean up the island and make it pretty again and im excited to see where these fabled mermaids come into the picture

overall if you like farm sims youll probably like coral island it takes all the good features of farm sims and other games and combines them into one masterpiece of course i have some small gripes about things not in the game yet inventory management features mainly or other things that are a little buggy i do also think the text in the game could use some localization since some of the text used doesnt sound quite right and will fall flat to native english speakers in addition not all features are available right now such as festivals the game is in earlyaccess after all its not the full game and this is not the full release but the developers really listen to feedback and work to improve the game so i believe that they will work to make the game even better as time goes on

i absolutely recommend giving the game a try

i want to like this game i really really do 
but it is honestly a play by play rip off of stardew valley im a pretty big fan of the farming sim genre overall and have played many games in it and none of them have copied one another the way this one does 

from the first time into the mines resulting in a grizzled battle hardened veteran giving you a sword as you enter the blacksmith showing up to give you the furnace blueprint after you get your first ore it practically follows the plotline bit for bit the whole overarching storyline of uwu bwig corpowation gwunna wuin the town is a straight rip off they even pulled the hat selling mouse who lives in an abandoned house in the forest and converted it into a hat selling monkey that lives in an abandoned house in the forest its named concernedmonkey it would be a wonderful tribute if the game wasnt practically plagiarism i had seen reviews claiming it was very very stardewesque and wanted to like the game despite this i had been extremely excited when i saw the kickstarter last summer but honestly i cant recommend this game when you could just play stardew and actually have a functioning finished game plus stardew is actually significantly cheaper 

aside from the plotline being a regurgitated muck of a previously beloved title the game is woefully unfinished to the point i would have expected it to have stayed well off the steamstore or at the very least be around the 10 mark the levelling system is unfinished and unsatisfying as there is no tier two to use your perk points the clinic while existing is completely nonfunctional and the festivals god the festivals i wish they hadnt included them in the early access like it would have been better to actually cut them entirely and only introduce them when they were finished because you cant actually complete them for example you show up to the local potluck only to find out that the pot doesnt work and you cant actually put food in it because its not implemented yet the only thing you can do is a potato sack race and then leave upon which the mayor acts all mildly disappointed that you were too busy to participate this kind of halfbaked introduction to festivals does nothing to make me want to interact with future ones even if they are finished eventually same with characters whose entire personality is written tba or something similar in the description like i really am not going to care about the character later if i spend the ea playing with them being a blank slate of a character with no progression 

overall this game needs so much so much it promises too much and delivers too little when the game itself announces things only for them to not be in the game yet that creates a frustrating environment for the player who wants to be excited to unlock things and progress thats what a farming sim is meant to be about progression accomplishment building charactersrelationships and having memorable special moments 
all this game provides is frustration long loading times and a butchered version of a modern classic spoonfed to you like an infant 

i dont recommend the game in its current state it has potential but it lies so deeply hidden under a layer of other peoples works that it lacks its own personality and identity the game will need to sort this out if it wants to be as successful as the game it so clearly idolizes

#####

this is not a finished game as the 10 makes it apear

wip quest and tbd item discription should not be included in a completed game
the first few hours are good but more and more missing bugged and unfinished surfaces
you get a few main quests that guide you but just a few until you hit the wip quest

as for mechanics 
many of the event minigames feel to random 
mining is hardly rewarding as you get floors with no ore and finding the way down can take some time
if you play longer sessions some machines just stop producing
the im stuck button puniches you not really fair with a buggy game
you want to buy another top for your alt form they come in 5 different colors judging by the icon on my charecter they were all blue

i hope this game still gets some development after the 10 version

edit
after seeing the roadmap for 2024 i am even more confused how the devs are able to call this 10 from 05 to 10 is a strange step

#####

i hope to change this because i really do enjoy the game and ive put a lot of time into it but its flatout dishonest to call this a complete game at this point it should not be considered version 10 but since the devs are calling it that im reviewing it as though any further updates will be out of the goodness of their hearts and shouldnt be expected a lot of important things arent just incomplete but arent implemented at all

#####

update this game has already come a long way and has improved so much i still dont think its worth the current price but it does feel more complete and has far less deadends at this point the only real issues i have is that i cant buy anything from the taco truck and i cant give the cats and dogs unlimited head pats

original review strike i would love to be able to recommend this game but i cant i understand that its currently in early access but there are so many bugs incomplete talent trees and dead ends in certain areas such as relationshipnpc interactions mining and just crafting in general i tried so hard to overlook the grammar and spelling mistakes in dialogue trees but its really hard to do so when there are so many other issues i look forward to the games full release as it is extremely reminiscent of stardew valley animal crossing and harvest moon but in its current state it should be available as a demo not early access and certainly not for the current price strike

#####

i went into this game with a fairly open mind and was quite concerned with the similarities to sdv i am not naive i do understand games of same genres have certain likenesses to each other and mechanics etc typically though when a game is made with similarities there are stand out storylinesfeatures that make it obviously different to other games of its type 

i was hopeful for this game hearing people describe it as 3d sdv ive sunk many many hours in sdv never played harvest moon but im getting a picture coral island however begins exactly the same as sdv the storyline is the same the ingame quests and missions are the same the crafting journal quests npcs evem the concept of joja cola supermarket actions everything is the same as sdv it is literally sdv in 3d the only thing that has made this game unique to sdv is the graphics literally im very uncomfortable with supporting a plagiarised game if concerned ape is not part of the development some wont care thats fine just putting in my two cents id rather stick to sdv because it has coop multiplayer which coral island does not yes its in early development but  there is no comment if this will be a future feature 

very disappointed when this game could have been a little more original in its storyconcepts not a replica

#####

amazing game even though in development is more polished than some games twice the price
if you love animal crossing or stardew valley then this is the game for you

comment written by a 56 year old gamer from the uk

#####

yes absolutely yes everything i love in these types of games and the charactersugh ive fallen in love with them all

#####

the game shouldnt have released in this state
old glitches are still very prevalent monster loot does barely anything in the game some items still have tbd in their category
the main story is not finished yet and still has wip and people who have complaints about the games in their discord server get banned do not support the game in this state
i really want to like it and i liked the time i have spent in it but i wont be touching it until they fixed these reasonable issues

#####

waited a long time to play this game so im very excited to finally jump into it id recommend it if you have been following the game for a while and are eager to play it now if you want all the bells and whistles wait till full release 

b edit notetips b
list
 you can edit your day pacing in the settings menu for me the day went by too quickly so lowered it to 50 thanks stevenchippss for pointing this out
list

b the pros b
list
 beautiful graphics and environment
 so far all the villagers ive met are portrayed as individuals with their own personality no copy pasting and great attention to detail with some of them they make me want to invest time into getting to know them better 
 great music in the background
 sound effects are great i especially like the rain sound
 while the customization of your character is not extensive for now its enough to make me happy
 the fishing mini game cannot be described other then it just makes sense in a good way
 farming is straight forward and i really appreciated that you dont have to move to each individual tile to interact with it
list

b the cons b
list
 the running speed of your character feels too slow even with the dashing button spacebar its not ideal hopefully we can upgrade this by purchasing items or improving our skill set
 the map is massive which makes it a bit of a pain to move around on hopefully there will be fast travel in the future or mounts or faster movement speed
 it takes a bit too long for fish to show up and its unclear whether you can fish in every body of water or designated spots fishing is one of the main things i like to do in farming games to earn buckeroos aside from farming crops
 while having a stamina bar is common for farming games i wouldnt mind having this scrapped in the future youre already limited by how fast a day passes by  your slow moving speed so the stamina bar just acts as another crutch you have to deal with
 it hard at times to talk to villagers because either the option to talk doesnt show up at all or you have to battle between accessing a store or talking to them
list

i will add more as i progress through the game but so far im pleasantly surprised for it being an early access title

#####

i like this game so far however its been in production for years and i feel like the timeline is slow i wont be playing again until the 10 update because it took me back 40 hours in game which i read is a common glitch but im sure the developers dont care because ive already bought it lol however its very much like stardew valley some stuff is so similar that its scary lol and i love stardew valley you cant currently romance marry or have children theres a few glitches but the game is still worth the money and has amazing potential the characters have so much depth and diversity i really hope they make dating and marriage amazing please please be better than the new story of season and harvest moon franchises   overall seems like a great cozy game my biggest complaint is the marriage romance not being available and the fact you can only adopt one animal why so many cute animals if i cant adopt at least 2 please fix

#####

dont kill me but i like it more than stardew valley the only thing i would say to keep in mind is that the game is incomplete this steered me away from the game a bit as i felt like when the full game comes out i am going to have to play from the start to get the full picture anyway so i am waiting for the full release

#####

somehow i managed to squeeze over 100 hours in the first two weeks while also playing another game with my friends so id say i am really really really enjoying this one xd 
i never could get into stardew valley something with the graphics annoyed me too much and such but omg this one this is what i needed

#####

another early access player here that really wants to love this game coral island is still unfinished despite being advertised as full release at 10 if you want to support the devs buy the game and enjoy what you can but if youre looking for a finished basegame product id wait to purchase until larger content updates are established in the future

there are countless unfinished aspects to list so here are a few of the bigger discrepancies you should know

   incomplete mainquest and storyline quests you will quickly reach an abrupt unfinished end of several quest lines making everything afterward feel aimless besides continuing mindless daily tasks
   you cannot travel to any of the other areas in the world as they have yet to be added i wonder if theyll sell these locations as future dlc regardless the devs have yet to communicate on this topic
   missing heart events and unfinished events
   you still cannot interact much if at all with the games aquatic characters or features which are a major part of coral islands gameplay and story  
   theres a list of players out there still experiencing game breaking bugs rip the homies 

despite all this the devs are adding little things like new clothing options between hotfixes which is nice but not what many would say should be priority considering this is a false 10 there is a lot of potential here for a great laidback game that is as rightfully glorified as stardew valley but coral island shouldnt have left early access in its current state

hopefully this review as well as similar reviews change in the future

#####

so 
ive seen reviews where people have been saying that there was some sort of forced diversity which like no i am a pacific islander and i am loving seeing all the characters culturesraces represented there is no set jock nerd artist etc which honestly did get a little tiring and there is no token poc in a town filled with obviously caucasian townsfolk looking at you rune factory and harvest moonand stardew valley the characters are very charming and since this game is still in the works i am extremely excited to see how they develop as the years ingame go on i went into the game expecting to fall in love with theo and instead surya is quickly becoming my number one there is an issue with some characters not talking unless i exit out of the game and go back in but thats just one of the bugs that can get fixed soon i want to focus on figuring out the mechanics of the game first off 
i agree that it is irritating that i lose stamina when i miss hitting a rock for example but in previous harvest moon games the player characters stamina would diminish faster if it was raining so its not something i mind too much the island and its ocean however much we can explore currently gives me major nostalgia about home i love the details and the music and the odd floating cat above the grocery store 
a bit of the downside the fps gives me a tiny headache i hope this gets fixed soon but again the developers are working hard and i am happy enough to wait the fact that i can adjust the speed of time to a certain amount in the game is amazing especially if i want more time in the day to go around doing things 
now do i recommend this game hell yeah do i recommend it at the price currently well it depends on if you have the money to spend i couldnt wait and also wanted to support the creators so i didnt mind the price at all ive sunk a bit of time playing and im happy enough with what i paid if youre wanting more content after year 1 then i do suggest you wait 
one last thing this is a game ive been looking for and dreaming about and even at one point had planned to eventually make myself ever since i played my very first harvest moon game i already love everything about it even if it isnt yet finished yes there are bugs to work out and yes some stuff is still pretty janky but there is much to look forward to

i dont think this shouldve been released in this state this is no v10 there are lots of bugs random crashes unfinished mechanics bookspages baby animals economy and balancing is bad and lots of details missing the straw that broke the camels back for me was the spooky festival a halloween festival where every npc is commenting about their costumes except theyre not wearing any costume at all id have expected at least the artwork to be finished for a 10 release

dont get me wrong its playable in this state and most of it its fun it just doesnt feel complete and sometimes its even frustrating when a play mechanic is mentioned by an npc but not implemented yet for example incubating eggs as told by the rancher npc

id advise buyers to wait another year or a very substantial sale before buying and advise the developers to stop shipping unfinished games jfc

#####

at first i thought id wait it out until the full game was released but boy am i happy that i didnt because i am hooked being a huge farming sim game fan i was pleasantly surprised at how full the game already feels obviously the game is still in early access so theres still a lot of things in the works and a few funny glitches here and there but nothing so bad that took away from the overall experience so far at this point i dont even think i can call it a harvest moonstardew copy because it really isnt while it may borrow a lot of themes or gameplay aspects coral island offers so much more

graphics are gorgeous although i would like to see more customization options for the characters features and clothes down the line the art style for the npcs are great and they change outfitsso cute the background music is super relaxing and theres so much to do aside from your usual farming ranching and mining i absolutely adore the diving aspect of the game and the inclusion of merfolk and im excited to see what we can do in the dig site i havent gotten to that part yet so im not quite sure if its accessible as of writing this there are also monsters to defeat within the cavern though i feel its a little clunky still and i love seeing the museum come to life although some bugs just refuse to be caught lol im currently starting fall as of writing this and i feel like theres a lot of things left for me to do in early access 

i would like to see an improvement in the hit boxes though especially for big stumps and rocks as it takes me a couple tries to find the right spot also fishing is a little difficult in some cases but i would assume that would get easier with increased skill and a better rod theres also some fish that i cant seem to catch as the meter doesnt move at all but maybe thats a me problem for now 

overall the game is lovely so far and i do highly recommend you buy it

#####

this game was 100 rushed to v10 release it is nowhere near complete and it is an insult to the consumers to act like it is this game is 90 bugs and glitches that it is beyond insane how unpolished it is obviously these will most likely be fixed as time goes on but a v10 release should have at least minimum levels of polish done what is this a bethesda title on launch

blist of bugsglitchesetc i have foundthere is actually significantly more by other players this is just what i found myself from 20 hours of gameplayb

list
    weapons would clip out your hand and onto your hips

    hit detection in combat is beyond broken attacks that are suppose to hit do not while some do making for a confusing experience

    enemies take a second longer to die which causes them to attack even though they are suppose to die after hitting they finally go down which causes chip damage

    pet race will have some npcs just cheat 100 a few npcs didnt even have a pet following and just sprints to the end without stopping making it impossible to win

    there is literally a gate fence in the race that prevents anyone from running in the race lmao

    even though an insect is alerted and tries to flee you sometimes fail to catch it even though it is within your nets grasp it sometimes allows it and other times it fails

    sometimes your character will carry items in their hands way above their heads 

    fishing hides the hud which is fine but it will often persist after finishing the minigame requires you to press esc twice to go back to normal

    when trying to mine or cut objects near the end of your characters reach it sometimes allows it and other times it doesnt there is no consistency

    tons of microstutter or macrostutter when travelling around i noticed this happening often underwater sections i am terrified if it crashes i will have to redo the entire day again

    this endofday save system is hot garbage i honestly dont care what the reasoning for it it is a bad mechanic and i am tired of seeing other farming games use this especially how buggy and glitchy this game is it is a constant fear that i will crash in the middle of the day i cant wait for a potential mod that fixes this similar to what stardew valley has

    your character will get stuck on the terrain as there are a lot of outofbounds and weird dead zone areas especially near the stairs of the town

    the big slime monster in the wind cave will accidentally throw a slime outside making it impossible to reach and kill

    very rare moments where the rope downwards doesnt show on a few floors in the forest cave

    the rope item recipe costs 199 stone to create bhemp ropeb lol ayo what are we making here an onyx pokemon i heard there was a gameplay reason for this but come on you could have easily made a new item for this

    when you are trying to activate the sun relic power itself in the underwater section if you stand underneath the beacon when it comes out you will get stuck 100 either you have to use unstuckwhich skips a day leave and restart the whole day or be lucky that the anchor drops on you for to leave

    you can also softlock yourself out of the games options menu if you put any keybind under the e key as its the same one as apply button so you cant make any setting changes from it the only fix for this is to use a controller and reset the keybind back

    the ui gets stuck when you load in from your save for the first time causing you to restart the load to fix

    romances are completely broken for many of the characters marriage dialogues are completely fucked and nonsensical as your spouse congratulates you on your marriagewut or they act like they are your bfgf when we are just friends

    constant white squares on character icons on the map screen meaning there is an error loading in their icons

    characters icons on the map sometimes get stuck staying large as if you hovered over them when you didnt

    lag when opening up the map screen 

    no way to put down any way points or markers on the map screen as the game has no minimap making navigation a pain in the ass especially when you are looking for a specific npc

    a lot of typos in some of the dialogue and descriptions

    bmain quest ends in wip is the biggest insult to all your players who have purchased this game with the belief that it is a full release versionb found out about this from other players

    half of the content is apparently going to be released in 2024 that was promised so players who have been playing beforehand suffered a save wipe for little to no good reason whats to stop these developers from doing another save wipe in the future

    a few of the content shown in the v10 trailer are not even accessible yet that is 100 false advertising or publisher negligence

    and much much more bugs that i didnt even list as other players had even more unique encounters if anyone else has their own list or experience with bugs share them down in the comments because i have seen a lot of them on the steam forums reddit and their own discord
list

this game should have released in their original timeline of 2024 this game clearly needed another year in the oven as of right now i would give this game a 510 halfbaked until they add in what they promised and fix majority of the rough edges otherwise this would have been an easy 810 if it didnt release in such an awful state

edit april 18th
i can play now on my pc since some patches but still have have had no luck on my deck ive uninstalledreinstalled started new saves but something stops it from getting past the main screen and it just closes again sure this will be fixed as many others whom had the problem can play on their deck now not sure why it wont work for me seems like the updates fix some issues for others and then others like myself just cant play at all

i recommend but if youve bought this game since the march 16th update know that for me i can no longer run the game on my pc or steam deck even using exp proton im sure this issue will get resolved but if you have these pc specs listed below or a decku may want to hold off until updatespatches come thru so u can actually play the game you paid for
pc specs 

nvidia geforce rtx 2070 super
intel i71700f cpu
32 gb ram

h1game is still incomplete on 10h1

im sorry to break it to you some things in this game feel too much like wip

list
emmas taco truck is set dressing but why it could just sell tacos having an establishment be set dressing is so immersionbreaking that you cannot convince me this was an executive decision it undoubtedly was a corner cut to fulfill a deadline
the monsters in the mine pose no threat whatsoever the player is too bulky  needs balancing asap some other player called the monsters squishy rocks and yeah thats accurate they pose as much thereat as a rock
when finishing an errand the task giver will simply say thank you all of them considering how rich all the other dialogues with all characters are i can confidently say this is a placeholder text
and finally the reason why i decided to write this review in the first place  after breaking the big incandescent boulder that no character ever mentions btw i found a completely empty area and immediately fell out of bounds talk about anticlimactic im still giving the devs the benefit of the doubt here bmaybeb i was supposed to reach a trigger that would teleport me elsewhere and the trigger failed because of some bug after all i cant think of any reason why a finished game would lead the player to a completely empty and obviously not properly tested area after the player cleared a fixed map obstacle
list

at the end of the day this is a fantastic game and im confident it will give me dozens of hours of fun gameplay i absolutely recommend it and have already recommended it to many friends of mine but i deliberately avoided the early access for a reason oh well

i am very mixed on this game i originally loved it and thought the concept was great with a unique twist with the underwater aspects the relationships and a fresh story that isnt just revive your grandpas farm 

however every patch and update seems intent on making the game harder in making it less accessible more difficult and more frustrating this game has in my opinion become a little bit gruelling which ruins the fun its a shame because it had so much potential 

the monsters in the mines are now at swarmworthy levels and im going to be frank i already found the mines to be slightly annoying because of how much energy you use in them combined with how little reward you get i often waste entire days unable to proceed to the next level because it is almost impossible to get there but now you get nuked on site by a mob of monsters that do a lot of damage 

coupled with other patches that made money extremely difficult to obtain new files are increasingly challenging to get started i bought this game for the farming the romance plots and the story line not for the grind

there just seems to be a lot of focus on the part of the game devs to implement things that increase the difficulty and make things more complex which i find unusual given the genre of the game and their original marketing 

i dont know why they even boasted the marriage and relationships aspect as that unfortunately doesnt seem to be a priority for the game devs they are apparently too busy making death bees that kill you in the mines 

loved the concept and the story line but the game is becoming an incredible slog for the players

#####

the game is not completed in v10 update

i bought this game thinking they finally completed it out of early access with the increase in price as well i have put 35 hours into the game and ran into 3 npcs listed as single that you cannot actively work on the relationship until 2024 when they provide another update there are multiple quest areas of the game that are unfinished as well 

this felt very scamlike as i believed i was getting the final product why publish a game out of early access with content that isnt fully accessible 

i enjoy the game a lot which is why i am so massively disappointed will be putting this game aside until the next major update 


#####

this game is a lot of fun but is in no way ready to be a 10 release this game is not finished there are large parts of the game that arent functional id estimate contentwise its about 40 finished the farmingcatchingresource hunting mechanics are solid as a base level the ranchingartisan system is pretty barebones but not terrible 

the 2 big failings are the rewards for completing anythingofferingsmuseumquests and missing writing there was 1 quest reward in the whole game that i was like sweet thats pretty rad everything else got a reaction of  really thats all i get for donating hundreds of itemshours of fishingetc 

about half of the talk options in the game are either you dont understand what they are saying or they have nothing to say to you the evil corporation storyline is barely there after 50 hours i saw 3 total cutscenes related to it and none of them needed any interaction from me

if you buy this game know that its really a midcycle beta version its probably 2 or 3 years away from being a 10 ready game

#####

so i have some mixed feelings about this game overall i enjoy it its addictive in the way any cozy island sim builder is and has some unique aspects to it that i really liked however i think there are some serious things that need to be addressed before it leaves early access 

 b pros b
 running your character can run not only that but they can do a quick sprint and jump over walls which i absolutely love and havent experienced in many other games
 the diversity of the characters is incredible i wish they had more diverse body sizes but thats a minor complaint 
 the drawn art is gorgeous 
 i love being able to see where everyone is on the map it makes finding people for their birthdays or to talk super easy although this seems to be a little glitched in early access
 the free teleportation totems you can unlock through game play make traveling around painless especially since the map is so huge
 under water mermaid game play is super unique and an interesting addition to the story
 there are so many romanceable options and npc characters it really makes the island feel populated

 b cons b
  my biggest issue is it truly seems like they copy and pasted from some of stardews or harvest moons main game play features the island has an evil corporation that is trying to buy everything out for their business your character must help restore the islands popularity by doing quests from a goddess of the island all the quests can only be completed during each individual season as you have to forge or harvest the plants needed  you have to unlock each quest room by finishing the one before when you do you unlock prizes and new game features sound familiar 
 trash trash everywhere it never goes away no matter how much you clean the beach the trash just responds and really ruins the aesthetic 
  there may be too many characters although i do like the options its really hard to get to know everyone well and it seems like some of the characters have been more developed then others this leaves some npcs feeling a little 2d in who they are 
 mining is tedious mining is essentially enter room hit rock rarely fight a jelly or spider continue to hit rock then find whole and go down theres barely any gems or ore and the gems you do find are all the same likely do to early access it seems like depending on the mine level theres a certain number of rocks that must be hit to trigger the stairs i have used the bombs and other devices to speed this up but it doesnt seem to have an impact i will say an interesting thing about this mine is that each door has different materials you start with bronze and then after getting to level 50 unlock the silver room etc i like this aspect to it as it makes gathering materials way easier 
 fishing could also be made better i like the fishing mechanic its much easier to control then other games but fish take forever to show up
 this is probably an early access issue but ive gotten stuck running over things or around people quit a few times there a more game play bugs as well that i think just need to be fixed before release
 a quick edit as of 33 hrs into the game i have done absolutely everything thats possible in the early release ive gone as far as you can in the ocean mines donations and temples the  festivals available have also all been done ive also discovered many many more bugs one big one are peoples birthdays or events spawning wrong on the calendar or npcs just disappearing from the world they often disappear on their birthdays making it impossible to give them a gift i look forward to the devs fixing these issues and updating the game because as of now i have no reason it play any more

#####

already a pretty solid game with lots of potential for future enhancements 

if you liked stardew valley and similar farm sims you should definitly give this a try

#####

ive been waiting since this games kickstarter launch for a full release and now that the full release is here it is clear i should have waited even longer this feels less like a complete game and more like a pass to beta access

to put it simply the game is unfinished main story lines are clearly incomplete areas of the game are labeled as wip and marriage and dating dialogue is barely there i have played a lot of farming sims in my life and yet this is the first one where i have felt no desire to get married to my chosen bachelorbachelorette because there is no content waiting for me after it 

that doesnt mean the game is bad i enjoyed the 30 hours i have played the art style is beautiful the town is large and in the beginning it did a good job of always giving me something to work towards but the longer i play the more i realize there is very little left for me to do

if you think you will play past the first year care about romancing villagers or enjoy having children in farming sims please wait to buy this game you will be disappointed if you are mostly here to decorate go ahead

i come back in a year to update my review hopefully the game is actually complete by then

#####

im currently 23 hours in and midway through summer year 1 ive been playing harvest moonsosstardew valleyetc for 20 years now so im a long time fan of the genre and overall im really enjoying coral island so far i was a backer on kickstarter but didnt want to play the game until full release as i dont really enjoy beta testingresetslosing my save file

im playing coral island on steam deck and ive ran into a few minor bugs so far the worst being that i cant move the map around on the construction build screen so i can only place new buildings in the central area of the farm map ive also had two freezescrashes although i think those were probably a result of my deck overheating from playing for too long the dialogue could also use further editing many errors with grammar and some with spelling just frequently enough in the early game to become annoying and make me want to volunteer as an editor its just not quite at the level of polish i would expect from a game at full release but im hopeful things will improve im also aware that the console releases are a mess and certainly the top priority for bug fixing right now and my gripes are minor in comparison my overall play experience has been pretty smooth

the visual aspects of the game are all so beautiful color palettecharacter artmap designhome interiorsetc im also really enjoying how lively the town feels the npc cast is larger and wayyyy more diverse than most other farmlife sims ive played the town itself is physically larger theres new businesses opening up as you progress you constantly see the npcs going about the town and living their lives etc even small touches like location or seasondependent clothinghairstyles add to how dynamic the game feels my only gripe in this area is that i wish there were more interactive elements in the homes ive always loved when games let you parse through bookshelvesdeskswall art for the extra details and immersion

im enjoying the mechanics of the game which are pretty standard for farm and life sims farming mining fishing bug catching artifact hunting and this unique version of diving however i will note that the game doesnt offer much in the way of tutorials and definitely expects players to be familiar with these mechanics from other games or to just figure it out through trial and error this also goes for the minigames at the festivals you can do practice runs first but there isnt any narrative walkthrough beforehand of how the minigames actually work this might make the game frustrating for casual or firsttime farm sim players despite the cute disneylike aesthetic the game isnt exactly optimized to be kidfriendly

the skill level progression seems slightly slower compared to other games im at level 4 for the skill trees i spend the most time in farming and foraging while id probably be at 6 or so by this point in stardew valley im not much of a socialite so cant really speak to the rate of relationship progression although ive seen several townie cutscenes so far and ive enjoyed them the writing gives off cozy sliceoflife vibes and the cutscenes make me feel like im genuinely learning more about the townies and becoming a part of the community myself

i especially love the environmental elements of this game the tree planting festival was fantastic and unqiue and the underwaterocean cleanup has been so satisfying only wish i started upgrading my scythe sooner it makes such a difference i also really like the choice of fantasy elements in this game very flavorful and unique these were the aspects of the game that made me decide to back the kickstarter in the first place and im very happy with what ive experienced of them in the game so far 

overall im really enjoying the game so far and while ive had some small complaints they arent significant enough for me to drop the game or refrain from recommending it very cute very cozy very satisfying


#####

i enjoy this game but as a matter of principle i cant recommend a game that declares itself released from early access with so many dead ends from unimplemented content

#####

bought this game on release but waited until now to start playing as i wanted controller support to be implemented i also wanted to give the devs a chance to iron out some initial bugs etc ive played over 4 hours in one day so clearly im enjoying it there seems to be more than enough content for me as i like to play several games at one time graphics are lovely and works fine on steam deck feels to me like stardew valley but with better graphics and an ecological theme

#####

i love the game its everything it promises and its so beautiful to watch do i recommend it yes yes and yes

you know how there are a million farming sims out there each thinking they added that one tiny special feature to the genre that makes it okay to deliver a completely unpolished game for a full price because people just love farming sims

well here you have an example of how it actually should be done they put the whole thing to a coral island and the feel of the game is just fantastic so many things work so smoothly you feel like there is a lot to discover the island seems vivid and the characters really feel like busy inhabitants rather than just decoration you can talk to 

despite being early access the game feels coherent and thought through features that are missing esp mini games are already teased and you are told ingame that they are yet to be implemented and i mean scubadiving for treasures and discovering underwater come on 

the only weaker part in my opinion is mining in the cave as it feels a bit neglected so far this is rather a result of the details and the life in the overworld but should be worked on until full release nevertheless however it is absolutely okay and works in the context of the game

#####

farm on land in the mines and in the depths of the sea 

pros
 the sea farming is a nice break from the regular farming and there are a few little surprises too
 a great variety of things to farm in general
 you dont get all the upgrades at once which is a nice touch
 the storyline revolves around more than just farming this is probably what i enjoy most about the game it has great variety and an interesting mythical aspect

cons
 the map could have been lit up in the area you need to search when you have a quest in progress a lot of time is spent on trying to find your way around
 before buying consider that the main quest is being released in updates and its currently not finished yet

my review

 coral island is one of the most anticipated games particularly among indonesian players 

 coral island takes elements of every farming simulator youve ever played throws them in a blender and adds a storyline about an environmental disaster and a town in crisis the mixture is then poured over a sprawling world with a diverse population beautiful scenery and plenty to explore

 the game features a vividly colored and welcoming atmosphere

 there are several side activities to enjoy on coral island ranging from catching fish to embarking on different fetch missions for the townspeople

 overall the coral island experience so far feels very much like playing several different games at once there are elements of story of seasons harvest moon animal crossing and many more

 im looking forward for the full release

please remember that this game still in early access phase

#####

i backed this game on kickstarter and i have 0 regrets the developers have a nice flow of information roadmap and clear set goals
now in early access you get to see the game grow and mature dont expect a full fledged game version 1 is expected next year  expect to be able to play through parts get a good taste of what the farming ranching and exploring will be like

so far i have been loving the style and game play the devs have chosen even without it being a full release i have been fully sucked in

edit 10 release was much sooner its been an update to the game for sure on pc i can see better textures nicer flow of game play and of course more content now the main thing im waiting for is multiplayer which is expected to release somewhere next year
another good thing this game has going for it its absolutely inclusive and diverse its been amazing to see food items from my cultural background i never had this experience when growing up im glad kids from all over the world will be able to see their food their culture represented

#####

1010 a nice cozy game with lots of little hidden gems to explore the artwork and playthrough style is clean a good game to try out if youre a fan of cozy farm games and exploring

#####

i held off on playing until the full release so i wouldnt have to start over and then after playing a bit i find the game isnt really finished theres bugs typos incomplete storylines and more and more signs this should have stayed in early access longer

dont get me wrong i love the aesthetic and diversity of this game but today i launched it and just stood outside my farmhouse wondering why even bother its nice the devs keep patching things but i also keep finding new ones even as the hotfix patches address them 

hell im still afraid to look at the weather report at night cause its the #1 cause of the game locking up for me the weather lady might as well be a creepypasta subject at this point

ive had fun but i dont see any point continuing until this is actually doneand frankly im sick and tired of developers kicking out half baked games and then finishing them off in later content drops that and treating discord like a message board im in like two dozen servers already i cant do this for every game

ill update this review if and when things improve

#####

ignore the 10 release  this is an early access game  i dont understand who thought it made sense to fully release the game with huge sections still missing content   i purposely held off on playing it until full release and i wish i had waited longer

basic examples there are large buildings in the town that just stay empty and gross looking ie recycling center  half of the content in the merfolk section is just empty or nonfunctional  there is a cellar door outside of your house that isnt accessible  a manhole cover that you uncover and you can select but nothing happens  multiple sections in the ocean that seem like its supposed to be a puzzle but isnt  

ignoring all of that if you pretend its finished the social aspect of the game falls flat compared to others of a similar nature  while the story is somewhat engaging if unfulfilling and unfinished i found myself spending absolutely no time with any villagers  theres not a single villager that i am even mildly interested in  they are all just flat and boring  if you look into the roadmap youll see that they havent even implemented hang outdating yet  every interaction is the same across all characters  except one who talks in all caps because apparently it makes him quirky   

i cant give the game a recommend  whats there is great and if it was ea i wouldnt question it but if youre going into this thinking youre going to get a full experience youll be highly disappointed like i was  great idea absolutely terrible roll out

#####

i love this game its the sims meets stardew valley cannot wait for a full release

#####

if harvest moon had had everything i ever dreamed of it would be this game the only thing i would add if its not already a thing or a future goal is for the npcs you dont date to get together

#####

for some odd reason the developers are obsessed with making sure players make money very very slowly rather than focusing on making sure that certain gameplay systems function in a way that is enjoyable eg spawn rate for silver koi needed for altar offerings  think stardew valley community center item sets  or finicky bug catching patch after major patch they will nerf the sell price of various goods or dramatically increase item production time 

let me be clear player economy balancing is important but so is player enjoyment every single patch the feedback channel in their discord server will have people politely pointing that the changes theyve made have made the game feel grindier and less fun and yet every single patch theyll do changes that seemingly ignores this feedback and considering that these patches come every couple of months thats a long time for people to be frustrated by the resulting tediousness they only rarely release hotfixes for bugs and remain radio silent in the face of critical feedback 

there is a lot i like about this game the ui is clean the character art is amazing the graphics are charming i sincerely want to be invested and spend time in this world but the repeated nonsensical decisions made by the devs bwith no explanation for why each timeb have made me too frustrated i hope this game turns out well w further patches but i cannot recommend people buy this game right now there is still too much polish and refinement thats needed and the devs seem to have selective deafness to player feedback

#####

this game is very much still in development having said that as a farming sim it hits those little dopamine receptors that make me happy ive been playing the game since the alpha backed on ks and have watched as the mechanics came together and the world has been built there is so much to do in coral island that its kinda overwhelming do i want to go mining today do i want to go diving i need to get fish for the museum and altar but i need bronze ore to make more bee houses  just honestly a lot to do but the game doesnt penalize you for not doing it as far as i can tell coral island is an at your own pace thing 

having said that there are some things locked behind town rank up like seeds and fruit trees decorations and clothing options town rank up can be a bit of a slog especially if like me you left most of the fishing till year two xd the first few town ranks seem fairly simple to me and clearing the ocean and diving can get you town rank points pretty fast in the first year after clearing the ocean though it comes down to filling the museum and making offerings at the altar some of these seem more simple and easy than others xd cracking open geodes and treasure chests can get you a lot of gems and artifacts for the museum and keeping the bug net on you can get most of the ocean critters while clearing the ocean cleanup as someone who only filled the museum in stardew like twice over a hundred or so farms feeling like the museum is mandatory is an adjustment not bad just an adjustment 

the story line also feels like its still hammering out the kinks but the characters are almost all charming and delightful to get to know also every marriage candidate is gorgeous and there is at least one nb option character creation wise the farmer can be any gender and you can choose your own pronouns which i very much prefer it feels sweet that every character in the game will refer to your farmer as the preferred pronouns which i cant get irl there are three base body types for the farmer traditional feminine and masculine as well as an in between that i suspect is supposed to be androgynous but is a less built male type the body weight sliders are appreciated but almost all of the weight is along the middle like a doughnut i dont consider that a big deal i understand there are programming limitations currently but it makes for an awkward body type at the extreme ends of the slider which seems fair enough xd 

personally im not super fond of ranching and bug catching and fishing however the ranching isnt hard or anything the bug catching and fishing take some patience to learn but also are not hard the farm layout is huge and gorgeous with four water features where you can fill up your watering can and the sprinkler sizes both make sense and at level three are awe inspiring large 80 crops covered by one sprinkler xd which with the unlockable deluxe scare crow creates large plots to grow in that im just loving with evenly placed pathing its just neat and tidy there are unlockable automation options from the auto chest to the sprinkler attachments that can do everything from fertilize your crops to harvest and replant them 

the options for decorating the farm are robust to put it kindly there are so many outside and in house decor to choose from and while i feel like decorating is a later game thing starting it on year two in my current farm i know other people in the discord definitely check that out have put priority in making their farms look nice 

all in all ive had a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of coral island of getting to know the various characters and picking my favorites to bring smoothies to every day 3

#####

i waited to play coral island until it was out of early access because i wanted to experience the full game since its v1 launch ive played quite a lot and ive got to say im a little disappointed the core gameplay is really fun i love the farming and the diving but the game is so buggy that im not longer enjoying it my character got married and now they cant talk to their spouse without the game crashing entirely and now some of the characters the my character didnt marry have dialogue like they are married i went in the underwater caves and suddenly pieces of the house were in the cave and when i exited the cave pieces of the cave were in my house not only is the game really buggy but the story is unfinished i finished the storyline with the giants because the next part the savannah hasnt been added to the game yet calling this game version 1 and charging extra for it is terrible its essentially still early access however when they fix the game breaking bugs and finish the actual story im sure the game will be great and i look forward to it in its current state i cant recommend it but keep an eye on it to find out when all the issues have been fixed

#####

this is beautiful game if you were as disappointed with how unfinished the early access game was as i was you will be pleasantly pleased that the full release is living up to its early promise the game play is quite cozy and you can opt out of combat should you wish you can set the mobs to where if you dont bother them they will not bother you nice to have the choice that was my first review unfortunately after a long time playing the game i cannot change my recommendation it could have been such a good game but not enough effort was put into the underlying game mechanics it is far to glitchy for a game that is out of early access the game story is rather weak and there is only a partial end to the story line it is very unsatisfying

#####

im so glad that i was introduced to cozy games such as this it helps me relax and unwind after a hectic day

#####

i got this game for my girlfriend as a gift for her graduation
she ignored me for 1 week while playing this game non stop while she wasnt ignoring me she was streaming this game on discord while we talk after been influence by her i ended buying the game for myself now im the one that is playing it non stop and ignoring her too the only bad thing is i cant play this coop yet
but great game cant wait for the rest of the updates

#####

its not a 10 release because game is not complete at all

its very buggy 
not all planned characters are romancable now will be in 2024 i guess
planned some story changes i hope they will not break save again
some quests and items still have tbd text

playing from ea and i think its still is ea good potential not a release state but already a release price not recommending for now

#####

h1game is not finished it has major bugs and missing assets and segments do not buyh1

as a kickstarter backer i am severely disappointed and ashamed at the state of the game especially after it showed so much promise
despite getting out of early access and being version 10 coral island is not finished in the slightest
worst part about it is that the early game is good until youre a couple of seasons in which is why i assume its been reviewed positively recently i suspect most recent reviews just havent gotten to the unfinished parts
im talking bugs aplenty missing or incomplete features and even whole segments of the game that lead to nowhere and dont leave an impact missing assets such costumes characters mention they are wearing and map portraits placeholder texts such as tbd and playername underwater critters using the wrong models and just looking like a bunch of buggy textures floating around poor performance in certain areas pets not moving and so much more

progression is really weird as well
for example getting a stable and a horse to move faster takes a fair bit of investment yet you unlock free fast traveling to pretty much all major and important areas really quickly making the horse more of a nuisance to use rather than an upgrade especially since getting off the horse not only has a weird default keybind that is on the other side of the keyboard k but also because the animation is slow and you cant forage on a horse youre better off staying on foot and using space bar to dash which the game never tells you you can do
the game also fails to tell you what to do to achieve certain things there are these withered trees that you obviously have to restore but despite having restored some of them i have no idea as to how and when it happened i just randomly noticed they changed while walking by none of the npcs mention it and there doesnt seem to be any reward either
there are also these weird magic cutscenes that sometimes happen during the night indicating some kind of change or happening that i have no idea what causes them or what they do nothing seemed to have changed when going to the area they happened in there was only a single time where i found a new path that was unlocked but there didnt seem to be anything there except more blocked off areas and a shortcut to a place i can fast travel to
rewards for progressing are a joke as well altar bundle rewards think of community building rooms in stardew are basically useless i havent fully completed any of the 4 altars and only a handful of bundles inside of them but what ive gotten so far has not been worth it whatsoever oooh wow 8 seeds i can use next season thanks game ill subtract them from the 500 i need to buy sure stardew has the same rewards but there you at least know youre working towards a bigger unique reward that isnt just this is pretty now which seems to be a theme in ci
mining is yet another issue coral island splits up their mines into 4 different caverns with different themes but in actuality they all pretty much look and feel the same each mine houses one of the 4 different ore but heres where the issue comes in because you can only find a single type of ore in each mine you often have to go back to earlier mines to grind for copper which is tedious and ore nodes spawn way too infrequent and reward way too little ore im talking whole floors without a single node and each node can give as little as 1 ore and you need 5 to smelt into a bar and the reward chests you get every 10 or so floors are not exciting either you get like a couple of craftable and in most cases useless tools in the first few but outside of that its just the same food item over and over and over you get 2 weapons across all the chests in the game a hammer which is inferior to the starting sword in every single way and an upgraded sword which is decent but you can buy an equally strong or even better weapon for just a little bit of money the only real useful thing you get out of these chests are the explosives but even those arent too expensive to craft
and the combat in the mines is a joke its floaty unsatisfying and unengaging you just take the sword and spam left click until the enemy dies no enemies are a real threat to you they all die pretty quickly and are fought the same way this also makes the tools i mentioned earlier pretty useless and a waste of time and resources even when an enemy gets to attack their attacks are just as floaty and buggy for example some enemies still hurt you long after their attack animation appears to be over and others can still attack you in their death animation

but what about the other activities

farming is alright
i barely touched ranching it didnt seem to be worth the effort
fishing is slow and boring i always seem to find the same fish no matter whether i fish in the ocean lake or rivers
bug catching is unrewarding at best and frustrating at worst with some bugs fleeing as soon as youre in catch range
diving oh geez i mentioned diving not only is diving linked to one of the unfinished segments of the game but said unfinished segment is your reward for enduring the slowest most repetitive chore of the entire game your movement speed underwater is so slow and there is trash beverywhereb that you need to remove while it does do a good job at getting the games message across it doesnt work well in the concept of this game everything is just so slow from walking to removing to having and having to hit some trash piles multiple times and your reward a confusing area with no purpose and unfinished characters oh and kelp which is the only reason to put up with this crap as its used for crafting and upgrades but you find that littered all over the place
super confusingly there are also 4 different underwater caverns which have to be unlocked by clearing out the zones theyre in but they house nothing but rooms to farm infinite trash even more insulting considering the one character that mentions these caves tells you that they might be of value to you and the caves once again show that this game is unfinished since theyre nes zeldalike square rooms with doors on each wall said doors only open once you clear enough trash but there is no feedback when they open no sound no animation the stones blocking the path just get deleted in plain sight and the other rooms also just contain more trash
completing the underwater quest seems to unlock another quest that seems to allow you to turn into a merfolk and hopefully fixes the movement speed issue and maybe fleshes out the place more but that is only after you explored and cleared the entire map already at this point i was fed up with this section and never went back to diving except in the rare instances where i needed kelp maybe it fleshes out the underwater kingdom more who knows but the path leading up to it is so slow repetitive and unenticing that i simply couldnt be bothered to do that now as well just for the bchanceb that there might be something more to that area after all everything leading up to this quest pointed towards a big fat no

i really wanted to like or at least finish the game despite its state but i only managed to get a few days into my first winter before finally waving my white flag
i gave up once i ran into a bug that created duplicates of all my tools in my inventory that you cant delete drop or sell all i did was try to enchant the tools and once i opened the menu they just appeared
i also read that there is a major issue during the winter festival that will straight up permanently delete your tools if you dont watch out

bnoneb of these issues would be actual issues if the game was still in early access and marked as unfinished but this is unacceptable

tldr check the title

#####

its for games like this that id like a neutral assessment
the game does what it sets out to do well its a great farming game with unique doses of its setting that are quite interesting both culturally and in terms of the diversity of creatures and the part about cleaning up the oceans is quite interesting at least at first
you dont have to play much to see how shallow many things have become during the games development most likely because the game is still quite incomplete
unlike other games where completing challenges in this case the altar of offerings equivalent to the community center in stardew valley unlocks new content and features many of these are incomplete here when you unlock npcs like pandazen its a beautiful region but empty and with nothing of interest beyond the first glance
likewise the ocean is the same frustration the mermaid kingdom is interesting at first glance and then you realize that you can barely interact with the npcs or theres nothing to do there
in the end the game leaves you with the feeling that it could have been excellent but its mediocre due to the large number of incomplete things
i hope that over time ill be able to change this assessment and really recommend the game to my friends

#####

this game is unfinished and should still be in early access do not buy it in its current state

#####

gameplay

plays like a 3d heavily modded stardew valley exactly like stardew valley 

i supported this game through kickstarter i did not know it was going to be an exact copy of stardew valley 

the main plot is the same big corporation comes into to ruin the natural beauty except tweaked to fit the location

ive only seen one festival but it was exactly the same as stardew valley luau with a potluck soup
edit i have played another festival and it was very original and i commend the developers for their creativity 

the secondary plot is the same you donate items to bundles to unlock new areas and restore the community 

the mining system operates the same way the npc gifting and hearts system works the same 

the house upgrades operate the same way

theres a small ape that sells you stuff in an abandoned house in the woods just like in stardew valley and hes named concerned monkey

i know a lot of people say oh all farming sims are like that yes i understand that however that does not mean that every farming sim is a copy of the last popular one that came out

there is a difference between being inspired by a game and copying a game

stardew valley did not copy harvest moon it was inspired by it 
coral island has copied from stardew valley and animal crossing plotforplot mechanicformechanic

when i back a project for 45 i expect it to not cheaply plagiarize from a game i have already sunk 15k hours into 

this game has the potential to be great i like its diverse cast of characters and the diving aspect is grand however the obvious copying has made me incredibly disappointed in this game so far

##########################################################################

computer demand

i dont know anything about computers at all however i do know that this game should not eat up that much memory

i cant have any other application open while playing this game 

discord no 
steam no 
google so i can refer to the wiki absolutely not 

this is the only game i have ever encountered this kind of memory demand with 

i had this computer built so i could play games like ark survival evolved on max graphics

this little farming sim should not break my computer the way it does

##########################################################################

as i continue to play the game and as i gets updated i will put more information here andor correct my original opinion 

edit #1 ive played a few more of the festivals and it was something new and i very much enjoyed it 

a lot of people say that all farming games are like this yeah the vibes are similar but as i stated before when i spend 45 on a game i expect it to have a unique and interesting plot this does not so im very disappointed in it 


#####

seriously obsessed with this game i love that you can slow down time so each day is basically as long as you want and that you can make the mining fight hit to aggro so you only fight when you want to its so relaxing to clean the ocean there are definitely bugs and missing content but its a great start and im excited to see what else is added in the future

#####

even though i played it quite a while i can not recommend it coral island in its current state is full of bugs and some of them are game breaking also some of the achievements cant be unlocked the discussion forum on steam is full of people reporting their bugs and even though the community is really nice and helpful there is not much in terms of fixes from the devs this shouldnt have been a 10 version

#####

this game is so beautiful and cozy to play i love how all the characters are written and amount of detail this game has so much potential  i say that because its kinda obvious playing that its not fully complete also their are a few bugs and it crashes causing you to start the whole day over which can be irritating if you made a lot of progress

#####

i heard about coral island very early on in its development but couldnt participate in the kickstarter campaign myself ive been following its development ever since so i was among the many people who eagerly awaited its ea release needless to say my expectations have been blown out of the water this game is clearly a work of love and the developers artists and the entire team behind it are passionate people with a genuine desire to create an innovative and inclusive sim farming game while paying homage to the genres classic titles the easter eggs of the concerned monkey selling the og farmer hat had me smiling like an idiot 

im also very happy to see they decided to lay off a little bit on the stardew aesthetic that was very strong in my opinion in the early images and concept art shown to the public and included so many elements reminiscent of their own culture the game is filled with indonesian dishes and recipes as well as cultural and architectural elements which makes it even more rich and special compared to many other games of the same genre which end up being completely bland and soulless due to their generic aesthetic and game design i hope it will keep on developing its own identity over time 

the character 3d models and the character portraits are absolutely stunning and the game offers a diverse cast of lovable and interesting npcs from different backgrounds ethnicities and cultures 

that being said i think the game could have benefited from a few more weeks or months of development before an official ea release as it is still filled with a lot of bugs to the point where it is sometimes very hard to keep on playing some of the quests are completely broken on my end i couldnt complete those that required cleaning the ocean and selling a certain amount of eggs and milk and many of the furniture items dont work properly for example its possible to buy a calendar so that the player doesnt have to check the town board every day to keep track of the npcs birthdays but its impossible to interact with it once placed inside the players homeand on that note any of the furniture that can be placed on the walls cant be moved properly afterwards some dialogues and heart events also dont show properly etc 

the game also crashed several times while i was playing and since there is no way to save manually which isnt wrong per se im not asking for manual save to be implemented i had to restart entire days from the very beginning which is kind of annoying when you had a very productive day of building fences and patwhays around your farm or when you were only one level away from an elevator floor in the mines i also think the game urgently requires some kind of tutorial as me and many other players have struggled to figure out how to use some of the game mechanics 

still the available playable content is already quite extensive and offers dozens of hours of gameplay it is also diversified enough to keep it interesting the devs are also very eager and open though there could have been a clearer indication ingame of whats not yet available or implemented and they have a discord where they regularly give updates and information all in all i think coral island has a lot of potential and could become one of the best indie games released in 2022

if you want a more seamless experience id suggest waiting a little bit before investing 25 bucks in it but for me the amount of time and love that went into this game is clearly worth the price

#####

this game is just as good if not better than i was expecting long anticipated and super fun cant wait until they add more content cause once you start playing you dont want to stop 

#####

the farming is good not much different than any other farming sim as well as the animal care aspects as well that is where the samey feel stops the recycle mechanic for trash the fact that picking up the trash matters and crafting with it so you actually want to go searching for the garbage is very unique the diving feature is smooth and underwater area is beautifully crafted you can tell careful meticulous care was taken with each aspect of the land mines and sea the scaling system for your town is easy to understand and improve your rankings the developers honestly listen to the feed back of their community and implement ways that dont make it to hard or easy to complete your objectives the variety of the characters are amazing as well the unique look at what a spirit is and the culture references are amazing there still a bit of a balance issue in my opinion with things being sold for so little but over all the game feels looks and plays stunningly definitely a triple a game being sold for an indie price in my opinion i highly recommend this game to anyone

#####

you will hit the content wall pretty early on in the game but the potential is absolutely there

the combat and mining segments are extremely barebones relationship events are not present for most of the interesting characters

the farming aspect is very satisfying

its a fun game as it is but you can definitely tell its unfinished in its current state

#####

i very rarely write reviews as most of my sentiments are usually shared by some group of people in the reviews 

however with coral island im absolutely bewildered that people find it lacking while yes there are still bugs typos getting stuck running in one direction and sometimes just a complete controller disconnect i still think this game has so much to offer

as an avid player of both harvest moon friends of mineral town stardew valley and a skimmer of all other farming sims coral island just adds to the goodness of these beloved games i think 
i write this review not for those potentially seeking to buy it but for the creators

i want you to know how much i love the attention to details that have been given so far in interior design fashion of the characters the amount of items that can be made from your farming and the dialogue 

the dialogue is my favorite i think heh from my understanding its come a far way and for some its lack luster but if any of them have played stardew or harvest moon and no hate to either there but most end at two lines at most with very surface level lines in my opinion or perhaps i lose interest in their conversations faster because theyre only a couple of lines where as with these characters i feel its an actual exchange and they certainly make me feel things which is more than i can say for the others whoever is writing the dialogue i think is doing amazing at developing these characters personalities because i can actually tell who id want to be friends with and who id give major side eyes to mark bree and walter 
in fact instead of putting relationship building off like i usually do in these games i felt pulled to actually go out and meet these characters and learn their backgrounds even if im not trying to date them its a huge bonus that everyone is so well designed  im legitimately torn between three bachelors rn 

i love the acknowledgement of asian cultures both in the food you can make artisan goods clothing and storyline wakuus cutscenes made me feel seen despite not having super similar issues but that type of struggle is just not seen most of these farming sim games 
also the general nods to pop culture is kinda fun too and i super appreciate them 

i love how much there is to explore and it seems there are parts of the game that maybe i have unlocked yet or are in development still which makes me excited that there may be more hours to come im on year three now just made it yesterday and the overarching story of pufferfish is progressing so im interested in seeing how that plays out ive yet to beat bobby who also boils my blood  well done writercharacter developers once again 

that being said ive intentionally tried to not complete everything as quickly as possible the way i feel i start to do with harvest moon and sdv in the past so that might be helping me enjoy the experience even more but truth be told i think its just how thoughtful the game has been designed so far that makes me want to settle in and really appreciate the details youve all put in it instead of becoming a money making hog trying to accumulate mass amounts of wealth  get married have two children and be done with the game

anyhoo well done so far i cannot wait to see how this game continues to improve thank you for this beauty



#####

buyer beware 
as of 1711 this is a 10 in name only 
part of the story line is wip you can check the forum about a 6th something which i wont spoil to you is a work in progress

some stuff which looks like puzzle are actually non active and do nothing some other like the undersea cave youa re told are full of resource  they are not they are just an infinite cave labyrinth with 99 only trash i saw 3 kelps total among 12 room of trash bags 

at this point i am wonder if i should continue or wait 3 to 6 month that they are finished

if it was a finished product  i would definitively thumb it up but with the unfinished part i cannot recommedn it in good faith

for now i cant recommend this game it is missing so much content its unfathomable that they had the galls to call this game fully released this is still very much in early access even though they claim otherwise there is achievements you cant even get yet because they either havent implemented it yet or are locked behind contents that inst there yet lets say gift all npcs i have full hearts with all intractable npcs on the surface no hidden ones nothing yet achievement isnt unlocked and the merfolk you cant give gifts nor gain hearts with yet
there are cooking recepies that are bugged and crashing the game so that one isnt possible either 
we have crafting recepies that havent unlocked even with having bought everything there could move also outdoor area etc i assume its hidden behind another content that isnt available the savannah that is supposed to be unlocked after the rare bundle is done it dont
all animal products sold nope i have had everything that can walk in my coop and barn with a rank town gotten golden in eggs and milk small big etc etc nope
i could keep going on here in the stage this game is in its simply not a game i can recommend and that makes me sad because i enjoyed what i could but when you keep hitting your head into unfinished content then a lot of the enjoyment goes out the windows because i bought the game in that assumption this is a finished game its not

#####

having played stardew valley and dinkum this is by far my favorite farminglife sim been following coral island since it was first announced on kickstarter and i have nothing but praise for how receptive stairway games is towards players feedback and suggestions despite the ea bugs coral island is undeniably a new studios labor of love bonus points for the southeast asian elements included in the game
edited to add that im absolutely in love with the ost

#####

you move to an island full of hot islanders get to swim with merfolk give offerings to a goddess befriend giants and live your best coastal life while running a farm

#####

amazing game thats nowhere near a 10 release you might still enjoy whats available and i have that said im not recommending this game to people i know until its closer to actually being finished the amount of wip stuff or promised content that hasnt been implemented boggles my brain for a game thats full price and finished

please bear in mind that ill change this to a hearty thumbs up when this game actually reaches a point where its finished

#####

love this game fantastic artwork and the landscape is beautiful the storyline is really lovely as well

what it needs
needs a button to autoplay dialogue
being able to save when you want the game days are far too long to only be able to save when your character sleeps
movement feels really clunky ingame and not in the fun kind of way

overall highly recommend this game as its very relaxing and fun

#####

highly recommend to give this game a try but id like to see more content for sure 

 please keep in mind only around 30 of this game is finished since its an early access a lot of things needs to be added and worked on in my opinion
 i  enjoyed the variety of things you can do
 you have to work quite a lot to get all possible upgrades and make progress in the game which is a good and wellpaced so im taking my sweet time with everything
 great atmosphere decent gameplay goals are pretty much clear and doesnt rush you in general
 i would love to see more background around dateable npss right now their stories and side events feels a bit flat and not as interesting as it could be really love current artworks and designs they have this is exactly what sold this game to me in the first place
 ive seen a lot of reviews including complains about crashes and errors im currently using geforce gtx 1660 oc 6gb  intelr coretm i510400f cpu  290ghz build and havent faced any issues on my end so far   
 some updates takes quite some time so waiting for the new content in the game could be tough sometimes

i would recommend to try this game by yourself but if you want a full experience better to wait till game is finished

peace

#####

while its a nice harvest moon  stardew valleylike farming sim with an interesting twist in regards to the diving gameplay  i find it rather frustrating that the game despite being released clearly is still in a stage where it is not finished
in some places the map is completely grey and some side characters have no images for their map markers there are clearly places that are supposed to be puzzles but that also have no solution at this point because there is nothing implemented besides the interactable mechanism with which to solve something that doesnt exist
oh and its not even possible to marry the merpeople yet despite big announcements about how marriage was working now and specific merpeople being dateable on paper

now would this game still be early access id recommend it anyway as it certainly is playable and kind of fun but calling this a released game  10 version with not even a comment about the clearly missing features some of which were promised during the kickstarter camaign to be included for release at this point despite calling it released is rather meh

i can forgive simple bugs even after a release as you can never catch all of them but missing features that were clearly intended to be there this ought to at least be addressed in some news honestly
and as someone who backed this game on kickstarter originally i feel quite sad that this is what they would call a released game 
might update this review in case the game actually does get to a state that feels as finished as eg stardew valley did at its release assuming ill play it again around that time

#####

if you like animal crossing little wood or stardew valley this is a great choice for you 

pros
artwork  character design  you can see they put extra thought into including people of all kinds my only gripe is i wish there were more options for dark mysterious types to romance

combat  combat is fun and simple swinging your weapon is satisfying with the movement

lots to do  at first it seemed a little overwhelming but you can really pick and choose what you want to accomplish

level system  the more you do the more you level that particular tree

music  nice and relaxing

story  main story seems pretty basic but with so much to explore and so many characters to meet it doesnt need to be too complicated

cons
this game is in alpha so im sure many of these will change

 minor bugs that can sometimes break immersion

 a bit confusing at first no clear tutorial on where to find things such as crafting menus ect

 the days feel a little too quick time flows a bit too quickly

 storage systems work nicely for inserting items into chest but taking out into your inventory can be a bit awkward

 the main antagonist of the story is literally named karen like i get it but does it have to be so literal you can see this trope throughout the story most of the time its funny but for some reason this just kinda made me roll my eyes a bit


overall really great relaxing game you can definitely get lost in this one for hours at a time

#####

im only 25hrs in but i can already see where this is going and its great  if i was the creator of stardew valley i would be pissed  this game is stardew valley right down to one of the first missions is to build a scare crow or going to the mine and breaking variations of rocks to find the hole with the rope to go to the next level  its the same game  i dont want to use the phrase updated because stardew is designed to look and feel a certain way its not dated  this has in my opinion more story more direction more variation of locals and scenery but the same hook  i do like this game better as i like the art style better not much of a pixel graphic person and i like how this feels like there is more impact you make on the world  i havent played hundreds of hours of stardew because its fun but i think its the art  i can definitely see me putting in a lot of hours in this game

#####

very relaxing and beautiful game to enjoy with artwork that is very appealing and characters that are diverse the scenery is just beautiful while i wish i had more color options for a horse the animals you can own are pretty diverse and adorable being able to customize your houses exterior and interior is a plus

#####

if you like these types of cozy farm sims youll have a great time its a beautiful game

however taking this game out of early access and having a 10 release when there are main story missions that still say wip this game is not finished and the devs should not have pretended it was dont reward devs that pull this stunt with your money just dont there are tons of good cozy farms sims out there you dont need to play this one

#####

i just cant stop wont stop this game reminds me of the og farming game harvest moon but they did so much more in coral island with the ocean and everything the island is really breathtaking the people of the town are insanely gorgeous i cant wait to marry one of them lol seeing lots of indonesian culture in the game for the first time really put a smile on my face

i am sooo excited and cant wait for any future updates iand please asap loli hoping the developer will continue to impress me as they did with early access content because this game has a loooot of potential im a proud indonesian here

#####

i know this is early access but this feels too early to even justify early access release it takes place in a tropical setting unlike stardew valley but in reality it just feels like it is taking place in a tropical resort in the middle of america nothing feels tropical beneath the surface of palm trees and beaches the crops you grow are not tropical crops the seasons are temperate with a snowy winter which makes no sense for a tropical climate 

overall it feels like they tried to create a setting to separate it from stardew valley but the fact that they couldnt get even the basics correct shows that they put very little effort into research and just copied stardew valley at a surface level while in some cases making the features fundamentally less enjoyable 

i will return in a year to see if the game as improved and i am willing to change my review if that is the case

#####

if youre looking for an adventure game that wont disappoint coral island might just be what you need with my  40 hours of gameplay this game promises to keep you entertained for hours on end the graphics are stunning and the storyline is engaging and immersive youll feel like youre really on a deserted island trying to survive and thrive in the midst of nature

but coral island isnt just about survival youll also get to interact with other characters on the island each with their own unique personalities and stories to tell you can build relationships with them help them out with tasks and even start a romance if you so choose

the game also offers a variety of activities to keep you busy from farming and fishing to crafting and cooking youll need to manage your resources wisely and make strategic decisions to ensure your survival and success

overall coral island is a fantastic game thats definitely worth a try with its beautiful graphics engaging storyline and wide range of activities youre sure to have a great time playing it so why not give it a shot and see what adventures await you on the island

#####

if you love stardew valley and animal crossing and want to play a game that is a combination of those two with very few original ideas this sure is for you my review says ive played it for 18 hours its been more like 5 hours but i was offline i gave this game a fair shot

things that are a blatant imitationcopy of stardew practically all of the starting dialogue after you arrive at the farm  you show up with the mayor the carpenter is there they remark that the place is a mess you even start out with the same first quests  plant 10 seeds water them and meet the villagers the layout of the farm  the house is in the upper right corner as is the shipping box and the plot itself is strewn with rocks trees grass and wood many of the characters are deeply similar  two little kids who run around together a nerdy girl etc the community center idea of stardew has been shifted slightly to the left  you still have to complete bundles of items to get rewards and fix the island but this time youre saving a goddess not just the town the mines  slime enemies copper ore and to add insult to injury there are several level maps that are basically mirror images of stardews rather than a greedy supermarket theres greedy oil drillers but the plot setup is still the same the first neighborhood event is a potluck where you could put something into a pot  to anyone who plays stardew thatll sound real familiar theres an abandoned cabin in the woods where you can buy hats theres a caravan in the woods that shows up every so often where you can buy specialty items there are others but these are the ones that stand out to me most immediately

things that are a blatant imitationcopy of animal crossing new horizons the fishing good lord  the shadow fish in the water is literally the exact same this game doesnt even try to change it bug collecting  same as acnh fossil collecting  same as acnh all of the above can be donated to the museum which you guessed it can be expanded as you donate more new things the stores  theres the classic clothing boutique but also another shop where items seem to rotate through theres also an island rating system and to be honest i didnt play that much acnh so these are the only similarities there that i noticed but im sure there are more

original ideas you get to go clear trash from the ocean and the villagers have different names 

thats all ive seen so far

look this is a charming little game the art style is pretty and im sure i would have enjoyed it had i not already played enough stardew and animal crossing to see the obvious places where this game not only takes inspiration but outright copies them maybe itll get better with time as it comes out of early access but right now it just feels like a ripoff of two other well loved games with very little original content of its own if youre okay with that and if you loved those other games enough that you just want to see different retexturings of them then this game will probably appeal but to spend 25 for a game that is essentially a collection of other peoples ideas is absolutely not worth it to me

#####

while i very much enjoy this game and have already gotten in my opinion my moneys worth i cant recommend it just because they recently released this game as 10 the full version when one of the main story lines is not even finished some of the content that has been added since the last ea version is a bit barebones and needs a lot more work

i dont know if humble pushed this release or if the ci team decided to release the current build as 10 its most certainly still an unfinished game theyre just charging you more for it now

#####

i really love this game i was having a lot of fun but then my save got deleted i dont know how but its enough to not make me want to play please be careful with our saves i really do like this game and this is really upsetting

#####

my first 30mnt on this game and  its already make me disappointed

how can stairway games remove the early acces status  i mean  this game is totally unfinished  so so far away from complete to be sold as solid v10  so much basic feature that should be in v10 are missed like unfinished story  some minor bugs from early access that are still exist  as example from my case the bgm and ambience around the farm or around the town  around woods suddenly stoped which make the game totally gone quite execept for the char footsteps that can be heard out loud and some button are not funtioning properly or sometimes swapped with other button when using joystick  as for my case during the decorating mode  it was written in instruction hud below that rright analog supposed to be used to navigate the cursor movement  but its turn out that lleft analog to navigate the cursor not the otherwise and some button are not functioning precisely to the instruction just like the analog which are swapped

my conclusion 
coral island v10 just an early access game with fulll game price compared to my time at sandrock v10 that are already well prepared with completed single player story most of the bugs from early access fixed  the game is in solid form for v10


but ofc this game is totally great  combination of stardew  story of seasons series with beautiful designed  themed with southeastern asia lore based character and community this game have so much potential and i wish for the game to become whole sooner so we can enjoy coral island fullest experience as farming simulator that we never found before

#####

while the game at its core is fun and the art is great this is severely unpolished for a 10 release filled with bugs and typos main storylines are still incomplete npc dialogue are lacking and repetitive controls are unnatural and all over the place just not enjoyable at this current state hoping the devs address our feedback and work out these issues eventually because they made everyone reset their save files for a 10 version that shouldve stayed longer in early access

#####

still needs a lot of work to be a finished game but the content that is already available is a ton of fun

#####

this is a very competent harvest moonstardew valley style farming game  the reason i cant recommend it is the fact that they are calling it 10 and no longer early access is extremely misleading  there are tons of major features that are not implemented and the game feels unfinished  two of the five bundle unlocks are not in the game some of the npcs and enemy types straight up dont exist  given that ive played over 100 hours its clear that what is in the game is enjoyable but the game is definitively not feature complete and should not be called a 10 release  i recommend waiting until the game is actually finished before playing  otherwise you will frequently run into incomplete storylines and game systems

#####

game is great but not finished multiple questlines have no ending as of writing still a very fun experience festivals are very creative and all the typical farming sim activities are done wonderfully game is quite buggy also had a few crashes and i think memory leaks

would only recommend if on sale

#####

10 is a scam release alot of content unfinished with wip or tbd alor of bugs wrong translates i love this game but i cant support a scam release to be sell at the holydays

#####

i made a urlhttpsyoutubebbo5tqypwcreview video hereurl if you prefer to watch 



coral island is a really ambitious farming life sim game from indonesia dev basically all features from all farming games are here from different town to explore a lot of characters 70 people multiplayer until a feature where your kid will be able to grow up

but this is the early access version and a lot of features mentioned above were not included yet

bvisuals 810b
the graphic is amazing as an early access and first game ever made by the dev i dont know how they able to nailed this look

bgameplay 710b
gameplay loop is really enjoyable so far the only thing why i dont rate it higher because a lot of features arent still included yet you can do basic stuff like farming ranching mining and diving the sea to clean the corals
a lot of qol implemented from stardew valley  stardew valley mods too which is helpful

bother 1010b
this is personal score from me because they include a lot of indonesia representation and references in the game from batik javanese stuff balinese stuff indonesian foods and the famous indonesian balap karung
its probably the first time that an international wide game have this much indonesian references in it other that ghosts in horror games and im proud

boverall 810b
when the game release fully next year and if they deliver all the features they mentioned before im confident that this will be the next big farming life sim game after stardew valley

for now its a really enjoyable early access game and in my opinion worth the money

#####

the game is indubitably fun but its not complete and it being listed as a full game instead of early access is quite dishonest from the devs

i dont recommend playing unfinished games which this review represents strikecongrats on making me spend money on an early access game i guessstrike

#####

wait 10 is plastered all over the store page im 7 hours in and im just now finding out the main story isnt even completed

#####

the game is not complete despite the company claiming this is version 10 even the main quest ends in a wip note

#####

this has the potential to be a really excellent addicting farm sim game  it combines elements of other stellar games in this genre including wylde flowers stardew valley animal crossing dave the diver etc and even improves on some of those elements  i especially enjoy the ability to explore clean up and forage the ocean floor  there is a large interesting and diverse case of npcs  the artwork and soundtrack are beautiful  the controls work well for the most part with the exception of when precise movement is required for certain minigames and things like plowing or moving objects which can be really frustrating  

while i do recommend this game i would warn that there are still several bugs that can make gameplay very frustrating like artisan machines getting stuck in a loop where you cant obtain the product or get rid of the machine and have to reboot the game disappearing tools which was recently fixed disappearing home furniture or inability to place furniture youve purchased quests from npcs requiring items that arent yet available in the game a super expensive online shopping computer that doesnt work at all ive read the devs are working to fix this also the game only saves when you sleep so a few times ive lost a whole lot of gameplay when there was a crash perhaps wait until a major update or a sale to purchase

#####

i backed this game on kickstarter for the dragon pet and the merfolk the art is gorgeous the characters are interesting theres loads of activities to do theres interesting lore and the multiplayer gives me and my brother a chance to play together im not sure if there will be couch coop or not but even if it wont it will be a good game to play with my younger sister who is mentally disabled
i played the alpha for over 200 hours and the progress ive witnessed with this dev team is amazing i also appreciate that they dont just focus on the marriage candidates but give all the townsfolk the same amount of love i also really like that the marriage candidates are all different even the twins have unique personalities and arent just copy paste versions of each other and i find it very cool that suki already has a daughter that we can bond with
the children are fully fleshed out as well i enjoy talking to them and having their cutscenes they act like believable kids im not saying im looking for 100 realism in a game that has merfolk and mythical creatures i just appreciate the care they put into every aspect of the game i cant think of anything i really dislike about the game maybe how slow it is to make money in the beginning if i had to pick something but theres no time limit on the important things so its not that much of a big deal and theyll have mod support in future so im sure a modder will have a money mod up all in all i enjoy this game so much i bought two versions on kickstarter for me and my brother and after alpha i bought it again on steam i really love this game its up there in my top 5 farming sims

#####

do not buy 
this game is unfortunately still in early access despite the claims of this being the10 update it is full of bugs and is missing a lot of content i want to love it but cannot recommend it in its current state i was waiting for the 10 release and was extremely disappointed that the publisher has pushed this game to release when it just isnt ready

i have just completed the first year of the game and i have mostly completed all the content such as the mines sea cleanup and main quests

the game has interesting characters and some charming story parts but it is dragged down by repeating dialogue and generic lines such as every npc saying just thank you when completing a quest 

the events for the different seasons feel mostly incomplete with lacking acitivites bugs and the minigames are just badly designed some events are incomplete and especially the last event of the year is clearly unfinished as no npcs have any dialogue whatsoever

the mines and the combat is a disaster enemies are no threat and barely react to you when they do they barely do any damage the combat itself feels floaty and lacks impact its apparent that the devs have tried to make varied enemies with different attack patterns etc but the core gameplay is just not good enough for it to make a difference 

the sea cleanup  dives are super repetivive and makes you do the same puzzle over and over again clear trash to find a lantern then clear more trash to make a path for the lantern you will be doing the same exact thing the first time you do a dive as you are doing during your last dive 

the farming aspects are fine but not good enough to carry the game when everything else feels lacking you can grow many different corps raise animals and craft stuff there are some decent customization options for the house and farm

the best part of this game is the art style and music the artists have really knocked it out of the park and it saddens me that the rest of the game is not up to par with it

#####

full release  incomplete game

dont be fooled by reviews you have to progress before you realize its unfinished im an early backer and they made millions on kickstarter whats available is good and plentiful but its disingenuous to do a full release they have no excuse for releasing incomplete and should have stayed in early access

#####

i like the game a lot but my biggest gripe is the lack of controller support i like to play farminglife sims whilst relaxing in bed and it really bothers me that this isnt available straight off the bat still i understand that its in early access but i really hope that it becomes available in the next major update im not a fan of the running and gathering animations just seems a little weird to me

despite those two flaws im enjoying playing it

edit also this game absolutely needs a either a save whenever or autosave just like controller support theres no reason why this shouldnt be available

#####

i like a lot of other people love the concept and the genuine good art style in this game but that being said this game is not at all finished it truly feels like i am playing a demo at best and a buggy one at that i am hoping the devs are still working on finishing the story at some point because it right now is not worth the 2999 price point in the slightest id give it a solid 510 and if theyd simply complete the story it would boost my score to a 710 ill just play stardew valley instead

#####

sadly at the courant state i cannot recommend the game they slapped the 10 on it but the game is not done it is good for an early access game but not a full release 

there are quests that end in wip a lot of bugs like all your tools duplicating when you access the enchanting table invisible and misplaced assets after moving them with the architect desk after clearing the oil vines some of them are still there just the not visible u can not walk there items duping when in a chest in barn while upgrading sound issues when u tap out the game that persist until reloading the game 

prices for stuff just seems not balanced while the sell price for osmium ore got cut in half from 300 to 150 it is still the fastest and easiest way to make money aging barrels somehow cannot be crafted you can only get 2 and the aging of wine takes 6 days good luck getting anything done there just found out they can be craftet so this one is obsolete solar panels at some points just stop producing batteries until you tare them down and rebuild them 

and dont get me started with combat its a joke and i dont think anybody testetd it you get hit after u killed the enemy you get hit after clearly leaving the big white circle befor it gets red enemies get themselves stuck in walls hits dont register  luckily the difficulty in combat is so easy that it does not matter if you get hit or not

i could go on but that should proof the point that the game is not finished give it a year or 2 maybe it is done by then

#####

i really want like this game but i cant support them releasing this game as 10 when there are tons of bugs from the beta and alpha version are still in it
no to mention that the story overall ends with a wip



#####

valorant is inspired by counter strike and other shooter game a copy project m  have a nice day everyone

#####

coral island at a glance has almost everything i wanted from a farming sim  great looking and diverse characters a mixture of real and fantastic elements a rare tropical setting etc the game also tackles real ecosystem problems however the game felt very mismanaged during early access leading to it being released 10 while missing major content the devs almost doubled the price to catch the holiday sale number with an unfinished game that alone can tell you more about the project than anything else im going to say

but besides being unfinished the game feels lacking in many crucial aspects that are not easily fixed the writing for instance is subpar many key characters i was excited about dont really have any character arc take kenny and rafael for example some early spoilers be warned from the moment you meet them you know they are nice guys but after several personal events about them and more than halfway through their heart progression what more have you learned about them nothing they are still nice guys without any nuances their stories are focused entirely on something besides their personalities i still dont know why rafael wants to forge this magic hammer or why kenny wants to decipher this scroll it feels completely random compare this to stardew valley you learn so much about each characters motivations and dreams and you see their growth with your own eyes

the game also fails to capture the gravity of ecosystem problems basically all you need to do in the game is to find some kind of magic altar donate random plants to the goddess and the ecosystem is fixed it sends a wrong kind of message oh the goddess will revitalize the island and the mermaids will fix the oil spillage no lessening damage done to the ecosystem requires knowledge and a lot of work its not easy and not magical i almost wish they havent put the focus of the game on this topic when they arent capable of getting it right

one last thing the game classified tomatoes as fruit tomatoes are the fruit part of the plant just like cucumbers pumpkins chili peppers but if you try to classify it in a culinary sense fruits vs vegetables vs grains its a vegetable this tomatoes are actually fruits thing needs to die its a misunderstanding of the double meanings of the word fruit literally unplayable

#####

the game has the potential to be good once it is fully developed im uncertain why it was released in its unfinished state it could have benefited from at least a few more months in early access currently there are too many unpolished aspects bugs and clunky elements for nonenglish speakers i advise against playing it at this stage as the translations seem to be barely adequate likely done through google translate or another ai translation tool i will update this review if i feel that most of the issues have been addressed but as it stands i cannot recommend the game

#####

main 10 jam pertama seru sih udah ke hook game ini bikin lupa waktu kalo main moga bisa ada update baru lagi secepatnya

#####

my only wish is it was fully released which is spoiled to say because they gave us early access with so much content i love this game so far have sunk many hours in such a short time already finished year one and now just making the bread so im ready for release with a nice boost apparently you keep money and character even if world deletes when it officially releases i highly recommend this game as ive already got my moneys worth out of it and its not even done warning dont go into it thinking you can do romance stuff yet seems im stuck at 5 hearts with my guy and there are no romance vids yet house is limited on upgrades until later date there are a few caps until later updates keep this in mind as far as a pure farm sim goes everything is there

#####

32 hours and one full year in the game and im sure i could have done way more i just concentrated on a few areas that i wanted to max out but there is so much content that you could definitely take way longer

i can say that this is a work of love each cough cough very attractive characters has a background with intriguing story no villager feels the same and the animations make it even better than just waiting in town for your farming hero to come and chat them up they have personality and life 

while noticeable bugs are indeed present it didnt hinder or slow down the experience i believe that in time it could well be one of the more favorable farming sims out there take stardew meets animal crossing and heck even throw in dreamlight valley for a second and you seem to find everything here that gives you exactly what you want i am not going to pit them against each other all of them have pioneered something new and exciting and its wrong to try and place any of them above another classic or new

the game

the farming feels familiar like other sims the reach is longer and thats nice even with the silver upgrade to my watering can i still like the fact that the reach is much better than the hold and wait which in my opinion could be fixed a bit to be a square instead of a line but thats nitpicking at this point 
the gatheringbug hunting mining is all relative to any other cozy farming sim as well not much to say on that except that i have enjoyed filling up the museum that seems to be a much better layout and function than any museum that ive come across yet and the story for it is so nice gave you that warm feelyfeels

diving is new for a farming sim and its clear that this was supposed to be the forefront of the game its gorgeous and massive and quite frankly clearing the land has new definition i have spent far too much time underwater and ive really enjoyed the tediousness of it all i know some wont but i have that ocd factor of needing it clean which makes it way easier to find the materials you need afterwards anyways double bonus 

the seasons are nice knowing that going into winter there isnt much done on the layout and youll be wondering what to do since there isnt a greenhouse option yet but this is the normal time for veterans to upgrade tools and finish out that mine and you can still dive so its nice to have those options if youre a hardcore farmer in the early months 

honestly to make this lengthy review to a wrap the game is great its in early days and its still this wonderful work of love and caring and i cannot wait to see where it goes from here the devs are apparently very active and im not in the discord but from reading others its nice to see that they are ready to listen ready to fix and are even more excited about their new upcoming features to share with us seems like it was worth the 2 year wait and the wait can continue on for the fact that this first portion was so well done the completed game is going to be quite the masterpiece

#####

while im having fun with this game i cannot in good faith recommend paying for this this is a game that should still be in early access massive amounts of content is just missing
dating is just like being friends the halloween festival has dialogue where everyone says theyre wearing costumesbut they never made models for that there are bugs galoreand not the type you can catch
but to me the most egregious is the merfolkocean stuff
to me this is what seemed to be giving the game its own unique spin something that wasnt just a new version of stuff other games have already done andits not finished i mean its therebut thats kinda it the ocean caves are just resource girding zones that are clearly placeholders for something coming later you cant go into any of the buildings in the kingdom you cant talk to most of the merfolk the ones you can you cant even give gifts to which means you cant date them theyre flat out lying about this on the steam page
and all the missing content stuff you wouldnt encounter till after the refund window has passed

the game seems like it will be promising when its finished but they have no right to have taken this out of early access if they cant even be honest on their steam page consumers shouldnt have to join a discord or do further research to find out if a game that claims to be complete is actually complete

#####

i saw this game on kick starter and missed out on backing it so i got early access and i enjoy this game so much its so laid back the art style is so cute and comforting when i got the game i sunk 26hrs into and couldnt stop i highly recommend this  game if you enjoy games like stardew valley and animal crossing

#####

i have very  mixed feelings about this game  on the positive side

the game is beautiful  graphics are detailed and gorgeous and the townies you can interact with are almost too attractive  but no one is complaining  lol  the game has not yet progressed to the phase where romance and marriage are possible so cant say how that will play out   the items you can purchase to decorate your farm are nicely done  there is a lot to do in this game in addition to the standard farm sim activities of planting harvesting fishing bug catching collecting things for the museum and raising animals  diving is an interesting feature and will no doubt play a large part as the game development proceeds   i do like the ecologically positive vibe of the game and there are mysterious island inhabitants to help and a goddess to assist in bringing coral island back to its former grandeur   the museum was thoughtfully created  much in the spirit of the animal crossing new horizons model  you cant get as close to the detail but it is well done    i have the impression that there is much more of interest planned for the final release but we dont yet have access to it  

on the negative side
one is that you cannot save this game until you go to bed every night  i find this very annoying and really hope they change it  two is that the movement in the game is wasd which i am totally comfortable with in a first person game where your view is over the shoulder  but in ci your view is from the side so your character is constantly bumping into things and movement can be quite jerky  they have finally implemented game controller access but that does not help us keyboard players  i dont know if they will ever address this 
 
this game is very much early access  there are many features which are gated as they are not yet completed  quests just die in the middle   skill trees  have been capped and even some of the items that were accessible before the last update have been removed  you can only progress half way in your relationships with townies so gifting them is useless after a certain point  portions of the ocean are inaccessible or have vanished entirely  the last update provided some really great qol improvements such as crafting from storage and decreasing the time it takes for a fish to bite but the game also became unstable afterwards and many players are having crashing issues now  the devs are having an apparently difficult time balancing the challenges of the game with the rewards  the most recent update nerfed practically everything  prices were increased across the board  and the artisan goods makers you can build on your farm had their production rate slowed to about a third of their original speed  this has resulted in basic produce and animal products building up as you cant process them   some fish became ridiculously difficult to catch  profits on artisan goods were dropped  basically pretty much everything players could do that was profitable was seriously diminished  i am assuming this was done in part to slow the players down as they were getting ahead of the games development or making too much money in the devs opinion  but it took all the fun out of the game for me and for others who have commented on the forum

i am not into maxing out cash in a relaxing sim game  but i found this game so frustrating after the most recent update that ive stopped playing for now  it has made me rethink early access purchases in the future   i do think that coral island has a great deal of potential to be an amazing game  there has clearly been a lot of thought and love put into it and at some point may be well worth the price of admission  i am sincerely hoping that the development team can work out the bugs rebalance the production and pricing and finish out the intriguing possibilities in the questlines   i am looking forward to the marriage and family aspects of the game whenever they get there  but for now i cannot recommend buying the game in its current state   id wait for the final release

so update  i picked up the game again after the 10 release to check out the devs progress  hmmmmm  well they improved some things and fleshed out others  you can get further in the various plot lines than before and it seems they finally adjusted fishing so that certain fish are only very difficult to catch instead of impossible  i can tell that pricing and artisan production have also undergone at least some balancing  its still a rough go in the beginning for new players  i was fortunate to start my new game with the cash id made during early access play 
 
the game is still all the positive things i mentioned earlier  the decorations in the town during certain holidays and at the elaborate festivals are just gorgeous  it runs smoother as well although there remain some significant bugs especially on consoles  however it is still very much not done  there are plot lines unfinished areas inaccessible dialogue unpolished dating marriage and family aspects not fully developed the list goes on   some of the cut scenes still seem to have no real purpose and the responses your character has the options to make can be awkward  i have made it through my first few seasons and it took until late fall for my farm to start being profitable  i did have the advantage of not having to worry about initial cash so it will probably take longer for a new player   

all this said  i am going to change my recommendation for purchase from no to yes   no its still not done despite the official release  and yes they still have a lot of work to do with this game which i sincerely hope they do in 2024  but it is a very addictive very beautiful game with many hours of worthwhile things to do and a few truly shining moments  my favorite so far being the spoilergiantsspoiler attempting to do yoga  d  the game is currently on sale for 24 and i think the amount of enjoyment ive gotten out of it is worth that price even though the game isnt finished yet  if the devs dont bring everything this game could be to fruition it would be a crime

#####

i cant recommend this game yet

after almost 300 hours i have found so many things to enjoy about this game diverse and quirky characters wonderful festivals minigames and so much more

however there are some issues that has made me decide to put this game down for the foreseeable future

   bugs for the second time my entire farm has been completely erased due to a pre release bug that just keeps popping based on forum feedback this is common and has set back many players that alongside crashes and other game interrupting really dampens the fun this game offers when you can play it

 story line unfortunately there is a lot to this game that still isnt finished core story and romance options do not have dialogue or anything written out

while the game is fun i dont think i can justify another 200 hours with core content missing or if there is still the possibility of having my play deleted for a third time

i hope i can come back and change my review in the future this game has tons of promise and i think a few months to a year from now it will be worth it

#####

the game is nowhere near finished i would wait to buy it until the devs get it together and actually complete the game

#####

the stuff below this is my old review from the time when the game was first came out on steam most of what i had problems with has been fixed but a few things have popped up first off the placeholder images for things are now gone thats great you can now organise people by different categories you can get pets the town folk have more than one outfit now
the underwater section has changed in how you get to different areas and you can customise farm buildings 

 over all the game feels a lot more polished than before but there are sill some negatives

 i found that both the under water stuff and end of year event need more dialog i find the whole game needs it but those things in particular there are also a few visual improvements that need to be made there is an underwater area that is heavily pixelated in the line work there are also a few speech bubbles that need to fixed the id referral i would also like more colour options for clothing and under water stuff the underwater roots in the last area like to grow back until all the roots are gone 

farm animals still overlap and you walk right through them so you have to wait a bit for them to move i sill would like a update how people are related to one another

over all the game is in a much better place than before and as long as they keep up the work this game will be great



while it is a pretty game theres just to much missing as an early access game so i would hold off on buying it until several large updates come out this game also feels a lot like stardew valley from working a boring job in the big city to taking over your grandparents farm the general store closed on wednesdays to the big bad corporation setting up shop in town

there are too many items using a placeholder image in the wold but shows up fine in inventory i would say about 1 eighth of lootharvestables cut scenes are missing and not one out of the way but main game play one first fall festival festival cut scene as an example a lack of hair styles and clothing when diving there are creatures that look like they block off areas and you have to gift them a item to pass yet half of them its just the model and you can swim right past them theres also a stair case that goes down to another section thats unusable due to being to high off the ground at the bottom meaning you have to take the long way around the same item and path mapping problem can be found in the upgraded museum bug exhibit uppermost left hand corner

character summaries are missing along with being able to see who you can romance in game in the people section or seeing whos related to who in what way you just have to remember everything cant organise people by how much they like you only by alphabetical order the people arent that compelling so there isnt any real reason to interact with them 

the animals like to overlap when they walk around and stay that way for far to long making it hard to interact with both animals cant use tire 2 skills update my run twice and there wasnt a difference until i held down shift to slow down to get a bug then let go then i could run fast speaking of speed if you close the game completely and come back to it later your speed resets to how slow you were at the start of the game until you hold shift and let go so your speed is what it should be until you close the game again  

while i like the game over all theres just a lack of polish all around in this game where it feels more like a demo than early access its definitely not worth the 3399 cad that its listed for on steam and should be half that price like i said at the start put this on the wish list and wait for several big updates to come out before you buy

edit oct 28 22 after almost a in game year i finally got a heart for a romance person and there is a colour difference but if you have the blue light filter on on your monitor its hard to see the nonromance peoples hearts as they are are close in colour to the blue light filter i also find the hearts a bit too small 

forgot to mention that to interact or cut something down you have to have the cursorwhite box on the item if the cursor is past the item there not contact so the axes just phase through trees as an example leading to many a game of find the sweet spot it interact with the thing like going into buildings also fell asleep playing so actual play time is about 2030 hours more updates needed

#####

since this game has now been fully released i decided to edit my original review as so much has changed with the game this game is really fantastic and i havent minded having to start again from the beginning if you played early access just make sure you go into your original save file and youll keep all the money you had to start the new version it makes a huge difference as ive been able to upgrade my bag straight away and buy other items too 
this game has everything you want from a cosy farming sim i can see the stardew valley influence in the offerings at the temple the greenhouse the oil company threatening to take over the island however there are many things that are unique to the game i love the environmentally focused festivals there is a tree planting one and one that focuses on cleaning the beach they are really fun to take part in there is so much to see and do you have the usual staples farming cooking crafting mining fishing and bug catching but there is the addition of diving too i really love the mermaid kingdom that has been added it has its own cast of characters and im looking forward to future updates that will add more to this next year
there is combat in the mines so do be aware of that this has additional monsters added since the full release and is more challenging than it was before as anyone reading my reviews knows i suffer with anxiety and combat in games can trigger me thankfully coral island has an option in the settings menu under combat called hit to aggro if you select this option the monsters will ignore you unless you hit them this means you can avoid combat completely or fight the monsters one at a time and avoid being swamped all in go i find this a fantastic addition and am very grateful it has been included so if you have the same problem as me i highly recommend changing that setting from default to hit to aggro that way you can still enjoy the game
the graphics are colourful and beautiful there is a huge list of characters to get to know a large amount of which are romance options you can decorate your farm inside and out as well as raise animals in your barn and coop there is so much to do in this game with an engaging story running through and plenty of quests to fulfil well worth every penny as there are so many hours of content here this is one of the best cosy farming life sim games out there if you love this kind of game this one is well worth picking up


#####

even though coral island is an overall enjoyable experience i cannot recommend it at this point in time

ive been following the game ever since it appeared on kickstarter and decided id wait for the full release to play it so i can fully enjoy the game with it now being released i was absolutely excited to give it a go  to find out that not only is the story not done but due to bugs extremely limited and hence repetitive dialogue options and parts of the game that are simply not available yet it still feels like an early access game 

the gameplay itself is as addicting as a farming sim can be the artstyle and attention to detail are beyond beautiful but i cant help but feel like there have been some empty promises here as soon as the game reaches the state of a true full release ill be more than happy to change my review to a positive one

#####

what you expect out of a game thats exited early access is at least being able to complete the main storyline however thats not what you get with version 10 it literally tells you that the storyline is still a work in progress wip no mention of this on the store page and they market the game as if its complete it feels like false advertising

of course there are other issues random lags as you traverse the map try to decorate your house or even put new clothing into your wardrobe events triggering when the characters in question arent in the area and its not even the right time tools being duplicated when you try to enchant them display glitches characters skating across the map but those are all fairly minor compared to just not even being able to complete the game itself which is what is societally promised when a game markets itself as version 10 out of early access

i do not recommend anyone get this game unless they are fully aware that this is essentially just a continuation of early access and that you are unlikely to be able to finish the game until well into 2024

#####

the game is lovely  its heavily influenced by stardew valley and harvest moon with a more eastasian feel the characters are memorable and for a cozy farmbuilder game theres a lot to like here

the only reason i am saying this is not recommended for now is that it isnt finished youll reach a point where you cant really progress but more importantly for me  the relationships function is not finished as such there is not much point pursuing the romantic interests in the game yet because its going to be finished later this has meant that i have stopped playing for the time being i will return and update my review and thoughts when its finished

#####

its better now

#####

me my wife and my wifes boyfriend love this game so much we recommend it to everyone

#####

edit 
i actually got a new pc for this game and a few others thinking my computer was the problem its not the memory leak i thought the game had was just how this game runs it is horrifically and very poorly optimised and absolutely not good enough for a finished project  regardless of content 


i got this as a christmas present from a friend

the game is 10 but has no dating marriage or children mechanic despite displaying 25 npcs as single for the entirety of the game later heart events on friendships say coming soon and its impossible to give some npcs gifts or have x has nothing left to say today for years because their dialogue has literally ran out 

it is not a finished game and the majority of the screenshots on the store page arent doable in game you can unlock achievements with an achievement unlocker so dont take the global stats seriously i dont think its worth the money right now and ill only be changing this when the game is actually finished especially if dlc is planned to add the missing content because this price isnt enough for whats missing it is similar to my time at portiasandrocks early access where the game just has a note saying not added



other than that its genuinely a good game its a bit laggy and can crash and is very heavy on your computer when you tab out  for some reason this gets worse the more and more time you play so completely quitting the game sometimes helps with that and if you play with half time speed the game can only save on sleep  and you might play 2 hours fishing one day and then it crash near the end of the day because its caching all the events youve done throughout and wont save theres no mods to make any issues in the game better other than cosmetic character ones that dont look great 

so whilst i think this is one of the closest games to scratch the stardew valley itch in a long time it lacks the modcommunity behind it fixing a lot of the base game issues with games like this and despite all my bitching ive played 110 hours and im going to continue playing it because at its base  it is a good game and an excellent farming sim the characters are fleshed out and the story is fun and it adds extra mechanics that a lot of copycat farm sims dont include its a game ill see myself eventually 100ing and im excited to 

but let it cook buy it later and buy it when its actually finished it isnt right now and its disingenuous of the devs calling it 10 for steam sales and it leaves the experience a little lack luster when youre excited and get 100 hours in and its missing content

#####

i have hundreds and hundreds of hours in all kinds of life sims and especially farming sims this is one of my favorite genres of games and this is a game ive had my eye on since prerelease

so far here are my thoughts concerns and feedback 

interesting points and some pros
 very inclusive there is no girl and boy gender different body type with sliders
 selling bin similar to stardew
 theres fishing and bug catching and a museum for them like animal crossing
 a general store that has a scheduled day closed similar to stardew
 mining and a villain character that wants to make the small town a corporate place like stardew
 i love the character art
 i love interacting with the strays and animals on the island and them 
having cute personalities that show through their actions
 i love the diversity of the characters their identities and their character design
 many ethnicities and backgrounds theres one girl in the inn with stretchmarks and i rlly love that attention to detail and realism ngl
 the ambience of the town is so good i love the details in the foliage the interiors the layout of the town how big it is and generally just a very pretty game 
 dating system similar to stardew but havent explored it yet we will see how far that content goes ie can we get married and live together like stardew

feedbackcons etc 
this game is in early access im not rlly that upset about these just commenting on them so devs can fix for full release
 sometimes characters have red eyes kinda scary haha
 the movement is very robotic 
 the audio settings dont really allow for some sounds to be very low i have some settings to the lowest possible and they are still very loud if i lower master volume those sounds just disappear instead of being lowered further
 some of the audios in the game feel not very satisfying ie footsteps have no diversity its like the same one footstep but played over and over but they do change on the terrain youre on like sandwoodstonedirt
 the town is so so big which i love but running is so slow to get around on granted there are horses and i havent gotten this yet so might change this bit but they seem more of a grind to get and in the mean time it can take like an ingame hour to get from point a to point b sometimes especially since the general store is so far away x
 some of the hairstyle models are clunky with the textures being a little messed up
 the hairstyles bounce a lot when your character is turningmoving they look like jello haha

all in all 
right now im in love and very happy with it ill come back if anything changes with my opinion and i look forward to the updates bug fixes and new content  ive played stardew into the ground at this point so im so excited for this game and have been for as long as i have known about it fingers crossed my love stays the same

#####

this game is still early access bugs and stuff not recommended yet
its like 05 you can check global achievements some of them 0 percent because theyre unobtainable not in game yet you unlock stuff which are not exist

#####

reviewed swapped to not recommended due to discovery that the 10 release does not contain the complete game story talk about a bait and switch 

i feel dirty playing this game im all for game developers taking inspiration from other successful titles but this game is such a blatant ripoff of stardew valley that its kind of offensive i understand that sv didnt invent the farmingadventuring genre but the developer certainly built upon it and gave it his own spin im only a few hours in to coral island but so far its been a beatforbeat copy of sv down to the recipes for making items this game has a lot more polish than sv and if all youre looking for is more stardew then youve come to the right place

the pros to this game are that its basically just an updated version of stardew valley the cons are that its so much of a copy that i feel like im missing out on the new player experience so far ive not been surprised or intrigued by anything because ive seen it before

im going to keep playing because i bought the game and may as well but if youre tight on cash then just replay stardew valley and save 30

#####

this game is not ready for a 10 release you cant befriend any of the merfolk and a main quest is still wip theres still a lot of bugs and its concerning considering all of the dev updates focus on adding content like new clothes

#####

to be honest i went back and forth on whether id actually recommend this game in its current state or not but i settled on no at least not how it is currently in early release 

ive purchased a fair amount of early release games to know how the experience generally is and was ready for some items to be incomplete andor to experience some bugs but after purchasing and playing for a few hours its become apparent that the developers are far from finishing the game in that there are huge pieces missing  after running into brick walls twice with quests once i hit the third devs will get to this at another release type message i was annoyed especially since theres no estimated date for the next round of updates 

that said i think once the game is complete and fully released itll be a great game just as it stands its frustrating being pointed on quests that have components that arent done and therefore you dont get to start on them until the 10 release 

save your money and wait until the full release of the game

#####

to emphasise i dont recommend this game yet i want to love this coral island there are a lot of aspects to the game that i do love however the 10 full release is disingenuous at best 

several main story lines are incomplete andor impossible to continue up to a certain point multiple item descriptions are wip or tbd bugs galore and not the kind you catch ranging from inconveniences to game breaking and no you cannot in fact date one of the merfolk  all of this will supposedly will be addedfixed in 2024 

so why is this considered a full release when it is so clearly still in early access

#####

releases a 10 version with work in progress quest lines genius

#####

now i really want to be able to recommend this game i love the story progression i love the characters i love how many things there are to do and collect in the game and overall it is a genuinely good game that i wish i was able to recommend

however i cant in good conscious recommend a game that claims its complete when it is so clearly not its not something noticeable until youve gotten a good 3040 hours in the game but at that point its clear that the main story line is unfinished and even a fully filled out bestiary is only half full

i am hopeful that there will be updates over the next year or so that make the game feel complete and i will be able to turn this negative review into a positive one because i did really enjoy my play through of the game up until the incomplete portions

edit it looks like they 11 version of the game is going to be substantially more complete and its estimated to come out in april of 2024 so i am looking forward to that

#####

it shouldnt be called a full release when some of the important contents are wip wait for a year or until they reach all their 2024 roadmap for a complete game

#####

this game cure my depression

ps hoping they add multiplayer early 2024 so i can play this with my husband and marry him in game 3 

additional note to keep in mind that the game feels a little unfinished because the merfolk storyline and and the last giant is still wip but either way i hope that it gets releasedupdate asap

#####

absolutely love this game so far been here since it was first released its enjoyable and i find myself spending hours on it i love seeing this game grow and im excited to see further development my only issue is fishing i understand that there are people who play games differently and as someone who tends to struggle with certain mechanics of games i dont like to sweat the new fish update has kind of upset me its so frustrating ive unlocked all fish skills so far and upgraded my fishing rod im even using bait however its impossible for me to get the legendary fishsharks i just want a shark for my museum but im finding it almost impossible it doesnt even move on the bar i dont want to get angry or frustrated that ive found comfort in when it comes to my anxiety i would really appreciate it if the fishing mechanics were changed a little bit not make it too easy but it doesnt need to be this hard or at least an option for us to pick whether we want it to be more of a grind i hope that makes sense i just dont want to get frustrated with a game i genuinely love because i cant do something besides that i love the game i rant about it to my friends over call and everything the characters are chef kiss x

#####

loved this game until you hit approximately fall  then you start noticing the bugs and unfinished content  like pets that are just forever stuck indoors even if all they have is an outside doghouse  halloween costumes that are apparently invisible  the occasional random person floating through the air with their latte or taco  im disappointed that this apparently released before it was ready when there is a ton of potential here that decision is going to overall harm reception  just do an extended ea promotional push instead of releasing early if you need to push some cashflow ffs  
i will be willing to flip my recommendation once enough longplay content and bug fixes have come out to justify  the road map info looks interesting but it kinda looks youre abandoning the game when it can only be found googling the game with zero info on steam nor in game there is a road map button in the title menu that just says tbd wth

#####

i bought this game thinking it would be a finished product isnt that what leaving early access and 10 release means well the game is unfinished and missing all late game content the rare altar said reward for completion savannah access i struggled to complete it as fast as possible only to discover that the savannah has not been implemented yet 

selling this as a completed product is deceptive

#####

no ones gonna see my review anyway so im just gonna go ahead and say that im gay for wakuu and semeru you better watch your back when the fish romance update finally drops because im coming to get you 

#####

full released yet its so not finished lol feels lazy and doesnt have the heart

#####

i really like the game so far but like can i please date the fish

#####

while its too early to rec this this game is shaping up to be one of my favorites in the genre ive enjoyed whats available but recommend holding off on playing until full release or until theyre farther down their development roadmap

some of the things i love are the overwhelming cast of characters the mature marriage candidates though the romance aspect is unfinished as of this review and the fantastic character art not much to complain about in the writing and dialogue but theres room for improvement minor typos inappropriate dialogue for the time of day or weather etc i also really like that the characters feel crafted and so do the relationships they have with other characters keep an eye on this at launch

#####

considering the price i cannot recommend this

this game is barely passable as an early access game considering how much money the developers raised and how long its been in development its a disappointment the game is in early alpha stages at best there are so many bugs and most things are just unfinished graphics are cute but thats about it

#####

cute animation fun characters runs well even in early development if you love stardew valley youll definitely like this

#####

h2i want to love this game but its not letting meh2

its 10 in name only this is wholly unfinished a lot of items and storylines are tbd and everything with the merfolk is entirely surface level i can go through the boring grindy mess that is clearing out the entire ocean of garbage and i am rewarded with access to a general store and still no ability to have any meaningful conversation with the merfolk

the farming gameplay is good the mines are aesthetically cool but too short and feature combat against enemies that dont seem to notice you exist until youre standing on top of them at which point theyre probably already dead from 2 hits with the sword the game gives you and ready to drop their worthless loot you can sell to be able to afford one whole potato seed

im hopeful this game can be good once they actually finish it but for now dont bother throwing your money at a full release early access game if you already spent your money uninstall and come back in a year maybe itll be worth your time by then

#####

i was excited to see that this game was out of early access and the recent steam sale seemed like the perfect time to pick it up disappointed to see that the game is still very incomplete i feel like it is false advertising of the developers to label it as a full release instead of keeping it in early access for more time i would wait until late 2024 or early 2025 to check it out again if their current roadmap goes as planned

#####

steam promoted this game to me as a finished one they have even put an ad to the home page but in fact its not finished and still in ea lots of stuff is literally marked as tbd in the tooltips offering altars are not unlocking stuff some resources are obsolete rn etc etc also prepare to experience crashes every 2 hours if you are using traps or your base is a big enough overnight since its the only moment your game is saved so your progress may be pushed back by 3040 min every time you crash sadly i have already been for about 50 hours into the game when i realized that steam should really reconsider their ea policies

#####

first of all its not fair that this game has reviews this good based on an ea phase that showed much potential and teased a featurerich and hopefully smooth 10 experience

as of right now 10 is simply a scam coral island is at this point not a complete game there are literally main storyquests tagged as wip npcs lack dialogue at the later festivals pets are hollow lifeless creatures sitting in your house all day babies can only be adopted localization is in a ridiculously sorry state and bugs are many  just not the critter kind of bugs because those just randomly stop respawning at some point the console versions are even worse due to the game just saving at the start of an ingame day crashes are also extremely frustrating to deal with

what about stairway games well radiosilence when it comes to those issues the same radiosilence we got when they announced that they would reset savegames for 10 and parts of the community were rightfully upset instead of simply saying sorry that they initially claimed that even with potential resets you could keep way more than just your money they relied on their whiteknights gaslighting new players into believing otherwise and now theyre doing exactly the same thing sitting this out and letting their dedicated fanbase handle the outrage even for an indie dev with limited resources this is not acceptable

if you really want to spend money spend it on stardew valley sun haven my time at sandrock or fae farm because while some of those games have their own issues all of them are way better than coral island right now

#####

theyve lied to their backers and keep pushing back promised content from 10 the game is not finished do not buy it for at least another year 13 on their roadmap is the promised 10 features

#####

honestly a wonderful game but its not finished for something being sold as 10 it should be finished imo its really frustrating because i started playing this when it first came out originally but i hadnt realized just how much still needed to be done back then so i stopped playing i started a brand new play through once i saw that 10 was out because i assumed it was finally finished sadly i was wrong again a really great game but id wait until its actually finished ive invested so much time and i feel like it was a waste

#####

i love this game it is so darn well done i cant even begin to tell you just how much i love this game  spent 13 hours non stop didt even eat i was so enthralled love

#####

ive never been so excited about an early access game before ive played a lot of games in this genre and many of them suffer from one more more of the following issues 1 the town is too small andor feels dead 2 characters are lifeless 3 theres just not that much to do even in its unfinished state its obvious coral island doesnt have any of those problems the town just feels so alive  theres so many different characters and they all feel unique and interesting theres a ton of stuff to do too i really like the diving stuff although it does get a little repetitive  i hope that gets expanded a bit 

its still very unfinished events not implemented some items can be unlocked but arent actually in the game  like bait for example my only major criticism at this point is that i wish it was more obvious what is and is not implemented yet  even a list thats linked from the start screen would be good i wasted a bunch of time trying to fish in the mine only to finally find on a wiki page that its not fully implemented yet

that said i am really loving this game so far and once its finished i think itll be right up there with stardew valley im super pumped for the next update

#####

so this seems like a fun alternate version of stardew valley with a couple different things going on different scenery and a cast of brand new characters to engage in storyline with the reason why im not recommending this game at this time is because of just how early access beta it really is 

incomplete animations missing images quickly maxing out your character skillset so youre left with upgradable points and nothing to spend them on npcs running into each other and ive experienced all of this by the beginning of the first summer 

these are the types of games that are a grind that are supposed to encourage the player to continue grinding its pretty hard to do that when youre already maxed on a certain skill and youre only at the end of the first season of the game i dont agree with calling something early access when it feels like youre playing a demo 

i think this is steams biggest downfall there are so many games on here in said early access that its remarkable i can understand a developer needing more funding to complete their project but when youre so far behind schedule and you decide to quickly pump out something a half a step above a demo it makes you wonder if the game will even be released in the next year its hard to look at progress like this and not think this might be their cash out option

#####

the sad thing is im really enjoying this game but its clear that it should still be in early release the games main objective is to get the town rank up and it only goes to a but its clear from empty shops and the like that s and ss rank were planned from go and are not yet implemented a library is empty in the town hall with seemingly no way to fill it and many more systems feel like they are roughly 80 finished until this game is actually finished im leaving up a bad review dont move from early release to 10 without it actually being 10

#####

its like stardew but upgraded i love the story despite it being similar to stardew valley what really sets this game apart is the number of people you can interact with and the adventuring under the sea

#####

play almost 50 hours to find out none of the main questlines are finished and some characters arent even interactable that are supposed to be 
this is a good early access game but not finished yet 
maybe check back in a year if you want to play a full game or just get one of the other good farmingtown sims from 2023 sun havenmy time at sandrock for example
cant reccomend at this time

#####

super cute sim game super excited to be part of this community

#####

its too bad that the game is not finished having a released game that does not have a finished storyline is a bit wrong if you ask me but overall i enjoyed the game so i would say get it if its on sale but wait till they finish the story if you care about that

#####

im almost 100 hours in and it feels like wasted time 

i bought the game in early access and liked the game and decided to be patient and wait for the full release and it became clear the game should not have been released in this state

after spending hours gathering resources to automate my farm and in general play i experienced the following

machines like solar panels auto chests etc randomly stop working and i have to destroy them and place them again to fix the issue so much for automation
random crashes
i need trash to create scrap the ocean is clean and the only place to gather trash quickly is the caves but the the caves are bugged and a world of weirdness happens when you enter the caves making trash farming basically impossible
items with tbd as a description as in its still a work in progress
areas not accessible because it has not been implemented yet although its suppose to be the full release

it would be better if the developers at least made a simple post with some feedback like hi everyone we are aware of these issues and the eta for a fix is 4 weeks or whatever but ive seen no such feedback

its the holiday season and the developers also need a break and i suspect fixes will most probably only begin in january 2024

furthermore full mod support was one of the stretch goals reached in the kickstarter which is currently not in the game why not at least get that going so that modders can work on community patches to help fix some of these issues

in summary im very disappointed the game showed great promise

#####

the game is incredibly front loaded and just feels more and more unfinished and shallow the further you get with far too few interesting events and far too much useless grind to replace it i fell for the visuals and early game but if i could go back i wouldnt have bought it sandrock was far more rewarding throughout the entire game this is a game that feels like it was made by a team of mostly artists rather than a rounded group with good designers and programmers

#####

all i will say is that this game was not ready for 10

save your money check back at the end of 2024

im going to try roots of pacha

#####

i wanna say so many good things about this game but its all soured by the knowledge ive been handed an early access game disguised as released as it is now theres not much reason to go through the entire game as youll be rewarded with incomplete systems and to be determined stuff essential stuff was missing on release like marriage the second year experience people asking how your first spring is in second year no one being dressed up for halloween despite everyone saying how great their outfit is absolutely no dialogue at new years eve and an unfinished main quest

i wish i could forget ever playing this game and then play it when its actually finished

#####

how i wish theres at least an auto save in this game just doing some decoration on my farm for 30 mins and suddenly the game crash 
all my hard work gone 
i lose all my motivation thanks 

#####

not 10 the main questlines are incomplete with missing areas do not purchase expecting a full 10 release

#####

h2 overall dont buy until they show reasonable improvements for 10 as this game is still very much early access h2
                        h3 make your voice heard things like this only truly change with player input h3

ive put nearly 200 hours in the game and the majority of it was in early access i absolutely loved the concept and had a lot of fun making the farm but with the 10 release im left disappointed the lack of finished content and the lack of rebalancing of systems and activities that people have asked for werent implemented which begs the question why even go into 10 if its just going to be the same as a content update wouldve be in early access 

uthis just seems disingenuous as a company and a money grab even if it was not the intention from stairwayu

the funny thing is id discount a lot of this stuff and even recommend the game if it was still in early access under the guise of further improvement as a 10 release im reluctant to even suggest it on sale as they havent communicated any further updates yet in the short term instead of 2024 and as a 10 release its not up to par for what was promised to backers

#####

i love this game but it still feels like early access so i definitely cant recommend it with how it is right now calling it 10 isnt really fair when theres still a lot of game breaking bugs and missing content that was shown in the trailer some item descriptions are even labeled tba

dialogue gets repetitive and at one festival no dialogue available at all i dont feel the farmers connection with the characters tons of marriage candidates but none of them feel actually dateable since most of their heart events are of the farmer spying on them as they go through their problems with their family ex surya wakuu lily up until 8 hearts there was no proper buildup for their event at 10 hearts with the farmer

mining is too grindy monsters barely drop any loot and where are the ores the drops are a nightmare the opposite of cozy

fishing is very frustrating and its not much better even when you upgrade your rod bug catching is pretty nice though

i love the concept the art style the characters theres so much potential in this game but theres still plenty of stuff missing i would stay away from this game until they finish their roadmap for 2024

i will fix my review once the game is actually complete

#####

3d stardew valley

#####

good game should never have left early access or be purported to have been released with so many features unfinished you cant just release a game saying its 10 when you havent finished the main story the main map romance features multiplayer and more thats just patently disingenuous and dishonest  thats what early access is for you release the game as 10 when its actually finished

#####

h3 unfinished game h3

game has been released and labeled as 10 but isnt finished yet
lot of features are wip as well as the main story

also i backed it on ks cause they announced it would had multiplayer but it isnt there

#####

unfortunately the higher ups decided to force the game out way too early this game still feels like its in early access with many bugs and unfinished quest lines as is i cannot recommend this game not until it is actually finished

#####

ive had the opportunity to play since the early access and i must admit that i had a great experience playing although there were some bugs and crashes at times they werent frequent when the game officially launched in version 10 i was really excited to play and i didnt mind starting over i tried speedrunning attempting to achieve success as quickly as possible but then the game started to crash repeatedly i had to replay the same day up to 10 times because i didnt know what was causing the crashesit seemed to happen randomly for example just walking around opening the storage chest  or even opening the craft menu would lead to a crash this forced me to skip the day and stop playing for a while

when the hotfix was released i didnt hesitate to go back and play but the crashes persisted i felt quite frustrated the games content graphics and characters are adorable and engaging currently im married and have a second child playing into the second summer in the b rank town i want to start decorating the farm and expand the production process but with the game crashing repeatedly like this i feel discouraged and think i might need to take a break from this game for a while

ive reported crashes before but the responses were somewhat slow which is understandable due to the large player base after some time passed the responses disappeared and it seems like the problem was swept under the rug i understand that my bug might be a minority but it still leaves me with a sense of frustration however this might be specific to my save file possibly due to an excessive amount of auto chests or something else i really dont know it creates such random and massive bugs meanwhile my friends experience some crashes but not to the extent of needing to start anew like me

in terms of gameplay i highly recommend itits a great game enjoyable and fun but when it comes to the current bugs and crashes its beyond what i can tolerate its version 10 now but it feels like the game is unfinished if theres a major update that comes out and the game has fewer bugs than this and when i can play normally i wont hesitate to update this review if anyone is wondering if its a problem with my computer here are my specs 
processor cpu i9 13900k intel core gen13th
memory 64 gb ram
graphics nvidia geforce rtx 4070ti

have a good day 
nevertheless i still love this game and hope that in the future there will be fixes that allow me to return to playing with greater peace of mind than now 

#####

the game is fun and im really enjoying it but i have to give this a do not recommend for now if you like stardew valley this game is basically that but with 3d graphics i might even be understating how much this game is like stardew valley wearing a mask but thats not really a problem for me as the setting is beautiful and unique no my issue is that the game is unfinished and had no business being launched into 10 in this state usually when something is launched as version 10 you expect a complete experience but theres scraps and threads of unfinished content all over the place multiple times now ive went and looked up something that didnt make sense only to see the best explanation be the developers havent finished that yet which like fair but why release into 10 then why have all this dangling plot threads that dont go anywhere still in your game all it does is make me excited for something that doesnt even exist yet but maybe thats my fault for expecting things to be fully implemented in a fully released product 

aside from the unfinished content there are so many bugs character portraits are bugged on the ingame map and sometimes just show empty squares the game gets really laggy around certain times a day like 6pm as a bunch of stuff is triggered simultaneously it sometimes freezes for so long i think its going to hard crash filling machines causes the game to hitch my characters head was completely broken during the only unique romantic cutscene you get with your romantic interest the game still needs some polish and hopefully it gets it eventually

if the content currently ingame is finished and the bugs are ironed out then ill change my review until then yeah

edit 11223 they released a hot fix with so many bug fixes and it somehow barely moved the needle on the amount of issues this game has turns out ive been really lucky because other people have lost progress saves and tools due to bugs and if you dont have tools you cant get them back making the game unplayable i also reported a bug and the developer told me to my face this is intended so my hope for this game getting better is starting to wane ill keep my eye on it but all of this has really soured what was a game that made a great first impression it needed at least another 6 months of polish before being officially released

also i have another issues with the npcs npcs can run out of stuff to say and just stop talking to you they dont even recycle old lines every romantic interest uses the same lines when you ask them to be your partner and this affects nothing ingame outside of unlocking a special additional cutscene if it even plays at all cause almost all of them are bugged in some way my partner ingame has not once acknowledged that were dating outside of the one date we had which was also bugged mind you i love these characters but theres just so little to them i dont actually enjoy being friends or even dating them stardew valley is just pixel graphics and text on screen and even those characters seem more alive than this

#####

before playing this game i played stardew valley and harvest moon back to nature this game seems to look alike stardew valley but its improved both its 2d design 3d design and features for example nice and memorable 2d character design openclose sign in front of stores to indicate whether it is openclose dash feature npc position on the map broad selection for romance etc so i guess it will also become a new experience for veterans in farmsim game

#####

the game is obviously still in ea so although i run into a few bugs every now and then theres been none that have been gamebreaking i absolutely adore the artstyle and story for this game and i can tell that the developers are pouring their passions into this game they update close to every single day what theyre currently working on and are continously keeping players informed about any changes its honestly such a nice game to just chill with when you want something relaxing so i highly recommend getting this if youre on the lookout for a new farming sim

#####

less an homage and more a lift and shift from stardew valley  nearly all the same mechanics some of the same events some of the same cut scenes theyve added in some animal crossing features  bug collection  and their new idea of ocean cleaning and that instead of juminos its very indonesianpolynesian giants you deal with but it all gets drowned in how much more grindy and bland it is ocean cleaning for example is just clicking the scythe tool a few thousand times the townsfolk are bland and uninteresting and there are a bunch of systems and rewards that are promised but never got implemented like half the rewards for collection completion or the entire find missing books mechanic which is again completely lifted from sv

overall its just a miss there are better harvest moonlike games out there which really bring their own sense of self

#####

this game is out of early access but it is by no means finished it offers nothing new and the wellfamiliar mechanics of farming are clunky and frustrating it is buoyed by great graphics art style and music but the minor issues continue to stack up until it ultimately sinks 

edit the further you get into the game the more glaringly obvious it is how unfinished this thing is the first few seasons everything runs mostly ok but it rapidly falls apart after you get out of that first impression phase it has great potential but is very very buggy and has far too many instances of missing content stay away for now

610 should be 20 max

#####

all my favorite games in one

#####

i cant believe they released this as a 10so many things arent ready or even close to be considered a full game dont spend your money on this until everything is actually in the game insane

#####

played it for a while before and after the 10 release and save reset its disappointing to see some new bugs and realising that even a lot of content tied to he main story still remains a wip as some quests explicitly state as a whole the game seems like it is going to end up feeling woefully anticlimatic for new players that will be reeled in by all the fanfare and positive press surrounding an official release after playing it for a while 

it comes as a huge betrayal of expectations considering the price tag increase

#####

coral island is a lovely looking game with a lot of potential however it currently has enough rough edges and incomplete storylines as well as unfinished features to avoid unless you have a considerable amount of patience

in game controls becoming unresponsive andor the game outright crashing resulting in having to replay complete days due to the game only saving at the end of each day
this is a single player game i am not sure why the logic to limit game saves in this way if it is to prevent save scumming the question becomes who cares as it is a single player game and whoever does this is only affecting their own gameplay

conversations with characters occasionally show variable strings rather than other character names
most any game releases with bugs in time these sort of errors will get fixed if the developers put the time into it to fix them

oddly disappearing characters turtles in an update removed conversation opportunities various creatures though to be fair when previously attempted it would result in you do not understand and removed features eg shopping from the sturdy computer in the latest hotfix
it feels that as much is being removed from the game with each update as is being fixed and what is getting fixed i guess that if you did not know that they were there in the first place you would not view that as a problem so that too is a fix 

tutorials are sparse where they exist but usually nonexistent

even 100 hours into the game there are place holder spots in the journal where i am uncertain if i have just been luckyunlucky and i have not seen things like certain monsters or artisinal goods or they are not in the game presently i have not searched much on steam a wiki or reddit for answers to this nor have i joined the games discord i have seen references to a discord but have not looked for it and have little interest in joining it if the game is truly in a state where it is fit for 10 i should not need any of this to play it

interactions with pets and npcs relatively meaningless as nothing comes of them

lengthy cut scenes which are often stacked an example  i walked into the carpenters shop to have three cut scenes play one after the other taking enough time that i forgot why i entered the shop in the first place this has also happened in the bar as well as sams shop the only bright side to this is that you can hold down the f key on a keyboard to bypass some of this at the expense of missing some storyline

rewards often are nice but pointless by the time they are given they would have helped complete the task necessary to get the reward but after the fact they are meh temple offerings 
or well past the point of where they would be nice to have most museum rewards

festivals  most of the interactions are button mashing games the exception are the end of the year quizzes 

some of the achievements do not seem to work or are not as described  cooking for example i know that i have prepared 20 items but have not received that achievement

levels of randomness  each category of item fossils gems fish insects has some items which are rarer than others fair enough however getting those items can be problematic to get something which is only available during a certain season during certain weather during a certain time of the day and even then is rare remember this is if you know these conditions two examples
gems gems are divided into four categories earth water air and fire gems appear to come from nodes which are related to these categories plus a fifth type of node mystery though the drop rate from the mystery nodes are much more rare from the specific category nodes due to them covering more things whether you find a node is a random chance from hitting rocks then what you find from an individual node is again a random chance to get all gems of a specific type you have to grind the appropriate mine and get lucky to get enough nodes of the correct type to play the gem lottery as stated previously some are less common than others so you may not wish to be in a particullar mine but you need to find enough appropriate nodes to try for those gems
fossils these are equally bad as gems but in a slightly different way the actual fossil nodes seem more plentiful but are equally random and differentiated in type and the drop rates for specific items are equally rubbish

this is a game released too early given some of the obvious issues with the game either the qa team is small andor is ignored heaven help them if the programmers are also the qa team it has the feel off being rushed to 10 due to publisher or management decisions i speculate that this might be due to microsoft not wanting beta games on xbox live however that is merely speculation on my part i feel for the developers they have shown a great deal of love in certain aspects of the game but so much of it is currently half baked as a result i would say steer clear of it until the game reaches a true 10 or better release

#####

so i have almost 200 hours on this game i would like to say that i am obsessed with the game it did annoy me that i had to restart my whole farm though but it was no problem as they gave you  to make up for it it is similar to stardew valley and harvest moon almost like any other farmingdating games however this game does have their own personal touch to it with a unique story line and mermaids 

pros
 there is so many things to do in this game from mining cleaning the ocean fishing catching bugs decorating your house and farm customizing yourself maxing out all your farm equipment 
 sooooo many characters to interact with 
 i love that the island changes depending on the season and they offer so many decorations around the island and even the characters change their clothing depending on the season 
 the events are really fun
 you can slow down the game in the options which helps a lot  
 the fish mini game and fighting monsters are balanced as well with stardew that was a little challenging so i appreciate this game easing off on this and making it more casual it doesnt feel like a nightmare having to mine for ores and getting destroyed by monsters 

the cons 
 still so many bugs and the game crashes a lot it gets annoying having to restart a day
 the one bug that is aggravating me the most right now is that some of your aging barrels and artisan equipment will be done but you cannot grab the item you have to constantly restart the game for it to go back to normal and apparently it has been a known issue for months now 
 i love that you can have a pet but it is lame that you can only adopt one also the pet does nothing but stay in the house all day you cant play with it or the pet does not go outside to interact with the pet house you had to buy what was the point of having to own a pet house if they dont use it 
 although i enjoy so many characters to interact with i also feel like there is a downside to that the interactions with them are sooooo limited it was really disappointing story wise a lot of the cut scenes are just me hiding and listening in to other villagers interacting or i was not even in the cut scenes it was disappointing i feel like i am not even a part of the village and it would have been great if there were better cut scenes that included me it does not feel like i am actually bonding with them or there is some sort of connection with the villagers 
 which leads me to the bland romantic aspect of this game it is the reason why i love these types of farmingromance games the heart scenes do not feel like heart scenes in this game there is barely any interaction with me and the person i am trying to romanticize with it is one of the most disappointing aspect of the game most of the heart scenes had almost nothing to do with you 
 i wish they stepped away from the childlike aspect of these marriage candidates a lot of them felt too teenagery which is with almost all of these farmingdating games its always like wahhhh my parents dont understand me and then you bond over that it can get very tiring 

overall i wouldnt recommend this game just yet as it feels so incomplete still i would wait it out until there are more updates

#####

heres my insight based on my experience from early access for the past 6 days my background in the farmlife simulation sim started with harvest moon back to nature ps 1 up to the latest pioneer of olive town switch and pc and then with rune factory 4 3ds switch and pc and rune factory 5 switch and pc it took a while for me to branch out outside the bokumono series harvest moon turned story of seasons went it comes to the farming genre i tried out starview valley but it didnt last long so i still stuck with the harvest moonstory of seasonsrune factory series coral island seems to be the one who helped me branch out from the bokumono series

what i lovelike

the game is really gorgeous and detailed especially the exterior and interior buildings you can see a lot of care to give each interior unique and give an insight into who lives there the exteriors are really nice as details as well like vines growing at the side of the door a small garden beside a house and a bonsai garden beside a house as well

diverse cast of characters they all came in all shapes and sizes it really does feel like home i live in southeast asia and the developers are from indonesia with the amount of diversity found in the town and i really like the art style

i really love the diving aspect of the game coral islands story revolves around saving the ocean from the oil spill and the island from the oil drilling company taking over the island i love swimming around cleaning and saving the corals the ocean is really beautiful cant wait to see the ocean with merfolk updates in the future

i really love that you can adjust the game time speed if you put it on the lowest setting 1 day lasts for 40 minutes while 20 minutes for the highest option iirc

i really like the map which shows where the townies are and the shop operating hours as well

what i am neutral about

the island is huge got lost during my first week ingame i really dont mind it but some are already requesting a minimap for it if ever they implement a minimap i hope it will be togglable

what im worried about

too many romance options compared to other series coral island has the largest number of romance options with a whooping 25 confirmed romance options and three more tbd romance options i really dont mind a lot of romance options to choose from what i was mostly worried about was the quality of the writing im praying that each romance will be unique in its own way add that to the nonromanceable npcs a total of 70 npcs for the town
havent tried

mining and combat

things to note wishlist and wait if
 you need controller support and keybinding support
 regional pricing is not favorable in your countrys steam 
 you want a full experience this is early access there will be bugs save wipes and the like



i cant really complain about the animation since theyre still polishing it there are some bugs that are to be expected the regional pricing for coral island in my countrys steam is definitely worth even on early access overall i will definitely enjoy my experience so far and hopefully coral island will deliver and become one of the household names of the farming genre like the bokumono rune factory and sdv

#####

this game has potential but its not finished they left early access without finishing the main story or implementing core things like dates or children i have found plenty of bugs specially decorating the house its a shame and bad practice really insulting that they dared sell this as a finished product and we will have to wait almost a year for them to patch and complete this game we should not endorse this kind of behavior 


#####

loving the game a lot of stardew valley references for this game but it is also making its own path needs optimized but its early access so thats understandable if you like farming games you will love this just know at this time it is not close to complete but there is still a massive amount of content

#####

i agree with the reviewers who said this is exactly like stardew valley i expected it to be similar not an almost identical copy of the game in 3d after logging hundreds of hours into stardew im not exactly looking for a duplicate of the same grind down to the elevator in the mines and a chest every 5th floor and breaking open geodes at the blacksmith

#####

this isnt a full release it is still wip so dont expect it to be finished or bug free it has gotten worse then ea we got more bugs in 10 and some are really bad i might update this later if it improves but i wouldnt recommend getting this yet

id suggest waiting until late 2024 or sooner just check news and discussions about the game

#####

please do not purchase this game its not complete there are things in the game that are missing or theres just a sign that says work in progress you cant even finish the main quest of the game because its not there also there are sound lag and stuttering issues save your money

#####

despite its early access state and the obviously missing content that comes with it this game is a treat for all harvest moon and stardew valley enthusiasts  a group i count myself amongst 

the setting is beautiful and the characters are all different interesting and alltogether lovable their stories make you i want i to run around the island each day to talk to them which is a new one for me most of the time i talk to everyone on occasion pick out my husbandwife shower them with gifts and forget about all the other characters until one of them asks for something not here the interesting characters combined with the pleasant relationship progression make exploring all their stories extremely fun 

both farming and ranching feel incredibly rewarding despite its usually repetitive nature its easy to upgrade your farm and all the extra buildings are in the realm of affordable that carries out into all the other parts of the game  weapons tools furniture clothes and whatever else are all varying states of affordable without the crazily overpriced items that other farming games often include 

the mines as well as the ocean have interesting storylines that make digging and diving a treat and they do that while not being crazily out of reach especially the mines dont feel horribly endless and repetitive because theres a clear goal to follow 

as of right now theres still a few bugs and missing pieces  absolutely not surprising seeing as the game is still in its early access version most things arent really all that bothersome either the one bug that can really get extremely annoying is when the game crashes during saving and you loose an entire day some actions seem to trigger this behaviour however but i have yet to find what exactly to avoid 

other than that the game is already extremely lovely and fun to play and has by far outdone its brethren it truly seems like the devteam has taken a good look at other games of this genre and learned from their mistakes and they did a good job with it

#####

if you like stardew valley and saving the ocean environment this game is for you

#####

remember playing the harvest moon franchise rune factory franchise and stardew valley well this is the game that completes it all with the added bonus of being very current and very open to all players i can not wait for this game to finish

ps i need a mark in my life 3

#####

the game isnt fully released parts of the main quest leave the player with a wip tag other features arent fully implemented hold off

#####

coral island is not a finished game  i tried to hold off from playing coral island until the full release i had faith in the game and i knew that if i enjoyed it i would blast through it i wanted to enjoy a full experience but this is not that ive been so utterly disappointed by everything in the game at some point or other

bugs and glitches are abundant but i can somewhat forgive that every game has hiccups and especially right after a full release but its frustrating when youre playing a game how its intended to be played when its intended to be played and had a price increase to boot but ive run into multiple gamebreaking issues ive tried my best to ignore it all and persevere on the games good graces but when something as simple as changing clothes makes my characters face default and go bald or interacting with a chest making all the tools in my bag duplicate infinitely leaving me no choice but to store them in a chest at the corner of my farm or placing a fence next to my coop that just doesnt place and yet consumes the fence i crafted regardless im tired

these gameplay deficits could be obscured by the social aspect of the game  if that werent also lacking the dialogue is just so droll and samey i dont know if it is a translation issue but its just not interesting i mean erika has said the exact same thing about bree every day for a year since i first met her why make her a character if youre not going to do anything interesting with her theres too many theyre just there villagers in this game that give you no inclination to speak to them because you are rewarded with the same stale dialogue if i speak to someone on the day of a festival im no longer allowed to see their festival dialogue prior to a recent update every character would have the speech bubble present to speak to them but all they said was they have nothing more to say it begs the question why it was even there in the first place though
i had another interaction with randy wherein i had a dialogue choice option and the option i chose resulted in placeholder dialogue appearing that was more entertaining than seeing the same dialogues over and over from the person im trying to woo however

some of the slice of life scenes are ultimately just boring some are better than others to be fair i enjoyed the antoniosuki meeting with valentinas teacher one but these scenes could have been a really great way of developing this large cast of characters and showing how they interact with one another instead they just miss the mark writingwise and do nothing to make you care more about the villagers

the mining in the game is atrocious combat is not fun enemies have no reaction to being hit until their stagger bar fills up because of this it is far easier to stand and wail on them and take the damage than actually engage them strategically
the mines themselves are stupidly large it takes far too long to organically find an exit in the mines without using explosives to the point that the decision to not have an elevator on the 35th floor of each mine serves more as a punishment than a challenge also at a certain point it becomes very difficult to tell how many hits a rock takes to break due to the similarity of the models the ore is also restricted to either one or no veins per floor and one vein can be as little as two ores ive currently progressed to the wind mines but i have to go back to the earth mines for the sole purpose of collecting bronze for buildings and tools and it is painstakingly awful when considering all the issues listed above

i have very little patience now for coral island full releasing without a finished storyline a tease at a currently noninteractive joja cola questline and a completely defunct underwater kingdom with borderlineplaceholder mermaids just amplifies every other issue it has i also consider the fact that it so clearly emulates stardew valley and harvest moon to the point of having a concerned monkey npc that sells harvest moon garb yet it drops the ball on a template that has been continually laid out for it how did one man without a kickstarter backing of 16 million do so much better than an entire team i played stardew valley when it first launched and it was nowhere near as lame as this

i really love the artwork and modelling for this game although theres a bit of a framerate issue on all npc animations but i feel like the eyecatching visuals are distracting from the fact that the game is rushed and sorely lacking in every other department

also the apple bobbing minigame at the harvest festival is ass that whole festival actually

#####

i really enjoy this game  you wont regret buying it

#####

i really love coral islandthe game has beautiful graphics and npc house designs and interior decorations are truly impressive adding depth and charm to the gamethe soundtrack is beautiful but i wish it played more often because i enjoy listening to it while doing quests and choresoverall its a great farming game and i hope they add more decorations and outfits in the future i cant wait to play more when its fully released

#####

game isnt finished many planned features have not been added in this full release dating mechanics main questline and a significant amount of other content is missing and scheduled to release by the end of 2024 given the passion of the developers the publisher more than likely forced a holiday release for 10 

for these reasons i cannot recommend coral island at this time

#####

this game worked perfectly for me the vast majority of early access recently it suddenly starts crashing when showing the publisher screens on launch it was fun when i could play it but i have to say not recommended anymore my specs are above recommended and it worked just fine until some sort of recent change

#####

edit yeah the game got now fully released but it feels like an early access game the early access felt like an alpha or beta maybe wait another year right now i am dissapointed how buggy and still unfinished it is i was sooo hyped  

this game has the potential to be really awesome it is already great and i enjoy every second of it
however i wouldnt recommend to play it yet but go ahead and buy it  since its seems to be in the very early access you cant get gold out of the mines yet but you can buy gold from the blacksmith and forge your gold tools theres a minigolf you cant play on yet and the first festival you cant participate fully because its still in development and you cant reach more then 6 hearts yet so no marriage possible yet just to name a few missing parts  i cant wait for the new content patches because the game is already really fun if you overlook the missing parts of the game which will come over the next year if i saw that correctly on the roadmap 3

why would dev bother to reset the progress for this unfinished product i will never understand
10 with several wip mark in the main quest ocean and merfolk story line is not available in 10 despite being the key feature they bait for long time for some reason monster in dungeon was no threat with a braindead ai and dont make me start on a progression reward because it is complete horseshit three rope for 190 museum item wtf  and 1 clearly unfinished event new year event with everyone have no dialogue for some reason i really want to enjoy 10 but instead got all pissy because all i recieved was a half baked unfinished product

please most of the game are very much enjoyable and the content was sure therebut trust me from a peep who play this shit every major patch update  this is not 10 
for whats its worth i just hope dev would be different from others since its was mostly funded by community and it looks that way for a while even with the founder hall
but alas mindless consumerism win the days again

willing to change the review if there is a proper response from dev

spent an hour fishing guy came up and said hey thats my spot moved over spent another hour fishing next to guy without saying a word 1010 accurate fishing simulator

editing to add how much i appreciate every new addition to this game it just gets more and more exciting with each change definitely worth the money

i was one of the people who supported coral island when it was up on kickstarter and i have zero regrets for doing so even with the game so barebones ive had nothing but immense enjoyment playing it and i wish everyone gets the same experience

i do think a lot of people are forgetting that it is early access and with that there are bugs glitches and all that that is bound to happen and its something that you need to be aware of the developers and staff are incredibly active on the discord server if there are issues and they seem to be on the ball please make sure to keep all that in mind

i have a very lowend pc and so i most likely have more crashes than the average user and i still enjoy playing every day 

tldr get the game and be gay 3

its just not ready for its advertised full release i keep coming back to toss in a a half hour here and there and each time its apparent that its still in the oven text issues npcs in the furniture store glitching through their own models unable to speak to said npcs and as others have stated the story isnt even finished theyve recently released a roadmap saying that starting in april they will be basically finishing what should have been done for version 10

i wont be playing until then and will change my review if it looks like its finally done

#####

a 10 release out of early access comes with the bare minimum expectation that the main story and rewards exist and no elements of that should be tbd or wip 100 not recommendable at this current state potentially an example of marketing malpractice even

#####

i really wanted to enjoy this game but it is sadly extremely buggy and incomplete i have run into multiple times where my game would freeze or crash including whenever i tried to do the first festival there are areas that are finished but lack any meaningful dialogue or anything to actually do in that area the game is not only buggy but just lacks in a lot of areas it also has a lot of blatant rip offs of stardew valley that you see in a lot of farming games now instead of original ideas it had a lot of potential to be something more but just didnt pull through should not be 10 version with incomplete main storylines

#####

i really want to give this game a thumbs up but the lack of some accessibility features makes it a bit rough to play at times 

1 no option to remove screen shake if you are prone to motion sickness you will struggle with some of the mini games the screen shakes rather violently at times specifically with the mechanical bull riding mini game

2 disable fatigue animation does not work as intendedmay be glitched when you are exhausted the game fades out and the colors dim to this washed out grey filter there is an option to disable this but from what i can tell it doesnt do anything getting fatigued is fine but the solution shouldnt be having to eat food or ending the day early adjusting the game to color blind also does not resolve this issue

the game is a great farming sim with fun gameplay features to make it shine compared to other farming sim titles but its unfortunate to hear that this developer isnt all that receptive to accessibility features if there are adjustments i will gladly update my review

#####

everything in one theres so much activity in the game 
love the detail and the story
its still a good game even tho in the early access 
cant wait for more updates

#####

unbalanced unfinished full of bugs and dialogue typos beta that is still being developed yet was forceably released out of early acess as a finished game and was asked by devs to promote it for free 

wait until at least 2025 or 2026 before getting it because theres still tons content that needs to be added theres a huge chunk of the story that is missing  the unuseable empty buildings animals and scenery just sit there the duilogues are shallow and buggy and if you romance someone they dont feel like your partner at all and i suspect that every time they release a big big update youll need to restart the game again to experience it the way youre supposed to cleaning the ocean for the third time i am not doing that by hand again and for what for not getting the promised content yikes

finishing the altar offerings and the museum donations right now feels impossible because the needed scavengeables gems resources fish just dont spawn and that was my last straw to write this review i dislike when a game should be fun but instead feels like a chore despite its great potential

its a cant recommend until its fixed and finished

ps oh and the game has no manual save which is a huge no
