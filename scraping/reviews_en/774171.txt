latest update 9212023 the people who have the just as planned pack is fine we are getting everything including the paid dlcs 

for those who dont know whats happening peropero recently announced that there is going to be dlc that is not going to be for those who have the just as planned pack people got angry because peropero promised the people who bought the pack would be a 1 time purchase thing where future updates and dlcs will be provided for free to those who had the pack the recent announcement claimed that there was going to be paid dlc that is not part of the just as planned pack so there was some review bombing

recently however peropero came out with another announcement where they stated that
1 those who have the just as planned pack will get the paid dlc and future paid dlcs for free strike as long as they log in during a week of the dlc dropping this will be permanent so if you log in the week of the dlc dropping you will have it forever strike
they recently came out with an announcement that whoever has the just as planned pack will get all future dlc for free

2 the just as planned pack will be discontinued but those who already have it will keep it kinda like a kickstarter backer reward

3 the just as planned pack will be replaced with muse plus basically the just as planned pack but without the benefit of getting the paid dlcs for free

the replacing of the just as planned pack and the vocaloid dlc dropping will supposedly happen near or on oct 4 2023 honestly get the game and the pack before then as this is a great game

h1bcome for flashy visuals stay for catchy musicbh1

muse dash is a rhythm action game developed by chinese studio called peroperogames steam version is completed mobile port which share same price of base game

muse dash is like a warm place where you sit back and enjoy both music and visual subjectively i was drawn colorful art design and stylish flashy characters which remind me of anime like panty and stocking the game has hybrid concept between sidescrolling beat em up on the rail and rhythm beat which are executed very well

h1parkour rhythm on the railh1
the control is tight and responsive compared to mobile touch pad you simply control character using two keyboard buttons which can be modified or set alternate keys via option one key is to hit enemy notes at ground level and another one is to hit enemy notes on the air it sounds simple but also challenges sense of rhythm of player where you face variant types of note from common long note to invisible note dodging sawblade notes and utilizing your timing to maintain combo and character hp to the end of song

urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2065335523url
similar to other rhythm games the game has judge system indicates input accuracy based on timing but is more much simplified and forgiving as perfect great pass and miss that will break your current combo and affect overall accuracy the game will also enter fever mode once player maintains amount of combo allow player to boost score in short period and can be set as manual spacebar key

h1three characters different gimmicks h1
your starter character is rin by completing any songs regardless of difficulty you will gain user exp for leveling up each level will unlock random troves used to unlock new playable characters rin buro marija new elfins supporting companions and many beautiful illustration allow you to customize loading screen the process is random and varied for each user but player will easily unlock everything at certain point

speaking of characters each main character has different 45 costumes theme and likeable personalities both costumes and elfins provide player benefit one way or another based on playstyle and specific gimmick some can match up with elfin to boost extra scores or maintain hp some can use to boost overall accuracy or lengthen judge area to the point you feel comfortable and familiar with beats the system is friendly for casual players while keeping master challenge for veterans

urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2065335895url
h1enjoy as casual or master favorite songsh1
the game offers 3 difficulties easy hard and master except for few default songs master difficulty only unlock when player completes s rank on hard 90 accuracy higher difficulty contains more notes that synchronize most beats of the track or completely replace different sequences from easy and hard it may sounds hard on paper but as i consider myself as average player for this genre its common for every rhythm games that you invest time for practicing to the point that it becomes muscle memory combine with strong visual feedback from beating wave of enemy notes and bosses at end of level its such an addictive and satisfying gameplay loop that i genuinely enjoy everyday regardless of scoreboard

h1embrace the melodyh1
muse dash offers great variety of songs both vocal and instrumental for example dubstep eurobeat edm jazz vlolin vocaloid pop mystical bms and other mixup you may expect some chinese vocal songs and some japanese songs but they are overall catchy and aesthetic in their own way it also encourages me to dig into meaningful lyrics and discover more talented cover  composers there are some familiar songs that share among other rhythm games arcaea djmax maimai and more such as conflict destr0yer pupa milk and much more

urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2110466357url
h1base game and just as planned dlch1
the base game has total 52 initial songs 43 default songs 3 nanocore 6 budget is burning with 3 price tag served as standard version provide full access of all characters and elfins to experiment its worth checking without dlc to get a grasp how the game plays out

while mobile version has various bundles steam version has single dlc called just as planned with current 132 extra songs free 6 songs will be added every month this dlc serves as onetime payment for longterm support if player really interests into the gameplay and music types i personally think 30 price tag is reasonably worth considering amount of licensed songs the developers have to pay and generate notes for each song if youre still uncomfortable for a price and expectation which understandable in some regions you can follow the game page and wait for dlc sale

h1performance and some nitpickingsh1
muse dash runs on unity game engine with friendly spec requirement and well optimization i had no performance issue or fps drop during 37 hours of playtime stylish and flashy ui but easy to navigate between menus due to mobile design you need to press esc from main menu to exit the game

aside from fantastic visual and gameplay loop there are few cons i found that can be problematic to new player such as transition effect of fever mode can be bad distraction in few songs enemy notes in some portions doesnt sync perfectly to music beat or slightly offbeat especially on high level master difficulty however you can adjust offset delay if the problem relates to your monitor same as background brightness if you feel like notes are blending to backdrop lastly i notice register  delay problem of daily challenge at least on latest patch 

h1closingh1
muse dash is a rhythm game with its own identity solid gameplay high replayability and satisfying feeling of hitting beats as music enthusiast its something i could enjoy from hard day and share experience with friends in discord wherever youre not familiar with rhythm genre or not muse dash is another title that worth checking

this game saved my life

i am 42

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5  minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

h1 written review h1
muse dash is a colourful rhythm game with a good variety in music and a satisfying gameplay loop

the games music is overall anime but they manage to mix it up some of it is more cutesy and dancey while others take cues from jazz or swing and others are a bit more hardcore or dubstepy i thought the quality of the soundtrack overall was really awesome and ive had songs stuck in my head for weeks since playing this game

on top of that i actually have just found myself gravitating towards playing the game a bit everyday thats because of the great gameplay

its simple but has enough depth to it to make you feel cool when you nail a string of notes

so the way the game works is you play with only two buttons this is because the game was initially designed as a mobile game you press one button to attack at ground level and one button to attack in the air then all you need to do is time your attacks with the notes that come your way guitarherostyle 

the game mixes it up by having some held notes some notes that turn invisible after a while or some that have you button mash as much as possible but the more interesting gameplay comes at the highest difficulty there are 3 difficulties easy hard and master not all songs have all difficulties and you need to unlock master for every song individually which you do by earning an s rank on hard which isnt as daunting as it sounds 

the game does a great job at making all the notes make sense with the song while at the same time mixing up the notes so two verses in the song might sound identical but play asymmetrically and its really interesting and fun

the game played totally fine on both my xbox 360 controller and my keyboard on pc controls all keys were rebindable while on the controller the entire left side of the controller controls one note while the entire right side controls the other note which i appreciated

there are scoreboards that drive you to better yourself everytime and you can interestingly even sync up your save and scores with the mobile and pc version via online login

i really appreciated all of the options they provide you with one of them being an offset that you can use to try and perfect your audio sync with the visuals in case your monitor screws with that

even more fun though is unlocking new characters and elfins all 3 characters have different stats that affect your scoring and playstyle and they each have a bunch of costumes to unlock that each have their own unique and fun stats elfins are pets that just follow you in a level and give you passive buffs 

you unlock all of this by simply playing the game and levelling up this can be sped up by getting unique achievements per song as well as daily tasks that refresh every 24 hours

unfortunately thats also the only way to unlock new songs at some point i reached a dead end and had to go back and replay old songs before i could unlock and play newer ones i found that a bit frustrating although it didnt take too long and i would have replayed old songs anyway it still was a bit annoying

the catchy music great gameplay and charming aesthetic really made me fall in love with this game a few more level designs would be great as it can get a bit stale cycling through the same 4ish levels but im hopeful theyll continue adding new content to the game following its launch as they have in the past with the mobile version

overall i highly recommend the game to rhythmgame fans its up there as one of my favourites now

#####

i just cant get all the reviewbombing they have been giving us a huge amount of content for such a small price and when they decide that they cant keep on going like this and they need more money to make good content people are angry about that to licence music and make good charts you need money and many rhythm games are a lot more expensive than muse dash i am supporting them on their decision and even if they didnt make all the dlcs free for those who bought just as planned i would have supported them either way because i like this game

#####

friend asked me what genre of game i wanted i told him rhythm game given ive been stuck just playing rhythm games and fighting games for a solid week had no clue what he was gonna get me holy crap this is just straight up crack
the visuals pop the songs are catchy and wow where did the time go this game has been an absolute blast my gripe with so many modern games is a lack of a proper progression system or shoving a battlepass in the place of one the fact that for the price of the game you get a full progression system a full game and continual updates freaking amazing the fact that the modern gaming industry has become what it is is certainly sad but this is a shining light in the darkness
keep up the good work

#####

really makes you feel like an anime girl on an acid trip killing candy monsters

#####

its about time i review this game

so i bought this for about 50 cents during this past summer sale because i am a huge fan of rhythm games and that was cheap af
my only concern with buying it was that the dlc was way more expensive than the base game so i was expecting about an hour or two of game play with the rest stuck behind a paywall lets be real for 50 cents that wouldnt be terrible

lets just say i was pleasantly surprised when i started playing the game and realized that there was hours and hours of fun content the gameplay is fairly simple once you learn the controls but each level has an amazing song to it that i just love jamming to some levels are fairly difficult and i find myself having to replay levels to get the trophys as i am a completionist the characters and elfins are a fun addition and overall there are so many cool things in this game

overall this is one of my favourite rhythm games currently and even at the base price its well worth the price but seriously if you are looking for a fun game to spend time on but not be too overly invested in youve found it

get it its so fun

breasts if you may tiddies even boobs so should it please

#####

before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

its like osu but i dont want to kill myself


#####

this game feels like if someone gave you coffee and put next to it a jar full of sugar and youre gonna drink the coffee thinking you put sugar in it but oops turns out i was cocaine all along now u r high and addicted to whatever tf this is

#####

fun game but you would not catch me playing this out in the hood

#####

i absolutely love rhythm games i played a lot of guitar hero rocksmith melodys escape etc my first one and the most favorite is probably guitar hero iii legends of rock i used to play it every evening when i was a teen and spent tons of hours playing it when i stumbled across muse dash i didnt expect a lot in fact i didnt even check which kind of music is in the game i really liked the colorful art style so i just bought it the price was cheep anyway

when i launched the game i was kind of disappointed because i didnt expect the music to be anime im not a fan of such kind of music but my husband is so i though about refunding the game and buying a copy for him i decided to give the game a try first and i dont regret a thing the games so addictive and fun that i even got used to the music

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2824926972
the game starts off very simple you need to press two buttonsone to hit the enemies on the ground and the other to hit the enemies in the air but dont be fooled cause the games actually not that simple there are obstacles that youll need to avoid enemies that become invisible and even bosses theres also fever mode that increases your score similar to star power in guitar hero there are 3 difficulties easy hard and master easy was too easy for me so i quickly moved on to hard and master hard is available from the start to unlock master for a song you have to complete that song with an s rank on hard first the rank in this game does not depend on your score like in guitar hero but on your accuracy so you cant compensate lower accuracy with a higher score to get a higher rank the difficulty increase with each song is very smooth so you dont struggle with getting stuck on particular songs

theres also a level system in the game you gain experience when finishing songs unlocking ingame achievements and completing challenges with each level you unlock a new song and get items needed to unlock new muses and elfins small creatures that fly beside the muse each muse and elfin give bonuses such as increasing fever mode time boosting muses hp increasing score etc

the base game contains about 50 songs the dlc adds about 300 more songs and a few new characters i will definitely purchase the dlc during a sale cause it adds a lot of content
update got it and its definitely worth it

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2825472319
if you dont mind the anime music i recommend you this game its cheap so you wont lose anything if you dont actually like it if you do you can purchase the dlc and add much more hours of play time to the game enjoy

ps i believe that some people can get motion sick because of the game being a sidescroller thats moving fast enough if you get motion sick just take a break after each song i also recommend focusing on the character rather than the moving objects ive suffered from motion sickness myself when playing melodys escape its a sidescroller too but after a while when i got used to the game the motion sickness was gone

i swear i play for the rythm

strikestock up on keys for just as planned to earn huge profits a month from nowstrike the dlc has been retired now and if you did stock up on them i hope youve been making a profit for everyone else that doesnt know what im talking about i encourage you to keep reading so you can learn about a piece of this games history

ever since it was released this game had a single dlc called just as planned that once bought it would unlock all song packs previously released and would allow its owners to receive every future song pack and game updates for free in the words of the publisher themselves

quotepurchase just as planned to unlock a complete collection of music now over 300 songs characters elfins welcome screens and illustrations
on top of that future updates on muse dash will be unlocked for free 
thats to say after purchasing just as planned theres no need to pay for any further updates on muse dash ゝ quote

now they will be retiring the just as planned dlc on october 4tha month from nowwhich will be replaced by what theyre calling muse plus strikea service that as of now we cant be certain whether itll be a subscriptionbased service or a onetime purchasestrike a onetime purchase dlc thats virtually the same as the old just as planned dlc with the sole exception that it doesnt unlock certain song packs which need to be bought separately

that doesnt seem too bad right theyre just changing the way the game manages microtransactions and the ones that will be affected the most will be future players if only the drama ended there

the crux of the matter the detail that made the player base explode in righteous anger is the second announcement the one that said they would be releasing separate largerscaled dlcs that would not be unlocked for either legacy owners of just as planned or future owners of muse plus which meant that both would need to buy those dlcs separately if that isnt a breach of their promise and a betrayal of trust then what is it

after a lot of criticism from the player base the developers tried to make compromises first they announced that owners of just as planned could get the dlcs for free if they logged in on the first seven days following its release since that didnt seem to do much to allay the players anger they went back on their word or perhaps further on their compromise saying that just as planned users would be able to claim the dlcs for free anytime they went online for as long as it was on sale they even tried to save face and make a joke out of it by saying

for old owners of just as planned this would seem like a happy ending in which they got back what they were first promised future players may even feel moved that the publisher had been magnanimous enough to listen to the players feedback on their decision to the point of going back on it but behind the curtains this has been a victory for the publisher without a doubt in the past three days as this whole drama was unfolding i imagine sales for just as planned mustve gone up proportionally to the number of negative reviews it got and following its retirement a month from now they will continue to rise if youre reading this as a new player i feel sorry for you because now that youre five years late if you want to have access to all the songs past and future chances are you will have to pay more than anyone that has been playing the game up to its fifths anniversary

convoluted announcements betrayal of trust and backtracking decisions while gameplay is an important factor when choosing to buy a game its just as important if not more so to consider the publishers relationship with its players and this event has left a stain in their history im sure that in time as is often the case with most things things will be forgotten the negative reviews will stop and everyone will go back to loving the game like a cuckold who chose to forgive their lover future players may never know their waifus were ntring their players but some of them were actually all right with that i bought just as planned for cheap many years ago and they have been giving us new updates for five years they would say as they gaze at their own navel oblivious to the new players that had bought the very expensive just as planned dlc recently and were feeling slighted by the publishers but to most of us we will always remember the saying trust goes out from the same door from which the doubt comes in after all trust takes many years to build few seconds to break and forever to repair

i feel bad for peropero because of the review bombing heres why i think they didnt deserve it

they put a lot of effort into each and every update that they put out all of that licensed music are expensive and all the gorgeous art that they put into the game is amazing for a game that only costs like 35 dollars there are over 407 songs in this game for that price thats a value of 008 dollar per song this is incredibly generous not even mentioning the characters elfins and all of the artwork that is in the game

i honestly didnt even understand how they were making money being this generous with just as planned and i am glad that they are deciding to enforce a new way of monetizing their game they deserve it but they had to backtrack on a lot of it due to reviewbombing and boycotting

from offering a special discount to giving pervious owner of just as planned to own it forever if they claim it within a week to just letting them have it forever if they had just as planned at all

support these guys let them know that its ok to monetize the game a bit more

i recommend playing this while your parents are arguing outsideit makes you feel like its your fault that they are arguing d

muse dash is a rhythm music game that combines action fighting and music in one genre each character will hit all opponents passes through away and theyll strike out by following rhythm of the song there are many challenges that let your eyes felt almost giddy with its rhythm 
the bossess will be shown when the song is in the middle or at the climax basically called rep in middle of music easy to increase the exp get some stuffs and characters when you finishing a song price of the game is really cheap except dlc even my younger sister really likes the game
she asked me to buy the android version and i have bought the android version your progress will be synchronized via facebook and google account 
you can customize the keyboard as you wish same as rhythm game in general the game is really comfortable to played with low spec last but not least you need to buy the dlc to unlock all songs

bthis is a warning review about a major issue with this game which you should keep in mind if you are considering buying itb
although the game is great when it works the issue is  when the developers have made an update which added nothing new but completely broke the game making it unplayable for 3 weeks until they finally fixed it some of the major issues couldve been fixed in a matter of minutes though they didnt acknowledge any of the issues there was no rollback of the update so people could play while they were trying to fix it and they didnt even apologize afterwards there are still small residual bugs and the game is running worse than before the update but it seems to work at least
for a comparison  there was an update which unintentionally allowed all players to use characters from the dlc without the need to own it it was fixed the very next day
 so by buying this game you are risking that it may stop working after a random update and possibly wont be fixed for a long time

bdetails about the major issues in the aforementioned updateb from my former review
 the biggest issue being that some people cant play any levels you get stuck on a purple screen with music in the background and must force close the game to get out it isnt a one time issue either if you are affected by this bug you cant play period
 this was fixed after 3 weeks but couldve been done in a few minutes as only a few lines of code needed to be changed the bug affected people whose os uses commas instead of dots in decimal numbers
 another major issue which many if not all players can experience is that key presses arent registering properly this includes input drops on fast presses several enemies very close together random delays in inputs overall up to several seconds hits on some enemies straight up not registering hits not registering for some time after hitting air pressing key when there is no enemy to be hit combos breaking after hitting a certain enemy in some levels these issues make it hardimpossible to play harder levels properly but also affect simple slow levels
 this was fixed after 2 or 3 weeks based on others comments i was affected by the first bug and couldnt test it myself the hit registration still sometimes feels wonky so i am unsure if it is properly fixed or i just got rusty after being unable to play for so long i have no idea what caused this bunch of bugs but i would guess the developers just completely butchered the code trying to changeimplement something
 a last big issue being that the log in feature stopped working which wont prevent you from playing the game but is an inconvenience as your scores wont register into the leaderboards
 this was fixed after 4 days but couldve been done in a few minutes as it was caused by devs changing the name of the folder which stores user data though some people still had issues even 2 weeks later

#####

this game put me on some sort of watchlist

#####






are you
wininng

yes

this game is actually good jumping into it i did not really know what to expect from it but i ended up being very pleasantly surprised the tutorial was quick and to the point and while it doesnt exactly explain that you can use 2 keys for both ground and air it does its job at explaining how the game works

the characters while few have interesting variations that spice up the gameplay with their own unique abilities suggestiveness not withstanding

but if i could draw any parallels to this game it would be taiko no tatsujin or osutaiko if youre an osu player believe me if youve played either of those games or both jumping into this will be no problem youll make yourself right at home especially if youre an osutaiko player that plays with the kkdd scheme

there are gripes with the game i have though such as some songs rhythmically feeling like they dont really highlight what the player expects leading to me just mashing for the most part and hope i get it right but so far  its been a blast

in 3 hours i managed to reach level 45 and unlock almost all of the free tracks but i will definitely come back to this in the future either to finish unlocking everything or just to play for fun

tldr
do you want an animestyled taiko no tatsujin for cheap muse dash is for you

ips i was surprised how many songs i recognized here just by the fact that i played osu beforei

buhoweverub and i really must stress this point in particular  bthe base game you buy is very lacklusterb while you get a pretty alright selection of songs and enough content to keep you playing ithe game even gives you a selection of free premium songs every weeki this games base content is really a far cry from what it could iand arguably shouldi be

muse dash in my opinion should be a free to play game with the just as planned dlc being a premium upgrade option because if you want any reason to go back to this game at any point in the future you will not find much reason to replay this without the just as planned dlc sure you could go for character unlocks and gallery illustrations by leveling up but as a rhythm game  the base game does feel lacking in a lot of areas and you will dry up all the content within 15 hours of playing sounds like a lot but in rhythm game terms  thats absolutely nothing

so take caution with this if youre still not convinced otherwise by the big addendum i wrote there then by all means  grab muse dash its a ton of fun and very accessible especially to newbie rhythm game players

but if you want any semblance of content and dont want to spend 30 on dlc to get more songs then avoid muse dash and look for an alternative game to play one of which i already mentioned in this very review

#####

good game but im not paying 30 dollars for maps

#####

this is weebshit but its good weebshit

#####

3rd december update made the game literally unplayable and devs still have done nothing to fix it 
update devs fixed the game it has bugs here and there like unresponsive clicks and esc button but gameplay is back to normal

#####


























#####

i really enjoyed this game and was very satisfied with it when i first purchased it im coming back to it a few months later and  after their updates the base game is basically unplayable because all of the songs seem to be part of muse plus now and have been removed from the base game i considered muse plus previously but after this update its basically is forcing you to have to buy the dlc

#####

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay

h1keep it simple rhythm game that just worksh1
muse dash offers a cute and vibrant art style to go along with a simple and addicting two button style gameplay the game has three base characters to choose from that you will unlock costumes and companions for in a token style system as you play during songs you have to hit and avoid things on either the top or bottom plane as you continually run there are three difficulties you can choose from for most songs allowing for you to enjoy regardless of your skill there is a fair amount of varied content content in the songs and as you can probably tell from the store page where this game really shines is its cutesy design and vibrant color scheme 

h1the minor gripesh1
honestly the only gripe i have isnt anything major or deserved there is a lot of content locked behind a paywall at first it was 20 songs you would unlock if you bought it from what i remember seeing but there are even more songs added now ive read how some would prefer to have a steam workshop but it may be hard to keep the charm and design over custom added songs 
codeh1っっ  pros h1
cute art
simple addicting gameplay
vibrant colors
nice soundtrack variety

h1っっ x cons xh1
dlc seems pricey
code

the dlc price is a bit steep but its probably worth if you enjoy the game and they keep cranking out content just clearing the base content of this game took me around four hours and ill probably go back to it every once in a while i hope to be able to pick up the dlc one day and experience everything this game has to offer and i hope they continue to add more content for now if you enjoy rhythm games i can easily recommend muse dash for the base price seeing the great content you get

i dont know what i was thinking

leaving my child behind

now i suffer the curse and now i am blind

with all this anger guilt and sadness

coming to haunt me forever

i cant wait for the cliff at the end of the river

is this revenge i am seeking

or seeking someone to avenge me

stuck in my own paradox i wanna set myself free

maybe i should chase and find

before theyll try to stop it

it wont be long before ill become a puppet

its been so long

since i last have seen my son lost to this monster

to the man behind the slaughter

since youve been gone

ive been singing this stupid song so i could ponder

the sanity of your mother

i wish i lived in the present

with the gift of my past mistakes

but the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes

your sweet little eyes your little smile is all i remember

those fuzzy memories mess with my temper

justification is killing me

but killing isnt justified

what happened to my son im terrified

it lingers in my mind

and the thought keeps on getting bigger

im sorry my sweet baby i wish ive been there

its been so long

since i last have seen my son lost to this monster

to the man behind the slaughter

since youve been gone

ive been singing this stupid song so i could ponder

the sanity of your mother

#####

muse dash is all about rhythm and timing as you tap slide and bash your way through waves of notes in sync with the energetic tunes the controls are super responsive making it easy to get into the groove and show off your sick moves its a total adrenaline rush

the game offers a killer selection of songs across various genres from pop to rock to electronic beats plus its packed with tons of characters to choose from each with their own unique abilities and style customizing your experience with different characters and unlocking new songs adds a layer of replay value its an absolute mustplay no joke
highly recommended

h1 truly a transcendent rhythm game h1
b dont let the ecchianime aesthetic turn you off b if you can theres a lovely game hidden underneath the blatant sex appeal

  great core 2button really works out to 5 or 7 gameplay
  excellent professionalquality charts excellent consistency across charters 
i shoutout to howard_y the goat i
  bangers only real talk this games soundtrack is bumpin if you have an interest in rhythm games odds are pretty good this game can help you find some new artists at minimum and new favourites at best
i okimochi expression my beloved i
  lots of amazing collab song packs and gimmick charts for the enthusiasts out there

once youve caught on to how to play accurately ie consistently 90 the game really opens up in its variety the different characters called muses and pets elfins allow you to tailor your goals and experience persong
of particular note is the devil combo of little devil marija combined with the elfin lilith
this particular combo takes this generally casual rhythm game and makes every single hit count
it has made easily the most tense rhythm gaming experiences of my life despite it being by far one of my leastplayed rhythm games by time spent also played osu sdvx iidx djmax project diva

i havent even mentioned the best part yet you buy it on steam once and get the just as planned dlc once you get any newupcoming song packs for free its seriously rare to see a rhythm game have that much faith in their content that theyll take your money only once twice if you get just the base game first but honestly it isnt representative of the game with the dlc

all in all the best money ive ever spent on a rhythm game ever and its nowhere near done 
heres to 5 more years peropero

h1 sum uph1

 colorful environments with flashy characters
 music tends to go along the aesthetics of the game it is energetic classy and dynamic
 there is a good number of mobs to crush from enemies having different models to bosses
 the game price is relatively low for the quality it presents characters have animations and are rich in detail
 the sound effects are not an extra or queue for notes instead they complement the songs in the game
 lots of replayability with dlc songs some of them are free rewards once the player reaches a certain level

 the game starts very easy which can be boring for some players
 leaderboard requires a sign in into your google account in order to post your score
 since the game is flashy and features vivid colors playing on a room that it is not bright enough can be a bother

h1 introduction h1

muse dash is a hybridrhythm game that successfully combines the elements of sidescroller with the fastpaced beats of a music game it also features a lot of quality when it comes to details in its final product as characters have their own animations and look enemies do as well as the variety of mobs and bosses add a rich layer to the game as well as a vibe that goes between comedy and cuteness 

h1 gameplay h1

in muse dash players must hit musical beats which are featured as a sort of elements these can range from robots to lollipops or starts as they beat these notes hazardous elements such as enemies traps or bosses that will spawn to obstruct the player progress and eventually create a sort of mini showdown after which they will retire early levels start off easy as a sort of practice mode while later ones can be hard to beat on higher difficulties 

there are three characters in the game these are rin buro and marija each of these characters has different costumes that each possess their own effects and will affect gameplay for example default marija will make it so that when a combo is under 100 missing a note wont break the combo while default buro becomes invincible during fever mode these can be stacked with elfin effects elfins are little creatures that will help the players by giving them more fever time reducing damage and more

fever mode is activated when the player fills up the fever gauge this can be done quickly by successfully maintaining a combo while in fever mode notes give more score and the visuals change to reflect an even more energetic style fever mode can also be used to recover some health if enemies with hearts show up

songs have a number below them in each difficulty this number indicates how hard it is to beat the song on the said setting the first songs are extremely easy even on hard which will result in lots of full combosperfects however once the player reaches lv 2530 songs will start to become more challenging especially on master difficulty so for those of you who enjoy those insane notes being stacked together dont worry they are in the game


h1 color is the key h1


what makes muse dash so singular is that it really goes out of its way with the aesthetics every element seems to complement each other rather than being the result of an addition the characters are flashy the enemies have lots of models featuring cute and fun themes the songs are energetic the visuals are vivid and the bosses showup in style it is like watching the game put on a show while playing it

every detail is executed with the utmost cared from buros facial expressions when she hits notes to costumes and sound the songs are fast paced but the rhythm is always present and new enemies keep getting added as the player progresses through the song list this quality resembles a certain extent that of a aaa game

i would recommend players to play on hard mode and then move to master this way there is a learning curve of sorts for each song while also adding some complexity to the gameplay it can be sort of boring at first but it gets much better later in the game

there are also multiple stages from cities filled with robotic enemies to candy islands filled with pink palettes to a factory in space the stages are a nice touch and they can keep the game from getting repetitive as having the same background for all songs would be detrimental the enemy models can vary in the same stage this means that sometimes you can see certain types of enemies while in another song the mobs will be different even if the stage is the same one

h1 some notes h1

the game runs like butter most systems should be getting 100200 frames with ease muse dash is a game that can be both fun and entertaining to watch and you are getting much more than your moneys worth with the quality present here the only thing i didnt like so much is that rather than featuring its own leaderboard it borrows it from google which might look a little cheap

h1 what makes it special h1

what makes this game special is that it does manage to keep the player attention after multiple sessions usually a rhythm game will be bought and eventually forgotten but muse dash makes the player come back to it whenever it is because of the sidescroller elements its aesthetics or the characters commenting on the main menu it is a rhythm game that tries to soar among its peers by adding lots of little details

what also makes this special is how fun it is smacking enemies to the rhythm of a song can be great for casual fun and some enjoyment at the same time getting that full combo or aiming for a place in the scoreboard can be challenging this invites the player to revisit songs they had already cleared and with the mixes of its elements it becomes something to look forward rather than a task

h1 conclusion h1

muse dash is a fantastic game that features lots of elements mixes them together and keeps elevating them its strongest point is its a presentation everything looks nice and rich in detail the song list is pretty good and its always funny to see how the characters speak to the player on screen this is a game that was put effort into it and it was worth to do so based on the attention it has been getting i recommend this to all players who want to try a rhythm game but dont feel too sure and to everyone who enjoys this kind of games

this is what it feels like to get the girl toy from mcdonalds

#####

tldr the game plays out well and the music is addicting characters costumes elfins and songs will continue to be put out for this game which is really neat for people who are still on the edge for buying the dlc songs i am almost 100 sure that when they release new song packs those songs will be included in the dlc it sort of acts as a season pass absolutely get this game and if you can afford it get the dlc as well

this game is a total blast to play people may turn away from its simplistic controls and its limited 2 lane mechanics but the feeling of nailing a combo and popping that fever at just the right time is just amazing and the characters you play also add up to that experience with each of them having unique animations for their personalities

the characters that they introduce are not only cute but each costume that they get have certain abilities such as increased fever bar gain or more health per pickup there is even a costume that lets you watch a perfect run of the song there are also elfins little pets that you can bring during your song in order to give you another special ability to use
the only downside to this is the way you obtain these characters and elfins you start off with one character and no elfins and as you level up you collect items that will unlock a specific characterelfin each characterelfin needs 8 specific items to be obtained this can become a grind and after a while youll be replaying the songs you can do in order to gain the exp to level up but you can see this as a positive too at least they didnt hide any of the characters behind a paywall at least from when im posting this

the songs are very mixed actually some are vocaloid some are instrumental and some are just regularly sung songs in japanese or chinese these are actually pretty nice songs and fit perfectly with the type of game this is in the base game they start off easy and continually become harder and harder to complete which helps players visualise their progress in something more than just unlocking songs

unlocking songs works kind of in the same way that unlocking characters does but instead of having to obtain items it is directly linked to your level songs are unlocked each level until a point then are unlocked every two levels final one is an exception needing 5 more levels after the previous song i only had to replay a song once or twice in order to unlock a few of the songs which was nice but the variety in songs gave me enough experience in order to expand my knowledge on this games mechanics

all in all a very solid game worthy of its praise so far keep up the good work guys

super cute art style the colors and general vibe of the art as a whole makes me very happy but im also biased considering i have a sanrio hyperfixation lmao overall very good art different maps occasionally have different styles too and theyre all very cute and unique

 gameplay 
 very good
 good
 its just gameplay
 mehh
 watch paint dry instead
 just dont

very fun gameplay the leveling system motivates you to play for longer so you can get little items you use to unlock new characters 

 audio 
 eargasm
 very good
 good
 not too bad
 bad
 im now deaf

super good music i even recognize a few of the artists of songs here not all of the music is cutesy upbeat stuff or vocaloid if thats not really your thing its definitely a lot of them but theres also some very good instrumental tracks

 audience 
 kids
 teens
 adults
 grandma

despite everything i have said the fact im gay is probably the only thing keeping me from looking incredibly suspicious picking at least half of the character options

 pc requirements 
 check if you can run paint
 potato
 decent
 fast
 rich boi
 ask nasa if they have a spare computer

my judgement of computer requirements is absolutely horrid so take this with a grain of salt no really i have to check task manager for each new game i play because i always somehow think i can max out the graphics settings and then wonder why my pc is begging for mercy

 difficulty 
 just press w
 easy
 easy to learn  hard to master
 significant brain usage
 difficult
 dark souls

very simple controls just hit f and j or also d and k if youre playing a faster song it can get a bit more complex when you get to harder difficulty songs but since the controls are so easy to remember its pretty easy to find yourself getting better at that one song you were having trouble with

 grind 
 nothing to grind
 only if u care about leaderboardsranks
 isnt necessary to progress
 average grind level
 too much grind
 youll need a second live for grinding

pretty self explanatory you level up after playing 12 songs so getting new characters isnt much of a grind

 story 
 no story
 some lore
 average
 good
 lovely
 itll replace your life

 game time 
 long enough for a cup of coffee
 short
 average
 long
 to infinity and beyond

i just say long because there isnt really a set end to the game its really just play until you get bored

 price 
 its free
 worth the price
 if its on sale
 if u have some spare money left
 not recommended
 you could also just burn your money

the price for the base game is 100 worth it just wanna clarify the dlc id only really get if its on sale theres already plenty of songs in the base game to occupy you for quite a while but if you really want more songs the dlc definitely seems to be worth it considering its really just a buy once get all of the songs  dlc is updated with new songs you just get if youve already purchased it sorta deal there arent dozens of song packs to sort through that start to add up

 bugs 
 never heard of
 minor bugs
 can get annoying
 ark survival evolved
 the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

i havent encountered any bugs but im sure there have been tiny ones nothing game breaking or that arent fixable though

dont let the fact i only have 2 hours of playtime fool you my attention span just is that of a fly i would definitely recommend this game to anyone whos into rhythm games or wants to get into rhythm games but is overwhelmed by how complex they can get its very simple and really good for someone whos just starting out

i am a rhythm game veteran i have been playing and checking out every single rhythm and music game i come across for about 10 years now as a big fan of the genre and digging through so many games i have seen the good the bad and the ugly with different results i can wholeheartedly say this is a good one a great one even from the very beginning it just felt good to play it inputs are tight responsive feels amazing playing and succeeding is extremely satisfying song choice is also very good with a nice varietyyou will get dubstep funkot generic edm eurobeat poppy vocaloid songs and more if you are a fan of rhythm games this one is a must very fun and addictive if you are a veteran used to playing the highest difficulty in your music games dont expect too much of a challenge though you will probably unlock all the songs in about 5 hours of game play like i did but you can always get dlc for many other great songs which i definitely recommend you may find the dlc price a bit high but i would say its worth every penny since the song library is absolutely massive
also muse dash is best played with a controller trust me on that

im not even good at rhythm games i just like cute anime girls

i played without the dlc so you dont have to

this game is the real deal a supremely satisfying rhythm game for beginners and veterans alike with tight controls good song selection and great art and sound design

if youre interested get it its 3 and youll know long before the 2hour refund window whether its something youll want to keep spoiler alert you will there are plenty of songs to enjoy even without the dlc and the game isnt predatory with its unlocks anything thats unlockable via levelup i acquired just by playing and enjoying the game without feeling pressured to buy the dlc for its xp boost at the time of this review ive played for 17 hours on the cheap version and im thrilled to be buying the dlc purely for the love of the game and not because i felt like i needed it to enjoy the base content fully

best rhythm game ive played in years you need this in your life

i only bought this game because shirakami fubukis song is in it the fact that you banned them from streaming the game is a shame

the nonrecommendation is more to highlight the buyer beware aspect of this review for late adopters of dlc content  do recommend muse game on sale   understand dlc can no longer be all grabbed in an all in one dlc package via steam purchase anymore  have to go through the in game store  yes they have muse plus which gets you everything released up to october 2023 but after that is all ipurelyi in game store  most of those usually run 899 each so the price hike for those that dont catch the train does ride high for missing the train   are they worth it  the assistance is worth it for learning players and the tracks themselves come with fun unique visuals and are crossover characters so licensing fees

if you already got just as planned muse dash has already grandfathered you in and youre riding good as long as you stay active during first week releases of dlc updates  otherwise youll be in the same 899 train as nonowners of just as planned


h3muse dash rundownh3
simple musical rhythm game with fun graphics only 2 buttons
prompt directions visibility and pace of what to grab or avoid is how difficulty gets adjusted between charts 

content is absolutely geared towards teenagers and young adults with a taste for the upbeat aspect of japanese  chinese popular music culture
shows signs of being designed for mobile devices and nintendo switch first but added in good convenience options for pc version including controller support
large mostly upbeat music selection
crossover content open for unlimited time frame 
popular songs do get special chart effects and visuals
original and crossover characters with various boosts and gameplay modifiers with the ability to shut off their modifies with a helper if you just want a skin swap
newer players will eat dlc price hike that early adopters will not have to
as of review still being updated with more songs after 6 years both free and dlc with a mixture of crossover and original songs
many easter eggs and hidden charts from touhou to cytus 2  knowledge of what happens in those games may prove useful to unlocking those secerts without guides


h3in speaking of easter eggsh3
for those who want to understand why muse dash is still special despite its simple concept
spoilerbad apple has special visuals on their chartspoiler
spoilerthe nyan cat song is best enjoyed after mastering the default songsspoiler
spoilerif youre familar with the hellohell animated music video the chart visual fade effects match pretty close despite there was no need to do so without affecting game playspoiler
spoilercytus 2 has their most famous song of their lore be given dual treatment of played straight and for those of us who know when the song played in the story can find and play a special chart with unique visuals as wellspoiler
spoilerdefault songs from level 55 onwards will play around with player expectations for unique challengesspoiler

tldr
the chart designers didnt have to go those extra miles and this is by no means an exhaustive list but if you know the pop or meme culture behind a song the care the chart designers add to each song shows through the visuals  some of them hidden through repeat clicking difficulty before starting a song


h3general vibe of music runnerh3
muse dash is the simple one to just pick up and get back into
good mood booster
mixed feelings on the management change but their handling of newer muse characters and their bonuses ie rin and len helping players doing duo notes  hold notes hit off hand prompts easier aimed to be reaching out to both add in popular music based icons into the game that also help players still learning advanced difficult chart patterns while not overshadowing challenge characters that reward higher skilled players who like to curse less than perfect game play for score boosts 
spoilerie little devil marija who only really works for already fast paced charts otherwise she straight up offs herself in under 30 seconds due to her hp drainspoiler

if the japanese and chinese heavy song rooster isnt your thing try out djmax  its a significantly more pc based title with a massive collection of charts and many more english songs to rock out to  funny enough muse dash collabed with djmax respect v as well and rin is a pretty good collab character for those who dislike timing fading prompts   or just stick to beat saber

 h3about the reviewerh3
old rockband 3 and dance dance revolution fan who has been seeking out various music games ever since former musical rhythm titles faded from prevalence   disappeared off steam for several years when titles like arcaea deemo cytus 2 lanota and beat saber played better on nonpc attached devices  has returned and rediscovered some old loves to pc titles and the reemerging market for well done musical games on pc   though the dream of some good music rhythm coop games still drives the hunt for other titles

this game goes hard unfortunately there are some pedo undertones theres a girl who looks 13 and is v sexualized the startup screens often have tits and ass on it and like 90 of the characters are sexualized in some way be it panty slips or whatever people can argue that the age of consent in japan is 13 but that is just not true youre not allowed to fornicate with a child that is under the age of 18 unless they they are married to you which im p sure most adults wouldnt consent to marrying their 13 yr old to other ppl call me an sjw all u want i jus dont wanna have 13 year old looking ass and tits shoved in my face 247 theres one loading screen that says how old are the girls you ask too many questions it makes me uncomfortable as hell the game play is fire and fun as hell and addicting  but if you dont like over sexualization of all the characters then u wont like this game im going to have to recommend this because the gameplay is very fun especially for inexperienced players but be warned the portrayal of women in this game is p messed up

yes there are songs featuring hatsune miku in this game with that out of the way let me tell you that muse dash is just a straight up good time its chockfull of the sort of uwu and uguu anime and vocaloid type beat vibes that i absolutely adore but i dont think you gotta be a fullon weeb to vibe along and give your fingers a real workout here muse dash is a hella cutesy rhythm game with lots of heckin cute and valid music for you and your perhaps soontobe waifus to mash bash and dash your way through together the soundtrack has a pretty good mix of genres and moods but leans mostly towards poppy and upbeat with predominantly clean production and a generally electronic sound there are only a few guitarforwardrock tracks no black metal tracks sorry most of the vocals are sung in japanese and chinese but theres some english and korean as well

the games control scheme and overall premise is very simple notes travel down two rows from right to left and youre tasked with smashing them before they leave the screen while also avoiding obstacles you have an up attackjump for hitting notes in the top row and jumping over obstacles in the bottom row a down attackdive for hitting notes in the bottom row and diving under obstacles in the top row and an optionally manual fever mode activation function by default fever mode is activated automatically when the fever gauge becomes full fever mode in muse dash works much like star power in guitar hero hit notes bar go up use for bonus points  fancy effects wait did i call them notes i meant happy little clouds with bunny ears visibly shy ghosts samurai things lollipops cowboy blob creatures riding seemingly rocketpropelled ice cream cones grumpy cotton candy hammers bonk and smash and dash em all i will continue to call them notes from now on if your chosen character gets hit by something she cries a bit and takes damage and if you fail a stage because she got hit a lot shell cry a lot you dont want to make her cry 

muse dash is a game about playing a beat on your vidya manipulation device of choice in time with music and not usually in correspondence to one particular instrument in a song but several including vocals so you might go bap bap bap bapbapbap on your keyboard to a songs vocals and then barabarabapbap  you just baped along to a drum fill on the same song after finishing a song youll be given a letter ranking based on how accurately you played it and a score based on stuff a note can be missed entirely which counts as a miss it can be hit sort of on time which counts as a great hit and it can be hit basically perfectly on time which counts as a perfect hit going all brrrr on your keyboard and seeing perfect after perfect on the screen with every note hit is super satisfying you need to hit all notes perfectly and not get hit by any obstacles to get 100 accuracy and the gold s ranking on a song if you use your mouse to click anywhere except there on the victory screen after finishing a song youll get a slightly more detailed rundown of how accurate you were hitting most notes in a song is often very easy but hitting most of them perfectly is considerably more difficult and hitting all of them perfectly is just oof there are also like just musical notes that u can run into and stuff ye yeehh you get it notes come and notes go and your mission in muse dash is to hit notes in time with the music

joining you and your waifus on your merry dashing and bashing are the elfins elfins are these little creatures that fly beside the girls and give them various buffs the different girls have different abilities too but to be honest which girl and elfin you decide to use isnt all that important unless youre looking to absolutely maximize your score and climb the leaderboards i personally care more about accuracy than score so i just play with pretty much whoever although ive definitely developed a fondness for marija magical girl l bonk they all function pretty similarly for the most part but a few definitely stand out like reimu from touhou for example who can hover and who is from touhou touhou btw and sleepwalker girl rin who will just straight up play through any track automatically which is helpful if you wish to study a difficult track without dying constantly 

there are differently themed stages with different looking notesenemies for you to dash through a jazzy song might have you dash through a city on a rainy night smashing top hats and missiles because obviously whereas a more cutesysweet song will send you straight to diabetes heaven     its also rumored that sometimes on some songs a stage might all of the different stages look great it can take a teenytiny bit of time to get used to playing on an unfamiliar stage just because everything looks so different but the core mechanics of mashing and dashing are the same between them all

as of writing there are 352 songs in the game about 60 of which i think are included with the base game the just as planned dlc grants you access to all songs currently in the game  all songs added in the future in addition to giving you a permanent 15x exp boost and unlocking all girls which i think the developers refer to as beauties by the way 0 and elfins immediately a few dlc songs are made available to those with only the base game each week for a limited time the base games default songs which doesnt include all the base game songs are unlocked by leveling up  they are not unlocked by the dlc you earn exp and level up by playing through songs after youve unlocked all the default songs i dont know what the heck your level even does mines over 600 as of writing which ok if you like to watch number go the very big one then wahoo mamma mia for you i guess  that number do be going up up up i suppose there are the unlockable illustrations and unlockable girls if you dont have the dlc unlock them for you but they arent gated behind specific levels like the default songs are its a whole big thing the illustrations all look very nice and can be viewed in the menu at any time and they can be saved to your hard drive as pngs as well well the animated ones cant be but whatever unlocked illustrations can be seen on the loading screens as well for like three full seconds stuffs cool and good really

muse dash is very straightforward hop in play the tutorial and bam youre off its got a wonderful playful vibe to it i dont have many complaints with it im tempted to call it perfect i suppose i wish there were more difficulty options for some songs because sometimes i find a song that i really like to listen to but that i dont really like to play because i find it too easy ah well muse dash is a very solid game and a mustplay for fans of rhythm games even those who have never played a rhythm game before should give it a shot its very easy to get a basic hang of and the base game is cheap as heck anyway if you end up liking it a lot the dlc is definitely worth your money as well

this game is horny as fuck but its actually a really fun rhythm game

cute girls and solid music what is there to hate on p

#####

this game somehow makes skeletons in a background look cuter than i ever could and im not sure how to feel about that

#####

i had no idea pressing the same 2 buttons over and over could be so fun

#####

this is a great and cheap rhythm game that i enjoyed playing through if you do choose to buy it here are a few things you will have to keep in mind before purchasing it
 you are basically only paying for 10 of the actual game 90 of the games content is locked behind a 35 dlc
 the publisher of this game has a concerning history with supporting the ccp
 the dlc includes exclusive characters that do provide you with actual benefits making this game semip2w however for the most part the free content will do you just fine 

if you keep all these in mind then feel free to buy it you will enjoy the game as long as you acknowledge these facts

i picked up this game for about 2 thinking i probably wouldnt play more than 15 min i was wrong i played for over a half hour before i was dragged away the base package contains a great variety of tunes and the game has many difficulty settings to cater to all levels from two left feet to rhythm wizardry the dlc package for this game provides a huge number of tunes although each week a song from each dlc album is made free meaning if you play weekly you will end up playing almost all of the songs

suprisingly i think i will give this another go and i recommend it for anyone who likes anime and japanese game music i definately got my 2 worth although to be honest if it cost more i personally would have given it a miss because the content isnt my style get it on sale if your wondering what your missing

#####

ive had muse dash and just as planned on mobile for several years now just popping in here to combat some of the poor reviews

for years the amount of very cheap content available to players has been staggering just as planned has come to unlock almost 500 songs for the same cheap 30 price which is crazy as each song comes with 34 charts and we arent talking about the characters elfins and illustrations that take a lot of artist talent keep in mind that people need to be paid to create charts make art and write or license that crazy number of songs

im honestly glad that peropero is planning to up their prices as the game grows bigger and jap becomes less sustainable please before bashing on the new payment model consider the amount of love commitment and hard work that has taken this game from a small indie project to a phenomenal rhythm game with 500 songs

#####

bcure me of my rhythm feverb

i actually knew of muse dash before it had a release date on steam i vaguely remember coming across it one day and seeing gifs of two characters which i now know is maid marija and sleepwalker rin however i never actually picked it up till the last winter sale i guess i never added it to my wishlist and thus never got a notification that it released fast forward after i played through deemo reborn as well as still playing deemo and voez here i am trying to shake off my obsession with another rhythm game i saw that this was just 3 and said why not if i didnt end up liking it it wouldnt be too much money down the drain

muse dash is a colorful two lane rhythm game that has you fight enemies or projectiles to the beat of the music instead of simply hitting the notes taking a sidescroller approach your enemies come in from the right and will either be at ground level or up in the air which makes up the lanes a song can take place on either of the four maps with most enemies getting a reskin and containing their own boss though the variety youll come across enemywise doesnt stop at what lane theyre in theres the classic small and big enemies enemies that are linked together called gemini that take up both lanes ghosts that disappear a few seconds before it hits your crossfire and bosses there are also the more annoying raiders variant that is basically an enemy swooping in at the last second bosses in particular will send out more enemies fire projectiles where you have to resist your urge to dodge them or even come at you but you cant necessarily defeat them though the maps boss and a particular big enemy with an exclamation mark will let you mash away and there are hold notes sheets here as well

other than enemies there are also hammers that can swing down saws that you need to jump over or you get hurt and your combo is broken song notes that increases your score and hearts to increase your health

as of now the base game has 48 songs available with 100 songs with the just as planned dlc with more songs coming in every month in addition muse dash also has a weekly free song rotation for anyone without the dlc so you can get more of a taste on what the dlc will give you other than listening to the song previews

there are 3 characters or muses that you can play as with their own unique outfits each different outfit will give you a specific ability that can help you out whether it be giving you more health or increasing your score there are also elfins that can join you and provide you with their ability if you happen to get hurt a lot or want to get a full combo more easily you can equip an elfin with an ability that can help although these arent unlocked automatically on every level up youll be randomly given two chips that will either be for an elfin a character skin or a photo for loading screens elfins and characters require eight while photos only need five

you can gain exp from completing songs the higher score you have the more exp you get achievements daily challenges and song specific challenges which can range from getting a minimum combo or perfectly hitting certain enemies idol buro also gives you more exp when you play as her

muse dash is definitely worth picking up for 3 before i picked up the just as planned dlc i played for 5 hours and still needed to unlock one more song of course those who want to score on all difficulties and perfect all songs will have a longer playtime you probably should look up some songs so you know if youll enjoy the music here but considering how cheap it is for the base game it couldnt hurt to try it out anyway

one of my fav rhythm games 3 super cute n easy to learn

#####

this is a great pc rhythm game for 3 you get a ton of songs and one dlc gets you supposedly everything extra and yet to come it took me almost 5 hours to just clear all the songs in the base game and not even on the hardest difficulty 

there are some negatives  the unlock system is completely random for characters and familiars which sucks at this point the bonus xp character will be one of the last ones unlocked for me the abilities are completely tied to the outfit andor familiar which means you tend to always use the same one no matter how many you unlock it would be nice to pick your bonus and then pick your outfit for variety

i would recommend playing the core game for a while before picking up the dlc as it is an upfront investment there but this game is great

the cutest rythm game out there absolute worth the price

only things that could made it even better
 a song editor for custom maps like in other rythm games
 archievements for steam and maybe trading cards makes it even more replayable

#####

very fun clicking buttons i like this

#####

i really like this game

but the developer are censoring and banning people who just want to enjoy custom songs 
i think a rhythm game without modding is not a good rhythm game becaus its limited to its small library

i dont rly have a problem with an 30 dlc were i can get more songs but why shouldnt i be allowed to get mods on this game
i know you can mod this game but for me its a pain in the ass to find how to do it 

httpswwwredditcomrmusedashcommentsd8pm0acustom_songs_are_possible

a mod on this reddit responded with this
thread is removed for illegal modhack gameplay also op will be banned for not respecting the developers wishes

this is retarded imo
why the fuck wouldnt you want custom songs 
this review will probably be censored too _ツ_

sry for bad english

this game has been some of the most fun i have ever had with a rhythm game it would be an easy recommendation if not for the current state of the dlc i was lucky enough to get into the game before just as planned was retired about 23 years

for context peropero had a dlc for their game just as planned  which promised there would be no need to pay for future updates an absolute steal this dlc and its promise was made before muse dash blew up considerably and my guess for why they decided to try and go back on it is because it just isnt sustainable muse dash is cheap and just as planned  was still a good price for getting literally every new song pack for free even with the price increases i actually was okay with this change it felt fair not many in the community felt the same and i dont blame them peropero attempted to compromise with several announcements which just made people angrier paired with some other controversies in the past and you have a company that has broken the trust its built with its community in its attempts to create a more sustainable model

im not defending peropero here either there was other ways to go about making more money without obliterating the trust of their fans

as it stands now just as planned  users will continue getting all content packs for free while newer players get a much worse deal if you chose to buy this game now you would have to pay more than the people that got here before the 5th anniversary as much as i love this game i cannot genuinely recommend it to a new player unless theyre willing to put up with the fact they have to spend more than veterans just to unlock the same content

that aside the game itself is incredibly fun its a 2k rhythm game with waifus and some really fun charts among its many content packs some of their content packs are super unique and interesting too and the game has a lot of charm to offer

muse dash is a rhythm game featuring a very pretty anime anesthetic its music collection is mostly electronic music with heavily autotuned vocal if there is any as a fan of acoustic they are not my type but they are not bad to listen to i think anime music lovers are likely to appreciate its collection 

besides the music taste this game is solid and fun it has a structured progression system to unlock content such as music characters and skins so that you dont get bored easily it is also very easy to get the hang of however for controller users the game fails to show the control scheme correctly in the tutorial it shows a play icon for air attack actually all buttons including moving sticks on the left side are for the air while all on the right side are for the ground excluding select and menu buttons i appreciate the game gives freedom to players to use any button they desire but what is that play icon suppose to mean please fix it

this is my first time playing this genre so i dont know if this is a thing for rhythm games not following the beats sometimes to be more hectic and unpredictable it doesnt feel right to me as the sudden change of not following beats can throw me off also some songs have less audible beats making these songs more difficult to play not in a fun way

anyway for those who are into this genre especially for people like electronic music and anime this game is a treat as for those who havent play any rhythm game you can get it a shot it is cheap easy to get into and its music collection is constantly getting updated i heard rhythm game helps practice reaction for shooting game as well

#####

i absolutely adore this game the music selection is on point and the various crossovers have introduced me to games id never heard of 1010

especially for such a low base price i love it

#####

the game is good especially for the money its a nice rhythm game the devs are great what isnt great is their publishers and how they are ccp shills 

taiwan exists saying that is not controversial its a fact saying that should not be cause for corporate harassment you should be ashamed of yourselves xd network

#####

fun music thighs

#####

hololive

#####

shortly after having bought this game i found out that a very skilled streamer showed their stream analytics which show taiwan as a country during a stream this triggered ultra nationalist chinese into launching an online harassment campaign against them including death threats xd networks publisher response was to ban the streamer from streaming the game banning all their previous streams as well

a couple of their videos
listhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuydzpb_f7so
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvosnqkn4opklist

if you still really want to play this game find a friend who will borrow it to you instead

politics dont belong to videogames and abusive companies like this should go bankrupt save your money for someone more deserving instead

the game the little i played was fine an fun the problem is that it has only 52 songs of which you might like not the entirety this implies that youre forced to buy the dlc if you want a bit of variety and more songs to play if only it had a music analyzer like audiosurf or beat hazard

httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp235800audiosurf_2
httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp618740beat_hazard_2

so even under a technical standpoint it falls short and barely okay if you wanted to ignore what has been said above value to money ratio remains low

#####

game is currently unplayable the error still hasnt been fixed and i cant even get passed the press any button screen i love this game please please fix it soon n

#####

i came from osu looking for another rhythm game and got hooked on muse dash so much that i bought it on mobile so i could play on the go very fun all in all just know that if you want to buy a pack buy it on the device you use more because the wallet data cannot be transferred over to another device

#####

excellent music and visuals to accompany a deceptively simple control scheme the entire game is two buttons you can tell the devs had fun making this game  they continue to push new content  if youre a fan of taiko in osu youll have a blast

#####

its so good im just so bad

#####

this is almost technically my first rhythm game ive enjoyed and wanted to play seriously its very accessible and i feel like it starts out easy enough for anyone to enjoy the game first appears very simplistic i started out playing with just two fingers i very much enjoyed for the first time being able to play a rhythm game even up to a medium level i use 4 fingers now to play most songs im enjoying s ranking level 78 songs and going crossed eyed on higher levels very enjoyable surprisingly enjoyable if you thought you couldnt get into rhythm games this is the perfect one that i think can catch anyones interest

a very casual and catchy visual music game where you can defeat various enemies from the air and ground avoid gears collect notes and hearts to complete the music

code a decent number of song are included even by default but the number of song will increase with the purchase of the dlc there are regular updates and collaborations with others so if you only have dlc you can play for a long time

 characters not only change their appearance but also have their own characteristics so its nice to have the option to change the character that suits your playstyle as needed or just use the character you likecode

bought the game for myself safe to say im addicted i plan to get the dlc at a later date girls are cute songs are catchy if youre a fan of vocaloid and jpop and cpop youll probably find a few songs on there that youll enjoy pretty easy to pick up and play especially for a novice at rhythm games but can be hard to master especially with the higher difficulties

pros
cheap dlc is 30 far more than the game but for the amount of new songs you get its probably worth it
addicting
cute girls
catchy songs
small download and isnt too demanding on slower machines i play on both my gaming desktop and my microsoft surface go

things to be aware of
some of the character skins are considered nsfw however i dont think there is any nudity so i wouldnt recommend this game for someone under the age of 13 use your judgement if your kid asks for it look at the character skins before deciding if its right to let a someone under 18 play

#####

a very fun and addictive game for a great price

 the base game currently has 46 songs and they keep adding to that list over time most of these songs are locked until you level up which happens pretty quickly and gives you have something to work towards random dlc songs will be free to play for limited times if you havent bought the dlc too
 the gameplay looks really simple and might even look a bit boring but its a lot more fun and satisfying than it looks and it can become pretty challenging to get full combos and high percentages on songs with higher difficulties
 there are 3 different characters with several costumes each but the game divides them as 15 individual characters with their own unique abilities there are also pets called elfins that have their own useful abilities
 the music is really great although that is purely based on opinion but the genres are decently diverse so im sure there are some good tracks for just about any rhythm game players


muse dash really exceeded my expectations for its price and the dlc expands the game a lot you just pay for it once and you get all the current music plus they just keep adding tracks to it over time


ps for anyone who plays a lot of rhythm games there are a few songs in this game that are also in other games like musyncmusynx voez and djmax respect v

#####

i like touhou songs in it

#####

okay one more song then im done

new character unlocked

okay one more song

new song unlocked

okay maybe just one more

new picture unlocked

okay i guess this is my life now

#####

breast physics 10 out of 10

#####

thicc girls and best beats

#####

great music fun gameplay anime bitçhes what else can i ask for

#####

ignore the children enjoy the music

#####

rhythm game featuring lewd anime girls

#####

my fav quote
purchase just as planned to bunlock all music packs characters ans elfins immediatelyb
future updates on muse dash will be unlocked for free

#####

please play this game

#####

steam said its similar to hollow knight so i expected a badass soulscastlevania fusion received some dumb rhytm game with cute graphics instead worth it

#####

great rhythm game i am absolutely horrible at it but its great  

my eyes go crosseyed though when playing this

#####

cute girls and boppin music what more could you want

ㅤㅤㅤ𝗗𝗜𝗦𝗖𝗟𝗔𝗜𝗠𝗘𝗥 while the base game is fairly cheap and you can eventually unlock almost all songs and characters simply by playing do note that there is a dlc called bjust as plannedb that gives you access to pretty much ieverythingi its quite a bit pricier but its real value for money  the game is updated regularly and new music is added all the time never regretted getting it

ㅤㅤㅤso what does one see when they launch muse dash the first thing would inevitably be the logos of the developer and the publisher stylised to include crudelydrawn butts and breasts then a flash  and a sexualised anime girl appears on the title screen or maybe all three of them and then it just never stops the innuendos the double entendres the scantilyclad ladies and the moans this is probably where the backseating potential goes down the drain one might even go as far as to say that this game exudes a iseverei lack of female companionship 
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2827343248
ㅤㅤㅤhowever all of that is surfacelevel stuff  a superficial veneer of eyecandy fan service for those who are able to look past it muse dash will reveal its striketight bodystrike true nature  an easytolearn yet toughtomaster rhythm game that despite its simplistic mechanics can put your abilities to a real test 

ㅤㅤㅤthere are only two lines of notes  on the ground and in the air some notes will be invisible some of them youll need to hold and some will require you to mash all buttons as fast as possible there are also spinning gears you need to jump over hammers that you must hit and gemini enemies  those that make you hit both ground and air buttons at the same time to top it all off each song has a stage boss that barrages you with notes in a less predictable fashion or at a faster pace thats everything there is to it however when it all comes together you will see just how crazy it can get

ㅤㅤㅤif youre planning to reach the top of the leaderboards or just get any good at this game youll need to use your keyboard to play  gamepads will be fine as a starting point they may even feel more intuitive and natural but as the difficulty ramps up you will find that youve hit a glass ceiling youre allowed to customise the controls as much as you want so play around with them and see what works

ㅤㅤㅤone of the actual reasons im so in love with this game besides sister marijas ivoluptuousi hips of course is the fact that like all rhythm games it offers the feeling of real almost tangible progression heres a song that you couldnt beat two weeks ago and then forgot  now you can play it with 100 accuracy using just one hand  while barely breaking a sweat successfully learning new skills is possibly the most satisfying thing our brains can experience  and muse dash takes that empowering feeling bottles it neatly and sells at a rather affordable price you cant miss this deal man
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2844151368
ㅤㅤㅤthat is not to say that the game is outright perfect its got its own share of blemishes and some of the most notable ones in my experience are

ㅤㅤㅤ bthe ranking system is somewhat flawedb  once i attempted to play a song that was clearly out of my league i missed 23 times nearly died and still got an bab like come on there are ingame not steam achievements for getting ten bcbs  what am i supposed to do to get a bcb fall asleep while playing 

ㅤㅤㅤ bsome characters have useless skillsb  basically there are three girls but each one has several variations that grant certain perks most of these perks have no use whatsoever sister marijas visual design and music are simply the best and i wanted to pick her but all she does is flip around the ground and the air notes why would anyone want that whats the point

ㅤㅤㅤ bno way to create song collectionsb  anyone whos ever played iosui knows what im talking about sometimes a particular song has a certain pattern of notes that you want to practice more but you cant create a custom folder with songs like that  you can only choose favourites im thus forced to keep a notepad document with this data which is super inconvenient 

ㅤㅤㅤ bslightly broken english at timesb  i know that the developers are not native speakers no big deal but how hard can it be to hire a proofreader

ㅤㅤㅤall of these while positively annoying dont ireallyi get in the way of the fun  and the devs are working hard to make their game better for example song search  a feature that was much coveted by all players  was added recently its nice to know that theres someone whos listening to feedback and taking notes 

ㅤㅤㅤoverall muse dash makes an impression of a game that at its core isnt about trying hard or pushing your limits  its about enjoying the moment the enjoyment is made easier with all the uum igorgeousi colours and you know iinvitingi mechanics yeah sure つ

h1 rhythmic cuteness extravaganza h1

writing this review out of sheer impulse due to the amusement ive had easily should be a blind purchase for anyone that has taken even the slightest of fascination to it you simply cant go wrong with this

first minute in and im absolutely captivated by the cutesy and vibrant aesthetic that the game offers in another few moments saw myself completely engrossed losing track of time whilst being exposed to some underrated melodies and tracks that profusely appeal to the masses of the weaboo popculture such as of course myself 3

muse dash consists of 3 lovely playable characters with unlockable costumes that are most meticulously fashioned each with distinctive ingame animations and quirks  
40 tracks are in the base game with an optional addition of 13 music packs that has 6 songseach pack upon the purchase of the dlc the players will receive 1 pack each month completely for free

it comprises of two button inputs now while that may sound quite elementary underestimated must it be not due to the articulation it has that makes up for a euphoric experience for indeed inside this brightly lit shell conceals within an engaging rhythmic venture

originally muse dash is a mobile game available on ios  android this pc port is polished and faithful to its counterparts with higher resolutions and an unlocked framerate for fluidity and pure eye candy bliss 

for a rhythm genre enthusiast it would pose as rather underwhelming however fortunately there is a higher master difficulty unlocked that cranks things up a notch for a bit of a challenge but can as well be surmounted with practice 

with such a colorfully charming appeal ebullient design ecstatic gameplay at a bang for the buck of a price muse dash makes an excellent candidate for gifting to fellow  weebs friends 
observed some of my own pals playing after being gifted going at it relentlessly that automatically serves as a compliment to the product

h1 tldr h1 
spoileryou know you want it you weebspoiler



note to devs kindly do add in achievements and trading cards to this gorgeously crafted lil game

edit tradings cards and now finally achievements have too been implemented must dash is now perfect

#####

it gives me anxiety and i cant even blink 1010 would recommend
also there are many songs and characters

#####

heh tiddies 

#####

rip my keyboard

#####

perfect fit for both newcomers and veterans to the genre muse dash manages to strike a perfect balance between being fun and a visual delight while also including a plethora of songs to unlock in the base game through play alongside illustrations and playable characters who can be interacted with on the home screen
im hoping in the future they will consider adding a level editor as the game would very much easily benefit from having one

a cute rhythm game with kawaii anime girls while the dlc seems expensive it gives you access to all the songs packs and more will be added in the future for free you also get an exp boost the base game does have 30 songs so the price  cdn 339 for me  is fair i had a blast playing it and ill go back for more my favorite songs are breaking dawn disco night midstream jam bass telekinesis cotton candy wonderland tsukuyomi glimmer exist out of sense thirty million persona irreplaceable and one song by ank feat kumako the title is in chinese  

now i didnt follow the controversies with the devspublisher so i wont comment on those too bad the dlc with all songs will be removed for packs

#####

cytus ii  muse dash arknights collab

#####

visuals are nice fun for a few hours base music is mediocre the 33 dlc doesnt cover all content released ingame store purchases that feel a bit on the predatory end in short there are better games to get that fit this genre dont fall for the base game cheap price steal like i did

i love girls

#####

i am 32 years old

my exwife and i have a daughter together and we adopted our son together both are now 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i felt lost and unhappy i was selfdestructive one day i was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that i punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion this resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right handthe hand i worked with played games with and used to carry my children to bedthe hand i desperately needed to ensure i could continue providing

upon learning the severity of the selfinflicted damage i became almost suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i had never experienced anger outbursts nor was i the type to break down and cry but i was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side

with nothing better to do i looked for a game i could play with one hand while recovering somehow i stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments i decided it was worth a try i must admit i didnt beat the game nor did i play as much as some of you in fact i may have played this game for only a day or two that being said after doing so i had a new joy and hope for life i managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me i could experience the joy and happiness of other people i relaxed for 5  minutes listening to this music long enough to realize that i would be okay

after realizing this i turned off the game and went back to work my hand hurt a lot but i was motivated i stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father i needed to be at that moment not the weak boy i was behaving like

today i am close friends with the mother of my children we dont fight argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

now i have 3 children my third child is wait also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each others lives we have been dating for a year and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life has in store for you and if i had given up when all odds were against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you
