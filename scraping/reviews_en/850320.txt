played the demo during the steam game festival along with a few others and phogs was for sure the most enjoyable 
initially when the price popped up this morning on release i was a bit uncertain but already feel its worth it at just over an hour

pros
no technical issues thus far on an average machine
looks absolutely beautiful i absolutely adore the art its super whimsical and colourful reminds me a lot of adventure time both environmentwise and character design just lovely and makes me feel super nostalgic have yet to witness anything horrible with the character models maybe the phogs as they spin extended through the air
fab relaxing music
dogs phogs woof

most importantly gameplay is so fun really simple and the puzzles are never frustrating the other half of my phog currently is my age 20s but could totally play it with younger family maybe 8 gamers that kind of accessibility is neat

cons
wheres ya merch store i need a 6ft phog 
i hate those screaming clocks 


tldr good worth price nice all skill level coop game

ive never had so much fun playing a game in my life i played it with my girlfriend over discord and we couldnt stop gushing over how cute this game is its fun sweetly made but so simple with adorable yet sometimes tricky puzzles and quite a datasaver compared to most online games a huge recommend and yes were both in our 20s so no this isnt just a game for kids its wholesome fun

#####

phogs is a cute physics puzzler game for 12 people i played it on the same screen with my 4yearold with each of us using xbox sx controllers to control one half of the phog

the main story will take you around 912 hours 
the game is split into hubs there is a home hub that links to three thematic hubs each of those hubs has several levels some space to goof off and a few extra collectibles 
you can collect golden bones and trade them in for silly hats

pros
  great looking game
  the game design will give a nice tiny preview of a new mechanic before making it part of a puzzle
  puzzles got more challenging over time
  silly hats
  npcs will pet the dogs
  bark bark bark bark bark

cons
  no ultrawide support as far as i could tell
  got stuck in the floor a few times you can click a respawn action in the menu to fix it and itll drop you close by
  my kid wants a phogs shirt and they dont exist

if youre on the fence give the demo a whirl its very representative of the game it excludes the hubs and instead strings together a few parts of some of the levels in each hub

#####

doesnt cure depression and anxiety but its adorable and i like it so i see this as absolute win 
ʕっ ᴥʔっ ﾟ ﾟ ﾟ

phogs stands for physics dogs

phogs


phogs is a familyfriendly puzzle platformer the game revolves around two attached dogs and their starchy adventures 

play and control both at the same time to traverse around the fun goofy world use both of your dog heads to control and manipulate items to solve puzzles and overcome platforms 

gameplay phogs lets you play as two attached dogs and now you must help them throughout this goofy awkward world full of puzzles and platforms 

phogss gameplay seems to be targeted towards every age the game seems pretty childish and my initial impression was that it was for children but no the puzzles and platformer elements are intuitive enough for adults to enjoy as well 

the gameplay is supersimplified with its wasd to control bluecollared dogs and arrow keys for pink use space to interact items with the bluecollared dog and right control for pink 

there are puzzles platformers and obstacles scattered around everywhere and you will have to use a dog or both at the same time to interact with items to complete the puzzles or interact with a platform 

the world revolves around these puzzles each is well made and well placed and all of them serve a purpose  at no point did i feel that anything was out of place or that the games target audience might not appreciate this 

for an example at the very beginning you will need to raise four platforms from different floors of the beginning stage to be able to travel to different parts of the map and in order to get to these platforms you will have to go through a prescribed number of other platforms and puzzles 

some were as easy as placing a ball in a triggering switch while a bit of a tricky one that requires you to use both of your dogs to reach a peak while strong winds are blowing  

although there are a ton of puzzles and things to interact with the good thing is they are very simple and tasteful even my 8yearold cousin took a few moments to figure out the trickiest one which is great you dont need stupid hard puzzles and platforms to enjoy a game you need smart and wellplaced ones 

another feature that is important and plays out quite well in a goofy way is stretching by hitting left and right shift you can stretch the dogs and hit spaceright control at the same time to grab on to items and switches to complete various tasks 

for example there are two switches far apart that you will have to interact with at the same time to start a function simply stretching the dogs and hitting grab at the same time will engage with the said switch 

world design beautiful colorful and joyful is what my 8yearold cousin said while playing and i agree there is a certain level of charm to this goofy cartoonish art style and combined with its great visuals and relaxing environment the game felt very good while playing 

the only downside to phogs world design would be its awkward terrain and elements scattered along the pathways which created quite a few minor annoyances throughout the game 

music and sound effects wellselected and implemented fits the theme of the game just fine but the music did get repetitive after a while 

puzzles easy intuitive and well designed im saying this again    puzzles dont need to be crazy hard or stupid they need to be clever and well balanced i must say phogs did a decent job at it 

the puzzles didnt hinder the flow of my gameplay they were well integrated with the world design easy enough for the kids to enjoy and clever enough to grab my attention

considering all aspects of the game phogs turned out to be a fun familyfriendly platformer with a clever mixture of puzzles throughout its world i played it with a young cousin of mine to get his perspective it seems like the kid loved it and rightfully so a fun world design goofy cartoonish art style clever puzzles and amazing visuals 

although a decently sized game there is not much replayability which is something to consider as well 

positives 

 fun gameplay 
 simple yet clever puzzles
 unique art style 
 fun and goofy gameplay machines 
 decent music and sound effects 
 collectables to find 

negatives 

 few bugs here and there
 music got repetitive after a while 
 no replayability 

dive into a fun goofy world with two cute dogs and their adventurous journey

reminds me the catdog

#####

this is one of the most wholesome games i have every come across it is lovely joyful and just plain happy my boyfriend and i have been struggling to find online coop games to play together through 2020 and this has just been wonderful absolutely recommend you cant help but smile the whole time you are playing

the only problem weve had so far is i cannot see the hats in the hat shop but as these are just cosmetics it has in no way impacted our enjoyment of the game

#####

super phoggers

#####

absolutely incredible coop game with puzzles that arent too complex and certainly adorable all the way through

the love and care that the developers put into this game is greatly shown and even when the game has the occasional whacky physics glitch where you truly ascend into the spaghetti you were destined to be its nothing but entertaining and hilarious with no frustration involved whatsoever  i am incredibly glad to call this game one of a select few to have 100d on steam and to do all the collecting and extra challenges with my mate to accomplish this goal earning lovely cute little hats along the way was some of the best entertainment ive had in years

if you have a best friend or someone you love to do this game with absolutely get it and do it with them  again the puzzles arent too hard and theyre easy enough to solve that they wont really cause any frustration its all a positive experience through and through

i really hope the devs have an idea in mind for a phogs 2 and maybe even with two pairs of coop players totaling 4 players or even more for some true adorable puzzlesolving chaos because i am dying to have more phogs content  thank you 3

1010 amazing game definetly recommend for folks which love to play coop games had a lot of fun also played in remote play by steam worked great works well with all controllers tried ps4 and one nobrand 
this game is full of cute stuff with great and diverse game mechanics developers were very careful to details and did a great job the design here is amazing too each minute in this game is pleasant especially if you play it with your partner close friend or a family member didnt encounter any bugs or lags or anything else
from the many coop games ive played this is one of the best

totally recommend to everyone

#####

possibly the single most sickeningly happy wholesome video game experience ever

#####

phoggers
this game is epic
im alone and dont have friends
i cant play coop because im lonely

#####

a recipe
one copy of phogs
one person you talk with on the regular a wife is good but a friend will work fine
steams remote play

using remote play play some phogs with them  use discord to ensure youre coordinated  solve puzzles enjoy chaos mash the bark button frantically

right so the game itself  you play one head of a twoheaded dogthing whose heads are linked by a stretchy doggy tube  somehow each head can locomote on its own and by virtue of being stuck together each head influences movement of the unit as a whole  so if youre not coordinated it gets a bit chaotic  im not saying we didnt get ourselves tangled on a post because id be lying  we totally did

aaand together you solve puzzles  so far they have not been really hard puzzles theyre just more challenging because both of you have to agree on the same general plan  since the game has hidden collectibles strewn about the map your partner also has to want to go poking about looking for them as well

i dont think my wife stopped laughing the whole time we played  22 thumbs up for that alone  worth every penny

#####

cute game and really wanted to like it but the multiplayer is very buggy and not enjoyable after many lags if a patch comes out to fix multiplayer would gladly play again

#####

this game is really fun and cute dont play this game alone it should be played with another person sitting next to you

#####

great coop game 1010 aarfs

#####

a double ended dog that shoots windwaterfire out of its butt great coop

#####

likes
1 art style is really amazing i kept looking around the map because it looked so good
2 lots of collectibles really fun to look for the bones and boingles in each level 77 bones and 23 i think boingles
3 hat store you can get hats for your phogs
4 very fun coop there is a lot of chaos when playing this game

dislikes
1 some clunkyness and disorienting camera angles led to a few deaths but nothing much past that 

i think its a game thats been done with a lot of love behind it i really enjoyed the game overall and id recommend it

#####

my friend and i havent laughed this hard in a long time if youre looking for some silly fun while grinning almost the whole time buy this game

one small downside the game doesnt recognize my xbox controller it works fine with a ps4 controller however

#####

i 100 can tell you to buy this game especially if you have a friend who loves chaotic energy as much as you do the game is very wholesome as you can bark as much as you want whenever you want and npc characters give you hugs the game can be fustrating but it makes it much more fun that way

#####

me and my friend have a blast playing this game its glitchy in every good way possible instead of making us mad they make us laugh a lot it has way more content than i expected and after 23 hours we arent even close the end of the game amazing 1010

#####

i had a blast with my friend this game is a must play for those who like to play coop puzzle plataform games
the only thing i can say that i dislike so much is the freaking scissors for some reason the interaction with them was really glitchy we spent some good 5 mins trying to cut things sometimes
but overall a very solid game

#####

played as a long sausage of two dog heads  had to learn how to control one head and someone else controls the other  especially when one goes one way and the other pulls in a different direction  but you know what  communication  yes  thats the only way  but not really  because  when you get stuck under a bridge on the first level  there is nothing but a reset that will save you

everything is freaking adorable  everything

i would like a permanent beam light phog  then i just blind everything in my way  hah

obviously you will get stuck more than 25 and some puzzles were solved in a rather  unconventional way  but  they were solved  cant argue with that

the camera is not your friend  it makes you rather  nauseous not always dont get discouraged  it just rotates on its own  especially in that sleep land level where it was the worst  however  if you rest and dust yourself off  you can do it

those alarm clocks  i hate them  i dropped them off the level  they can go explode somewhere  who put them in the end credits

so did um  phogs reproduce  is that how they reproduce  holy  thats awesome  is that a hint at phogs 2  would love to get stuck again

loved game  thank you   

#####

i wish hogs were real

#####

bugged game but really really fun you can easily cheat without intentions in a lot of puzzles

#####

so gifted me this to play together and its amazing 10000000000000000 worth it great to play with your so

borkbork would bork again

#####

such a great game worth every penny the entire time i was playin i was grinnin from ear to ear and laughin like an idiot 1010 3

#####

play as not one but two phogs

#####

awooooooo woof woof bark bark awoooooooooo

#####

brilliant coop teamwork 3d puzzle adventure game where you both play as either end of a dogdog like cat dog but only dogs  if you have the opportunity to play this one definitely take it
httpsyoutubeamkborlrbrk

#####

1010 this game was way more than i was expecting it to be the entire game is so cute and charming im not sure how anyone could actually play this game alone though id really recommend this game for couples to play together this game might look like its purely for kids but as an adult of 30 years i loved every minute of this game 3 
only down sides to this game is the fact that it is a bit buggy but thats pretty easy to get past for the most part you can generally respawn and the game will fix its self

#####

yes

#####

one if not the most fun coop game to play d

#####

my boyfriend and i tried this out and we had a very good time with it its a fun silly and interesting puzzle game and each world provides different mechanics to learn to keep things interesting 

id say the only issues we faced were some bugs mainly in the play world with the grabbing claw section where we encountered a strange but hilarious bug that sent us flying off the map also trying to bounce on the drums didnt seem to work however i know theyve updated things since we last played so these issues may have been fixed already 

overall id definitely recommend it and id say its even more fun if youve got the right person to play with you

#####

cuteness overload 100 recommend 

#####

its phoggers to play with friends would 100 recommend

#####

super cute puzzle platformer game highly recommend playing with a friend for some chaotic fun though its not terrible to play alone soundtrack is fantastic the animation style is very cute and alot of the character design was adorable the levels were all different with fun mechanics that werent too difficult to pass but were all quite clever had a few glitchy moments but nothing gamebreaking and theres a respawn built into the game that makes it easy to fix

#####

its phogs

#####

i love being attached physically to my partner 1010

#####

one of the coziest games ever honestly just so adorable

#####

the devs were super kind and provided me with a game code

i think this game is just so adorable and fun so far i played solo but you can play with a friend coop style and i imagine it would be extremely fun as you each would control one head of the lil phogs playing solo was a little tough at first since each half of the controller is dedicated to one side of the phogs so it requires a bit of coordination i definitely got used to it after a little bit and enjoyed what i had played i think the graphics are gorgeous kind of reminds me of ooblets or donut county with the colors and style the soundtrack is nice as well very upbeat

in terms of challenge ive only played a few of the early levels but so far i think theres a good balance its just complicated enough that i do get confused sometimes or have to back track but it doesnt feel punishing by any means and makes you want to figure the puzzle out

i can see phogs being a good fit for gamers of all ages

#####

worth every penny such a cute game especially the sound effects and visuals so far my boyfriend and i arent even half way through and already played over 5 hours a perfect game for couples or friends to work together 3

#####

dog

#####

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

#####

a fun and cute game any bugginess that was found was usually pretty entertaining especially when it caused the phogs to launch into the sunset when the body got too twisted haha would recommend it just to see that happen 

only gripe is that there was a glitch with the hats so that my partner online wasnt able to see the hats in the store and consequently we werent able to buy them

#####

super fun wholesome game it manages to be a physicsbased game that doesnt rely on cheesing it the puzzles actually feel like progress and make you want to collect all dem bones a lot of games with collectables get stale really quickly but phogs has so much charm my single gripe is that there is an unfixed bug where the hat shop appears empty in coop

whilst you can probably play this alone you should absolutely play this with someone you care about and fight over whoever can grab all the pizza first i mash the bork button every spare second i get 1010

#####

cute fun times

#####

awesome  game love the design of the game thank you for making this awesome game  d p


#####

ok cute and fun and nice and good and adorable and happy and sweet and dogs 



#####

phogs is a great game to play with the one friend who loves the argue over how to solve puzzles my friend and i have had a great time playing thus far but did notice a fair amount of bugs that would force us to respawn or even restart levels entirely i would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun collaborative puzzle game

#####

super fun game to play with a friend the sleepy time levels tho make u sleepy

#####

super cute and fun to play with a friend or partner there are bugs but they usually end up being funny more than debilitating

#####

while it lacks in challenge and complexity it more than makes up for it in buckets simple good vibes whether through cutesy visuals soothing soundtracks excellently designed levels or just the wide and varied roster of characters you meet i will say it certainly is best in multiplayer though

#####

great coop game for those looking for a lowstress cooperative experience no time pressures or highstakes situations such as overcooked make for a very pleasant experience

the puzzle mechanics in each world are shown gradually and make sense thematically all of them combine in the boss part of each 

sharing a body really pushes communication and  cooperation in a way that can be more subtle in some games puzzles are not overly challenging but its a great experience with cute visuals and good sounds note the alarm clocks are very annoying but this is possibly intentional

overall a great coop game especially for those after something a little slower paced and less challenging

#####

i enjoyed this very much

#####

an amusing game pleasant art style neatly designed levels cute characters occasional simple puzzles you can bark very fast

#####

woof woof x3

#####

very cute and neat puzzle game not particularly challenging but still quite fun  even for adults

#####

if you love dogs and cute things in general you owe it to yourself to try this game

#####

great coop game just challenging enough to be engaging without any real frustration

h2ﾟ a lovely cute game to spend an evening with your partner or friend ﾟ h2
   the graphics are very nice the sound work is great the gameplay is not boring and is not difficult from the word at all 
h3games problemsh3
   the important thing is that the game has a problem with multiplayer two players may have out of sync which is why my partner and i were flying around the map which was funny 
   the problem is easily solved by respawning 
   i also couldnt play on the gamepad i still didnt figure out what the problem might be but i still enjoyed playing on the keyboard
h3a little bit of my opinionh3
   in general the game is perfect for having fun without putting a strain on your brain in the campaign of a loved one the game deserves its honest 9 out of 10
h3highly significanth3
finally i wish you a lot of patience during the game


#####

a well designed coop optionally single player puzzle adventure game that can be played locally or online perfect for these postpandemicremote work times we live in occasionally glitchy but full of well designed charm  1012 hours long but its its a breeze and never gets overly complex so enjoy it with a friend

#####

fun game and worth to buy it

#####

its a really cute and fun game but its so glitchy it makes certain levels unplayable i would wholeheartedly recommend the game if a patch was released to fix the gameplay issues

#####

bork

#####

this game really makes you feel like phogs

#####

very fun cute silly coop puzzle game highly recommend to play with your significant other some puzzles are easy but others are surprisingly difficult but usually easy to execute once you know what you need to do lots of fun to find and collect everything and interact with the world lots of hats and secrets

you can also play together remotely so only one purchase is necessary which can be a big plus for some

if they ever make a phogs 2 id buy it in a heartbeat

#####

is a phog one conjoined being or two beings

#####

very cute and a lot of fun mechanics are very simple and perhaps a bit too easy but its fun and although its glitchy the glitches add to the experience because they are hilarious

#####

really fun really adorable 1010
its a bit short for 25 dollars 12 hours was enough to 100
absolutely have to play with a friend i think you can play alone but just not the same

#####

fantastic cute coop experience 

#####

i do not write reviews for video games but this one is quite special i have replayed this game a dozen times and each time i revisit the cold depths of phogss oceans i feel a sense of revamped adventure that i cant describe and no other game can pull out of me experience this game in its entirety every nook a cranny has something beautiful within it

#####

i really enjoyed this game its cute comfy and creative my favorite zone is the sleep world even though i found myself falling sleep while playing it

#####

great game especially for couples during quarantine lots of interesting mechanics but nothing too complex 

probably the best coop puzzle game that anyone can pick up regardless of skill level

however dont go into the game if you are looking for super challenging puzzles

#####

cute game extremely recommended specially if you want to distract yourself 3

#####

i have been following this game since seeing it in person at the insomnia expo a few years ago i was worried that maybe it would be too short but there are plenty of puzzles to justify the price the levels are well designed the whole thing looks lovely and overall it is exactly what i want to be playing heading into the bleakest winter of the last half century woof

#####

cute and fun

#####

fun and relaxing game to play with somebody 

#####

so much fun

#####

phogs dlc

#####

the puzzles arent very difficult but were still enjoyable and the levels are visually pleasing my only real nitpick is that the controls are a bit janky i do think the game is a bit expensive for what it has to offer though so i would wait for a sale

#####

i am a big fan of stupid twoheaded stretchy dogs

#####

amazing coop experience i played through the entirety of it using remote play with a friend where just one of us had to have the game and it worked great everytime
the game has fun and great puzzles level design and use of cooperation 
theres even so fun miniganes thrown into some levels that are really fun
the art style is nice and the music is great too
you can also play by yourself so thats nice to have as an option
theres a lof collectibles and hats to unlock as well that make the game more fun
recommended

#####

the game is great to relax so colorful cheerful i love the simplicity of the models recommend for long winter evenings

#####

phogs

#####

good game full of puzzles and laughter with a friend or family member

#####

fun i lobe it

#####

i heartily recommend this game to anyone whos up for some good fun with a friend loved one or a kid 
aesthetics of phogs are very cute and playful action is joyful and slightly chaotic puzzles and platforming are just hard enough to make you pause every so often but wont ever completely stump you this is a perfect game to play with someone who doesnt have a lot of experience with video games but if youre looking for a challenge like overcooked or moving out you might want to skip phogs

i like the phogs

#####

super fun and cute game i normally love hardcore noncasual games but this hits a soft spot that i cant help but love currently playing it with my girlfriend right now and we both are loving every minute of it the puzzlesmechanics arent complicated which makes it fun to just pickup and get back into fairly quickly after breaks in sessions i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fun chill and feelgood game added to their library

#####

phogs

after how good and fun a way out was me and my friend looked for a new game and since phogs came out recently we wanted to check it out

the gameplay is simple you are a dog with 2 faces and one person controls the other face so you solve puzzles and platform all over the place the gameplay is fun engaging and unique there is an arcade level where you get into the arcade machines and play them to get points in one level in one level you are in a fruit factory trying to solve problems while squashing fruits and such in one level you are in a stealth section and trying to protect the light ball 

while i didnt even tell you some of the best levels the game offers the consistency for level quality is mixed there are 3 worlds and the best one is drastically better than the worst one its not even close also the game is fairly long so dont get scared when i told you there are only 3 worlds there are bosses and such too

aside from level consistency my biggest problem with the game is amount of bugs the game has it messes you up a lot and me and my friend got frustrated a lot while playing the game i honestly think you should be aware of these bugs

in conclusion this is a charming unique fun coop game that has miserable bugs but still is a damn good time i wouldve easily recommended you if there were no bugs and glitches but its up to you if you can suffer d

excellent game of its own right but as far as games you can play cooperatively with a small child i think this might be like the best ive ever played was a little hesitant to pick this up at full release price but my daughter has been harping on me since we played the demo and i am happy with the decision i have a 3 and 5 year old phogss fun and bright art style gets them excited enough to talk about throughout the day with puzzles and gameplay that challenges without frustrating its the nature of cooperative play which takes phogs over the top for me you can use a two controller scheme for couchcooperative teamwork or a scheme where each controls both phogs to help guide younger players either way you can help steer each other in the right direction while both are totally playing the game everything about it is executed well controls art sound music gameplay the devs definitely had a strong vision with the talent and resources to execute it

#####

honestly the cutest game ive ever played best money ive ever spent 1010

#####

its super cute and funnnnnn the art and soundtrack are amazing uwu

#####

phogs is amazing 
such a wonderful joyful cosy nonviolent game that is even better for the fact that it encourages cooperation and playfulness it allows you to experiment without pressure or failstates letting you explore and enjoy the beautifully designed worlds at your own pace the puzzle design is fantastic and gives a sense of challenge without ever feeling impossible and at the same time still giving lots of little surprises along the way

phogs inspires curiosity surprise delight and fun i laughed i gasped i even cried with joy at one point

on a side note  i feel like i relate to dogs so much better now too i get why they bark at everything they see and i get why they go up to every person nearby in the hope that they might get petted d

wholesome fun coop puzzling

great game 1010 has cute doggos and even cuter hats

phogs provided very enjoyable and creative puzzlesolving as a phog i was able to explore colorful uniquely designed levels by barking orders to guide the phog herd each new area had its own charming aesthetic and obstacles to overcome what really stood out was how varied each stage felt  one moment i was in a grassy meadow and the next a cryptic underwater zone 

beyond the charming visuals the music fit every location perfectly with upbeat playful tracks that kept me engaged throughout my time herding phogs while simple using bark abilities on things like switches or to move platforms made for satisfying puzzles to work through 

i can see kids especially having a blast playing this colourfully cute game together cooperating to lead the phogs to each levels exit with enjoyable mechanics and adventures for all ages phogs seems like it will provide many fun family gaming sessions

#####

fun simple game but uh its showing i played 95hrs when it hasnt even been 95 hours since the time i bought it pretty weird and itd fuck me if i tried refunding it
its probably fun for kids after a while we didnt hate it but didnt feel the need to finish it either

#####

a great puzzle with an oddlyshaped protagonist that will take you on an adventure through colorful and happy world

whats hidden behind the silly name i hear you ask why its the most adorable thing youve ever laid your eyes on in this crazy year of 2020 if by adorable you mean a legless stretchy body with two dog heads on each end be my guest i wont judge

bh1story h1b
the storys pretty much nonexistent a phog dreams of his favorite things a big mat to sleep on a colorful ball to play with and a bowl with food after waking up and realizing it has none of those things the phog sets out on an adventure to find them theres no talking or text the little bits of information you do get are presented as slices of life throughout different worlds

bh1gameplay h1b
the games a physics puzzle youre introduced to the mechanics right at the start in a tutorial level you use left and right side of a gamepad to control each head analog sticks to move shoulder buttons to bark or grab things and trigger buttons to stretch the body keyboard can also be used but it just doesnt work that well when you have to juggle with all those buttons and can quickly lead to frustration during some particularly hard puzzles the game supports coop where one of the heads can be controlled with a second gamepad which is great if you have kids or by finding someone online i didnt try this because the game is definitely more enjoyable when you play it on your own its so easy to mess things up and youre bound to find someone online wholl just pull his head in the other direction or refuse to cooperate which can lead to funny situations but grows old quick if you actually want to finish a level youll also have trouble remembering which side controls which head while phogs do wear a red and blue collar i was never able to remember which is which the worst was grabbing things on several occasions i was rolling the ball up a slope with one head and tried to grab it with the other but i pressed the wrong button and the ball rolled down 

after completing the tutorial youre free to choose one of the three worlds that represent phogs desires each world has a small hub with six levels that must be completed in order and the main event that opens after completing all puzzles hubs are pretty empty at the beginning but become more populated the more levels you complete moving through the world is done by going into the mouth of a giant snake creatures twoheaded that connects the islands these same creatures also represent the goal of each level the only difference is that you have to somehow force it to open its mouth by offering food or ringing a bell each level is split into several little islands with puzzles that need to be solved by using stretch and mostly grab buttons youll have to move certain items into place push levers ride elevators swing across chasms and even use phog as a hose to water plants dont ask how that works throughout the levels youll also discover residents of this world each thematic world has its own and except for an occasional pat on the head they dont interact with you theyre there just to make the world more alive and take part in slice of life scenes sleep world is pretty inactive because almost everyone is asleep but play and food worlds really make the whole experience more colorful and ensure you dont get bored during problemsolving

puzzles become progressively harder but youre almost never stuck you also dont die if you fall off the island youre just returned to the very generous checkpoints or right next to the spot where you fell down this way you never lose progress after solving harder parts of the puzzle gameplay might get repetitive after a while but different worlds make things interesting for example the play world contains minigames like golf and pinball or sleep world where you hide in shadows while avoiding lights with wings

the game also has collectibles in the shape of bones and little strange creatures hiding in secluded places by pressing the start button you can see how many bones there are in the level and whether or not you already found the hidden creature while some bones are visible and require outofthebox thinking to reach them others are hidden behind miniquests you have to do for residents these are very simple like fetching a nearby object displayed over their heads in speech bubble making pizza watering the plants etc the only problem is that you dont always get told what you need to do often its just experimenting with the stuff you see in a level or something not connected to the puzzle solution and you have to do these tasks right away if you move on to the next island you cant go back and your only option is to restart the level you can then use these bones to buy various hats in shops their only purpose is to customize the look of your phogs and dont offer special abilities or something like that

bh1conclusion h1b
the game runs fine and i didnt encounter any bugs there were some weird situations with physics where i got stuck behind some rock or thrown into the air but nothing a quick restart from checkpoint couldnt solve the games also quite long for a puzzle especially if you want to find all those collectibles but its not that difficult

the good
this is a very fun game to play with another person in coop 
theres a variety of worlds and levels and for me and a friend one complete playthrough took us about 9 hours 
the puzzles are fun and do not feel like theyre too challenging nor does it feel like the objective of the puzzle is hard to understand 
i would not recommend playing solo as controlling both ends of the phog is a little tricky

the bad
we ran into quite a bit of bugs while playing over online coop with items not appearing or not showing that youre holding an item
there were also other bugs with some of the physics causing us to get lodged stuck into spots and needing to respawn

the controls are also really annoying to figure out the game works best with a controller yes but the devs could have also at least shown what the keyboard controls were in the settings and with both controller and keyboard i found that the controls would tell me one thing but when i hit the button to do something in the settings i wouldnt work like many games phogs starts with volume levels at the highest and we couldnt figure out how to do turn it down from the games settings with keyboard we were able to select what volume we wanted to change but no keys would work to actually turn it down

the story is also rather vague

the game is also in my opinion a little highly priced at 25 usd i felt like for that price i would have expected more in terms of available levels and overall content i feel like the game would be more fairly priced at 15 or 20 at the highest this doesnt detract from the gameplay but for the price i just wish there was more

#####

best gam ever

#####

in three words adorable whimsical and wholesome the puzzles arent frustratingly hard but theyre also not simple the atmosphere visuals and sound design are wonderful and evoke nothing but big smiles from me my boyfriend and i use the happy face emote constantly and both of us make the snakemouthopening noise for fun

i recently finished the game and phogs is now one of my top games of all time definitely worth a full play through

#####

update the damn game there is to many bugs in oline

#####

 collectables
 hats for phogo
 adorable characters

what more could you want
not too hard but not too easy either just a chill game to enjoy the art style while collecting bones to buy more hats for your phog because they deserve it like the good phog that they are



ps  i feel no remorse dragging the clocks off the side of the world

also ps  disable vsync in your game control center to stop the game stuttering there is no ingame option to disable vsync

#####

bark bark woof bark

#####

dogs but epic

#####

phogs is an okay game in my opinion it wasnt exactly exciting to play but i had a decently good time playing it 

the premise of the game is that you and your coop partner are dogs with 1 body so most of the puzzles revolve around that this doesnt leave much room for creative puzzles and they can very quickly get boring or repetitive none of them are really that complex either theyre mostly straight forward and easily done in the final bits of the game spoileryou get separated into 2 different dogsspoiler and i wish they introduced that idea much sooner they couldve made it so much more interested and included better puzzles but they kept it to till the end theres collectibles throughout the maps such as bones that you unlock different hats with theres another collectible but i dont think it does anything 

there isnt much story its just the dogs trying to find their dog bowl i think but thats all there was the graphics are cute and well done i didnt experience many bugs besides the fact that every once in awhile i would get stuck in the ground

overall its an alright game but as i said its not too exciting i dozed off a couple times while playing lol i say give the game a chance but definitely wait for a sale

gorgeous game with surprisingly inventive coop puzzles and a laidback vibe

i have barely played this game so far but the 13 hours i did put into it were nothing but pure ear to ear smiles and laughter with my fwend i highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who can appreciate a cute simple puzzle game and has a good friend to play it with this is an experience worth the money and ill be playing a lot more of it over the coming days

quick note about the demo
it only supports local coop and the optimization is much worse for some odd reason the main game runs smoothly and supports proper multiplayer

#####

fantastic game to play with your significant other
even if they are a beginner gamer you can still enjoy winding eachother up in a cute environment

#####

i felt a bit bored while playing it i played with my little sister and i think the main thing is that it just felt a bit bland and somewhat generic the puzzles ive seen so far have been ok but theres nothing that doesnt stop my mind from feeling dull im not sure if theres even anything that could be done taking into consideration the main gimmick but how i feel is how i feel i guess part of it is also that i dont really have much of a motivation for going through the levels theyre just there and i dont get enough inherent joy from playing for it to seem worthwhile sorry not for me

#####

1010 best game made ever rdr2 who whats even the witcher all pale in comparison to the almighty phogs 3

#####

very nice

#####

this game is pretty poggers

#####

super cute and fun

#####

the premise of this game is super cute and i love the little hats and things you can put on the dogs however the controls are very difficult to maneuver its difficult to solve the puzzles because controlling where youre going is weird and feels like there could have been a better system

#####

if youre looking for cute and silly coop play game this is definitely the first to recommend ive been playing with one of my favourite humans and weve just reached the 3rd world playing together as a noodle 2 headed dog leads to many ridiculous de sync moments to which left us stuck dying of laughter sometimes the respawn button works 910 times the 1 time it didnt work left my screen with 2 bouncing decapitated dog heads at the carnival boss level overall would recommend to share with your favourite human too

#####

a friend and i bought phogs to have some casual coop gaming time the twoheaded dog is a fun mechanic but soon runs out of depth there are not that many interesting puzzles and the game ultimately doesnt feel that deep for the money i couldnt recommend it would not have bought it had i had the chance to try it beforehand

#####

the bad  its a cute game and i enjoyed the demo before buying the full version but the challenges are just way too simple basically no challenge its pretty much just picking up an item and carrying it to a hole to drop it in the only real challenge is trying not to yell at your partner bc the mechanics of moving as 2 dogs combined is incredibly frustrating if the other person chooses to extend then you get slowed down or start swinging around or just bug out and crash into things but if you dont extend then you end up just being extremely glued to your partner and its feels like very slow and boring to get around the maps i also really wish they didnt make the bite button the bark button at the same time it gets a little tiring when youre barking 247

the good  it is cute and it would probably be entertaining enough if you have nothing else to play and just want something very simple and gentle slow to play with a friend on a lazy day

suggestions  i like the concept and i think it could be really fun if they reduced the amount of snap that the other player has on you constantly pulling you to them i know were literally attached to each other but it just feels frustrating when you end up feeling like youre just dragging the other persons butt or theyre dragging yours or youre swinging in circles trying to stop dragging each other if they fixed some bugs and if they made the challenges a little faster paced and actually challenging maybe add in some working together to swing across huge chasms or something and make the movement speed much higher

summary  its cute and i know lots of other people did enjoy it so i wish there was a meh option instead of just yes or no for rating it but i just have to say no i dont recommend it because in the end i just thought it felt like a 2 year olds playmat no challenge just moving balls into holes and sliding around like a worm



#####

i have to admit its a very cute game however its soooooooooooo glitchy especially when played remotely my friend and i suffered so hard and eventually decided to quit playing

#####

i can only recommend phogs really the fun gameplay puzzles and adorable artstyle come together perfectly in this game whether you play with friends or by yourself youll definitely have a good time

#####

highly recommended can bork can eat can long can solve some simple but cute puzzles with very cute graphics

would be a good game to play with a child but were both 29 and are still having a blast

#####

the game wasnt bad but it wasnt very hard so the levels got very boring and tedious there were some cool levels but most puzzles were solved before we even realized we had to solve anything grab on to the first thing that you can grab on to and youre 90 of the way through the puzzle it might be better for younger players i dont think its worth the 25 price or even the 19 sale price that i got it for

#####

nice

#####

coming off of it takes two this just doesnt stack up  im out 50 for two copies of and we got bored of it in less than two hours  womp womp

#####

this game is a great idea done very well it just wasnt for me theres some serious polish and enough things to do so you never find it repetitive

#####

online experience is shit

#####

even on a good build the game fails to run with more than 5 fps

#####

i played this game with a friend of mine and it took us see playtime minutes to realize that it just wasnt fun the barking was extremely annoying having to manouver together was impossible because of the camera being stuck in weird positions sometimes and while we were in the sleeping level with the yawning tunnels i asked him to just quit and get a refund because i couldnt get myself to continue this game

it looks really cute and the idea is brilliant but i dont think ill play it ever again

#####

phogsconfused

#####

so frustrating i only have so many brain cells

#####

i couldnt go through the first level why because of those goddamn annoying alarm clocks
all their crying screaming and ringing was driving me nuts and gave me a headache

#####

yes

#####

its good


#####

its fun and how a lots of cute things but for a 12yo kids so bye 

#####



#####

my kids used their christmas money to buy this and the recent update disabled their controllers  theyre crushed

#####

extremely simple puzzles but the movement makes everything harder than it needs to be and its not in a fun way at 5 i would still feel disappointed by the content

#####

cant change graphic settings devs wont communicate or follow up much on forums if they are working on the new bugs that broke the game after the update controller support is also broken cant recommend the game in this state but am really hoping that things take a turn for the better as i want to like this game i think its really cute devs i dont mind if features are bugged but i think a verbal update for how things are going is overdue given the amount of people posting on the discussion board about the bugs

#####

i have completed the game and collected almost every collectable this game sucks this is the cutest way to bream with anger with one of your friends it is glitchybuggy and some of the levels were just wayyyy too long they build out the world and mechanics spoiler not that it would matterdont play but in the end they take those mechanics away from you and expect you to learn all new mechanics like a brand new game then poof they give them back game overthat is such a bad way to design a game in theory this should be a good and fun game but wow its not i barely made it through the game with my sanity in tact would not recommend unless you have the patience of a saint and dont know what a good game looks like

#####

game doesnt support ultrawide 

#####

phogs is an absolute unfinished bugfest that relies on a concept which gets old after an hour
its a miracle so many people played through the glitches and multiplayer desyncs and still gave this a very positive rating

not worth it unless massively discounted

#####

repeatable levels bland gameplay vore expensive refund

#####

im sure this would entertain a 6 year old but it certainly did not entertain my friends and i and we are entertained by the most stupid sht

its very repetitive and the barking will hurt your ears after a few minutes of playing 

#####

a very mediocre and easy puzzle game with a charming coat of paint might be good for kids but it isnt particularly engaging if you have more than one braincell

#####

controller problems in the game
after a day playing without the ability of using my second controller

discussion group was saying turning on the controller after the game is launched fixed it
and it did

i think this needs a patch before i give a thumbs up just a little patch

the games is great

#####

terrible game annoying bad graphics loud not cute or funny fuck this game

#####

very boring i imagine it is a game for small kids and i bought it by accident but still boring af

#####

game was amazing although the last level was a little confusing it was good

also wth are people talking about with the logo being offensive wdym

#####

beautiful chaotic random 1210 would bork again

#####

a cute and fun puzzle game where you can wear matching hats and bark at your partner the entire time 1010 want more phogs

i am only 13 done with this game and will update but so far it is absolutely adorable until now it also seems to be very childsafe

what is it about
you play as 1 very cute dog with two heads  so every end of the dog has a head  and have to make your way through the levels by cooperating both heads independently i assume playing the game with a friend is intended but it seems to be possible to play it solo as well i play with a friend and it is great fun

levels
three themed worlds  sleep food and play  with several levels in each of them in the levels you have to solve puzzles  find your way trough a labyrinth bring a tea service to a moth wake up the sleepy dream aliens by freeing the alarm clock turn on the lights for the sun and other so far i have not encountered any combat and the worlds are very peaceful you walk around and do things 

difficulty it is not very difficult  neither in logic nor in skills like timing or such

aesthetics but it is so cute oh my god it is adorable i have only played the dream world yet and it is extraordingly calming i listen to the dream soundtrack outside of playing the game the sleeping suns sighs the woken up aliens with bags under their eyes the distressed teddy bears the alarm clocks running around the reading moths and tea drinking hedgehogs  they are all so unbelievably cute in their design 

the game also seems to be very childfriendly up until now i think i could play it with a 5 year old and they wont have any nightmares or stressful situations the game does not hurry you basically if you are old enough to coordinate your fingers to press buttons to go where your eyes want you to and you are old enough to understand implicated causal relationships you are old enough to play this game 

the full price of 25 might be a bit high depending on what you want out of the game  it is in no way challenging but rather aesthetically pleasing and calming or just fun to play i assume the total game hours to be78 hours maybe but 15  does seem fair this game is build with love and id want the developers to be paid for their work be it 25  or 15  

you play this game and it brings peace to your heart love it

#####

a puzzle platformer in which two people control a twoheaded dogcreature crossing surreal landscapes

hrhr
phogs sees you take control of either head of what i can only describe as a dogsausage hybrid which allows you to move around expandretract your body to get more distance between both phog heads and bark to raise your head or grab objects using these minimal abilities youll have to make your way through about 20 levels spread across food play and sleep themed worlds

this involves some basic platforming made difficult by your wobbly physicsbased movement and the cooperation required from both heads there are also some rather basic puzzles which once again tend to become surprisingly challenging to navigate most level also include some unique mechanic for example being able to shrink or grow your heads luring npcs using fruits or using light to remove shadowy blockades together these mechanics make for quite a varied game which stays entertaining throughout its runtime in lieu of the basic core premise

spread throughout the levels are various collectibles which are either hidden or require you to complete certain bonus tasks these give some nice incentive to engage more with the levels and can be exchanged for cosmetics ranging from adorable to dorky

the game can be played alone using a single controller to move both phogs though i would very much recommend playing with a friend for fooling around with the physicsbased gameplay alone phogs presents wellbalanced challenges though coordination is always key in order to make it through with fun instead frustration

complementing the enjoyable gameplay is a beautiful art style paired with a nice variety in level design and some decent background music the game oozes charm which is highlighted by many superfluous details spread throughout it eg other creatures interacting with the phogs when theyre close by given the nature of the gameplay youll more than likely stumble across a few glitches related to the physics while these are noticeable and can result in certain level gimmicks being a bit janky to use theyre easy to remedy and never really managed to impact the fun me and my friend were having

hrhr
phogs was a blast to play and i urge you to give it a shot  its a wonderful couch or online coop experience

a very cozy game to play with your friends there isnt really any challenge to the game but you are gonna have some ha ha along the way

the biggest plus about the game are the graphics they are so comfy and look so cute it is just very nice to look at almost too nice one of the world is about sleeping and me and my friend was almost about to fall asleep it is so relaxing to play and if you play with your friends youre gonna have some angry spikes once in a while but thats the fun of playing it

#####

the game is really fun when it works the lag between two people who have the game and are trying to play together can make it really hard to enjoy the puzzles are fun but man when the physics break they break id rate it around a three and a half out of five onehalf star off for connection inconsistency making multiplayer frustrating and one star off for the physics breaking rendering puzzles uncompletable without resetting

#####

phogs is so fun its a great game to play with your friend had a lovely time exploring this silly little game mostly this game gave me a small nostalgic feeling for another game i used to play back in 2012 which was little big planet

#####

this is such a cute game i love the environment and especially the phogs design the levels are fun and adiquitely challenging to get plenty of ridiculous play time in i live for the funky physics and sillyness

#####

the game play is wonderful the levels and worlds are delightfully aesthetic and fun to navigate especially in multiplayer there are glitches from time to time that could prevent you from progressing in the game but you do have the option to reset if that happens

#####

this is a load of silly fun with friends

#####

this game is superb and i mean really giggy superb wicked wicked giggy

#####

this game is great to play with a friend very cute and very fun 

i see some reviews talking about bugs but i havent had any game breaking bugs during my playthrough and even someone talking about bad controls i mean look at it it is supposed to feel kind of janky but that is part of the fun 

this is a game ill let my kids play one day i can absolutely recommend it 

we played it with a ps5 controller and a procontroller as a couchcoop

#####

1010

#####

if you like relaxing immersive platformers and multiplayer gimmicks then this is the game for you 1010 very cute

#####

this game is an absolute blast  if you got a buddy and you guys like coop games definitely pick this one up  the game doesnt hold your hand but the puzzles are just always just enough of a challenge  probably #2 for my favorite coop game but its tight for first  i got this game on a sale but it is for sure worth your money at full price

#####

do you like playing coop games do you like coop games where the two of you are attached do you like coop games where the two of you have hit the bark button so many time that the number of barks is in the thousands

this is super cute if you play coop less for the challenge and more to have a good time with someone close to you this is perfect

#####

the most realistic dog simulator on steam

#####

having played many couch coops with my partner and looking back phogs might belong to the top 5 in my list we had so much fun while playing that we went back to complete achievements to keep enjoying it

games just dont feel the same if you cant bark your way to finish

#####

fun coop game often glitchy but enjoyable nonetheless

#####

1 dog 2 dog we dont know but how come the other guys doesnt have a second head

#####

you play as essentially catdog but this time its dogs for both heads cute puzzle game and its pretty easy to play with a partner 3

#####

my partner and i played this game together its a great time the art style is serene calming and cute i never found the puzzles too challenging nor was i too confused to figure out where to go the game has a great sense of humor and makes you feel like a kid again in the best way if youre looking for a quiet relaxing game to play with someone i highly recommend this game

#####

i really wanted to recommend this game but i just cant the gameplay and puzzles are great and it would be an awesome coop game if it werent for how unstable this game is it feels almost unfinished with how often it crashes and you have to restart an entire level due to a gamebreaking glitch i was playing coop with a friend and we never got to complete the final level because it crashed partway 4 times the last level is so long and we got so frustrated having to redo everything multiple times its a real shame this game never got updated because it desperately needed stability updates maybe it works better in solo play but if you plan to play with someone in coop youre better off not wasting your money or effort here

#####

fucking fire

#####

i recommend playing this two player its good dumb fun and super cute

#####

it is actually a very good game cute and fun but it keeps crashing every half an hour i hope they can fix it
game just crashes too often

#####

#####

phogs was a pretty fun game i played it with my little brother some parts drove either of us insane but overall it was good and our relationship wasnt completely destroyed by virtually being attached to each other at the bum for a handful of hours 

#####

its a crazy puzzle game and it has some really great graphics i played it with my mom and my brother and all of us liked it

#####

my friend gifted me this game for her and i to play together and have gone as far as to get all the achievements its an incredibly fun cutesy puzzle game for all types of audiences best friends roommates couples family members you name it anyone regardless of age and gaming experience can pick up this game and make it worthwhile its also super easy to run on most computers including my absolute toasteroven of a laptop the only bugs ive encountered were due to internet issues and occasionally your body spewing everywhere and bugging out would happen  still a funny thing to laugh at and nothing a respawnrestart cant fix overall definitely worth the buy as youll get a lot of laughs and heartwarming moments out of it

#####

super fun game and love the art style 

#####

i loved this game so much it was great fun playing with a good friend

i also want a boingle plush ahhhh

hope there is a sequel

#####

i really like it one thing though i think they should change the hat system its useless if only one person unlocks a hat and the other doesnt because you cant even open it

#####

actually very optimized

#####

great game to play casually not punishing your for mistakes and lots of checkpoints

fun puzzles lots of variety and cute artwork

the mechanic is easy to understand sometimes a bit clunky you do have to communicate on where to go since you are a bit attached

i really love this game the coop can be a little off sometimes but the game design and art style is so nice and cosy its great fun to play and can be challenging at times theres one or two glithy parts where you can get stuck in the floor and the stretch is a little off and weve had trouble where only one of us can see the hats available but overall i would highly recommend this
