this is my
ultimate
childhood
game
d

#####

i used to play the demo for this when i was a child never thought id see it on steam its a little harder than i remember still good

im really good at reviews

#####

i love these claymation games  nux is fantastically quirky and platypus does not disappoint  although there is only one method of play in this one sidescrolling shooter its varied enough that it does not lose its appeal as you play  the bonus items for weapon upgrades are nicely varied the game tracks your score percentages per section and some of the bigger ships that you destroy will drop bonus points in the form of fruit that you need to collect before they fall off of the screen lol

you start off with four lives and two credits  when you lose your four lives you can continue by using one of your credits which gives you four lives again of course your score resets when you continue but the game will save the highest score you gain for the leaderboard

it also looks like a second person can join in and play with you as there was something on the screen that said to press a button to join

platypus doesnt seem to be controllercompatible but using the mouse to play gives you plenty of maneuverability  theres no clickclickclick either just hold down the left mouse button to shoot continuously

there are weather balloons that float across the background giving you hints such as shoot the stars to change weapons and special bonus for passive resistance  hah  try not shooting anything and live through it i dare you  if you die even once it ruins your passive resistance because youll usually take something out with you and youll get no bonus d

platypus is yet another delightful arcade game by idigicon and ive happily added platypus ii to my wishlist

#####

this game is my childhood it is challenging and has a amazing soundtrack it is alot more fun if you have friend playing it with you though

#####

id never thought id see this on steam its such a joy to see this again thank you 1010

#####

sooooooooooooooooooooooo many memories

h1how i found out about platypush1
ohthis goes way back years and years ago when i was very young didnt know about things like steam or retail pc games i was always playing flash games online one site that i would play on all the time had a little game called platypus this was one of those games you came across that you had to download a free trial that only lasted an hour or so of course i did i believe the free trial only contained the first level of the game

i loved the game so much over about four or five years later i went on a search to see if i could find the games main website because steam didnt have the game at the time i found something similar to it the game was around 25 i didnt trust the site so i did not purchase the game now just last night i noticed platypus in my recommended on steam so i had to buy it boy was it a blast to the past and a nice thing to see level 25 levels i have never seen before

h1unfair first impressionsh1 
i tend to see a lot of hate for bscore attackb  bshoot em upb games i dont mind these kind of games as long as they are fun for me platypus takes both these genre i also see hate for bside scrolling shootersb which platypus is also 

therefor you may here people say bad things about these genre or about platypus itself some people will say that about the genre and not even try the game itself this can rub off on other people causing them to do the same thing then that can rub off and keep going like a virus 

h1review of platypush1
platypus is a bside scrollingb bshoot em upscore attackb game it uses a rare unique graphic style it uses bclaymationb which means everything you see ingame is made of modeling clay to add a unique design 

there are five total levels with about four or five areas in each in each of these levels you will find a wide variety of enemy types  power ups 

though the game itself isnt really the best as it is quite old and it seems that the dev is no longer supporting it the game still runs smooth there are no resolution options nor is there any audio options other than turn music onoff the steam overlay also does not work while the game is running 

however the challenge in the game is there it will get harder as you go along anything can destroy your ship enemy fire coliding with enemies etc when the screen gets really full youll find it harder to survive the challenge isnt to much that i feel over whelmed its a really nice fit 

the game also includes a 2player option player 1 yellow ship plays default with the mouse but a second player red ship can join in under the controls of a joy or keys arrows to move control to shoot player 1 can also use the different control settings but both players can not use the same control setup whats also neat is if you dont have anyone to play the game with you can spawn in player 2 and use it yourself along with your main ship this is difficult to master but will help out along the way still better to have someone to play with though

h1content enemies  power upsh1
platypus contains loads of enemy types some generic some unique the game also includes a few different bpower upsb to defend yourself 

in platypus you can come across enemy ships that fly in an up and down maneuver fly straight from left to right right to left pull up or go down etc not only that as the levels go on youll notice a lot of the ships to start shooting at you now the weapons fired at you could consist of a single shot in your direction a fast shot that moves one direction or other things like rockets that follow you 

to defend youself you have a few different weapon types ill only name a few to avoid spoiling too much you have your main bcannonsb which are default and have a slow fire rate then you have things like the traditional bcannon spreadb and bcannon fire rate increasedb upgrades 

along with weapon types you also have sort ofpick ups that can be dropped from enemies or crates these consist of fruit like grapes and bananas which give you score points when picked up inside things like crates you can find items like bx2 scoreb which will double your score income and bcoinsb which give off a lot of score 

h1pros  cons overall ratingh1
platypus is a very fun side scrolling score attack shooter that is easy to play and very addictive despite its problems this game is a cheap purchase that anyone can enjoy for hours especially with a friend 

pros
unique claymation graphic style
fun  challenging five level experience
2player available
catchy soundtrack that is full of nostalgia

cons
no resolution option
no custom sound options
steam overlay currently does not work though this does not degrade the final rating of the game

overall rating about a 1315 fun experience for the whole family

h1credits  disclaimerh1
thank you for taking the time to read my review i hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not

remember this review is based off of opinion only you may not think the same way as me towards something but thats okay because we are all human

#####

from nostalgia trip on miniclipcom to steam

#####

platypus is another shoot em up game which doesnt do much different from all the other games from the same genre what does set this game apart is the art style the graphics look cartoonish which work really well and is easy on the eye the gameplay ofcourse consists of shooting enemy aircrafts and dodging bullets or enemy planesdebries

personally these kind of games only enjoy me for a few minutes mainly because im not good at them still i would recommend this game if youre a fan of the genre

#####

one of the best memory of childhood ive ever had back then i skipped lunch because playing platypus for almost 5 hours straight over and over

#####

this was one of the first games i played on pc when i was 5 or 6 and i forgot about it for over 10 years was surprised when i found it in on sale on steam this game is still very challenging and enjoyable

highly recommend

#####

was a fun shooter until memory errors made it unplayable

#####

this game is just amazing takes me back yearsi wish there was achievments and far more levels with even more weapons and ship upgradesother than thati have 0 complaintsits just a stunning gameand the use of the clay mation iswell lets face it the best ive seen in yearsi dont think ive seen a claymation game before but if i didno game could match this oneid recommend it to everyone

100100 no less could more lol if thats exist

very short storyless repetitive but very very entertaining
this is what i called as arcade games gone right

i remember back those days when this game had been launched in my country zuma and plants vs zombies are real big titles my favorite too but i couldnt ignore the attractiveness of this simple game the clay design is so cute and refreshing also the difficulty is very enjoyable and addictive
cant say no more just grab it fast very recommended

troubleshoot help
for windows user if you experienced problem related to running the game crash cant open etc lets try this method
 click on search bar and type turn windows features on or off
it will load a list of windows features just wait a while

 give check on directplay check box
 click ok and then restart
 enjoy

big note read this
sorry for that caps lock bomb above btw
overall very satisfied by purchased this game no regret at all
but deeply regrets because i bought platypus mega pack bundle i dont wanna spam the beautiful review above with this trash information so better you check my review about platypus ii and nux through my profile
dont make your joy destroyed because of  injured expectations just buy this game the one and no more of this franchise

with warmest greetings ma friend

#####

call me a liar but i got this the same year it came out
i played it so much i finished the game even upside down
the amount of nostalgia that came from this
i forgot its name for more than 10 yearsbut i didnt forget it
because it was on saleand i so happened to browse from the cheapest to the priciest games i find this old gem
thank yougaben for having this nostalgia filled piece of art on steam
and thank youidigicon for making this masterpiece
ill see you in about 100 hoursbye

#####

for the people who cant launch it d

go to nvidia control panel  mange 3d settings  restore defaults  program settings  add  select your game or add it manually  select the same things as forced choices for example if the global settings for vsync is off  choose it off manually not off global  it will launch very fine but and its settings will not be changed because you forced it at certain tune 

for the people who cant do anything while game is running d

open task manger in the background and open your apps you need like discord for example then press alt tab when you need to switch  this is only for switching between tabs  and if you want to force close the game  press ctrl alt delete to open the task manger to close it or you can restart your pc from taskmanger menu

all problems solved  

#####

better than war thunder

#####

childhood memory
gameplay plain but fun art style is stunning even today soundtrack is so catchy
a bit dated today but can still have a fun experience with this 1010

#####

my mum comes home hours after her disappearance did you get me anything i ask i got you a few computer games she remarks as she trails of into the kitchen to put away her shopping could it be the new warcraft game no that expansion comes out next month she must have preordered it this is going to be great i scrounge through the plastic bags only to find a 100 games in a one disc in that generic plastic sleeve that looks to be designed with word 2008 god knows from what cyberpunk pirating underground she gets these dodgy discs which are probably chinese botnet builders but i neverthless reluctantly try it

  and on my mums excuse of a laptop amidst the plebian trash of bejeweled and diner dash i find this gem of a game my steam playtime does not do this game justice this game was one of the basic tenants of my childhood

h1 pros	h1
list
    fun arcade like shooter with varied game play such as the passive resistance bonus not shooting anything for a whole level
    cheap
    catchy soundtrack
    nice claymation graphics
    can play 2 player on the same computer
    has steam trading cards
    has a sequel called platypus 2
list

h1 cons	h1
list
    controller compatibility is not guaranteed it works with my xbox 360 controller but ive heard thats not the case with others
    minefields although i consider them a fun obstacle some consider them to be broken
    this game is not really for serious gamers the high score is grindable and replayability in terms of score can be a bit tedious since the leaderboard is useless but if youve scrolled this far thinking otherwise i dont know what you were expecting
list

h1 all in all	h1
  the game is a classic side scrolling ship shooter thats fun to play with a friend its not too simple that it is repetitive but its easy enough that anyone can just pick it up and play most people have it for the nostalgic value of this old game so i suggest you make some memories of your own

#####

wish i could play it but instead i get memory access violation
loved playing it in miniclip as a kid

#####

my childhood stuck at stage two

#####

awesome game one of my favorites but i now get memory access violation every time i try to play it no solutions available major bummer

#####

stop motion animation done with clay
it was a mostly good game at release
nowadays it feels kind of out of date
with that being said i just enjoyed it
it isnt expensive and it was nostalgic
theres even a nice local coop mode
if you are a fan of retro it is worth it
you should avoid the sequel though
this first platypus is far superior to it
overall its enjoyable and also cheap
i think it deserves my positive review
old school shoot em up at its peak


#####

warning if your cpu is intel this game wont work intel is not backwards compatible with most pc games for winxp amd is fine though

classic horizontal shootemup from the early 2000s perfect for your pc monitor the two player coop is a definite plus and the low intensity of bullets and colorful claymation make for a great shootemup game for the kids or a novice like me would pay 11 for this gem again if steam wasnt around and realarcade was

#####

really fun arcade style shooter game
glorious claymation graphics  still holds up really well in 2018
really good soundtrack
you collect fruit as a plane for some reason
definitely get it for the nostalgia factor

810

#####

7810 too good sound track

i remember downloading demos for this from shadyass websites as a kid best nostalgia trip dont remember it being so fkn hard though

#####

short but intesive and awesome gameplay

#####

very recommended

it has a 43 aspect ratio and an old school vibe to it and its pretty normal because it was launched back in 2002 

the gameplay is solid and its very enjoyable if you enjoyed playing raptor call of the shadows 1994 youll have a blast with this one pun intended 

the game is addictive and youll want to best yourself with each run there are sections where the game is quite hard even on easy difficulty and it requires skill to go through with it you have plenty of things to enjoy like various aricrafts to shoot boss fights powerups multiple credits aka retries and if you gather enough points you can get bonus lives or even credits you also get a hall of fame where you can add your score when the game is over

even if you fail a mission and its game over you can restart the level and you wont have to replay the whole game again just the missions from the same level you cannot save the game but once you unlock a level you can start from it and skip the previous levels

the style is wonderful and there are many subtleties that are implemented in such an old game the gameplay is smooth and i strongly recommend playing with the mouse for a smoother experience

you can play the same game in coop by having another player help you defeat the hordes of enemies yes they managed to implement coop while some modern games failed to do so which is pretty remarkable 

its a pretty complete experience and the game is highly worth its price

all in all this is a strongly recommended game for anyone regardless of their age

#####

good memories

#####

this game was part of my childhood i remember playing it with my brother and wondering why it was all made out of plasticine im an adult now but its still great memories

#####

platypus is a really fun and difficult game from my childhood its good fun if you enjoy arcade side scrolling shooters like this one like i said this game can be really hard at times which can make it take a while to beat even on easy also you can forget about its unique artstyle all being made out of clay being an older game if you have any problems running it on windows 10 or alike try disabling any overlays you may have on or look up a way to fix your game if you end up having any problems but that said its a fun and challenging game that should not be lost in time

#####

playing it for the first time 18 years after it was released
it aint that great but what is after 18 years

#####

better than ace combat

#####

childhood game moment

#####

1010 would play this with my dog

#####

nostalgic

#####

truly an amazing game one of the best of its time

#####

so many childhood memories a good retro game

#####

a very fun game from my childhood 3

#####

a platypus perry the platypus 

classic oldschool game that met steam

#####

this game is very fun and the artsyle is done so well but the best part is the music the music is so good

#####

my childhoid game



#####

brings back so many memories d

very fun game if youre into arcade style games

#####

i have so many memories on this game while the sequel is available and ok this is some gold right here and worth its money on its own if youre having problems launching disconnect any secondary display go to your graphics card control panel nvidia control panel for me and turn preferred refresh rate to applicationcontrolled on program 3d settings and you should be good

#####

will not launch unless you manually force your nvidia settings to let the application control the framerate

crashed my computer so bad i couldnt force quit in any form without shutting it down by hand

on an rtx 3080 i9 10900k 128gb ram 10 fans and a ton of heat sink

#####

holy crap i remember playing the demo of this game ah the good ol days good to actually see this on steam 3

#####

the nostalgia is strong with this one used to play this game in my childhood i only had a demo version so i couldnt go beyond level 1 area 3 then now that ive got the full thing it feels so much longer i can finally beat the game now

#####

ive played this game when i was 7 or younger and i still love it i am so happy to find it on steam

nominated it for a test of time award  

#####

when i was a kid i absolutely loved this game and have many fond memories of playing the local coop with my friends the graphics are gorgeous and id even say they hold up to an extent today the music is also fantastic the gameplay is fairly standard for the genre with a few different powerups on modern machines the controls feel clunky speaking of modern machines  i cannot recommend this game to anyone without some courage to get it working it took 10 minutes to get working on windows which was a little frustrating also it just works with wine on linux which is kinda funny but if youre willing to put the work into getting it working its definitely worth the 4

#####

we are playing as the only war plane of the air forces of a country named mungola and the nickname of the plane is platypus the objective is clear defend the country against collosatropolan attacks the game comprises of four chapters first one seems to be in mungola second one among the clouds third one among volcanic islands and the final one in the industrial collosatropolis 

there is a pretty good amount of enemy variations  there are five types of weapons which are acquired through collecting coloured stars yellow blue green red and the turquoise  yellow is wide fire allows you to shoot diagonally blue one fires quicker green one spreads sonic waves red one throws rockets and the turquoise one which i believe appears only in the last chapter electrocutes the key to success is of course powerups most important one is the circular fire powerup which is obtained through blowing up baloons and collecting the boxes they carry

gameplay is pretty smooth there is an evaluation of your performance after each level in the past we are playing such games knowing that a game is a game without the popular demand for reality in todays games

#####

awesome game brings back memories of when this was on miniclip the music is epic fun and explosive shoot em  up maybe if it was a little longer it would be better or with a ending sequence as when you beat the game it just says the end  other than that great

#####

art style is pretty simple yet enjoyable and colourful the game itself is no walk in the park so dont fool yourselfs thinking that it is only a childs game the oflinecoop works wonders it is a great game to play with a friend  overall it is a fun cheap game to play

lots of people mention that this their childhood game and you might think that they are only giving a thumbs up because of nostalgia however that couldnt be farther than the truth this game really holds up in 2018 it really aged well
disclaimer this game has nostalgic value for me as well but still what ive said holds up

#####

you have an hour to kill and money to put a game towards yet cant find any this charming shmup from 2002 is definitely a recommendation from me

pros
 addictive beyond belief
 challenging except for one part which will be bought up later but not too hard
 presentation is through the roof with this one the claymation graphics really give this game character
 fun weapons from a spread weapon like contra to rockets the list may be short but the variety makes it good enough
 the music is stellar especially in level 1 and baddie tune 2

cons
 its a little short i really dont mind this but for people who do crave for a longwinded experience will not find it here
 bosses are a little underwhelming except for the third one
 the mines in level 2 are very annoying especially in a part where there are a lot of them are on screen to me its a huge difficulty spike after an otherwise easy level the rest of the game doesnt get that hard though albeit a few difficult parts but it could be my low skill level

overall
despite a few flaws and one very annoying part of the game its still a great game that anyone should play you can buy a demo online if you want to try it out

score 810

#####

i used to play this as a kid but it never gets old

well except the balloon minesthose get old fast

#####

this game is super fun and it supports pc controller

#####

platypuswhat an amazing game its short but sweet and itll leave you clamoring for more
just dont go poking around in the sequel youll thank me later

get it on sale if you can though as its only 4 levels

#####

the game wont load for me probably best to download it on another website

#####

this game does not load at all for me on windows 10 keeping it anyway since i played a lot of platypus as a kid

#####



#####

i remembered i broke my mouse at level 3 when i was very young this game bring me so much memories
the gameplay is a classic shootem up style the soundtrack is really dope badass boss theme
and the difficulty is still makes me broke my mouse until now

#####

bought this for the sake of nostalgia and then died

#####

ok game for people who are into this genre maybe a bit too short but ok 

#####

fun little shmup interesting visualsart and okay gameplay

#####

eks tselent childhood game that can be finished in less than an hour

#####

how do i put this

it was like 2010 and seven year old me was hella impatient as my dad was downloading a game for me ive gone to arcades and played so many amazing games like daytona usa street fighter some really old suzuki motogp game and so on but never in my life have i seen the possibility of playing a video game on pc except for the already existing ones like 2d pinball 

thats right this was my first step into the world of pc video games even though it was a demo version i played the first level so many times its genuinely nostalgic for me and i was surprised that it still exists in the steam store 

from there on i found out about nfs call of duty halo and so on and over time ive forgotten about this game about a month ago i was talking to my mom and she was getting rid of some tech stuff in our house and she bought something up about my old toshiba laptop and thats when i remembered this game i frantically searched for the name of the game typing weird sentences like clay animation spaceship go pew pew old video game im so happy to find it and im willing to support the devs whove made my childhood amazing i bought this out of pure nostalgia its really old and idk if any of yall would like it but it holds a special place in my library forever

#####

199910

#####

good game but there wasnt any platypi

#####

nostalgia
this was my childhood game

#####

this is  theee funnest game ever i love this game everyone should try it

#####

nice retro game reminds me of the good old days playing games

#####

i have never played the game what the fuck but i am still going to get the game maybe

#####

lets make some lvl on steam 

#####

nostalgic game

#####

if you like side scroll shooters i highly recommend this game the music is great and the progression is balanced you can expect this game to take about 8 hours or more on hard unless you play these types if games a lot

#####

very nostalgic game i played this when i was a kid

#####

a nice game from my childhood
funnier if you play with a friend

#####

memories of when i used to play this game round my nans house i got so close to beating it on hard one time back then if you havent played this game before and you like the look of it i strongly recomend you pick it up the controlling of the ship feels just right the powerups are amazing and the soundtrack is great

#####

this

this is my childhood

#####

classic game had it on my psp back in the day


#####

played the shit out of this as a kid 
1010 for nostalgia

#####

best

#####

fav childhood game 3

#####

used to play this day and night on my 2008 windows xp pc and its still a joy to play after all these years the clay graphics are beautiful as well

#####

i bought this game to support the developers this is my childhood game me and my brother would play it all the time when i was 8 i have so many memories with this beautiful game the soundtrack is amazing i love listening to the soundtrack such an amazing game love it 

one thing i will say is that it doesnt support steam overlay i guess it is because it is old but i wish it did cause sometimes i chat with friends when i play video games

#####

great game for casual play

#####

memory access violation

#####

you will actually play it for about 5 minutes and then lose interest  any further game time can be attributed to farming cards  i am only being honest  the game looks nice in a nostalgic way i suppose

#####

maybe this game was great in 2002 and if you loved it then feel free to get it and love it

however if you are a shmups fan and have never played this think twice before paying for this game

it lacks some of the key elements of a modern shmup and fails to engage you

pro
cheap
easy to learn

con
power ups seem very limited and last very short durations
there is no leveling up weapon changes or any progression of your ship other then the 30 second powerups
playing single player it is very likely impossible to get 100 kill count maybe someone better then i can but it will score you based on that goal
even only playing through level two the enemies already were being recycled and just different colors and sizes
the game isnt smooth  there is no reason for a game from 2002 not to run perfectly smooth on a modern pc

overall it isnt a horrible game  i just wouldnt recommend it for anyone who doesnt already know and love it  i really feel that any newcommer to this title will be very dissapointed like i was

#####

simple but addicting claymation sidescrooling shooter

#####

this game is awesome get it just for the music or the art style love the little claymation ships the backgrounds are just beautiful as a game its hard in a good way expect for those damn telephone poles

#####

memory access violation

#####

platlittleship is cute buy it from commynity market

#####

harder than touhou

#####

fantastic art style annoying yet calming sound track and arcade action this really feels like i am playing on an arcade machine with the music the score the tension and the tokens used to revive your character i would highly recommend this game as it is fun unique and challenging

#####

the music is phenomenal the claymation graphics and animation are beautiful the gameplay is tight the levels are long and you can control your ship with the fucking god damn bitching ass mouse second player can join in on keyboard at any time i immediately got hooked from the moment the game started this game is better than most modern shmups and it came out a million years ago it blew me the fuck away buy it

#####

this game is alright like skyrim with dicks

#####

i remember winning a platypus demo cd in a cereal box when i was 9 nostalgic 

#####

spaceship flies  you shoot its awesome it sucks i dont know how old am i what year is it get off my lawn  damn kids

#####

the music in this game is awesome 
very old school feel 
a bit blocky movement but forgiveable for the music


#####

this is a very simple shooter all done in clay it really reminds me of the neverhood in that theres abstract shapes and everything is not super smooth 5 weapon icons including a 4 way shot weak but can hit multiple enemies at once rapid fire shot my favorite doesnt have a scatter effect but does take down enemies quick a wave can hit multiple enemies at once but kinda weak a rocket much better if you have the sidearms too they scatter and it can be tough to hit enemies and a laser also passes through enemies pretty strong but rare you can pick up two sidearms to triple your firing power of whatever weapon you have active and theres a 2x score multiplier you get additional ships fairly easily in game but its one hit and youre destroyed this is not a bullethell shooter and even if youve played games like tyrian 2000 youll probably find this one on the fairly easy side 

pros
1 very cool artstyle
2 i like some of the effects level 1 has a long train boss for you to destroy level 3 has a volcano that rains rocks and coins level 4 is a polluted city
3 the music i can identify the level 1 music as a commodore 64 remix of comic bakery with a splash of jurassic park nes level 1 music
4 picking up same colored powerup icons extends the time you can use the weapon

cons
1 when you die if you have anything special like the sidearms you lose them this can make things like the bosses challenging when youre given sidearms and rockets to shoot the boss with
2 no real upgrade system to speak of or even a in game shop of any kind once the time runs out you lose your special weapon

its worth picking up if its on sale

platypus is a horizontal shooter

there is no real story but its pretty good

you have powerups like machine gun rockets spread fire ect

the art style is pretty simple and good reminds me of a old windows 95 game and the game is pretty fluent

there is not much to say but its a pretty good game and i will recommend it

get this 


classic chipsound  remixes its worth enough only because of the soundtrack to get this  

the game is also nice btw 

#####

one of the greatest games of all time

#####

nice variety of firepower available to you musics awesome c64 throwbacks clay graphics look great nice for when you just want a mindless shootshitoutofaliens game d

#####

one of the most underrated gems on here i played an incomplete bootleg of this as a kid many years ago and it still holds its charm today it might be short but it has plenty of challenge and is still a fun game to fire up every once in a while

the gameplay is simple you are a plane with a gun and you need to shoot other aircraft that usually have guns it is nevertheless surprisingly complex with more little secrets than you might expect of a game like this doing well early on carries over into the later game and feels intensely satisfying as it is much easier to continue doing well afterwards essentially this encourages replay because it keeps getting better as you get better

#####

this game has aged fantastically

#####

great shootemup game to play with your friend locally playing as a spaceship fighting ufos and other ships game has some powerups that can really amplify or hinder your or your enemies attacks too

all in all game worth every buck with stunning graphics and incredible soundtrack its not long but it sure is fun as fuck get it while you can

#####

nice mini game

like it

#####

quotes you can say about platypus
thats one good game
man have i seen a game that good before
buy it its good
you gotta love that game
amazing
good


#####

two words comic bakery
seriously google it

#####

very fun game

#####

very fun game

#####

yes

#####

its really good game since my childhood and i have no trouble play it again


#####

an old shooter game suitable for casual gamers and kids
4 stages 5 areas each gain score for a life pass a stage for a credit continue
there is no screen sweeper and you cannot touch enemies coop shares credit btw

my rating roughly 410

breasons of playingb
    seeing that i used to play this and it is now lost bought this on sale

bmy experienceb
    cleared the whole game on hard continued a few times but im done with the game
    reminds me how shooter and bullet hell are different genres
    i like autogun bullet hell games influence

bwhat i likeb
    art musics graphics sounds atmosphere
    increase point item value by shooting it
    special weapons can be kept on screen when theres no need to collect right away

bwhat i dont likeb
    manual firing is much stronger than auto firing imagine rockets fired at machinegun rate
    difficulty this is not about the game being too hard or easy but somehow stage 2 seems to be the hardest and stage 3 the second with all the blending background and hardtodetect mini bullets
    enemies come from behind without sign no problem for me but this is a casual game
    stages dont end with just last enemy or boss defeated but also a set amount of time passed such a waste of special weapons
    you can select any stage to start after youve beaten it once meaning you can skip harder stages and still finish the game
    final score is affected by current score credits left and not lives left
    past stages are replayable  credits are grindable  score are grindable
    leaderboard there is no need for it seriously difficulty gives no bonus and they all share one leaderboard and score is grindable the game is not that competitive so this board is just a decoration

ball in allb
    this game is not so bad as i liked it as a kid but theres really nothing much for moderate or higher gamers to look forward to

#####

all the nostalgia 1010 



#####

platypus invented music and video games

#####

nice

#####

the game didnt run at all on my modern pc

#####

loved this game and decided to come back and play it but unable to load due to memory access violation hope they fix it

#####

i do love this game its very simple but a nostalgic childhood game for me

i only really have 2 complaints

1 would it have killed the devs to put a settings option when you start the game i had to mess about for ages to do simple stuff like make the game windowed or change the resolution seems senseless to not include it

2 the game is pretty short for the price honestly its basically only a few levels and thats it i get that this is an arcade game so the point is to replay it for a highscore but regardless a little more content would have been nice 

i would give it an a if both those things were different cause the game is cute and fun otherwise simple enough for anyone to pick up and play to have fun with but challenging enough for you to want to replay it constantly improve

#####

the childhood memories are real

#####

decent side scroller classic shooter clay based sprites are a unique thing 
negatives
game is 43 letterbox and game is mouse based only a little overpriced

#####

squishy shooty

#####

its a very basic horizontal shoot em up whos only outstanding feature are the clay visuals overall its a decent game however i wished that there were more permanent upgrades since the only time you get to change out your weapon is whenever you pick up a collectible that switches out your weapon for a short period of time after which itll switch back to the default weapon 

theres no narrative to this its about as arcadey as it could get with its lives system and limited continues which clearly dates this game but id say its still worth playing just not for the 7 asking price for that its a little too unsubstantial 


#####

good game but it wont run on my new pc with windows 10 doesnt start at all even in compatability settings sucks worked on my old pc

#####

old simple and enjoyable

#####

amazing time passer

#####

old but gold
listen guysthis game is awesome as it is
pretty interface good balance with nice graphics

#####

the bright and colorful graphics hide the intense and frantic gameplay would highly recommend

#####

is this real

#####

very unique horizontal shoot em up this game seperates itself from the masses by having a special graphics style that looks like everything is made out of clay it may look like a game for kids but it gets frustratingly hard at level 2 the music is simply awesome and the controls are crisp sadly this game suffers a few throwbacks like enemies will often enter through the left side of the screen killing you instantly bullets will dissappear behind scenery enemy bullets will have the same color as the background and overall your ship is a little too big to dodge most of the stuff in the later levels

#####

just pirate it honestly p

#####

best game i ever played

#####

childhood game still holds up pretty good 

#####

shit dont even launch

#####

i really want to like platypus but there quite a few bad design choices that it makes it difficult to recommend from enemy patterns that are hard to shoot completely for powerups to mines with random projectile direction and explosions that can block your view for a fraction of a second thats enough to kill you by something else its just frustrating to get through even on easy

#####

i love these claymation games nux is fantastically quirky and platypus does not disappoint although there is only one method of play in this one sidescrolling shooter its varied enough that it does not lose its appeal as you play the bonus items for weapon upgrades are nicely varied the game tracks your score percentages per section and some of the bigger ships that you destroy will drop bonus points in the form of fruit that you need to collect before they fall off of the screen lol

you start off with four lives and two credits when you lose your four lives you can continue by using one of your credits which gives you four lives again of course your score resets when you continue but the game will save the highest score you gain for the leaderboard

it also looks like a second person can join in and play with you as there was something on the screen that said to press a button to join

platypus doesnt seem to be controllercompatible but using the mouse to play gives you plenty of maneuverability theres no clickclickclick either just hold down the left mouse button to shoot continuously

there are weather balloons that float across the background giving you hints such as shoot the stars to change weapons and special bonus for passive resistance hah try not shooting anything and live through it i dare you if you die even once it ruins your passive resistance because youll usually take something out with you and youll get no bonus d

platypus is yet another delightful arcade game by idigicon and ive happily added platypus ii to my wishlist

#####

i was playing this when i am young many year later i cant remember its name i have to search google like a pro for this game then i found it on steam i am so excited to play it the music remind me old day

#####

simple fast claymation fun you can play with a mouse  this is one of those games that just gets it right perfect feel perfect difficulty ramping  fun all the way through  remember when games were fun

#####

i played this game like a decade ago and i never knew the backstory until now
get the game its so fun

#####

if you move your mouse too quick the plane moves very slowly

#####

i was going to recommend this i got it in a bundle just an amusing silly little game
but then i saw the price 5 pound for a game released in 2004 that looks like something youd find on a flash games site

its amusing for a little while and 5 quid isnt a huge amount of money but i dont feel the game is quite worth that 

wait for it to go on sale but without that well the screenshots are a good demonstration of all youre buying there are a lot of games exactly the same as this that dont cost 5 pound

clay is cool  but there are much better shooters out there

#####

man i miss the 80s

#####

the title says it all

#####

this works well on my linux system without any effort

any chance of remastering the game widescreen would be nice

#####

brings memories back 2018ship

#####

good game

#####

pls can you gift me some games like this  i like this game so much id like to get some games like this  pls gift me 

#####

well that was intredasting
might try in coop later with the kids

#####

this isent a bad game but dont pay any money for it it plays like something my dad made for me when i was young on his tandy 1000  25 years ago

#####

being a old sega lightning force fan i looked forward to this i found it somewhat fun with coop but didnt care much for the game mechanics the way the clay explodes everywhere it easily gets mixed up with the other objects ie bullets shooting at you everything kind of blends together making ithard to see whats what 

#####

used to play it with my cousins when i was a little kid
1010

#####

best game i played so far
graphics  1110 
gameplay 6910 

109 would install again

#####

bad game not worth money

#####

from picture this game looks good but try to play with it and you realized this game is very bad

#####

do not trust the overly positive review score on this game as the gameplay is just awful 

only good things are the claylike visuals and the soundtrack consisting of remixes of old chiptunes

the gameplay choises made in this game are just baffling for example 

 enemy bullets blend in with your own the background and objects in the foreground just hide them and enemies altogether
 enemy patterns are awful and can even blindside you without any indication
 powerups are timed and can only be gotten from shooting down special groups of enemies that are sometimes placed so that you need to know where and when they will emerge to have the slightest chance of getting them without the powerups many places in the game are almost impossible to get through 
 using same sprites for enemies in the background foreground and the playarea is just a horrible idea and this will come apparent on the minefield on the second world

this game actually made me angry and i can not recommend this to anyone

#####

#####

tags shootemup  bullethell
additional tags delete local content  remove from library

tldr gamepad was not detected claymation art is cool and the sound design is competent especially for when this was released difficulty is low but thats alright lack of gamepad and primitive resolution really holds this one down and with the saturation of titles in this genre it is not recommendable

#####

insanely short although fun dont buy

#####

not bad but im not gonna pay 7 for this

#####

one word awesome

#####

platypus is a very old 2d side scrolling shmup from 2004  control a weird little spaceship and shoot ufos and zeppelins 

the game has aged poorly the resolution is low and chunky and the game is a fixed 43 aspect ratio  i cant recommend it based on those merits

#####

one of the coolest shoot em ups ive ever played

#####

its a really fun and nostalgic game its a pity that when i was a child im always stuck at level 2
เปนเกมทสนกและชวนคดถงเอามากๆ เสยดายทตอนผมเปนเดกดนตดอยทดานสองตลอด

#####

just pure nostalgia it kinda sucks that i cant play it one my gaming comp but i had a work around so i love it i just wish they updated it so you could play on more modern devices

#####

haha its just a silly claymation plane shooter game dont go crazy with the soundtrack
the music producer

#####

gold

#####

the reason why platypus is the best games in 2000s early the soundtrack the background the boss theme was amazing the boss 3th and 4th is badass boss soundtrack normal and hard difficulty can lose your special weapons unlike easy mode cant lose your special weapons when you died better than platypus hard difficulty is hard because the level is worse to beat the level than easy and normal difficulty

#####

awesome claymation game a lot of nostalgia and i personally love it

#####

great arcade game at normal difficulty it gives a really good challenge 3rd and 4th level should change places since 3rd is much harder to beat i tried easy difficulty one time but it was way too easy so i had to change back to normal straight away the game is pretty addictive and makes you go for that one more try sometimes the screen is full of enemy ships and blasts and ammo so you cant even see what killed you d 
i really enjoyed platypus and will recommend it to others

#####

tearing up the music the nostalgia
one of the only memories i have about my sister is us playing this game when we were kids


#####

amazing side scrolling shooter game

#####

this is literally my childhood game i used to played it with my mom when i was little if i remember correctly this was from gamehouse or i might be wrong at some point but this game is actually nostalgic i love the art of the game i love the concept of it and being able to play it with friends nor families its so much fun thank you for making my childhood life better

#####

one of my childhood game the only issue is the performance on a newer device but other than that its still the same as i play it more than a decade ago

#####

runs well on desktop linux through proton version 80 but dont try to tab out of the game as the visuals will freeze and require a reboot of the game to fix does not open on big picture mode on the steam deck but i expected that from a 20 year old game

#####

what an adorable game a straightforward shooter with just a little bit of upgrading to be had along with some very easy cheats and the claymation graphics just make it even better

#####

classic epic soundtrack grab yourself some caffeine because youre going to need to focus up for this one glhf

#####

fun claymation animation space shooter whats not to love

#####

despite the game being difficult for me at least the game is still super fun and has a good soundtrack and very nice claymation definitely would recommend

#####

childhood memories all over again beautiful game

#####

my childhood
great music
epic art style
good price
buy it now

favorite childhood game played this for the first time on a windows xp laptop

#####

pewpewwwwwwww

#####

such good and simpler times

#####

this game looks so edible i dont eat clay dough but damn does it look yummy


#####

small game where you fly and shoot stuff with good music pretty fun you should try it

#####

h1a great indie game before indie became mainstreamh1

platypus was the bfirstb game ive played on my home computer let alone it was the first runandgun sidescroller game ive ever played yeah i had a nes back then but i didnt meet similar games like life force or gradius also if i happened to play zero wing on sega genesis i would though platypus was its sequel

in my childhood i also played it with my friends the game has a 2player mode typically one player uses a mouse and another one uses a keyboard

 bmain descriptionb 

platypus is a regular game when you fly over the screen and shoot enemies you have a good variety of uweaponsu to increase your firepower enemies are different by appearance scale movement pattern weapon and health points after each level area you get a score bonus by your efficiency you can also find bonus crates like score multiplier and extra guns

it may not even concern you but the game actually has a ustoryu even though its mentioned in its manual only readmertf in the games folder it somewhat explains the level order 

 bmusic and sound effectsb 

this aspect deserves its own paragraph music sounds great drivy and beautiful most important it was carefully selected for each level or level sequence if you play nonstop it even emphasizes several moments like a special crowd of enemies comes at you maybe its a coincidence that music bits match the condition on the screen who knows
the only udownsideu is the music continues playing after you pause the game and the action goes out of tact

sound effects are simple yet matching the action appealing to your ears sure some of them are taken from other games like the explosion of small enemies is a pistol gunfire sound from doom but to me it doesnt spoil anything even modern games sometimes do that

 bbackground and graphicsb 

another creative aspect of the game not only does it look beautiful it also tries to interact with the player give himher useful information of what to be ready for theres a blimp with big screen that shows messages to you sometimes background shows the enemies you will face soon
i like volcano area

its hard to believe all these graphical assets were made of clay digitized and put into the game i used to work with clay myself and let me tell you antony has made a giant work the appearance is unique here

 bflawsb 

every game has flaws and failures lets observe them here

1 bdifficultyb the game has 3 difficulties easy matches the altitude for sure the game even provides additional supplies for you 
on the other hand bnormalb creates a giant gap in gameplay by a creative decision to uwithdraw your weapon upon deathu which makes you feel increased enemy speed intensity and shooting probabilities even harder
amid this hard doesnt feel much harder only enemies shoot more often and bosses have extended attack patterns

2 bmouse sensitivityb the game has only mandatory settings  difficulty and control schemes for 2 players when you play the game you dont have much room to control the speed of your aircraft to move across the screen in fact it moves slower if you move your mouse fast 

 banywayb 

my final grade is b7510b good game i enjoyed it 
minuses its quite short and normal difficulty is actually hard

#####

it is just the best
i just hope itupdates like in anyway
maybe for the scaling to be more sharp or maybe make the soundtracks play at a higher quality

#####

i remember playing this game when i was little and its still just as fun the graphics have aged incredibly well thanks to a unique art style the music still slaps and the gameplay is as i already said just as fun as i remember it being platypus and platypus ii are the only bullethell style games i play no other games can live up to these for me

#####

platypeak

#####

when i was real little platypus always seemed to be installed on the white box computer we had 20 years later and it proves to still be a fun side scrolling shooter with a unique style be aware there will be issues on much of the modern hardware out there compatibility mode seems to help for some if you can get this on sale and dont mind messing around with some settings it will make a nice little purchase

#####

very nostalgic game i remember playing this and being mesmerized with the aesthetic as a kid once i found out it was on steam i jumped at it lmao 

1010 nostalgic game that still kicks my ass till this day

#####

poggers childhood game moment

#####

solid execution but as someone with no nostalgia for this title i dont enjoy it nowadays its a very basic arcadestyle shmup on the gameplay side the artstyle is fun and does remind of a few older titles i used to enjoy but i couldntget myself to keep playing it

still i will recommend it to people who know what they are getting into because its still a solid if basic execution

#####

children

#####

buy it and let the charming soundtrack transport you to a simpler better time

#####

plays well on steam deck at 800x600 but you will have to use the compaibility layer and have to tinker with the steam control settings but its alot of fun to play and great remixed music like comic bakery

#####

liked how it kept you on your toes trying to survive

#####

the only reason youll play this is if youve played it before weird how that works huh

#####

when clay ships attack go hit them back

#####

my childhood game thank you so much for having it be on steam not sure if it was originally on steam but i am thankful to play a blast from the past right here right now
fantastic shooter one i will always love and cherish

#####

good

#####

nostalgia 

#####

drmfree
can be launched directly from exe file

#####

good old game

#####

its a sidescrolling shooter and very well done for its time very much enjoyable today although you wont be able to get it to work without doing this 
run the game using the executable and set that to run in admin compat win7 mode at 640x480 resolution and turn off any second monitors you might have you also may or may not want to set your graphics card to this specific game to a max of 60 fps the key here is running it at 640x480

also if you want to have fun and relax a little bit theres cheat codes for super auto fire etc look them up in the community forum guides

so when it comes down to it its cheap youll probably be able to get it to work using the above info and its a fun quirky oddball game recommended


#####

im so amazing that this game can run smoothly on windows 11 legion 5 ryzen 7 4800h gtx 1650ti  just intall recommended app called direct play when open this game

#####

this game takes me back 13 years

its exactly how i remembered it

but other than that the game features original graphics a banger soundtrack and challenging yet satisfying gameplay

#####

p

#####

nostalgic memories i rember being just a lil kid and play it

#####

makes dark souls look like pong

#####

gonna be hard as fuck to beat solo the difficulty settings doenst seem to change much there can be errors with nvidia graphic cards so i sugest you unplug your gpu if you encounter crashes or other problems fun as hell when you play with someone

#####

i remember playing this game on windows xp and when i booted it up for the first time in 13 years i was filled with nostalgia this is a great game but i wish it was more optimized for windows 10 u may not get it to work but i luckily did the art style is so unique i cant really think of another game that uses claymation as sprites the music is top notch and there are some interesting little details like how there are power lines in the first level u can crash into if ur not careful its satisfying to watch the zeppelin take damage like shooting clay with a shotgun kind of satisfying also one of the sound effects of the ships exploding is the doom pistol noise which i cant unhear once its pointed out it welcome overall if ur into interesting games the are one of a kind ull love this game  i wish the source code was avaliabe so people could port this to other systems being able to run in wide screen and online multiplayer would be the dream

#####

great game

and if anyone has the memory access violation error go to the nvidia control panel and set the preferred refresh rate to aplication controlled

#####

this a great game

#####

well if you ever wondered how old shoot em ups looked like without being bullet hells here you go

despite being old game it looks decent and offers 3 different difficulties easy on which you should be able to complete the game in one go normal on which it is actually challenging to complete it with those lifes and hard well stay on normal if you dont manage to keep credits

pros
 graphics
 audio
 5 temporary weapons
 goodol highscores
 second player can steal credits like lifes in contra

cons
 no controls customize
 punishing if you misspick wrong weapon
 on easy its trivial
 kids friendly
 only 4 levels
 balloons and stones

give it a go its worth it

#####

childhood
owo

#####

a classic

#####

old but gold still this game gives me goosebumps when i play it always loved the pasty theme of this game 

#####

able to support 2 people challenging and diverse

#####

i played a demo decades ago on a potato pc and sort of forgot about it but one day after a hit of nostalgia i found it so many wonderful memories came rushing back it is a lot of fun to play with friends and the varying levels of difficulty get you hooked quite easily kick back relax and enjoy this retro masterpiece

#####

waiting for the day where i go through all the level 2 mine balloons without using an extra credit

#####

its more than good its one of my childhood games i played



biggi nostalgia

#####

very fun arcade shooter the game is short but replayability is good graphics are dated but are still playable controls are fun and simple difficulty is balanced

#####

i used to play this game all the time with my sister when we were kids im so glad i was able to find it again its a lot harder than i remember though

#####

this game is a musthave youll have a lot of fun with it and it will never get boring i highly encourage you guys to pick one up its cheap and definetly worth it


#####

not really my kind of shmup game but yeah its a good game the controls work good the action is fine everything goes smooth difficulty feels balanced the sound is ok the clay graphics look nice and the game is small in size and cheap to buy

#####

taken on its own as a horizontal shoot em up platypus is pretty good as someone who really likes shoot em ups this isnt one of the best horizontal shoot em up ive ever played and there are others id rather be playing but its good the speed is fast its mostly fair theres a good amount of variety and although it leans easy its still challenging 

on the downside i wouldve liked more enemey and weapon variety and although the game is mostly fair its not devoid of cheapness enemies frequently come from behind so you have to leave space at the left edge of the screen it also falls into the trap of making the game more challenging to deal with overpowered powerups and then punishing the player when they die at the wrong time and come back with just the base gun dying at the worst times can not only lose you the powerups youve already accumulated but also make you miss out on all the powerups the game expects you to be picking up just then to get through the level

all in all for a shoot em up developed by a single person its very well done and better than a lot of shoot em ups that have been developed by companies known for developing shoot em ups even if you dont take into account this is a one man effort this is still an above average shoot em up

however the real draw of platypus is the claymation and in that regard it delivers

#####

n o s t a l g i a

beautiful game i have many fond memories of this game and i even have a tattoo of the ship from this game worth every penny

#####

stage 2 is the best

i put in hundreds of hours on this claymation title as a kid its awesome original easy to learn and hard to beat its easily worth 7 and fun for young and old alike

#####

#####

awesome last level has some bullst lasers but its good childhood game

#####

here i am back at childhood nostalgia trip

is this game fun
yes it is

it has unique graphics great soundtrack and is just fun

however
this game is simlpy not playable at all for majority of people it seems
you get to experience memory errors and framerate going down to 2
it gets worse longer you play

if anything this game should be free 
otherwise publisher should post way to fix all those issues or optimize it themself

why is it a possitive rewiev well because nostalgia is too strong

#####

is there a level missing i remember it as level 1 2 3 4 and then a separate level 5 with the boss in it and there was also a grey metal battleship in level 4 after the submarine in level 3

i remember the order of bosses was
red truck thingie
green long spaceship
yellow submarine
grey battleship
green mothership

#####

this game is pure nostalgiaeven if you havent played it you should still give it a try cause its relly cheap

#####

this game is a real throwback to when games were fun as a kid very happy to see steam has the game to relive the memories

#####

very nostalgiac game nice


#####

a solid classic arcade shooter with a claymation twist
highly recommend for those looking for a time waster
also has coop for some fun with a friend or family member

#####

i was always playing this game when i was younger and then the nostalgia came back to me so i bought it on steamplayed like 2 hours then left it there bro im bout to go  gaming again

#####

platypus is awesome i played this game as a kid with my dad and i also owned it on the psp at one point before buying it here on steam simple gameplay with increasingly challenging levels multiplayer is really fun too

#####

1010  better than perry the platypus

#####

after all this time always
this game brings back many childhood memories  coop is where its at  unless your partner likes stealing the powerups

#####

h1simplicity  funh1

at least most of the time nothing can give you a relaxing time like a sidescrolling shooter and at the same time offer you some suspense platypus with its claymation artsy style is no difference to this simple game mechanics and some minutes later you forget about the bad game that rusts in your library

scramble and to some extend defender were some of the games i played in the arcade or  if i had to look for my father in his favorite hangout well anyway this game is nice to play and highscores are easily achievable this game is around for such a long time and yet hasnt lost anything of its vibe and freshness

h1recommendedh1

for all fans of classical shootem ups and retrogaming

#####

goood

#####

legendary

#####

one day i will stream this

#####

old skull fun yall

#####

this game was my childhood its great to play this masterpiece again looking forward to future games

#####

brings back old memories of playing this game when i was little good nostalgia with a good challenge

#####

i loved this game as a kid so when i found it on steam i bought it instantly does this game still hold up today or was i blinded by nostalgia 

pros
great music
responsive controls
great visuals
runs well im using windows 10
challenging

cons
cant change resolution or aspect ratio of game

overall this game definatly holds up today and is well worth it

#####

this game is one of my childhood favorites it was the second computer game i every played besides the nostalgia ive experienced after buying it on steam i still appreciate its creative design the levels are challenging like the impossible game but its art and level design set it apart from other arcade games if you are cheap like me wait to purchase it during a sale  but surprisely i actually believe that it is worth the ticketed price

#####

it me

#####

great game not worth a fiver brought it as a kid in a discount store for 99p picked it up in a sale for less than half that on steam fun casual platformer nice clay animation

#####

a very basic and plain shoot em up game the game itself is decent the visuals is unique   the upgrades for weapons are very limited your weapon pick ups only last a while before you go back to your default weapon all in all a very addictive game if its our type of game some if you may have played this growing up adding some nostalgia to it for you


however this game is quite heavily overpriced in my opinion only get this on major sale or in a bundle

#####

got it as a part of the bundle and even played some time if you love old nessega like fly and shoot action  this is something along the lines extremely simple and you can get contra like spray as a weapon

long story short pixelated edges of sprites is what made me uninstall this game

#####

i played this game when i was a little kid and had so much fun with it i recently found out its also available on steam and immediately bought it the game was still as much fun as i remembered its not a big game but definately worth buying when its on sale

#####

platypus is a nice little claymation game in which you pilot a small green military jet with the aim of shooting down hordes of alien spaceships that appear before you and behind you as the case may be
im guessing that they are alien spaceships but they could just be from a futuristic earth civilisation who knows not me thats for sure

the game mechanics are not very much different from a wide range of similar games but the claymation style gives it a sort of cuteness which is easy on the eye being somewhat visually amusing

whilst the game is simple in its concept it gets harder as you level up
when you blow up some bigger enemy vessels you can collect the large stars they leave behind which will give you better weapons
or they might drop fruit bananas cherries etc which you can collect for bonus points

in the higher levels you have to fight harder enemies huge motherships fixed gun emplacements trainmounted guns and more
whilst you can fly right down to the ground and take no damage by doing so you might be in for a surprise in a later level when you crash into a groundlevel fuel tank
so be careful with what youre doing

platypus is not a spectacular game but its a bit of fun
with its claymation style i imagine that it could be quite a good game for children

im the only one who cant reach level 3 this game is harder than ds3

great game brings back lots of nostalga but why cut the boss music that last over 5 mins to less than 40 seconds that you can clearly hear it being cut 

this is the cut song httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfetjedqziw
and heres the actual song httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7abzgkcaghi

#####

me childnoooo this game is so hard

1010 for childhood

#####

game nostalgia

#####

recommended for fans of shmups or claymation  which drew me to this game in the fisrt place admittedly i am a rookie at shmups and i find this game rather difficult it seems there are pretty big spikes in difficulty after only a couple of levels regardless the gameplay is good and the animation is awesome music isnt bad either

#####

my childhood i still love this game haha

note if youre playing on windows 10 and the game doesnt start search for turn windows features on or off in the start menu and make sure directplay is checked under legacy components itll take a minute or so for windows to automatically download and install whats required but it should work after that credit goes to jerry 2215 in the steam discussions page

#####

the graphics in this game have had a lot of effort put into them which you should totally respect i used to play this game a ton with my father but we soon begun to forget about it but 12 years later we found it again its still a blast to play and most deaths arent totally unfair but thats the fun part about it

#####

one of the best bmp based games 

#####

a game from my childhood that i am happy to play again

#####

wow id never thought i would find this game on steam and its such a relieve to see my childhood coming back to me
alas my skill regarding this kind of game has deteriorated i even rage quit on this one or maybe this game is rather difficult i played on easy and it was exhausting to me 81p

#####

i played this game when i was 2 years old and like hearing the soundtrack again for the first time in ages gave me the chills

#####

old school pew pew fun

#####

an excellent shooter game a bit easy but a bit hairpulling as well dont play this if youre expecting a full on japanese bullet hell game good unique graphics and an amazing soundtrack play it its a nostalgia fuled trip

#####

this game is a claymation 2d side scrolling shoot em up and it can be very hard the first time you play it but when you get use to it becomes easier and after i had about 5 deaths before i completed the in about 19 hours

#####

not my favorite type of game side scrolling shooter but any game that uses claymation is ok by me   enjoyed this while i was farming cards and have to give it a thumbs up for style

#####

i played this game whit my father a loot when i was a kid  i loved it so much  now i play whit my lil brother  i like platypus 2 too 

#####

only true 90z kids will remember this classic

#####

closest thing to rtype on steam

#####

great shooter game the way the game is made from clay is interesting and it actually looks really good the music is also very good as for the gameplay sometimes theres just too much stuff going on but its really addictive and you want to do better everytime

#####

me and my brothers childhood except now we shout and curse a lot more 
we replayed it kept dying kept cursing each other seems like we used to be much more coordinated and better at this when we were kids 
1010 would bond over childhood game again 

legit though for an old game the music and scenery are pretty good nice little minigame to play with someone or even by yourself im not a big fan of flying shooter games but this was a big part of my early gaming years

#####

no much to say great nostalgic game everyone who likes arcade shooting game should try this one too

#####

the soundtrack for this game is one of the main reasons i bought it that and that it is better that the second iteration

#####

a game i used to play a ton when i was much younger its still worth a shot today if you like shmups

#####

the  music is great the game is wonderful


#####

really good fun doesnt work on steam link though

#####

claymation i remember this game from my childhood
