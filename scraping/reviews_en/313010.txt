thought i would play a bit of xl before xxl came out it was a bad idea because you can see how identical the games are the best part is they forgot to rename the program so its still labelled as cities xl if you play in windowed mode it just shows the extreme laziness and lack of care from the developper where is the refund button

#####

so theres lots of bad reviews  but lets first look at whats sold

running on an improved game engine for enhanced performances cities xxl offers classic and extended citybuilding content including over 1000 buildings and structures over 65 maps including new landscapes and environments and ecological features making cities xxl the greenest cities xl game yet

and 

design build and manage the worlds largest and most diverse cities in cities xxl bigger and better than ever before with a more powerful game engine and new interface become the mayor of your very own sprawling metropolis

so they didnt say new landsapces new structures  ok i get that  i didnt really expect it to be a massive difference from the xl version in that sense

i bought the game thinking there would be ban improved game engine for enhanced performanceb  thats what was sold  an improved game engine  the previous version really suffered from terrible performance  has the performance been improved in this one  nope  not a bit  

i really dont know what this version offers over the previous one  

focus deserves the bad publicity  you know how you ruin a brand  this is how

#####

99 same game
even ui bug which allow you to buy infinite money tokens is still there so dont tell me its a new ui or new engine
its a scam avoid at any cost 

ps 1 new is ui color

edit most comments are fair enought so let me defend my pointa bit ive copied my 15mil city from platinum sure it works why not its the same game  and made few screenshots with steam fpsmeter and fraps on screen as well as cpu load per core httpimgurcoma7lvwo

#####

updated just to make clear if youre coming in new to this series or have a very old version of this game this is by far the best version of this game and could be worth the price but then again you could get an older version for a lot less and get basically the exact same game  except it runs much worse the bad reviews have to do with the complete lack of any new content controls ui anything  it looks and controls exactly like previous versions of the game there is no increase in quaility the controls still mostly stink  but it does run much better now



so ive liked the older cities games enough that i preordered this one i boot it up and tah dah well there is no need to relearn anything since its 99 of the exact same game

so to recap the new version

positives

 this is overlooked in the other reviews ive seen but the game does run much smoother than in the past i wouldnt really say it looks better but its no longer sluggish on my top of the line gaming pc older versions of the game ran pretty awful even on top of the line hardware

negitives

 its the same exact game as before

 the controls still stink if they had just upgraded the graphical engine so it ran much bettter which they did and updated the controls so it worked more like simcity this game would have been worth the 20 to me however they did not do that it controls just as terrible as the previous versions of the game

 its the same game which means it will probably be on sale on steam for 5 in a week

overall this is very very disappointing hopefully with the workshop intergration fans will be able to do the job the devs decided not to do  and that is to give us a new game 

if youre new to this game just wait a couple of weeks it will surely be on sale as they try to get people to buy this desipte all the poor reviews this is the best version of this game since it runs better but otherwise again its the same exact game as the versions you can buy all day and night for 5 or less

#####

this game offers a small update to cities xl this game should have simply been released as a patch for previous versions

no new gameplay horrible performance issues same problems as before

dont buy this game

#####

welli cant say i am surprised given the large discount for previous owners of the franchise but this game is the exact same game as what came before  the exact same buildings the exact same tools the exact same interface layout  the only differences i have been able to spot are the new color of the interface from blue to black and apparently it has multithread support  

i could have just saved the 20 dollars and played cities xl and gotten the exact same experience  it is a bit sad that they repackaged an old game and sold it for so much while promising us tons of new features  maybe a ton has a different weight value wherever this developer is located


edit due to some legit points made in the comments section of this review ive decided to make an edit

old players dont buy it unless you play it every day then youll have bought it anyway

new players  i would characterize this game as more of a city editor instead of more of a city sim in the manner of the old simcitys  in my opinion this game is just too easy to plop whatever you want down and watch it build itself  yes you can build a massive city in many of the ways you want  but if you want to start with a small town and work your ass off to turn it into a bustling metropolis after hours and hours of fun gameplay and then have to deal with sprawl aging infrastructure and urban blightthen this is not the game for you  

to that end i would characterize this game as a pretty boring way to spend an evening as you just point and plop whatever you want or need and then watch the grey boxes go around your city because you dont want to view your city one street at a time

#####

i want my money back

this game is just the game they released 3 years ago with the ui color changed from blue to black

dont waste your money

#####

get cities skylines instead

#####

this game is basically cities xl with a few minor changes they changed the color scheme to this black modern looking theme and added in workshop support and trading cards the features on how to monitor and build your city are the exact same they even had the nerve to use the same exact maps there are probably a few more new buildings in cities xxl but not worth buying another game just for that also on the old cities xl when my city got around a population of 300k i was pretty much done because the lag made doing anything impossible they kind of fixed it i was able to reach about 600k population until the lag did start getting unbearable 
so basically all they did was make a new color scheme sort of fix the lag problem and add minimal buildings i would not reccomend buying this game no matter what even if you do or dont own cities xl or one of their prior games focus home interactive should be ashamed for ripping all of us well guess what now you guys have a crapy reputation due to your stupid plan stay away from this game and anything with focus home interactive on it for that matter

#####

after having purchased four iterations of the cities franchise i can now say rather confidently that you will probably be better off not buying this game cities xiwhateveri has essentially not changed very much since the original and i think that is quite apparent

they say that the game engine is better it still runs kind of choppy and has the same problems
they say that the maps are larger as far as im aware they are the exact size that theyve always been
they say that the interface is new the buttons are grey and make less annoying sounds when you click on them
but hey at least the music is all new

i dont ihatei the game im not going to beg for my 20 back i will play this game as there are elements that i like about it it may not be the prettiest or the best citysim out there but then again there arent many good citybuilders out there

if i were you i would not buy icities xxli if you already own a previous cities title if you do not own a cities title and wish to get one then i suppose consider this one or a previous one but if you want a better citysim go grab isimcity4i isimcity3000i is good too i would suggest the new isimcityi but i feel like im the only human who thought that game was okay

#####

let it be a warning to everyone when a company refuses to release an actual gameplay trailer before release then this is not a good sign

#####

if you already own cities xl i recommend that you do not purchase this game it is identical 

better alternative cities skylines

#####

everyone is right this is the same game as xl unbelievable

#####

do not buy  

this is the same game as before i mean its the same game they changed the color of the ui its the same maps the same grapics the same interface the same game as before 

do not buy

i want my money back

#####

incompatible garbage buggy interface terrible programming  feels and behaves like an amateur firstrun testbeta app  if you paid  399 for it youve been had  stick to cities skylines

#####

can i have my money back please

i allready own this game its called cities xl it wasnt even that good why did you make me pay 30 dollars for a game i allready own

i am perplexed

this is the exact same thing

#####

just no fuck this developer they originally released this game somewhere around 2010 theyve continued to republish it under different names over and over this is no different this is literally a reskin of the same game do yourself a favour and buy cities skylines avoid this developer at all cost

#####

i like cities xl but man this is a ripoff its buggier than before with no real content added 

do not buy i want my money back

#####

so right off the bat cities xxl is not substantially different from its predecessor cities xl in my time with the game so far ive only encountered two new features everything else right down to the buildings available and the game interface are unchanged xxl hardly deserves to be called a sequel or sold as a new game its a content patch and not even a very good one

when i first started playing cities xl a few years ago i was really impressed with it i hadnt really played any modern citybuilder games since simcity 4 and so the jump to 3d graphics the ability to draw curved roads and the sheer size of the maps was enough to win me over initially but as ive played the game more its limitations and weaknesses have become much more apparent and hard to ignore this is especially true in the games interface and controls which are very rough and full of nagging annoyances when compared to the much smoother and organic controls of games like tropico 5 the modern disastrous simcity reboot and even older games like caesar iv cities xl really starts to look bad

the biggest deterrent to enjoying cities xl is its ui and controls theres nothing that really singlehandedly breaks the game but theres a cacaphony of small nagging problems that gradually wear down your resolve to play the game the first thing that youll notice is the ugly and disorganized interface there are buttons and widgets floating all over the screen build icons overlay toggles camera control widgets zoning subcontrols and so on you can customize some of the ui elements by dragging them to different places on the screen but there is no arrangement that really feels comfortable

#####

amazing that the same game can be renamed and resold so many times without someone going to jail  the fact its been done with a subpar game is even more surprising  whats embarassing is i fell for it lol  just buy skylines and get a great game instead

#####

i will say that the game itself is ok the scale is massive and the gameplaymechanics that worked in cities xl works in cities xxl just as well however there is no changes from xl to xxl except for the color of the menu the tutorial was taken word by word from cites xl

so if you dont have xl go ahead and buy xxl but if you had xl and consider buying xxl dont waste your money 



#####

hey lets paint the ui grey instead of blue put in some different music and call it a new game focus home interactive
edit it for some reason removed my entire city gg never going to touch this game

#####

 not recommended there are better city sim games with the same price 

i started cities first with xl series and the time it got published the graphics were overwhelming however short after a game called cities skylines came out which was bigger and better so then focus home interactive decided to come with a sequel to their city sim with name xxl pretty creative actually but unfortunately we realized that they just added a couple of things and new buildings to their previous game and released like a new game that was unfortunate because it killed the ip of this series totally

i wouldnt recommend cities xl while you can buy cities skylines with a decent amounts of dlcs as well


#####

this is exactly the same as xl do not waste your money get cities skyline

#####

cities skylines is better and cheaper buy cities skylines

#####

changelog from xl to xxl

 steam workshop support 
 removed gap of multiplayer button
 redesigned interface for your sorry eyes
 spiky frame rate who cares about multicore anyway

played 40 hours of xl2012 and around 30min of xxl and its just worse
please tell me theres something good i havent seen yet

#####

i want my  back this is the same as the last one

#####

if you own cities xl is like you are paying twice for the same game literal and thats it a scam a fraud so evident that even the executable its labeled as cities xl

#####

okay look im sure that you can read about the flaws of this game everywhere else on this page but im going to at least try to say some informative things about the core gameplay of cities xxl if you are a newcomer to the series yes this was extremely hard thank you for asking

1 the game is alright to look at and as long as youre doing nothing except sitting still and looking at it the game runs fine which is something i personally appreciate because my current graphics card is made of sliced bread even on ludicrously large cities the framerate isnt exactly stable but it is at least mostly high and the cities can actually get ludicrously large because every single map in this game is gigantic

2 there are four tiers of citizens that you zone residential areas for unskilled skilled executives and elites you have to make sure that the zones you lay down for them give enough housing room to match the job demand for each tier without overcompensating and leading to unemployment each of these tiers also requires different levels of city ordinances education health leisure etc and placing down the buildings for these ordinances is quite expensive so it becomes a balancing act of not drawing out more money for the ordinances than youre collecting in tax revenue from the citizens who need them

3 apart from these ploppable ordinance buildings and the small amount of commercial zones the majority of the jobs in the game come from the five different types of industry farming heavy industry manufacturing hightech and offices these different types of industry all feed off each other in a complex symbiotic web that requires some pretty close management so as not to oversaturate one industry or leave it starving for goods it needs from another type in addition each of these industries has three different levels of density low medium and high and each density level for each industry type requires a unique number and ratio of the four tiers of citizens to fill its jobs and operate at maximum efficiency it turns the game into a complex challenge of balancing expanding and finetuning in the hope of achieving some kind of equilibrium between the industrial and residential demand 

4 your city requires some firm resources water oil electricity holiday spots fertile soil for farming etc and these can only be found in certain places on the map this means you want to put careful attention into your city layout from the very beginning so you dont accidentally build all of your residential areas on top of the most oilrich ground or that you dont make the commute to the farmlands too far away from the houses and diminish their productivity and you definitely dont want to build the residential too near to the industrial zones or the pollution will completely drive everybody out and there is only so far that building parks can push the air pollution back whats more is that not every resource is necessarily going to be available on every map which incentivizes trading between the cities youve created in order to help them mutually meet their highest potential 

all of these factors come together to create a game that is heavily about thinking ahead but also constantly adjusting the layout of your city to gain stability so while i cant call this game good or even adequate with all the other issues surrounding it i do at least want to say that i dont personally think the core gameplay is bad if you are some sort of saint and can completely ignore the absolutely huge list of other problems with cities xxl its a not bad game and thats it

#####

a patch for cities xl sold as a entire new game get yourself city skylines instead

#####

i was really looking forward to this game the promised multithread support the fps improvements none of which were delivered with this update cities xxl is little more than a scam they promised a new and improved game but all it is is the same cities xl title with horrible modifications to the ui to make it seem like a new game but its not if you own or have played cities xl then youve already experienced everything this new title has to offer it is a lie it is a cash grab please dont give these people your money

note  heres a reddit thread that captures further on the points above
httpwwwredditcomrsteamcomments2uxr49a_warning_to_all_people_thinking_of_buying_cities

#####

play cities skylines instead trust me

#####

literally the exact same game as xl platinum just as poorly optomized same ui bugs still exist ui and graphics havent changed in the slightest as well as sound affects almost no new buildings as well plays literally exactly the same as platinum im not sure why this costs 20 more though 

hell even some of the old trainers and scripts for platinum work on this without a need to change anything shows exactly what kind of effort the devs put into this avoid it like the plague

#####

first the most important this game cannot really be considered as a game it is more of a paid patch to older cities xl versions with many of the bugs still present no surprise that owners of older versions of cities xl get a discount  in fact they are just buying the same game again as i did _ 

if you already own one of the previous cities xl titles please dont make the same mistake i did please do not buy this game the game is 99 identical to older ones only the interface is now black instead of blue and the performance is slightly better normally one should expect this type of change in an update instead of a new release

if you are interested in how this game works and what it offers i propose you may watch some gameplay videos on youtube as they might tell you more than i could describe in a text here on steam however ill try with just a few words

you start with one of different predefined maps lay out roads build a town hall and then start zoning residential industrial and commercial areas the game offers quite a few nice ideas residential zoning is separated into different wealth categories the different types of residents are required to operate different types of industry offices or other workplaces there are also different density options with higher density offering larger and higher buildings the trading inside the city is calculated using tokens heavy industry needs tokens of unskilled workers and generated heavy industry while manufacturing industry may convert this into manufactured goods which may then be used in commercial areas if a city is in need of tokens of a certain type or may have a surplus tokens may be traded with other cities however this trading system is heavily bugged since the first version of cities xl and was not fixed until today of course there is also power water pollution leisure police healthcare fire etc however the simulation is only based on statistics there is no real simulation of vehicles inhabitants or anything like this

if you look for an alternative in the citybuilding genre cities xxl might be the right game for you if you can withstand bugs however you might want to take a look at one of the almost identical older versions of cities xl for a cheaper price 
and again please think twice before buying this update if you own a previous game of the franchise

#####

if you already own cities xl then i recommend you do not buy this game as they are near identical

better alternative cities skylines

#####

updated graphics
steam workshop
multi threading support

those are the features that set this apart from platinum and the rest if that justifies 20 for you then so be it i however simply wish i could have spent my money on something better

also i liked cities xl because well simcity was garbage cities at least thought outside of the box and there are some things i still miss like trading between all your cities and realistic population calculations but alas it has been overcome by cities skylines in the overall experience

#####

cant tell the difference between xl and xxl it feels buggier the road drawing system still has its quirks still one of the better city building sims though but wouldnt recommend you buy this one

#####

this game was a horrible letdown  it is exactly the same as cities xl  my excitement of the preorder was terribly ruined upon release of the game  i wasted my 20 on getting the preorder and receiveing the same game as cities xl just tagged cities xxl

i wish to have my money back for this poor game  i would gladly give up any rights to playing it as it is no longer even installed on my pc

#####

i can compare this to sim city the first sim city zoning is blocky the interface is terrible and this is little more then a repackaged cities xl

unless you like microbuilding and management avoid this and go for citiesskylines instead if you want cities that actually look good and are easier to run

#####

i had played cities xl even enjoyed it
however there were some pretty bad performance issues and memory leaks in xl

xxl is the same same game same content same exact bugs
its a worthless addition to anyones game library 
xl was pulled because this one is a rerelease of xl to try and get some sales

#####

highly highly highly highly highlyadd more highly as you like not recommended

for people never played cities xl cities xxl may seem ok but if u have ever played xl ull find that xxl is not even a game it can only be called update of the xl just like mobile apps the changes are very basic eg some ui improvements gaming camera control update

this is called an update not a new game

#####

ripoff and massive scam fi you are just being stupid this time by releasing a small  update and calling it a new game

and any serious person will buy old sim city 4 or cities skylines instead of this pos

#####

complete rip off do not buy terrible game all they did was copy and paste their previous game and add an extra x to the title

#####

first impression
compared to the previous editions quite some things have changed for example the blue rounded buttons have been replaced by dark grey squares with straight corners since these buttons are really small on my 1440pscreen not to brag i wonder where the extra x in its title comes from but it certainly does not refer to these buttons the sounds during interaction have not changed the resources are the same and trading works the same as it always has done omnicorp is awaiting your trades when you have no friends or actually other cities as i have not found the online multiplayer yet which actually kind of made one of the previous editions of this game but i have to admit when you start the game you get a nice but short animation carrying the word focus whatever focus may be a studio a gang of angry italian hamsters that took this game and tried to earn an extra buck by adding an x i dearly hope they have actually fixed the memory leak bug from previous editions then it may actually be worth 5 units of your national currency when it is on sale in a month or 2 until then just focus on games that may actually be worth it or that hamster gang who knows

#####

i actually quite liked cities xl and its resource trading system it certainly was more flexible than the limited options in simcity 4 unfortunately cities xxl doesnt really build upon its predecessor to really improve

this is more of a paid patch than a new game none of the central mechanics have been modified or improved much at all in fact theres only two big draws here

 an updated engine supporting multicore cpus and 4gb of ram the game is a lot more stable especially with large cities
 steam workshop support

unfortunately one of the key mechanics of the game trading is completely broken without a mod all trades in all cities will reset to 0 when loading a city so it becomes impossible to actually trade resources around as intended the mod fixes this but why is it broken to begin with ive also had several unexplainable crashes while playing that make me saving like a complete paranoid

if this were a free patch for cities xl id be pretty happy if it were a 510 dlc id roll my eyes and be accepting but 20 for previous owners and 40 for the new game no way son my call is to wait for new patches to fix some of the problems more workshop content to improve the mechanics and a steam sale so you can pay what the game is really worth

#####

it kinda feels like a rip off i guess there are some extras compared to the earlier versions of this game but graphically nothing has changed the moment i started the tutorial it felt like the same old game i bought 2012 same tutorial same graphics im disappointed

but there is a happy end to this storyfor 20 eur i bought the certainty of never buying a focus game again and certainty is scarce nowadays

#####

yep same game same old bugs with cash tokens i made a bad descision purchaing this game again

#####

i dont quite understand why steam lets this company continue to repackage their game and sell it by changing nothing the only noticable change is size of buttons and color thats it theres no mechanical difference all of the resources and requirements are the same even the in game achievements i dont recommend this at all not even to new players of this franchise its a seriously boring game anyway once you understand it that should be the opposite for the type of game i assume it was meant to be but it isnt dont waste your money like i did twice

#####

not much to say its not a new game its the same as cities xl with a few modifications

#####

please go play cities skylines instead

#####

this is the 399th game i have purchased on steam and the first time i feel really ripped off enought to post first review
basicaly all reviews are right on about this expected a new game as i had played original years ago feels like i paid to have a steam library version of a game i owned already i dont really care to have my money back just for steam to get the name of anyone involved with this product and blacklist any future product they createeven people that created the terrible music the developer is a pos 
steam please create a ban option so i never support this crappy dev by accident false advertising should have been called cities xl remastered and sold for 999 this game is a perfect example of why not to preorder

#####

if you have citiesxl no not recommended its the same game those of you that dont have it    i didnt mind citiesxl  wasnt that bad of a game   i took my saves from cities xl and overwrote the saves for citesxxl they loaded and ran fine
not worth the 21 i paid   


#####

gameplay is outdated go with cities skylines sim city or even the old sim city 4 is better than this i was surprised at how many bugs i encountered in only the first 10 minutes playing game looked promising but after about 15 min total i had no interest in what this game had to offer

#####

this game is a thinly veiled and i mean real thin copy of cities xl the tutorial is word for word the same they changed from a blue theme to a black theme i havent even seen many new buildings

also still buggy and easy to exploit if you have any of the previous ones do not buy if you have never played any of them then meh go for it

#####

i thought itd be more of a sequalexpasion than a patch and rerelease of xl

also cities skylines has it beat in every aspect

#####

i would suggest listening to the other negative review about this game since its basically true this game is not worth spending your money on since there is nothing new about this game but only  with some extra features and a few things change thats about it if you want a more high end quality city building sim game that you wont regret buying i would suggest buying cities skylines instead of this rehash let down of a game since its worth every penny dont be fool by their promotion and their false advertising trailer you wont and i repeat wont get your money back if you buy this game

#####

big cities xl fan i have a few hoursdays racked up in it  saw xxl was a preorder and thought why not   ive never been more wrong about a game  this is a perfect reason not to preorder a game  it was a total waste of money  no innovation nothng has changed and its got some stability issues  save your money

#####

its a scam a total and utter scam i want my money back and i want justice if we could review companies not just their products focus interactive would have the worst rating ever

i like you valve but i dont see how you can allow focus to release such minor changes as a brand new game and charge the price of a full game if focus had been upfront and honest about what the new version actually included i wouldnt have paid 5 for it  it doesnt even have the value of a small dlc

very very dissatisfied

#####

not only is this game an exact copy of the original but it doesnt even work after some time for me at least its just stopped working it still launches but when i get to the map selection screen earth the land doesnt appear and when i actually play a session i litteraly cant do anything

do not get

#####

i should have saved my money and got cities skylines instead

#####

what a crap i paid money for exactly same game as was in 2011 and still lot of bugs i will never ever buy a game from focus home interactive i want my money back

#####

before you read this i wouldnt buy this unless its on sale since its not worth the full price

basically this is just like cities xl but with more buildings and stuff not worth buying if youve already got cities xl but the superior choice it dosent differ that much price wise anyways

the graphics are kinda meh they look not bad and thats on ultra 
no there are no graphics mods to my knowledge ive looked but i genuinely dont care that much you cant zoom out without everything fading away which really sucks in a city builder where you want to see the skyline of your creation every now and then the ui is really lacking they didnt try it feels like youre playing a android game made on unity whenever youre forced to use it i would assume its to come off as minimalistic bit it looks really shitty 

achievements are completely broken ive beaten several yet it dosent unlock i presume due to some bug related to several achievements being unlocked simultaneously so if you are an achievement hunter then this will be an extra hard task

the gameplay is really lacking at times especially since the graphics settings dosent allow you to zoom out and see your beautiful city from afar without the furthest away buildings fading away or getting buggy the buildings get repetitive after a while which should be expected but everything feels so scaled down in size like they didnt want to make the game xxl just m 

i dont recommend it if you cant play cities skylines and youre desperate for a city builder than this game might be for you might but it isnt anywhere near the fun you could have

#####

same game as the million other versions of cities xl priced as a full game still has the memory leak found in all the other versions as well

#####

i have been play this series for a long long time from the platium edition to this xxl however this game havnt change even a little bit since year 2012 so diappointing well guess we all need try the city skyline i dont wanna a refund or anything else from this game the only thing i want is hope more people can see my coment and trust do not try this game yes thats corret do not try this game

#####

the game feels runs looks precisely like its predecessors i was holding out hope that supporting multicore as promised as a feature would resolove its performance issues but after monitoring my cpu on pchardware monitor with my g510s it doesnt utilize multicores feeling somewhat scammed this will be the last time i purchase a cities product line and ive been a long fan of the series since the city life days

oh well learnt my lesson indeed theres always cities skylines to look forward to by the cities in motion developers which im sure will deliver

#####

hey look its the last game in the same series with a new name

if you can point me to anything thats changed and improved that wouldnt have fitted in a patch thatd be lovely also impossible

valve just refund every single person whos posted a negative review of this

#####

take advice from the hundreds of other negative reviews and dont purchase this game its literally the same game as cities xl rehashed for a third time with extra features this game should have been released as a free dlc and even if it had been most people would have been disappointed with its lack of adding anything there are serious programming issues which cause framerates to plummet throughout the entire time playing ive also experienced the game crashing every other time i attempt to run it city simulation isnt really that great either as the traffic feels fake buildings are just kind of there and the city really doesnt feel alive the only thing this game has going for it is that it does look decent at times

#####

get cities skylines instead

#####

long story short people write negative review for xxl is because it similar to xl

so to make poeple not to waste money on the same game i suggest something

 you can buy this game if you dont have xl just like me
 if you have xl you do not need to buy this

old player need to stopped negative review just becasue there nothing changes in xxl compared xl
do you ever though about the people who doesnt played xl 
most of the people buy game by looking at peoples review 

so if you do not have xl you can buy it

sorry for my english   peace xx

#####

as a city builder ats a great game but the ui and menus can be confusing i was on my way to building a big city but i had to get off so i go to save i press the menu button that says save and the save slots come up i figure ill just overwrite the first autosave so i click it and in my haste i click ok to what i thought was a confirm overwrite prompt but was actually an are you sure you want to start over from the begining prompt so the save menu and load menu are the same which is confusing and there is no overwrite function really without having to make two new saves and typing in the exact same name for each i had hours of work erased and even though the game autosaves when i accidentally restarted the game it erased those like whats the point of having an automatic save system if it just erases it when you make a mistake just bad system design and for that i have to give this game a thumbs down

#####

this game is just a rehash of cities xl and is not worth the money this is the exact same game and was not woth the money shame on the developers for outright ripping us off

#####

this game is no different to the last one except very slow and full of lag get cities skylines instead

#####

its the same as cities xl nothing new  the same tutorials same annoying guys advising on tutorials same roads same bridges same interface same bugs on main menu and game itself
its so bad that i prefer to play simcity can you believe that

#####

 not recommended if you already have cities xl 

people have every right to be pissed at this game because it says lots of things changed and improved after cities xl but it is not the case here though i have seen performance improvement in the game i have a task manager that shows cpu usage is like 50 and it was like 25 in the cities xl but this does not satisfy the people who already own cities xl

but here is why i recommend this game for newcomers if you have played city life 2008 this game is so similar to that one if you have played sim city 4 this game is easier and has a little bit different concept and understanding

if you are totaly new to city building i would chose this one over cities skylines this is not a hard game because there are easy and resourceful maps there are pain in the ass maps too cities are groving quickly but you still have to be careful while groving and keep the city in balance there are nice arcitechtural options like curved roads or filling up ares with plazas or parks you do not have to build square like cities so you can create an esthetic city building on mountains are easy and roads have option to be elevated you can go down to street level like google street view d visuals are amazing there is a photo mode soundtrack is cute i love listening them there are bridges and tunnels as well as trains and highways there is a summarized information about cities needs and surpluses interface seems little bit complicated at first but yu will get the hang of it soon

i have enjoyed playing this game and i will recommend it if you do not have the first game or if you are totaly new to city building genre

#####

 copy of a first game you can see that if you go to windowed mode you can see that game is called cities xl deffenitly not worth 15 save 12 more and buy cities skylines mutch better game than this copy pasted game

#####

its literally cities xl i dont think anything has changed

#####

first game i ever asked steam for a refund of

#####

this game has some promising features over competition however it fails to maximize the capability of them  the large tile zoning is excellent giant maps are excellent varity of buildings is pretty good multicore processors was a drastically needed change    citiesxxl has many draw backs one being that the game is very close to or  almost identical to cities xl

the game features broken promises from the developer such as being activenon existent at the moment adding free dlchasnt happened no developer support  bugs arent fixed at all either  what is also disappointing is the modding community is very small but the work theyve added is very good in terms of mods and assets  its just a shame that its all for nothing as the community is on life support

tldr  theres better options out there and at a cheaper price as well

#####

report this product

i decided to give this game a second chance now in late 2020 and it turned out to be much worse than i remembered

performance is horrible the game is extremely single threaded so performance dies when you try build something past a village regardless of how many threads you have with the amount of buildings on screen seemingly determining how laggy you will be performance probably wouldnt be too different on a single core cpu

the game itself is also clearly just a copy of cities xl with another x added to the name many game files are still called cities xl the game lacks simple things like pressing esc to open the menu button texts being all over the place and even with max graphics settings the draw distance for vehicles is so bad they vanish and appear out of thin air like this would still be simcity 4 which is a much better game from 12 years before this one

instead of getting this dumpster get cities skylines simcity 2013 or simcity 4

#####

if you got cities xl stick with it this is not worth 20 euros or the full price 

new skin for the ui thats seems to be all the new you get
old maps
old buildings
old everything

it plays exactly the same as xl what a scam

this is a ripoff and a easy quick buck for the developer nothing more nothing less you cant defend charging full price for something that should be released as a dlc for a maxium 10 euros there just isnt enough new contet to call this a sequel at all

#####

dont buy this garbage it is cities xl with a redesigned interface the old one is actually better they added some new songs still runs poorly it includes only a a couple new features and is honestly not with the purchase there is not enough content in this game to be callled a whole new game but rather just a quick patch for an older title really want my money back absolutely unimpressed and rather disgusted with this poorly prepare rip off

#####

if i had skipped the video intro and the title screen i would have thought i opened cities xl by mistake

i preordered early based on the promise of more powerful game engine and new interface as both were really lacking in xl  well theyre still lacking in xxl since as far as i can tell there isnt a difference

games like this is why there should be a refund option

#####

get cities skylines instead

h1introductionh1
well to start with i have played all cxl there is from the very first one to this  very last one and i will have to say that this is however worth the money for once i am actually impressed by the small things i have been annoyed by in earlier iterations of this franchise let me sumarize briefly what elements theyve improved and what is not changed about the game


h1improvementsh1
this is my list of things i have considered annoying for the past few games and the status of their current state

tdroadsnappingtd
tdodd or erronous roadsnapping makes laying roads difficult and is sometimes a tedious jobtd

tdfrom my perspective this is fixed i have tried to place roads on top of roads build tunnels under districts and placed bridges in places not possible in previous iterations it feels more natural now which is good enough for metd

tdtraffic jamtd
tdwhen building a block or a few streets and want to allow the citizens commute to work you end up with traffic jams all over the place and those real life scenarios wont work as expected forcing expressways where a normal avenue should have sufficedtd
tdfixed and fixedtd
tdat least it seems better now after making a few neighbourhoods as i normally would do the difference is clear from cxl and cxxl the traffic flow is just that much better and i can focus on infrastructure the way it should have been from the starttd

h1running issuesh1
while theyve improved plenty there are also many issues here some are even newly introduced and others are adopted from back in the previous versions 

ulong roads are laggyu
if you place long stretches of roads it becomes laggy when you lay new roads intersecting these roads it stutters a lot but is not unplayable they should fix this very soon

ubroadcastingu
broadcasting can introduce some lagg as well especially when you try to zone large districts

umany cities slow tradingu
if you a large amount of cities it can have a slight effect on the trade menu

ubsavegames disapearcrash the gamebu
i have already experienced savegame corruption and crashes from loading saves to avoid this do not use workshop yet and do not download the community pack yet there are issues which have deleted my savegames  or they just disapeard from the load menu and when i load preworkshopped saves the game just crashes this is a must solve as soon as possible

binewib 
ubinstabillities while playingbu
if experienced more instabillities the game is very laggy when deploying new metro systems or other routes for public transport once you lay more than 10 stations of metro and have a few lines running allready you will start get lags and other issues like problems to move about long waits while calculations are done

another point here is that it seems they have downtweaked the amount of people using the metro and bus systems making it harder to maintain traffic flow and forcing you to be really smart when planning ahead for a new metro system this can of course just be my imagination but i feel that i need to be more careful now than in previous games


ubomnicorpbu
omnicorp trading is just the same as before

binewib 
h1new content worth mentioningh1
its worth mentioning a few of the things new to this game in terms of content here are a few things ive come across so far

ubfarm ploppingbu
it looks to me as if they have tweaked the plopping of farming zones it is easier to make irregular shaped farms around corners and along the boundries of the areas where farms can be plopped

ubterrainbu
terrain responds better to changes done by development for example you will notice that laying out all types of zones in slopes and uneven terrain is easier and you experience less problems with road issues where roads cannot be constructed this is done by finding alternative paths for them in a more smooth way i like it this way makes more sense

ubmetro tubes disappears during gameplaybu

if you construct tubes with max amount of stations they will just disappear after a while leaving only the stations behind and potentionally crushing your infrastructure this has to be fixed at some stage very soon


h1conclusionh1
all in all the game is a fresh breeze of cold air on a hot summer day still there are a few issues here and there surely these will be fixed in later patches for this game and not for future complete rewrites of the engine

for the btldrb folks out there many of the problematic traffic population and polution issues are solved and i can confirm that it runs on all my cores and has so far not burned up all my memory at a stable 22gb ram id buy it  

i give the game a 810 in terms of its current state and 610 for the hefty price   considering the amount of money i have spent on previous broken titles owners of  two or more from the same title should have received 75 off of the price


i can warmly recommend this game for newbs to the cxl scene for you guys who own other games like this or is saving up for cities skyline have a look at the myriad of new gameplayvideos and decide for your self  id buy it

#####

cities xxl is a mostly ok game except that for 5 years now the developers have released bug fixes as 20  40 expansions or sequals this version adds almost nothing from what was promised in cities xl 2010 except that it is now finally playable

but seriously 20 for a slightly redesigned and no better interface plus fixing a major bug 5 years after release nope not worth it

#####

its cities xl with another x

meh

#####

no

#####

should have been a free update for xl

#####


11 year steam acount  first revew ever first time i ever regreted a 40 game steam pur sorry my mother told me not to speek ill of ppl and look on the briter side  

this game is really good at making me want to go pay sim city

#####

this is despite the many negative reviews actually a good citybuilding game it is easy enough to get started and has enough new buildings to last for a good while there is also mods on the workshop to make this game even better it also runs faster than citiesskylines and is also cheaper

the biggest problem is that this game is like many previous reviewers have stated just a patch for cities xl

verdict buy especially if you have an older computer dont buy any other cities games by this developer though

#####

if you own cities xl do not buy this game they are the same game with some minor ui changes 
this game is a scam

if you do not own cities xl you can buy this poorly optimized shit but i would recommend waiting for cities skyline releasing 10 march 2015

#####

 pros
great soundtrack
working classes are fun
moneyloans are not impossible

 cons
ui is horrible
saving is confusing
building roads is clunky

would i recommend
i would recommend for the 299 i paid wouldnt pay any higher

#####

not one patch since release is the exact same as cities xl with a minor ui update and x64 capabilities other than that nothing has changed at all

i cannot recommend this game what so ever it was clearly a blatant hit and run for cash like their last release and the one before that

#####

this game is obviously worse than cities skylines in most ways however there are still some things it does better than cities skylines
1 in cities skylines you have to use a mod to achieve street level 1st person view here simply zoom in all the way
2 in cities skylines farms are extremely tiny here you decide how much space farms and garbage dumps take up  the size constraints allow the farms to have vastly larger footprints than the average building unlike in cs where agriculture are the same size as all other zones
3 realistic speeds cartoonishly porportioned citizens aside cars and pedestrians in this game travel at slow realistic speeds unlike in cities skylines where every cim is usain bolt and cars accelerate with jerky movement and take corners at high speed
4 if you have an intersection with 2x1 lane roads in cxxl youll get traffic lights that let traffic through one side at a time this is not the most realistic but it beats watching cs cars clip through each other when the left turning vehicle is supposed to yield bump the lanes up to 2x2 however and youll start seeing cars in the left lane making right turns and vice versa  not cool
5 cxxl has a bit of humor factories can shut down because the boss was fleeing his ex wife 

again definitely dont buy this game if you want a city builder cs is still the way to go im however marking this as recommended because i dont want the things this game does right to be lost

#####

got this on sale for 2 to see if it was really as bad as the reviews say and i like city builders a lot  somehow i missed this franchise and never tried it probably because of the reviews at the time

not sure about the battle that occurred between developers and fans but i definitely see the fallout and aftermath from the battle lol  seems to be all over the fact that this version is very similar to cities xl platinum just with more dlcs that caused this massive war bad reviews and the franchise to die out  this game has no community no guides and no workshop items worth mentioning of and the devs moved on long ago  its just a bombed out battlefield left

well turns out this is one of the better citybuilders ive ever played though a bit clunky because of its age  ya the tutorial sucks too and the gui isnt that great the control menu is ridiculously simple but its functional not too annoying and the game easy to figure out once you tried the tutorial to see how everything works in the game  its a lot like all the others  it does have some good mechanics not in any other city builders  i like how you can create curved roads in tight terrain deal with traffic bus routes and place metro systems underground easily  you can create really organic and realistic looking cities  plus you start out with an entire planet with lots of locations to build huge cities and trade between them

theres much more content than simcity and anno series  over 1000 different buildings and this version is suppose to have all the dlcs from the previous versions  the 3d graphics in game are still very good in the game and you can go down to street level and move about which you cant do in most other city builders  i like it even better than cities skylines in some ways however it is very outdated in comparison  i havent encountered any bugs so far other than a few achievements not triggering  

so a great deal for a long lost  forgotten citybuilder for 2 

#####

i recommend this game if you dont already own cities xl platinum its a decent city builder sim with similarities to cities skyline and simcity but its also slightly different i personally like the other 2 i mentioned better but this one plays out a little different just like the other 2 are a little different from each other so its cool to switch it up now n then 

most all the negative reviews ive seen arent really fair to the game itself theyre all complaining how its the same as previous edition and that is mostly true but thats not what were reviewing here is it the review is supposed to be this game 

there is a website that has mods and such for this game too btweven though thats all kind of lacking in steam theres just not as much content from the community if you compare it with skylines ofc skylines seems to be the most popular as to its performance yes its supposed to run better than the previous edition however i run it without any problems on my pc but then im a bit tech saavy and know how to properly build  maintain pcs your mileage may vary

all in all its a decent city builder  simulator thats worth the priceespecially on sale id highly recommend getting it on salesince it does get a pretty decent price reduction when sales happen

#####

no just no play sim city or skylines way better

#####

i wanted to make a list with all points why you should not buy this game but thought it would be pointless since its pretty obvious that this game is not recommendable at all

seriously get cities skylines if you want a good and realistic city building game

#####

i think i was just sold the exact same game two times there is literally nothing different except the ui i love the game but i was expecting a bit more from the new version

#####

a 10 year old game rerererereleased from a 20 year old game that is so badly optimized it stutters on the beefiest hardware dont buy

#####

i brought this game before it came out since i had 50 off for owning cities xl i got my money back three days later

this game is a complete and utter rip off it is exactly the same as the previous game the only difference being that it has a different couloured ui and the shapes of the ui are squared rather than rounded

i also didnt notice any performance increase the game was laggy and glitchy for me moreos than the prior one

get cities skylines instead or even simcity 2013

#####

h1important  only recommended if this is your first cities xl titleh1
bthis part of the review is only for players new to the franchiseb  if you do already have a cities xl game  skip to the second section below  or tldr  its a ripoff patch for a game you already own

so if you dont already own a cities xl game then this game offers a lot of fun and creativity and is arguably the best citycreator on the pc scene at the time of writing  unless a new offering improves on the genre then this is the title you want even though its not perfect

bprosb
o you can zone areas and let the game choose properties
o you can select property designs and styles yourself instead of zoning with the community made mod in workshop
o the maps are huge and varied
o granular choice of industry you choose types of industry farming and commerce
o there is a rudimentary trading system
o a blueprint system as now used by simcity 2013 for advanced developments
o very modfriendly with thousands of compatible mods for the cities xl franchise
o full cheat system so you can choose the constraints with which to play

bconsb
o no dynamic population unlike simcity  no births deaths people who move in or out at will
o no fires crime or disasters
o little choice of mass transit nothing has been implemented properly since xl days
o a buggy interface 

boverall score 7510b


h1not recommended if you are upgrading from an earlier cities xl titleh1
if you had performance issues with prior cities xl titles then this upgrade might be for you  otherwise there is very little new on offer for platinum owners and xl owners are justifiably angry about being charged for what amounts to be a performance patch hence the swamp of negative reviews  even with my nice hat on i think fhi should only have charged a minordlc amount not advertised it as an allnew game  

so what do you get  there is a new sky feature where you can select a predesigned sky effect  this is static doesnt bring any weather effects but does add a prettier ambience to your cities  right now there are around 6 to choose from not many but new versions have started to appear in the steam workshop

all the primary buildings are exactly the same as before  there are something like 8 new buildings added by this new version green buildings for the climatefriendly builders and a small number of additional maps but no other content  the advertised multiple international and period architectural styles are purely a category list which sorts the existing buildings nothing extra

lighting appears to be a little improved but old bugs remain tree bugs box vehicles etc  the good news is that the mods that fixed these problems in the other games work here too  but thats not really surprising because the game is essentially the same as before  the majority of custom content  mods from xlnations and other sites are compatible but i recommend you try a tiny few at a time because quite a few wont work at all 

in short unless you experienced terrible performance in platinumxl this is a greatly overpriced superfluous upgrade that you probably dont need  wait until its around 5 or so then buy it for the prettier sky  but thats all 

boverall score 210b

#####

do not buy this game the game is the exact identical failure since 2011

sigh 

#####

bogus new engine and bogus performance increase
this game runs exactly like its predecessors meaning all around horrible performance

on top of that i could not get a refund because after less than an hour of disappointment i had closed the game went to bed woke up and discovered the game had been running as a background process

positives looks better than its predecessors

negatives everything else

#####

i cant believe i preordered this junk

after starting it up and playing for about 20 minutes i realizedhey i already own this game its called cities xl and has been in my library this entire time

the differences between this and xl
 the ui is a different color
 the music is different

stuff thats the same
 literally everything thats not mentioned in the differences section
 it even crashed on me after my 20 minutes just the same as the other one

what a ripoff never again will i buy a game from this company i recommend you do the same and steer clear

#####

this game sucks  you save your city and than go back in it saved all the money and people but not the layout  i lost days worth of work and now immediately the city is in crisis because the numbers dont match the layout  the game is nowhere near cities skyline and not even any fun to play  was a total waste of money

#####

yes yes we all know skylines its quite the duh moment in all these reviews yes i have  it yes i like it yes its a lot better but theres not a huge selection of these type of games with similar graphics and everyone needs something new once in a while yes this has its flaws and can be irritating to some on some machines its not that bad not as bad as the reviews make it it could have another duh moment been or be a lot better not much out there that couldnt be polished more these days ive had no tech issues so far graphics are ok interesting enough to play around in and certainly not a bad buy on sale

#####

as a game in its own right apart from its predecessor cities xxl is very enjoyable and i have played many hours and built several cities to 25 million

cxxl does not have the tools to build complicated highway and road interchanges that other city sims do but the trading resources system adds a depth of play i havent found elsewhere 

really fun game dont let the other reviews scare you away from a good time building cities

#####

this is a scam its basically the same game as cities xl shame on the devs for pulling this

even the taskbar icon says ciites xl will never buy another game from this company

#####

this has become one of the most dissapointing franchises i have played

i absoloutely love the idea of this game and the gameplay what i hate is the pss poor effort that has gone into development year after year
ive purchased these games every year with hope that they just fix the performance issues but every year they fail to do so

do yourself a favour and stick with cities platinum and just mod that version xxl does not add anything new of value

#####

this is cities xl with engine improvements ie lag is minimized  there are some new buildings and new background tunes but thats all  i was expecting a new game with new maps and buildings  didnt happen  although i like the game i felt ripped off by this release

#####

1010 amazing nostalgia it feels exactly like playing the old games

maybe a little too much nostalgia

#####

its basically cities xl with minor updates 
less crash multicore support black interface new buildings and minor updated animations thats it
if youre new to this city building i would recommend you to buy this as opposed of cities xl
if you owned cities xl this might dissapoint you but if you really wanted to play a city builders with less problems then you can get this
to me its a dissapointing product because of small update features this should be a patch not a new game or a dlc at least 
this is like an overpriced dlcpatch

#####

dont even think about buying it

its almost the same as cities xl also overpriced just look at the rating the workshop is a joke because for most mods youll  need other mods you cant get from the workshop

buy cities skylines instead youll get an amazing city building game with tons of features and a huge community

#####

bswift responseb

the initial response to the latest instalment of this huge city building game from focus interactive has been somewhat negative to say the least certainly on steam you cant move for cries of rip off and the now days inevitable  do not buy this game threads

there is an element of validity to some of the criticism levelled at the title but it needs to be taken in perspective more on that later


btailor madeb

so for the uninitiated cities xxl is a city building game on a huge scale
think sim city on steroids and youll be on the right track

in the equally criticised at launch title sim city you were presented with a region in which you could choose a plot of land to found your city or cities in cities xxl you are presented with a whole world to choose from

when you load up the game you have a spinning globe in front of you with a multitude of vacant spots scattered across the continents any of which you can select to build on
each spot has its own levels of raw resources water arable land oil etc and its own topography

you could pick an ocean side setting and build your own tourist capital gleaming with glamorous hotels and a bustling centre of entertainment
you could choose an inland arable paradise with rolling farmland nothing to break the sky line apart from the occasional silo stack you decide to drop down

from an industrial smog filled manufacturing powerhouse to an elitist country club dwelling hamlet of snobbery you are not limited at all in what you can create

bblank spaceb

one of the noticeable differences which sets this title apart from its peers are the map sizes
there are no sim city postage stamp sized maps here no matter which location you choose to build on the maps will be huge
youre going to have space to plan out your city however you want with multiple industrial commercial and residential areas and still have room left for some pretty countryside

bwonderlandb

if youve played a city builder before youre going to be on familiar ground here
you can choose between industrial commercial and residential zones and their placement in relation to each other is key to keeping everyone happy

a nice aspect is the ability to choose the population density of each zone high density for any potential sky scrapers medium density for multistory buildings and low density for one or two stories

you can also place special themed buildings beach huts snowy log cabins etc which all help add flavour to the game
there are your usual requirements of water and electricity needs to be met through various power station types and water extraction facilities

there is also the really nice touch of being able to add parkland or plazas to fill in any gaps between your buildings and roads this works like the fill brush in paint click and it paint trees or slabs across the required area to fill in any gaps
i cant state enough how much this fairly simple mechanic enhances the look of your city

bhighway dont careb

cities xxl has a plethora of different road types to choose from from small dirt tracks through various sized avenues expressways all the way up to highways i havent encountered as many varied road types in any other game in the genre and it really does add something to the city creation experience

bi wish you wouldb

what citiesxxl doesnt have is a rail network and it is sorely missed
why theyve never chosen to incorporate train tracks and stations into the game i dont know maybe theyve felt they had transport covered with all the different road types but as great as the road choice is i would have liked the option to have a train or two chugging around my metropolis

bshake it offb

another thing thats missing from cities xxl that are the disasters no tornados no alien invasion to level your creation not even an earthquake to shake your metropolis to ground when youre board or frustrated with it

bi knew you were troubleb

as i said at the start of this review theres a lot of anger out there on the interweb at the time or writing some of which is trolling but some is justified 

cities xl as a franchise has been around for a while now it has seen several updated releases over the years and this is where most of the anger comes from

each new release of the game cities xl cities xl platinum cities xxl etc are all essentially the same game

they look exactly the same and they play the same but with a few additional buildings added in to try and justify the new release and whilst focus often discount the new version for previous owners they still charge around the 15 20 mark for what is essentially the previous release with a small content pack added understandably this upsets people

there has also been a lot of talk about optimisation and the lack of multi core support in previous titles the game tended to be more than a little laggy once your city grew to a respectable size

theres a new game engine this time around and it does seem to run a little smoother for me than it has in previous versions however i also have a much more powerful system now than i had when i played the previous version of the game which might have just as much to do with the performance improvement than any engine optimising that has gone on behind the scenes


bnever played a cities xl title beforeb


bplayers gonna playb

viewed as a standalone title and assuming you do not own any of the previous cities xl titles then this is game well worth the entry fee
there is a vast amount of city building fun to be had here huge maps huge numbers of varied building types a nice selection of roads to watch get clogged up with traffic and its pretty good looking too

if youre looking for a competent city builder that isnt sim city or skylines then you should ignore the negativity surrounding this game and take the plunge
youre very own metropolis awaits

breccomendedb


bown a previous cities xl titleb


bhaters gonna hateb

viewed as the next release in the series cities xxl does not do nearly enough to justify its price point if youve played the previous titles youve essentially already played this game and if you have any expectation of improved graphics not that the graphics arent great anyway though or improved game play you are going to be very disappointed

there just isnt enough new content here to warrant a purchase unless youre a huge fan of the franchise and really cant live without that extra x in the title

keep building in platinum my friends theres nothing new for you to see here

cities xxl is a game that offers a fantastic citybuilding experience at an affordable price compared to its predecessor cities xl cities xxl provides players with more features improved graphics and a smoother gameplay experience

#####

ive been sceptical about it from the very announcement of preorder but i still wanted to give it a chance i believed they might finally do something about it after all these years and they did  it up completely

  first the rendering engine has gone haywire torturing my video card for 120 fps on region selection screen the fan went crazy and theres no vsync option so i cant help it  ingame its flickering terribly random roads and buildings disappearing on zooming out
  new ui okay maybe old one did need some facelift but it wasnt that bad to replace it with this buggy hell some buttons require some searching for a spot that would register the click hell it looks like exactly same ui that was in previous games only repainted black added transparency and rounded buttons replaced with plain rectangles


i cant say much about other features as i cant really play it because of the flickering and tearing come on give us vsync it hurts my eyes but based on the promises of added features it isnt that much different from 2013 platinum
right now it needs some patching up to become playable if that happens which we dont know fhi never communicate it might be recommendable to people who havent played any cities xl games

but right now youd be better off with cities xl 2013 or better yet simcity 4 is your friend

upd or even better yet  get cities skylines this review was written before it came out

#####

despite what many different people may say about this game it is not a real bad game by any means while i would not recommend it to someone who has the cities xl game it is a decent game that provides an interesting challenge for the player and does have plenty of good concepts within the game i recommend it if you are interested in trying something new

#####

i like the gamebut it has some annoying quirksnot the least of which is the autosave feature if you load a saved game and screw up you cant go back and reload the saved game because as soon as you exit the game screen it saves itscrewup and all and if youve been playing for 2 hours the last thing you want to do is start over from scratch
as i said i like the gamebut skylines is better

#####

game freezes button clicks do not register unless alttabbed turned vsync off and quit and game no longer loads

#####

still no fix for the cpumemory issues which where already in cities xxl basicly the same game as cities xl but with an extra x

#####

uninstall works fine
 very quick
 no complications

#####

do not buy unless youve not already got xl 

shame  anticipated game pretty much exactly the same as its predecessor the exe is even still called cities xl not xxl why was this not a patch and how do i get my money back

#####

its really not a bad game but its still a thumbs down as its pretty much identical to the previous version cities xl  
its more than a little annoying to pay for a game i already had when i was expecting it to have been an upgrade

#####

broken game buy cities skylines instead at least it works

#####

what they did with this game

copy cities xl
paste cities xl
optimize cities xl
add more bugs  heavy industry is bugged like hell to cities xl
enlarge some maps from cities xl
repaint the existing awful cties xl ui
make people believe this is going to be a new gaming experience
release the game as cities xxl

do not buy this game
i cant believe that i fell for this trap myself

#####

bought this game when it was on sale cheap it the exact same game as all previous cities xl

#####

cities xl  steam achievements  workshop content  new bugs  lags  multiplayer  cities xxl

its exactly the same content as in the xl version  after 3 years they just offering the same game with a new titel and a new price  



#####

its cities xl i had thought this was a new game  its the exact same game as its predecessor the extras are either on par with dlc or are insignificant do not waste your money if you already own cities xl

#####

i love this game tbh i know there is alot of negativ reviews
but i liked the gamleplay from cities xl platinium and i can spend hours in this game
the sad part is that the workshop items sometimes makes my game crash  but it has only been recently
its almost simular to the cities xl platinium but there is a few upgrades and the game feels more smooth 
i like this game 

#####

this is a perfectly good citybuilding simulator this game was reviewbombed for being too similar to previous entries on its own merits however this game is an excellent purchase for citybuilding and citymanagement fans akin to what we wanted simcity to become and where many citybuilders failed in the late 2000s the game leaves a lot of room to get creative with its features in downtime especially if you dont own a citybuilder already or havent invested in any in the last decade 

the video games industry is constantly using old ideas and repackaging popular concepts and then pushing price points back up to aaa levels of gamepricing and even this series itself is guilty of this but now cities xxl has been overtaken by cities skylines in popularity sometimes yes the higher fidelity graphics of newer titles are a bonus of course 

i am very happy that i have added this game however this being the xxl version of the cities franchise means that it basically included the cumulative works of the series and therefore incorporates the most of the features seen across the series you dont have to also buy the rest of the game with dlc and stuff this was when games were still complete on launch on sale this game can be about the price of an hours work for many people where many aaa titles cost a fifth of a months salary we dont always want to spend a fifth of a months salary on every type of game in existence and this is why this represented such good value for me 

there were plans for a sprawling sharedworld multiplayer experience in this game which in my opinion never needed to be scrapped but that is the way the market goes of course and they will blame this on the evolution of the industry and of course gamers moving on to other things over time which is a function of making the economy of the videogame world move forward all tied in with the procedural release of new hardware and technologies 

but if it was never scrapped there could have been a mighty persistent world built by users that was still actively being built across the community in many ways i see templates of what could have worked well in metaverse concepts here besides the garbage they are trying to sell us on its a topic for another day to store a completed city in a persistent world is an interesting concept

tldr 1010 for being a great value at a great price citybuilding experience

#####

the game is not bad but its not good ether sadly i have to agree with clint from the youtube channel lgr this shoukd of been a performance patch that would of been done for free for previous versions of cities xl including 2011 2012 and platinum
do i recommend it well no i wish i can but i cant even with the steam workshop support even when it was originally 3999 you are still wasting your cash on a performance patch thaf shpuld of been free with platinum think twice befoee you buy if you want to play a city building game just play simcity 4 cities skylines or city life 2008 edition any of them will work even simcity 2013 will be fine play anything else than this patch

#####

ok so i know that most people hate this game i rarely write reviews but i felt a need to defend this one this is actually a very cool and ambitious game it may not be perfect but its not nearly as bad as everyone seems to think it is im a big fan of city builders and i grew up playing the original simcity games which turned into a big crap by 2013 i personally still put cities skylines above it but there are a few things about cities xxl that stand out for me one of them being the map size you get without any need for mods i also adore the world map system its just way cool the economic system is also very unique and fun i owned this game back in the day when it first came out but i bought it again on steam because for 3 bucks its a damn steal

#####

i read all the bad reviews about cities xxl but i went ahead and spent the 3 sale price for the game anyway  i have not found anything wrong with it  if you like city building video games and you like to spend 3 on them then get cities xxl  its fun

#####

edit get citiesskylines and ignore this game

ive been rather happy with citiesxl during the duration of its tenure the first iteration in 2009 felt like it was made with a lot of love it had with its release the promise for a bright future since the demise of the original developer focus has had the tendency to ride it like a cash cow it has neglected the franchise like an abusive parent witholding affection from its secretly adopted middle child 

citiesxxl is the latest annual crayon drawing posted on the refrigerator from the intern at focus its release was preceded by an intentionally anemic campaign consisting of decent stills and an admittedly welldone video of the city they made for their marketing coordinator thinking about it now it probably took that intern longer to build that city than the entire update to the poor shattered dreams of monte cristos original code 

its been made clear why the publisher was so quiet leading up to its release as the expressed promise of a new game would have been somewhat misleading citiesxxl is sort of a new game

but its more of an update 

i wouldnt call it a patch because that would imply a fix my experience so far has been that it runs a bit slower than xl platinum it uses the same maps and the same textures on some buildings which clearly spell citiesxl ironically this seems to be the only thing spelled correctly the updated metroesque menus are poorly qcd and have flagrant visual bugs on the surface it feels like im beta testing

while i would love to be completely on one side of the black and white vitriol i find in the forums i find myself kind of liking this update the flaws havent so far been gamebreaking and i really like the steam integration mods are now incredibly simple to install and they have improved my experience there is greater control of the camera an updated soundtrack and an expert mode which is a wonderful addition  i still dont like the classism that plagues the heart of the series but i understand how it works and expert mode helps dull that edge quite a bit

attention to some of these details but not others has left me confused why are the controls so strange i know its european but i would love to use wasd instead of arrow keys and edge tripping why cant i edit these controls why cant i edit mouse sensitivity i should be able to upgrade roads in place especially when i meticulously curved that one to fit that ridge ugh

this isnt a bad game yes it is an obvious cashgrab that should have been an update or dlc yes focus is deceitful and disgraceful it is however an update to a pretty fun game casual citiesxl platinum gamers will be disappointed this would likely be worth the purchase for avid players and new players who just cant wait for citiesskylines

#####

q is this a copy of the previous games 
a i dont know i never played them
q is city skylines better
a yes it is
but for people with a slow computerlaptop who are tired of waiting 10 minutes for city skylines to load and even then have huge frame drops this is the game to get
its quite a solid city builder game and the fact wheter it is or isnt a copy of a previous game with a few more maps only affects people who have bought the previous version of the game

i just bought it today and only played for about 3 hours yet i can see myself playing this for quite some time at least untill i have saved up enough money to buy a new pc and play city skylines again


#####

for starters if you own cities xl 2012 then you may find this game a bit expensive compared to what you will be gaining for the upgrade it runs smoother than previous versions and does not sufer from the horrible memory leaks found in prior titles i find the new ui to be a step in the wronge direction much of the text is hard to read because the colors are so close black text on a grey background for example it does take up slightly less screen space so those with smaller monitors may find that a plus 

as far as what is new 
  the new freight airport is a nice addition
  also found in the marinas is a few new leisure options to make the waterways more usefull
  in the view panel you have the option to set a different background option and is nice for screenshots
  some of the roadways are available from the start without turning on expert mode this helps early game traffic managment and city planning

the main reason i recomend this title is for the people who have not played this title before and are looking for alternatives to games like simcity this title has the feel of simcity 4 but with greatly improved graphics and trade options done on very large maps it does however have its own bugs and oddities though most are just anoying in this version and not game breaking the steam workshop support allows for easy mod access if you are new to the series watch some youtube videos and tutorials first as mentioned before cities xl 2012 videos are still valid with only minor changes this game is not like other city building games and you will want to get used to the diferences

#####

very few additions in this new version and  cities skylines exists

#####

the entire game mechanics are broken counterintuitive uncomfortable and very poor in content like the number of buildings

#####

ive played all the simcity games and own cities skylines which is great cities xxl on the other hand is pretty terrible it isnt a completed game theyre selling it seems like the developers got half way through and decided to call it quits and put the product out and do no further updates it is playable and couldve had lots of potential as there are some coolunique prebuilt structures like hotels and others that you can build but most of the game is absolute bare bones and has very little aside from absolute basics

there are issues like having different looking buildings in the drop down lists but when you place them theyre the exact same buildings you cant really edit terrain in game you can raiselower terrain but not fill in water or add water at all theyve built a map editor after the fact which to their credit is now freeas it should be part of the base game but as far as im aware that is only for editing maps prior to starting a map

also lots of features that other simcity type games have this doesnt again the stats you can access about your city seem like theyre a first draftnot a completed product very limited if there at all it even goes down to basics like no ability to set hotkeys for things like zoom in  outat least not that ive been able to find all in all i wish i could take like two cool things from cities xxl and add them to cities skylines  it would be much better everything else is a significant downgrade from other simcity type builder games ive played a lot of my complaints may be fixableimprovable with mods but as far as the base game goes i definitely wouldnt recommend it stick to skylines

#####

same as xl tbh 

#####

cant quite work out what the differences are between cities xl and xxl the games look and play exacty the same even down to the porly designed tutorials same graphics same boring music same clunky user interface there is still no scaling on the tool text which makes it difficuilt to read any of the tool descriptions at 1680x1050 resolution dont bother buying this game if you already own cities xl its a waste of money

#####

this is the exact same game as cities xl  perhaps the only difference may be the use of multiple processors as xl only used one  wont know unless i play this as much as xl  very disappointed

#####

so this is the same game as cities xl released 2009 but a working version this time i got ripped off so bad by this company wtf 

people do not buy this crap

#####

the game is as the french say is comme ce comme ca or so so cities xxl has little to no difference from the cities xl series and for the game to run at top speed with best graphics you would need easily a 2000 to 3000 dollar custom computer but in comparison to other city builders it has a charm that makes it somewhat realistic with games like simcity 2013 it moves too fast and your done too quick i find myself with a town in such games within 20 minutes and a fully fledged metropolis within 2 hrs cities xxl seems to break that making me take several days of planning and placing to build my city and it feels more rewarding after ive greenifyied all my factories and set up my needs for my citizens though overall the game is more focus entertainment trying to use the defribulator one last time on the series but in vain unfourtunitly

#####

im out of touch and dont have a clue but im having fun and making bank just like every good mayor or politician 


#####

sigh i dont know why i preorder games

#####

 ripoff   ripoff   ripoff 

omg  its the same game as cites xl platinum which is the same game as cities xl etc  this is  ripoff

i expected a new improved game this isnt  oh they made a few tweaks and changed a few of the text and titles this should have been delivered as a free update

changing a few titles and strings does not a new game make

i dont recommend this game  even if you have evern had it before  why reward a company for ripping people off



#####

upon installing the game and launching it i have these observations 
1 initial game launch  asks for admin access red flag 
2 crashes upon launch
3 second launch loads again asks for admin access 
4 spelling error upon initial load screen loose instead of lose 

i dont have high expectations for this game

edit
upon further playing it seems to be almost verbatim cities xl platinum but worse

another edit
apparently nozac doesnt work in this version definitely skip this and go with xl platinum instead

#####

so disappointing  all the same bugs from cities xl are still there  road placement issues achievement banners saying youve unlocked things that you actually havent bridge and tunnel construction issues  all the same unpolished ui  gameplay is virtually unchanged

waste of 20 when i could have just loaded up cities xl again

#####

more of the same go buy cities skylines

#####

its not a new game its cities xl with some changes not worth the cash

#####

pretty much the same game as cities xl why oh why didnt i listen to everyone

#####

it crashes like crazy not worth it

#####

not even the close game button works

#####

writing reviews is not my thing but this game has pissed me off to the point where i have to tell someone how much it fucking sucks  these dipshits repackaged the same fucking game from three years ago with a few additions that are hardly even noticable  its still the same jittery screen bullshit everytime you zoom out or try and place bus routes everything goes to shit when you population is 15 million and placing leisure building still does jack shit  ive put my time in with cities xxl enough to say fuck this game and fuck the people that made it sorry for swearing

#####

abandonware  this is 70 of a great game and the lack of that last 30 will enrage you even if you only paid 2 dollars for it  this has the core of an amazing game in it and it was mismanaged tragically during a long drought of these types of games  today check out workers and resources soviet republic for an amazing city building sim  of course since this came out theres been cities skylines so there really is no earthly reason to spend money on this game

#####

really  i feel like im playing cities xl and when i say cities xl i mean all other version of cities xl  let me just put it this way  the only thing that changed was the fancy logo  a complete joke go buy cities skylines

#####

dont do it please just dont do it just go get cities skylines if you need a city builder actually building a sand castle would be a much better use of time

#####

way too many bugs to make it playable and customer support seems to be limited  unless they clean this up id recommend people look at other city sim games

#####

focus foc you

some nice music in the main menu  it needs some lyrics though

suggestion

we cant believe you really fell for it
buying into this pile of shit
it only took us 3 long years
to find out how to change the color
now feast your eyes on our latest scam
well take your cash and then fuck your mother

#####

if you own an earlier iteration of the cities franchise xxl doesnt add much apparently

some underthehood improvements and some new buildings  but it isnt a new game

this broke my expectation and disappointed me  but the game itself standing alone is good and worth playing

so write a negative review or a positive one 

since there are already all of these distorted hatetsunami reviews out there i thought id better give a positive review its a good game with negative commentary they bolloxed up the marketing almost to the point of selfmutilation

in short

cities xxl is a good game
if you already own cities xl platinum youre paying for some performance improvements ui change and not sure of number 50 new buildings

#####

so i bought this game about say 3 days ago id tell you how it plays if it would stop crashing after 510 mins  cities skyline is a much better game

#####

do not buy

i want my money back

its just change logo to cities xxl  but this game is cities xl

#####

wow its the same fucking game as xl platinum theres absolutely nothing different  how the fuck does a company get away with this legally i dun understand even the tutorial is exactly the same theres even that front end menu bug when you ok your options seriously mein this is fucked

#####

this could be a good game if not for the bugs and for being the same game as cities xl and others those games hadhave severe memory management problems and they have not fixed any of them over the years unplayable with 16gb ram or less

#####

i have no idea why i didnt check the reviews before playing the game just no

#####

this is the same game as cities xl with a couple updates that should have come out as patches  i do not recommend this if you have the prior games  if you are new to cities this is a better buy than the old games  that being said it was branded and priced to be new and simply isnt

#####

i use it to design my dream city


#####

dont buy this game its no different than its previous products and its a major performance hog i recommend reading more reviews and perhaps take a look at cities skylines instead

#####

do not waste your money this game is horrible they make the maps huge yaaa but then make the over all game play require you to basically micro the entire city also the controls are nothing short of a pain in the butt seriously could they have at least tried sim city to understand how to set up controls to move around a city

do not buy this i did and wish i could refund it was soooo bad

#####

please not make my mistake dont buy this piece of crap they just recycle the same garbage over and over again cities skylines is better

#####

edit definitely get cities skylines instead of this skylines is 100 times better and even has water physics and everything however if you insist on getting a cities xl game then xxl is the one to get

coming from cities xl 2012 to this gameplay wise its almost exactly the same game
its got the same ui just recoloured from blue to black although it does look a little more tidy
resources are still all the same as well as all the categories of buildings such as heavy industry

i have noticed a few new features and buildings in the game such as being able to edit how many plots the game places in the square building zones when building and choosing if the game places plots on one side or both sides of the road with the linear zoning tool new buildings include things like the pollution sensors and electric car dealership just to name a few 
now whether these new features and buildings were in cities xl platinum i have no idea i never played platinum or have seen any gameplay of it

the graphics look slightly better in this than cities xl 2012 but its really not by much im not sure if its me but the colours look a bit more vibrant in xxl though

performance is much better in this than xl 2012 focus interactive have finally figured out that multicore computers are a real thing in cities xl 2012 there would be a noticeable drop in performance once your city hit around 50k population and would gradually get even worse as the population grew in cities xxl however i have a city with 600k people and although there is a bit of a loss in perfomance it is no way near as bad as xl 2012 and still perfectly playable

for a new player to the cities xlxxl this game would probably be an 8510 for a player who has owned previous cities xl games its a 510 at best
so basically if youre new to the cities xlxxl franchise get this
if youve owned previous cities xl games and are willing to pay for some really minor new features and multicore support then get this but maybe wait for a sale
if the performance of previous cities xl games doesnt bother you then dont get this

im gonna vote yes to this game simply because of the fact that you can now build massive cities and still get a playable frame rate which in previous titles was almost impossible

tldr 
the performance is a lot better the are some very minor new features other than that its pretty much the same as previous cities xl games

#####

get cities skylines

#####

crap same game as the cities xl should be sold as a dlc or a patch for about 199 focus are ripping people off do not buy this game steam should withdraw it from sale it is not a new game as was advertised steam should refund everybody who wants there money back

#####

i really tried very hard to have great patience and understanding to accept this games release

lets just say that didnt last long word of advice uninstall both simcity and cities xxl and get yourself a copy of cities skylines youll be doing yourself a nice favor a breath of fresh air when it comes to city building simulation 

you cannot miss this opportunity they have succeeded where others and even the oncemaster of this fantastic genre have failed

#####

if you played cities xl dont wast your money on this no different

#####

sadly this game is much like its predecessor cities xl platinum  it does have a slightly different looking interface additional buildings and some minor improvements over the previous title however the main bugs still persist
incorrect achievements
strange road connections and irritating snapping
and most frustrating of all same performance problems 
how can they say it has a revamped engine when i still get choppy framerates when population is high when creating stretches of road or even when laying down zones  even zooming in and out causes the game to lag or like what just happened before this review crash
great job focus home i will never purchase a cities title from you again and i would definitely tell newcomers to just wait for cities skylines or until this game goes way down in price  veterans dont buy this game unless you are a hardcore fan  i love the concept of this game but the execution is frustratingly poor

#####

adds a halfbaked windows 8style ui theme on top of the previous game  otherwise 99 the same

do not buy total ripoff

#####

i enjoy building cities so this is fun but what is missing is the why

after building the city for a few days i ran out of reasons to build things i kept thinking i needed to expand the city to make it bigger but why at some point i couldnt remember why i was playing it there was no objective eventually i lost interest and stopped playing

#####

i am actually upset at how hyped i was for this game i have wanted a good city builder since simcity 4 the new simcity was good but the cities were too small when i heard about this game i was honestly really excited i preordered it i downloaded it the night it came out

unfortunately this game is just not fun it is unpolished frustrating and nowhere near enjoyable

believe me i have tried my roommate and i researched the best ways to build the cities what key points to look out for we have made multiple cities not once not even once was i ever as interested in it as i was simcity which is disappointing because i found simcity to have a lot of shortcomings 

the way the ui works is terrible upgrading roads is horrid the game is not intuitive 

i am waiting on cities skyline in hopes i wont want to shoot myself after 30 minutes of gameplay

#####

refurbished cities xl barely
performance is meh multicore support nonexistant
if youre new to the cities series and like city builders it might be worth the time if you get it from a sale

#####

so i had to wait 2 days after release to play since unlike the developer i have to work to make money patiently and with some excitement i wait for this ruse to downloadinstalletc once done i proceed to launch what i thought was a new game only to find myself puzzled moments later wait a second i think did i just load cities xl nope it turns out i loaded the right game it just has the same everything only slightly tweaked  did i really read the sale correct did i really just get suckered out of 20 for a patch wtf it turns out im not alone this developer has either taken us to be fools or has suffered some form of traumatic head trauma so buyer beware this is a classic used car salesman stich you know used car for sale belonged to a sweet older lady only driven to church on sundaysblahblahblahsuckers this developer should be ashamed

from title
 bigger and better than ever before with a more powerful game engine and new interface become the mayor of your very own sprawling metropolis

translation
so we slightly made a few tweaks here and there that we feel are ground breaking btw you know steve in development yea its sad his house caught on fire and burnt to the ground the other day then his wife ran off with one of the firemen and if that wasnt enough his car wouldnt start this morning he tried to push start it ended up rolling the car over his sleeping dog poor little guy never saw it coming  soo needless to say umm yea he kinda sorta um well he didnt make to the release with the game content so we released a repackaged version of the last game our bad it was totally for your enjoyment oh we also changed a few colors and added a useless interface here and there
to the developer gee thanks guy im really glad i could pay you 2000 for the same game i bought years ago you really should hold onto your marketing team though they managed to polish the hell out of this turd 
i have 2 favors to ask of you 
1	get the game data from steve tell him were sorry for his loss and give us the new game we all paid for
2	since i doubt the above will happen in the next cities game please include an empty jar of vaseline in the games title menu this way we will know were about to be royally f#ked
 
steam 
i know this may not be a burning priority and probably wont set off any warning bells it should but in the best interest of your customers i feel that this developers actions warrant a major review i mean come on i could see this being delivered in its current state as a work in progress had it been billed as an alphabeta but taking a several year old game and polishing it ever so slightly does not make it a new game we your customers were taken for yet another ride something has to give at some point someone there needs to stand up grow a pair and say this isnt right not every game is going to be a winner its to be expected but this this is unacceptable at least i can still somewhat respect for trying the developers  who take the money and run 


#####

ive had cities xl the first 3 games i thought the first one was cool with multiplayer but then the servers went offline
comparing the new one to the old one is that its nearly exactly the same

#####

this is essentially cities xl with multicore support 
multicore support is important for playing with large cities and a large amount of interactions
there is no reason to play cities xl after you upgrade to cities xxl everything else is the same

#####

poor game play average graphics and laying roads is a real pain get cities skylines or sim city 4 instead as these are much better 310

#####

do not buy this game  this is daylight robbery

the game runs poorly on my 2700k  7970 build the ui looks worse than most games found in early access they have offered a 50 discount to cities xl owners out of guilt not a reward for loyalty

very disappointed in steam for not taking action

#####

if you havent played it its a really good game ive never played any of them so this is my first time playing and ill be honest i like it and think its a good game yeah it takes time to get used to the controls and ui isnt the best but its a pretty fun game its worth every penny i gave for it

#####

its the same fucking cities xl for gods sake do they really plan on selling us one game over and over again

#####

pretty much the same game as the previous one

the only thing this game has that is better then sim city is map size

the cities feel dead

wait for cities skylines to release

#####

this isnt just a city builder its a country builder the world map has hundreds of city sites you can build on and each city can interact and trade with others each city you build stays there and you can use its surplus resources to develop other cities or contribute to megaprojects

the economy is balanced in such a way that although you could build a selfsufficient city it is more productive to specialize  in some group of industries and trade so you end up making rural agricultural towns polluted industrial centers busy office hubs beautiful tourist spots etc each place has a character and a reason for being

trade between your own cities is completely up to you without any buy or sell prices you could send electricity from a more successful city to a struggling one for free or also choose to send something else in return for more conventional trade theres the offworld megacorporation which you can buy and sell resources from the prices arent very well thought out there its obvious the devs ran out of time but the result of that isnt too bad it just means many things are not profitable to sell and many things are not worth buying which is somewhat reasonable even if it sometimes feels awkward what do you mean i have plenty of oil but exporting it actually loses me money if you want an exportbased economy you have to figure out what you can make cheaply

the maps are very large compared to some other city builders and although i never ran into perf issues others reported them for very large cities of course nobody forces you to build a massive city either so if you do run into problems you can just do another city nearby and ship resources between them

there are some bugs and awkward ui that takes a little getting used to you do need to save because crashes do occasionally happen especially if you have a lot of mods

and yes in all fairness there isnt all that much new in xxl compared to xl but i personally feel the extra megaprojects content was worth it got it for 15 which is more than the current full price and the whole point is moot anyway if you havent played the older versions so dont let the bad reviews based on that deter you from trying it 

its the best city builder game there is as far as im concerned

#####

this entire game is basically a paid patch for cities xl yes it is better and i enjoy it now that the memory leaks have been fixed but it is seriously the same game with a teeny tiny bit of polish there are a few new maps and maybe a few new building models but its noting new at all pretty sleazy move by the devs selling a patch though

if you are looking for a halfassed city builder game that finally runs smoothly then by all means buy it 410

#####

before cities skylines i enjoyed this game it could do better

#####

exactly like the cities before same bugs same performance problems high population stuttering when building structures multicore support isnt real it just uses 20 of the other cores first core 100 as always 
010 never ever
peace

#####

fck this shit when i zoom at max level and stare at a moving object for more than 10 seconds the game crashes
seriously dont buy i hope the devs will feel guilty of their fg nonsense when you dont need to release a game then dont think about it and if you dont consider having new features compared to the lastest game released then dont do a fg copy paste of the exact same game be kind and dont repeat this mistake

#####

when i start it first time i was suprised same game just diferent box but i decide to play so i did for last weekn with hope to build something nice since yesteraday when my xxl download new patch i cant open any map game showing me massage about problem with the mod i cant fix those cities even i reinstaled everything and unsubscirbe mods so today was my last day

#####

this is my last cities upgrade ill buy i expect leaps and bounds between versions but this is just pathetic its truely boring lacks colour design absolutely hate the trade system

cities skylines is way better

#####

game hasnt got a single update since 2015 
the game crashes way to often and is buggy

dont buy

#####

to be honest i wasnt too impressed with the game yes it does look graphicaly better somewhat and the multicore support is showen but just barely when theres zones being built i see massive frame drops and the game starts to lag quite a bit which is surprising because it was suppose to be such a smooth game to play the ui is the same with only the playfastforward buttons moved and the color of the ui is now a dark grey instead of blue 

    persionally this game should be running way better on my system seeing as how i have a high end gaming pc system specs below but it barely maintains 60 fps on a 4k screen which makes no sence since bf4 and bfhardline both way more demanding games especially on 4k runs better with a comfortable 74 average fps on my 4k monitor

    yes the game does look slightly better i will agree with that and the map sizes are nicer too compared to simcity which i have played a lot of but simcity does run better and looks way nicer with a better user interface then what cities xxl has now yes simcity 2013 did have an absolute horrendus launch but after all of the patches and bug fixes that they have released id much rather spend my time on simcity then on cities xxl

    if you have not played cities xl 2012 or cities xl platinum then you should still get the game but if you already have one of those two and dont mind the ui and lower frames then i do not recomend this for you unless you have a pile of money burning a hole in youre pocket

    lets just hope that cities skylines will be better from the game play that i have seen on youtube about cities skylines it seems to have a much better user interface and it seems to run better over all especially since they were playing that in alpha

please post your thoughts about the game in the comments below to let me know how you feel

pc specifications that i did my review on

cpu amd fx8350
mobo rog crosshairv formulaz
ram 16gb 1866mhz gskill
gpu evga super clocked gtx 980
psu crosshair 750w

#####

its a total rip off if you already own one of the previous versions then this has nothing new to offer except the multi core support which should be just included as a patch for the previous versions and even that is not working flawlessly theres seriously nothing new in this game thats worth the 20 and even less the full price of 40

so save your money and wait for the cities skylines hopefully it lives up for the expectations

#####

this title gets a bad rap but if you havent played any cities game and just want a decent city building game itll scratch the itch for sure

#####

cities skylines

#####

basically the same load of crap like before i feel ripped of even thinking that i would give this game another chance i am getting all the usual freezes and glitches and the single core bull st why couldnt they at least improve it i would have been so happy if i could play the actual game with no problems but i cant the game is trully unenjoyable and just isnt worth it at all the only thing thats nice is the steam workshop integration but really i do believe this game needs to be shut down its not a game for 2015 at all do not buy save your money for cities skylines where the devs actually listen to the community and are making a good game for the city buylding genre

#####

not recommended if you have one of the previous versions if you allready have one dont buy this game

#####

edit tldr if youre a fan of the series and dont mind that this is more or less exactly the same as cities xl then yeah its a nice update to buy if youre not a fan and youre expecting something brand new stay away

if youve played cities xl then youve played cities xxl this shouldnt have been a new game this feels more like a fix for all the bugs that plagued cities xl but instead they introduced it as a brand new game

pros
 supports steam workshop now yay
 no more memory leak like in cities xl that i can tell so far
 game runs a bit smoother than its predecesor
 sky box leads to very pretty screenshots of the city
 new buildings and offers more in terms of environment and countering pollution

cons
 its still buggy and still lags when the city population gets too high
 it feels like it shouldve been an update to cities xl 
 a handful of new buildings and fixed bugs doesnt make a new game not really 

do i recommend this game based on what i see purely upfront no i really shouldnt however consider cities xl and all its bugs most of it wasnt fixed with a simple patch because the issue lay with the core engine focus home decided to tackle the engine problems and release the improvements at cities xxl as a citybuilding sim fan at heart buying this at 20 was like buying really expensive dlc content is it worth it at full price not really why do i recommend this then because at the end of the day i still think this is a better game than simcity

#####

its not terrible

as city builders go it has issues and if you own previous iterations of the game then probably not worth it but it isnt terrible at all

in some ways its deeper than cities skylines in other ways it isnt i miss districts for example but i actually prefer some of the mechanics and the feel of xxl theres plenty of content to unlock and the graphics work well though not sure with the bighead design choice for the population

i wouldnt rate it as the greatest game or even the greatest city builder ive ever played but if you are a builder fan then well its not terrible

#####

this game is fine it is not the genre defining title like sc4 but a transition between that era and cities skylines

#####

they just remastered the old cities xl without remastering it
no new buildings hud is the same except of the other colour 

and now the biggest failure of this game cities xl lagged like hell they said cities xxl would use a new more powerfull engine with multicore support

the game has no multicore support it only runs on one core and it lags when you hit 100000 ore more citizen

do not buy this game its a complete rip off with no changes

#####

ive not played the previous cities games but i am a fan of city building simulations such as sim city theres a lot of talk of this game being the same as the one previous but as i havent played those i can only judge it on what it is as an individual game 

the maps are big very big compared to sim city but then most maps on most games are bigger than those 

the cities seem to run smoothly with no lag for me but i have only had low density cities of around 100000 people 

it doesnt seem to go as indepth as sim city though with regards to pollution crime health and other factors however i feel that this game is more about building the largest rather than building the most perfect city 

i have had trouble with loading up saved games and there has been some difficulty in placing roads but i feel that overall its a fairly decent city building simulator if you havent had a previous cities game 

in short its worth a purchase if you like city sims

#####

if you own any version of cities xl do not buy this it is exactly the same the features promised are nothing more than most companies would put out in a free bug fixing update prelaunch advertising was a scam

#####

i already owned cities xl this was the original version not the 20112012 or platinum and for me i feel xxl it is a much better game 

the game is much smoother more buildings and maps than original xl and the workshop intergration is my favorite thing i like the fact you can choose street options for example building lay out 2x4  2x5 and so on i like the range of maps and slightly differnt ui

the roads can still be a bit of a pain to lay and especially things such as bridges and tunnels and joining avenues to roads and expressways

i really do enjoy the game however i feel it can be a bit annoying when objects wont go in a space and the game does not give an indecation of why 

for me i only paid 1500 for this game and it is a lovely step up from xl but i can see how it for those with the newer versions of xl it feels like nothing has been changed

my verdict is if you dont own any of the previous cities games get this one it is really good
if you own xl original or older and you can get this at a good discounted price like 1500 go for it 
but if you have the newer ones it may not be worth it


#####

repackaged garbage i want my giggle back

#####

literally the exact same fucking game as platinum all the way down to the tutorial and its lame humor exact same thing buy cities skylines instead

#####

this is very much like city skylines only with more bugs and superstructures the more you play this game the more annoyed you will be a the various tabs and panels especially when you get to the building of superstructures it is so annoying that i have yet to configure a fully built superstructure only halfway through a nuclear power plant the main problem being is the balance of trying to get all the available resources together at just the right time
however it is functional like any other sim building game and has far more functionality if you use steam games work shop that has loads of different items that can be added to the game 
in terms of looks its ok but nothing to write about it could have been a lot better is all i would say and for anyone thinking of a purchase i highly recommend downloading certain mods from the workshop that drastically improve overall graphics and performance sound is very poor with very few tracks and most disappointing from a sim building title overall fun to play better with mods and could have been a lot better but to many bugs and a slow progression can make it tiresome and very annoying

#####

my recommendation will depend on what youre upgrading from if its 2012 platinum then there are only 5 new maps if anything bellow that then theres load of new content

so far my opinion is
 the whole music is completely new enjoying that aspect very much 
 5 new maps
 lots of quality of life features such as selecting what roads you want to put down with your city blocks how wide your city blocks should be etc 
 new buildings
 seems to run better 

however if you owned 2012 platinum theres not really overwhelmingly a lot of new features if your e completely new to the game or had 2011 and bellow youll be pleasantly surprised

#####

this is not much of an upgrade more like a patch it should of been free to previous owners

#####

the reason i stopped playing xl was due to the graphics glitches they have rereleased the same game changed a few things and the glitches are still there sort it out

do not buy this game unless you have not owned xl before its not worth it until it gets patched

edit zoomed in on a truck pulling an oil tank the tanker fell off zoomed in on another one the game crashed fun

#####

dont just dont its same with cities xl even game says its cities xl at window dont waste your money with this something go and buy cities skylines

#####

total ripoff same game as the previous version

#####

i had been hoping that this game could scratch the itch for a good city management sim after sim city 4 was such a let down unfortunately this game does not provide enough to keep me engaged in the development of my city it becomes quite boring after starting a short time i feel even worse for those that owned the previous version seeing as how this is apparently barely different from previous entries in the series

#####

selling as a separate product is a scam a regular cities xl with the ability to run on multiple cores everything else remained as it was

#####

well i think ill give it a positive review if the game is claimed as cities xl remastered edition

#####

i literally just bought the same game twice and by that i mean cities xxl and cities xl platinium dont buy this unless its the first time you buy from this series the game as the same maps buildings even the menu is identical only change i saw was the ui color change from blue to blackgrey want refund

#####

it is wery dissapointing to see a game with should be a new product and yet it just an upgrade for wich you need to pay normal price

no no no do not buy it if you have a previus fersion

sm4 or sm5 are good to

mabey cities skyline will change how we see city builders
cant wait

#####

isnt a bad game if you are just buying your first city xl game have had a lot of fun with it

#####

its cities xl for double the price literally

#####

if this game was released like this 10 years ago i would have been impressed i played cities xl 2011 and thought it was quite good even though it had room for improvement when i played cities xxl everything looked the same and i realised it was not a new game but just an upgrade  i feel the promotion of this game was misleading and so i wont even get started with what i still think this game lacks

#####

more or less the same as cities xl with a few tiny changes also seems to be more unstable and laggier than xl dont buy it if you own xl already

#####

great game

#####

one word  bad this game is so bad its not a joke im lucky as i only payed 3 for it and then it too much

#####

this game is the same game as the previous one
even the maps are the same

nothing but nothing is new here

what a rip off

#####

brand new interface

right

it looks almost exactly like every other cities xxl game ive played before every time i upgrade to their new version thinking this one will be different

never again

#####

xxl city is xl city with an extra letter x thats it


btw this is the frist time i wanna ask refund for a game

#####

i do not understand why so many do not like this game in cities xxl well all except optimization

#####

it runs and looks awful i have no idea how they made the screenshots and videos look decent when it literally looks worse than simcity 3000 just get cities skylines instead

#####

thats pretty much the same game with much worse interface i mean seriously it looks like it was designed by an entry level ui designer using paint icons are practically ureadable on 27 and the interface looks very shabby 
in terms of performance i havent noticed any changes either first thing that ive done is ive built a simple large layout and upon hitting 100k of population it started to lag just like the previous game 
no way on earth this game costs money they charge its really a scam literally

#####

this should have been a free update to cities xl shame on you valve for allowing them to post this as a new title

#####

i would recommend cities xxl to those who are detailoriented enjoy city building and have experience with other city building games such as cities skylines and sim city i like the simplicity of being able to find all of the similar things together building stuff info etc

#####

same game as cities xl do not buy

#####

we were expecting new features a new city engine realistic looking roads more organic feel better ai and the integration of all the stuff involved in the game which should impact on your city such as low education rate  upper crime rate etc but there is no challenge on this game

we were waiting for a new game for years for just a mere remake not fair

#####

people dont like this game but i think its an interesting alternative to cities skylines


#####

paid 20 dollars for the same game  very dissappointed in this game  i even prefer the old user interface over the new one
i want my money back

#####

after reading reviews for a couple of days it was clear to me that the game is not worth the money however i caved anyway and purchased it i honestly just really enjoy city building games being that i already owned xl 2012 platinum i got it at a discounted price of 20 which made my purchasing decision a bit easier another reason why i purchased is because of the talk of multicore support which is something the previous game suffered from the performance was utterly garbage in xl 2012 however that being said the performance in xxl is no different the game still has crap performance when your city finally starts getting decently large 

i cant even place a bridge or road after a while as framerate drops when rendering out the bridge or road placement to the point where its not possible anymore starting out my city by careful planning and design by the time large density areas are placed and built the design and care just goes out the window because of complete shit framerate when placing zoning areas or roads etc same bullshit performance issues as the previous game 

as city building games go the xl series of games are complete garbage when it comes to actual city building  sim city 5 while it has small building areas blows this shit out of the water also fuck this company for releasing this game like it was something new and feeding us the same bullshit lesson learned 

just wait for skylines that game looks incredible

#####

i recommend this game if you dont already play cities xl platinum

#####

with a slight sceptical view i took a punt on the 50 off offer patiently waited whilst the game downloaded and installed various updates to  be greated by a nice splash screen a timer cursor and then cities xxl application is not responding

restart game

cities xxl application is not responding

restart game

cities xxl game application has stopped working

sigh

at present this game is completely unplayable i feel disappointed in the games ability to even load and i will now have to wait for an inevitable patch to even load the game i have  paid good money for good job focus

cannot recommend game in its current state

#####

no body wants a job
then they complain there are no jobs when there are plenty of places needing unskilled workers right across the street


#####

this is the most ripped off i have ever felt with a video game please do not buy

#####

nothing really new the same old game with steam workshop added  this games was literly announced a few months ago with a short release date i really wish some company would fill this genre with a quality product   

 cities xxl does not even qualify to be called cities xl

#####

i should have read up on this game before buying it i already owned cities xl and initially i thought cities xxl was a lame title to begin with that should have been a red flag the title is not even creative the game itself literally is almost exactly the same game as its predecessors as has already been said many times there may be some new buildings buried in there somewhere but i havent found them yet

i really tried to give this game a chance i wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt especially since i spent 20 on it but im afraid theres nothing for it it is not worth the money and worse yet it is a total scam

dont buy this game

#####

fraudsters selling an old product ably knowingly and willingly supported and encouraged by steam

#####

best looking game of 2004 wait it was released when cant customise controls seriously this game is so broken even the tutorials are broken

#####

wish i could get a refund on this one hell id pay to remove it from my library should be named crashxxl

#####

cities xxl is a good game if it was just coming out  as is stands with cities xl platinum it hard to recommend it  
i have played cites xl and enjoyed the breath of wonderful features and good graphics  it allows for large cities in the millions something sim city has yet to do  

now to the changes there are some changes from cities xl   user interfaces make over  newugraded graphics engine new music and new upgrades to the buildings    the user interface has been cleaned up and now looks more in line with microsoft metro look  this works it is easy to see and distinguish the icons  i have seen little functionality changes though  the newly upgraded engine is smoother show off better pixel shaders  the engine is still fresh and i saw the roads gliching at certain zoom levels  there are more and better skyboxes so that is a plus  there are a few additional upgrades that you can add to the city utilities but they are later in the game and look like minor changes gameplay  the tutorial has not changed for good or ill  so what does 2040 get you
   the good
	better engine user interface sky boxes music variety
indifferent
	fuctionallity the same frame rate difference is hard to notice music changes 
the bad
	still glitchy paying 20 for a large patch 

if you want to get this game buy fresh on a steam sale  it is worth is in 2030 new
if you own cities xl then it is a tough decision  is the minor upgrades worth 20

for me no  there needed to be more content or a less of a price tag


#####

i really cant recommend this especially if you have the previous game since it is pretty much the previous game even if you dont there are much better city building games out there anyway that arent 40

#####

yeah i think it is really fun to spend time for people like me who wanna play a city builder game but cities skylines is beyond my pc spec to run smoothly

#####

personally i like it granted ive not been playing long on this game but i find it easy to grasp the fundamentals
some other games can be a nightmare but this is okay


#####

so heres the bottom line cities xxl is basically cities xl with what seems to be an identical gameplay and slightly altered interface its actually quite insulting but its also a good lesson for all you young developers out there say you desinged a decend video game about a decade ago made a bunch of money and lived a happy life but now the checking account is running a little low what do you do well you sure dont feel like developing a new game so instead you offer an amazing 50 discount to those who have already purchased the old one and promise them a new version you add a letter or a number to the title those suckes will fall for it every time and you slap a few minor updates and i mean minor like say the color of the interface and ta da youre done back to margaritas 

pro tip just dont forget to create an awesome promo video to make it looks more awesome  it helps then just watch the checking account get replanished

#####

a ui overhaul and some bug fixes does not a new game make 

seriously this game exactly the same as cities xl but with some very minor touch ups and bug fixes the models and graphics are exactly the same save for a little bit of extra polish it seems some bugs have been fixed from the last game but it is still littered with them some of which make the game slightly obnoxious to play this is an insult and i regret letting the devs make a monkey out of me by luring me with that damn 50 off if you were a fan of the previous game id advise you to stay away if youre new to the series i would ask you to not get this game because the devs are lying peeholes for reselling the exact same game

#####

same as every single other cities xl period

#####

this game is the same as cities xl except new colour for interfacebetter performance multicore and threads fuction and 5 new buildings i think ive only been able to unlock 4 for the time ive played and finally steam workshop i have cities xl which is why i understand the big discount but really 20 dollars for some new stuff is unacceptable and plus they have just tarnished their reputation

im never ever buying another foucus home intertainment game again im not even going to think of  buying a game in this franchise

#####

the graphics are great for use on an older computer the interface is easy to use the trading screen makes for interesting game play between cities the music is a great choice for hours of game play at a time

#####

new version but severely lacking the new

as soon as i heard that a fresh new cities xl game was on the horizon i had really big hopes that this would finally be a new start for the series a proper major upgrade from cities xl that maintained the best bits of the series whilst introducing significant improvements in gameplay customisation and capabilities this is a game that had to be more that cities xl was and given the titles new x one would assume this to be the case but alas two hours in and i find myself disappointed 

like with previous annual new releases it feels that focus have merely taken the same old game given it 2015s lick of paint and sent it on its merry way underneath it all this game feels exactly the same as the previous three incarnations and offers very little in the way of new dont get me wrong its not a bad game as citybuilders go cities xl or xxl is a very different take compared to others in the genre and where it excels in some areas of micromanagement its lacking in others but ultimately if you are looking for an evolution from the previous versions of the game xxl just does not cut it 

focus are crying wolf with this latest offering and had i known cities xxl would be an almost identical carbon copy of cities xl i would have stuck with the platinum version and invested the money in alternative new takes on the citybuilding genre such as cities skylines whilst focus rivals maxis may have their critics and problems with their latest simcity offering theyve atleast made the effort to evolve the series even if it is with varying degrees of success and while the latest simcity has been an education for maxis focus have yet to demonstrate that evolution is in their nature

#####

updated software for cities xl bug fixed etc there was probably a game engine rewrite which made things better but without the updated content to make it more modern it will fall flat

the new music is something different though not sure it works well with a city building game

if you dont have cities xl this is the better version

for me i might go back to playing simcity 4

#####

i have played the earlier cities games and love them which is why i jumped on the discounted newer version  however that discount just lured me into playing the same game i have always loved  i have since logged nearly 30hrs of playtime while i havent experienced any of the crashes some folks have i have a ridiculously awesome pc i have noticed plummeting fps and ridiculous road glitches  and the deletebulldoze tool still pisses me off why do you have some kind of lock on the delete item option  and why is my delete tools smallest size still the size of a massive freaking avenuehighway  while i still love this game even through the quirks i was really hoping for some of the engine and graphics updates i have seen elsewhere  so i am left 20 lighter and disapointed in the cities xxl franchise in total  you sucked more money out of me to give me the same game  new players to cities will enjoy this game and the franchise it is a fun time  but i am bummed out beyond belief  30hrs in and i havent noticed anything really new  at all

#####

for old users its an updatepatchdlc this is why hes 50 off and for me its fair imo its a good updatepatchdlc the perf was improved new stuff list is implemented as say for new user its a good game for realistic city building but old cxl players may be disappointed by lack of novelty

#####

better than cities skylines

a doesnt become a traffic simulator after 100k population and you dont need mods to solve any traffic issues you do have
b has low requirements and proccesses as well
              however
    on some pcs this game just wont work so bear that in mind
c has a goodish modding community
d doesnt fill your screen with giant popups just a few little ones
d pt2 the pop ups make it sound like it wasnt your fault sometimes because it isnt always your fault eg
the investors cheques bounced or the owner had to flee his ex wives
e personally it is more graphically pleasing as well although some may beg to differ
fthe progression rate i have two cities each with 100k populations now in 10 hours of playing
g multiple cities kind of they can trade with each other but wont connect via road like in simcity 4
disclaimer if anyone buys this game and then does not enjoy do not blame me because we all have different tastes also there are quite a few negatives just read the other reviews if you want to read more positive reviews just look at octobernovember for more proof
ps the no boxed cars mod and stadiums pack if your a sports fan are must haves in the second mod you can actually place down models of stadiums such as the emirates and watch two teams play both mods can be found on the steam workshop although there are other mod sites if you have any questions reply and id be happy to give you my knowledge on the subject

#####

nothing has changed from what i have seen

#####

not good especially when compared to cities skylines still if you are a player who likes citybuilding games like me you should try this even if experience isnt that good buy it when its on sale 410

#####

for a newcomer to the franchise this is not a bad game for everybody else though

this game is basically the same as cities xl the only big change is multicore support but lets be honest that should have been a free update ages ago

i call every enthousiast to boycot this game dont buy it basically you are buying what should have been a patch

the only reason cities xxl exists is so focus can squeeze some more money out of it as long as we keep buying crap games producers will keep selling them we need to send focus a message they need to understand that were not taking it any longer

that is why people should not buy this game that is why this game should as many bad reviews as possible and that is why everybody should ask for a refund the game simply does not deliver what it promised and that is false advertising

#####

ffs its same as xl can you get refunds

#####

whats new  nothing

#####

this isnt as good as something like cities skylines but its still a decent game to play
ocasionally

#####

i want a refund buggy unfinished quirky game

#####

do not and i repeat do not buy this game  they shined up the menus changed the music the splash screens but the 1280x800 res i used to play on in xl plat doesnt work in this iteration  from the very first 5 minutes of laying roads the game lags like crazy seriously

#####

game is unplayable for me due to roadgraphics glitch either the roads decide to act like a seizure inducing stroboscope or outright disappear unless im fully zoomed in placing roads makes the fps drop dramatically from a steady 60 to 45fps this  in combination with the glitches i mentioned earlier makes the game completely unplayable
where do i go for a refund

#####

game crashes consistently on single and dual amd graphics cards  tried desktop with hd 8750 and laptop with embedded r9 and internal r7  drivers and settings havent fixed the issues  nor unistalls and reinstalls

#####

i can sell my unskilled labor to another cities 1010

#####

i didnt  know that you have to buy the same game twice 

#####

as everyone writes before me its just basically another expansion at best  the tutorial ui build menu is almost the same except for a few graphic changes  if you dont have cities xl12 and you want to buy it wait for it to go on sale  if you do its the same ol same ol

#####

ive played cities xl the previous version for many hours as a city builder i found it to be a very enjoyable experience unfortunately it suffered from heavy lagging that made it almost unplayable after a few hours cities xxl fixes this so what remains is just one of the best city builders you can get i find this one to be a lot better than simcity the modding community for this game is also very nice check out xlnation where you can get a lot of mods for cities xl hopefully these will all be updated for cities xxl overall i would definitely recommend this game

#####

dont buy the cities xl
one multicore assist need 19 euro
人傻钱多么
i want mt money back
hope there will be lots of update to make this game different

#####

rebadge of cities xl cumbersome ui bugs and all relaunched to try and take advantage of interest in the thennew competing cities skyline cities skyline is much better arguably the decade and a half old simcity 4 is as well

#####

cities skylines is still number one


#####

i have bought every version of this game since inception as each itteration was not very expensive if you already owned the game i did not mind that there were no significant updates to game playability when i saw the xxl the move to steam and the increased price i just assumed this was a significant improvement on the xl version it is not

if you do not own the game i do recomend it its still a fun game and enjoyable to play for what it is it is not however a new version of the game i find it decietful that they have marketed it as such

i will no longer purchase any new versions it is time to let this game die

#####

ill make it short  the game actualy got multicore support  and if you ever want to buy one of the city xl take this one  

other than that the game look the same with more stuff and some new map and many things improved 

#####

first time to leave a comment in steam i have tocoz i really want to say it out loud
do not buy this game
this is basically cities xl
nothing signicantly changed

performance still bad bugs still there

i have experienced memory leak issue after playing for a few hrs with a small 10k populated town only



#####

decepcionado com o jogo estao vendendo este jogo que é exatamente igual ao cities xl por um valor ainda maior se vc ja tem o cities xl nao compre este jogo e se vc nao tem nenhum jogo da serie compre o xl que é exatamente igual a esse e custa menos

#####

what a joke do not spend your money on this this game is not much different than the older ones  the only difference is a slight performance improvement like multicore support  however it is super glitchy it takes a long time just to even make a block of houses  the graphics are not any better and while scrolling there is page tearing and graphics problems  i am also disappointed that they didnt add anything or change the interface so that it has easier navigation  another glitch is that the bulldozer will say its locked until you wait a few seconds then it will finally unlock the overall gameplay has gotten worse  truly a disappointment  this should have been an upgrade to previous editions  not a new release  i hope focus realizes that they just killed their fan base  they are truly just trying to milk off whatever fans are left

#####

this feels like the same game as cities xl which i already own  the interface the building tools the game mechanics all seems the same to me  

whats different

 allegedly performance does not fall apart so badly in the end game as with cities xl
 some new content
 steam achievements
 steam workshop

pretty sure engine achievements and workshop could have been a game update for cities xl and the new pieces of content could have been dlc for cities xl 

so why did i buy the same game released under a new name   somehow i thought it would be a different game  perhaps because it is sold as a different game   but it seems to just be a port of mostly the same game to a new engine

why would you buy this

 you dont already own cities xl and the game is on sale
 you desperately want the steam achievements and the game is on sale
 you desperately want the steam workshop support and the game is on sale
 you desperately want the new content and the game is on sale

even at the 50 preorder price offered to those who already owned cities xl this seems like a well played con job  

other developers have demonstrated how to update existing games with additions like steam achievements 64bit builds engine updates additional content etc  its a shame that focus decided to ignore the good examples set by others instead  pulling an insulting scam of a strategy out of their rear ends

#####

there are some slight improvements over pevious editions of the series however the game suffers from the same glaring issues as the previous ones 
this is definatly more of a expansion pack then a new game as most of the content is exactly the same as previous games in the series
it still suffers from horrible lag at times and several game breaking bugs that can effect trading and cause the game to be unplayable this will be the last citys game i buy from this company

#####

the game is an exact replica of the first game right down to graphics   this is a complete waste of money and you should seriously consider not pre ordering anything from steam going forward since they are not protecting their customers from this sort of fleecing

#####

as many others are saying this is just cities xl with another x in the name i feel especially butthurt because i wasnt paying attention and thought this was cities skylines this game becomes boring quickly performs poorly and feels like it should have been a free patch or a cheap dlc for xl focus are a bunch of jags

#####

no thanks crashes often yikes stay away from this one

#####

ive played the bootleg cities xl in the past just to see how it went i never went all the way because id get bored of it or play another game anyway i really did like to play the game and when i got this on sale for less than 200 whats there to losei must say so far im enjoying it and whatever quirk it has havent really bothered me its definitely not perfect but if you want a change of pace from playing your fps or whatever itll do the job go get it on sale theres less to regret if you dont like it

#####

cities xxl is difficult to write a review of but here goes

i owned cities xl 2012 purchased outside steam years ago service no longer exists so i couldnt reinstall but when that computer bit the dust i wanted to keep my world so i bought this on deep sale i wasnt paying full price for a game twice  if you own cities xl do not bother buying this unless like me you lost your access to reinstall  and yes i was able to import my save data from xl into xxl when people say they arent much different they are not exaggerating even a little even just pasting the save files into the directory worked without a second thought

the actual game play is pretty complex and sometimes frustrating in how things tie together and the balancing act you need to do  not just in your city but between the other cities you build  a single city cannot stand alone past a certain point doesnt have all or enough of the resources etc and while you can buysell to omnicorp it gets prohibitively expensive pretty quickly intentionally  though theres mods to change that if you want to mod your game  theres also a bunch of mods available and active communities dedicated to this game that love it  i come and go from this game playing for weeks or months in a stretch then taking a break etc  steam has tracked 125 hours but its probably close to 5000 over the last 6 or 7 years playing the game presteam time

the issues you hear about with performance are real but less of an issue with newer hardware and since this version is now 5 years old i wouldnt worry too much about that  conversely the graphics are older too and really more like 8 years so while still nice they arent popping like cities skylines thats still under continual development  other very noticeable things are that some things are unfinished like the use of a rail system despite being on the animated intro which is the most glaring one and the developer really property owner since focus bought this from developed by monte cristo that is not in business anymore has really no plans desire or anything else to finish the items or patch anything so wysiwyg bugs and all

the game had some interesting ideas and lots of potential so if you like city builders you may want to pick it up on a sale as i write this its 299 during a 70 off how can you go wrong for 300 but i wouldnt pay over 500 for this anymore  if you want something that is under active improvement and takes customer issues seriously id say go cities skylines but youll spend much more especially once you get dlc  overall i am giving it a yes recommendation if you go in eyesopen

#####

tutorial is a bit lacking you deviate at all and it wont allow you to progress  i havent played any of the previous versions so i didnt have the expectations that other people had whom seem to be posting all the negative reviews  i have how ever played simcity in all its previous versions  so far im enjoying xxl and if you would like to try something different i would encourage it

#####

wow this game is just awful i cnat believe i bought this thinking itd be better than simcity wish i could get a refund

#####

 after patch 3 edit 

 you can now move with wasd
 rhm2 is working nicely in xxl
 fixed stretched ui elements
 mod community is growing check xl nation for even more mods
 achievements are hit or miss  sometimes they are unlocked sometimes theyre not have to reboot the game to unlock a new one every time
 the expert mode is never ticked still have to click it every time i join a city
 looks like fhi is finally bringing this game together nevertheless







 original review below 

 started game
 hoping for wasd
 still no wasd
 dang

010 would play simcity instead


but seriously heres the rundown
 no wasd to move around this is 2015 right
 glitched interface fonts streched ugly ui like an alpha build
 there are clouds now but wait you have to manually set the enviroment no real weather its just there so your ingame screenshots look beautiful
 no daynight cycle yet at least i havent found it gotta rely on mod on this too like the previous version
 bigger maps theres actually something new actually i learned they werent bigger but they can hold on much more stuff which before it couldnt

when should you get this game
 if you are new feel free to try it out at your own risk overall gameplay is better than the new simcity
 hold on to more mods im testing them out from my 2012 version most of them make the game crash
 when it gets the realistic highway mod that should be standard by now

side note  running fine under windows 81 on bootcamp imac with crappy intel iris pro 5200 max settings but the game lags when building smooth when just viewing and walking around havent made a ginormous city yet so cant tell if it keeps its fps high on max settings

just one more game convincing me to never preorder again
