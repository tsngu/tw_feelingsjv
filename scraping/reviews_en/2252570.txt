btldr solid 810 fm24 a refined version of fm23 small but significant step in the right direction b

this years iteration is the final of the series before the upcoming major overhaul next year whilst changes are deemed small they have had significant positive impact on the general feel of the game the new setpiece routines are also a great plus for anyone that loves getting hands on with tactical set ups one i am enjoying

bmatch engine a large improvement fluid and succinct dont confuse yourself this is and will never be fifab

by far a long long overdue upgrade to the match engine but the look feel and visuals around it are a huge step up well done definitely not perfect nor aaa grade quality but a big step up from previous years if you are looking for fifa level graphics turn your attention elsewhere this is a purely management simulator and still far cleaner than any competitor products in its category

        players underlapoverlap appropriately no more fb running into wingers
        players understand spacing and no longer bunch up in the past
        ball movement are more realistic touches bouces and dribbling
        the defender shot blocking issues are resolved less wild blocking more penetration
        movement looks more natural
        flow of movement is very fluid
        feels more realistic

a very long due more than incremental match engine upgrade not graphics but actual ai decisions variable movements and more

ikeep in mind fm25 or whatever it will be called will bring in unity so expect any groundbreaking overhauls to occur next year but its si so dont fall prey to overexpectationsi

balthough some minor tweaks are requiredb
        you can still find out if var ruling before its announced by player celebrations a premature anticlimax
        keeper movement looks a little lacklustredelayed at times but this is experienced in other football games as well so i guess its a common difficulty

its a finally good update to the series and it only took up to its final iteration match engine and tactics to me are a great upgrade no ui changes but things feel smoother and more refined

despite some people stating large issues ive personally not experienced anything on a new fm24 save
        ive not had any injury issues
        ive not had 50 shots 0 goals issues
        game has run completely smooth for me

for those saying the me is terrible and they cant seem to score instead of blaming the match engine when majority of others are satisfied with it maybe look into your own tactical structures training methods and team cohesion the silent majority seem to be fine and ive not had any severe me issues since fm21 the odd bogey team bournemouth and damn solanke for me does occur but nonetheless everything has been a significant step up this year in the me

been playing since fm12 and fm24 is the best one since pre2020

im a sucker for fm and have always loved the game and continue buying it its an amazing time killer particularly when you dont need to be glued to your screen to play it

could i have just downloaded a database update from the workshop for fm23 yes i could have also done that for fm19202122 but i love the game and franchise no matter how much people claims it stagnated it has killed thousands of hours for me this doesnt even include the versions before steam or the offline hours i had on previous iterations

bis it worth the money its definitely a yes for me 810b

#####

this game have made sure my search history is regularly watched by the fbi for some reason they dont like u searching for 16 year olds colombians

#####

this is your brain on 4231 gegenpressing

#####

i was playing fm when i was offered the man utd job i knew it was a poor squad with no future so i declined the offer i then put the telephone down and returned to fm

#####

the glitch is amazing i signed mbappe to dinamo bucuresti and proceed to bankrupt the club in 5 minutes
great success would recommend

#####

in previous years i thought of breaking up with my girlfriend so that i could play freely but now she bought me the game so that i could take her hometown team to the next league

#####

giv me englund job i bring home

#####

my main issue with this game is how little it changes over editions and how the devs just do not fix issues that have been there for multiple years its a bit of a joke at this point

pros

 the match engine is much better this year it actually looks and plays like real football

cons

 interactionspromises are completely broken to the point where most people just avoid them completely if poissible i had a cb recalled to his club because he wasnt playing as a central defender despite him definitely playing there and in the agreed role the entire season
 everything is still based way too much on reputation it doesnt change dynamically enough either there should be an overall reputation and a current rep because if im taking a team from rock bottom of league one to automatic promotion in one season i should be talk of the town but i barely get a rep boost its also just way too slow if you want to grow a team organically
 ai squadbuilding is still absolutely terrible and si have said theyre happy with how it currently is which must be a lie clubs still focus way too much on rep and sign ageing players or players they do not need instead of competing for prospects its way too easy to hoover up all the best talents for myself because the ai are stupid
 logic of the game is broken all over clubs rejecting offers for players and then selling them for way lower than those offers players asking for super high wages at one club and accepting 3 times less than that at another similarly rated club etc
 spread of talent over the world is not balanced lack of fullback newgens still an issue dynamic youth rating still not working very well
 newgen faces look atrocious and have only gotten worse i know miles said this is because he wants them to look like the player in game but you can barely even see the player faces in game its rubbish and ruins the immersion when half of your youth intake are balding 16 yearolds with vitiligo

#####

tactical masterclass against the big teams just to lose to a team from lichtenstein in the champions league good game

#####

crack cocaine

#####

id like to see some improvement in stadiums and controlling club marketing the more i do better in sales and investment better players i can buy if i can adjust my stadium like increase a certain stand and to pick up how it looks another thing if i can open academies in other countries to get best talents would be awesome as well thank you if you consider any of those

#####

if you buy the game every year then yes its an improvement and buy it

if you buy the game every two years then dont buy as its not a lot different 

if youve not bought the game for years or ever and are thinking about getting it then buy it as its a good as any

you can read all the reviews you want but those lines above are as much as they are all going to mean no matter how many words they have in them

im enjoying this edition under a lot of aspects and id be okay with the problems and bugs ill talk about if a piece of the game wasnt missing entirely the ingame editor it would allow players to solve issues that make no sense eg a player being unhappy with a promise when it was actually fulfilled too bad the editor costs almost 10 either make the game perfect or dont charge me to be able to fix mistakes that youve made which in the grand scheme of things could also be acceptable
that being said with dynamics being an increasingly relevant aspect to team management in the game youd think that part of fm would also make some sense unfortunately thats not quite the case and most fm players will have to exploit some mechanics to get by just look online and youll see everybody avoiding promises like the plague due to very limited options in dealing with players im okay with certain aspects being crude and most resources working towards fm25 i accept that the fact is that people management is so important you cant afford to put in irreversible game breaking bugs

im enjoying the game a lot im playing a sixth level german league save since fm 2023 thanks to the ability to import savegames from fm 23 for about 700 hours now degree of realism is incredible especially when it comes to signing players they all divas lol 

german translation of the game is flawless and not just only translated from english but using german football phrases which impressed me a lot as well

worth any cent and beyond thanks for the great work and contributing to my happiness in my free time

story time for interested 
im on the way to the 4th level after about 7 seasons hoping to be promoted next one the competition financial wise is incredible since im managing a poor club from sixth level im stuggling to sign good players and many of them leave after one or two good seasons for better and more renown clubs but thats not always the rule sometimes you manage to sign a player which is basically too good for your club and he might even stay loyal which makes the scouting and signing players very enjoyable 
my goal is obviously bundesliga with this exact sixth level club i played there when i was young lets see how far it takes me till i get sacked lol

#####

i have never posted an online review for the previous versions of fm that i have bought but i am posting for this one because i am so annoyed with the broken player interaction in this game one player goes down a league to join a bigger club other players with a 2 and a half star rating start demanding high wages as soon as you get promoted that dont merit their ability then the whole squad is unhappy with your treatment of that player because they too want a high contract and this is all when they know that the club is 40 million in debt

#####

because of this game my mom told the rest of family that i like minors because she caught me searching for under18 brazilian wonderkids

im finished and my ass will be whooped at christmas dinner 

still a good game tho

#####

rip social life

#####

started off at hampton  richmond spent the year there getting promoted

moved onto colchester in league one where i got them promoted to championship before getting offered a job at norwich

joined norwich most my players demanded to leave due to relegation before i joined so i sell them i make a ton of money and then the board takes nearly all of it away i get promoted to the prem

i sign a ton of players for the prem and i finish in 15th not confident in surviving a second year i spend big

i bring in some proven players and then i go all out in signing van persies kid he fails to score reguarly i have no good striker yet

i have constant anxiety over finding a goal scorer but hey i have a great japanese winger wonderkid help

overall great game which gives you highs and lows like no other game

regular football manager like we used to play  am a fan of manager games for 30 years  

#####

football is life

#####

after finishing the tutorial just now i feel like im ready to start the adventure that is football manager 2024

#####

so we have had an update  i would have to write about 10 pages to tell you about this franchise that consistently treats its buyer and players like sheep  so i will say this  why have a bugs forum on the football manager forum where you can see bugs in the game whether its the me or data related etc if you are not going to make an effort to fix them  unfortunately the franchise has steady gone down the track of cheap sales and reviews for the sake of detailed database and me  match engine  there sole purpose now is to get the game to appeal to younger people for those on xbox or ps5s since fm17 it has become noticeable that they have taken a different direction to capture a different audience  while you see that there are very positive reviews this is the reason for any reasonable update  they think well we dont need to converse with our fan base as everything is fine  as the new people keep buying the next instalments you will see the lies that start appearing and the silence and the lack of support from the company  so many bugs that are in this game and have been in the game from 10 years ago still are being ignored  the me needed a few fixes that have been there for at least 5 years yet we as supporters get nothing to fix them  there whole excuse is now this  thanks for buying fm24 but we are too busy to support it anymore as we are moving on to fm25  they have even stated they are now solely into fm25 as they have now going to unity graphics  so regardless of the bugs in fm24 there response is  we dont care  unfortunately you just cant trust these people anymore  its money money money the head of the company has been there too long  new blood is needed to push this franchise in a better direction because its just becoming an arcade game  i have bought every game since 2008 so i know how its grown and been destroyed at the same time  sure give it a positive review because as a new purchaser of the game i would do that too but as a long time purchaser i cant recommend it  fm25 is well going to be so bug ridden it would be a miracle if it even gets off the ground as a playable game  as with a lot of games in todays world it isnt the game itself thats the problem its the developers 

#####

marketed as the most polished version yet headline features were that ai would be better in reality ai is actually worse than ever and sis response is that the fix is coming soon headline feature coming soon is an absolute shambles feels like they have conned people into buying their game yet again whilst it takes another step backwards interactions were also marketed as a headline feature they are also worse than ever you have 5 cbs the whole squad throws a tantrum because you dont have enough depth at cb sign 2 more they are still unhappy 

dont bother buying wait until fm25 with the new engine though i have no doubt that will only bring worse bugs and releases

oh and si dont bother having a beta  early access  whatever you pretend it is if you then ignore every single bug flagged up in this period and carry on with releasing a load of absolute poo conmen

#####

my team plays like fergusons prime united team one week and then plays like the norwich u12s autistic womens team against teams like luton 1010

#####

my wife already hate this game

#####

a classic fm as we know it however i am giving it thumbs down this time as it is really blatantly done in manner of i dont give a  they will buy it anyway because they want the players to be updated to 2324 season stats

i know that next year we are promised big changes from graphics to whatnot however this fm is really just a database info update and free kicks management as a bonus to that you can now set targets to players and i have to admit that this seems great however i have not yet finished enough of them to check how impactful they are 
oh yeah one more thing you can now sell all players you dont want to have when rebuilding a team to saudi or at least everyone elses team in the game seems to be only in mine they are interested however not buying

otherwise no change still 4231 gegenpress all day play ball into box still means they will hoof it from the sidelines by air you can just keep the encourage and berate shout and get rid of all the rest as players just start crying there are apparently 2000 new interactions added however all press conferences have the exactly same replies at the exactly same spot as last year i just read first 5 words of the press question and know what box to click at bcs i played fm23 and they did not even bother to shuffle the reply fields also if the press asks me about how great of a start to the career at my club my new signing has and i say he became one of the key players immediately maybe the player could at least react well to this or he does not care i gave him such a praise i mean ai is creating peoples thesis now and here i get asked if i am not afraid of overconfidence when i won first two matches of the season and am about to play the third one

no i do not believe i am particularly well versed in mindgames i just said that playing olympiacos in el when managing ajax is going to be a tough game and we managed to win 
no i am not interested in buying 32 year old defender for 5m when i just bought two other cbs and have 1m transfer budget left can they at least ask me on the press conferences about players i scout and not pick totally random players for triple the price of my transfer budget i had at the start of the transfer window

i am really disappointed that any more changes are just coming next year for sure right insert natalie portman from star wars right 


#####

its not really any different from any other fm game in the last few years ive enjoyed my time with it and will continue to play but it always feels like theres something missing series hasnt felt the same since fm20 for me its like a little bit of the soul got left behind those years ago probably something to do with the ui since thats most of the game and i dont really like it that much still at the end of the day its a fm game and if you enjoy the regular formula youll enjoy this one again match engine is something i dont really care that much about but its nice to see the improvements to how the football flows and feels regens have somehow managed to get even uglier its like theyre regressing every year idk if the 45 quid price tag really speaks to me considering id rather go back and play fm 20 again but its a great game if you can get it on sale or something
give it like a chill 85

#####

the only thing higher than the amount of hours this game has taken from me is the amount of south american regen wonderkids i have sitting in my under 21s

#####

i last played this in 2017 i kept playing this one in the hopes i would find anything that would set it apart from 2017 in 7 years it is almost exactly the same game even down to the flavour text questions and some still have spelling mistakes 7 years later if anything it has gotton worse you cant assemble a world class team without them moaning about not all being played day in day out despite real world elite footballers understanding the words squad rotation  there is then no way to appease them  loads of buttons loads of options but save scumming and trying them all proves none of them work apart from appeasement and if the squad then get angry at you again no button works except appeasment what is the point of putting all those options in if none of them work and the player they were angry about his average for the season was 67 and his current average was 64 and these players thought he deserved his place in the team based on form

real world elite football squads do not work like this they do not gang up on the manager in droves to defend a player who is playing awful and then throw a collective hissy fit where they tank their perfomances on purpose

so that combined with the fact that even awful fifa improved its game yearonyear more than this lazy developer means i will not be trying this product again for probably another 10 years

7 years and the exact same game with no major upgrades it beggars belief

#####

lets see  where to begin  

licensing issues a mess the much hyped japanese fully licensed leagues are  guess what not fully licensed and so players who want to experience them are out of luck until si gets its act together

ai squad building a mess ai still signs multimillion pound players for obscene fees and with no logic whatsoever to the deals  and then doesnt play them

most teams do not make substitutions  yes youve read that correctly almost all substitutions in the game come as a result of injuries or fatigue and happen from 85 minutes onward spot the tactical substitution and win a star prize and this is worse in the academy section of the game where entire weeks go by without the ai subbing any players at all which destroys the late game

the champions league new format which worked fine in 2023 version draws clubs from the same countries against each other  what a joke noone inhouse at si spotted that before release 

i could go on and on the game has been out for a fortnight in early access you hope that some of these issues will be resolved on day one  instead nothing and some vague promises about a patch somewhere along the line which probably means weeks 

there is no way i can justify recommending this title and i have often added a caveat to that sort of statement at the moment but this is a joke so im not changing this review later on the release version is unacceptable its dire and a lot of people feel conned by the japanese licensing thing 

no company except for creative assembly is in more dire need of a rival to snap them out of their complacency and arrogance the irony is that the match engine in its final iteration is the best its ever been and would be a gold star point all on its own other than the rest of this

#####

ive been playing since 1999 when it was championship manager and i believe it was the year figo joined real madrid so far im loving it again this year a little apprehensive about next year i hope they dont diverge to far away from a winning formula 1010

#####

yes i liked it because it is a classic but more improvements could have been made in all this time the match engine looks more organic but there is no big difference we have a better feel for different pitches different lightings and weather conditions but now fm needs a much bigger leap

#####

end of an era for football manager honestly the best installment of fm ive played in years soley based on how fast the game loads between continues wont be surprised if the new fm is bad and we will still be playing this next year

#####

its really addictive just wish it had match commentary and a few in game sounds

#####

i dont recommend becuz it take very much time of my life which i could spend masturbering eller tjäna feta pengar bror

#####

most refined fm 24 weve released

improved ai squad managementstransfers  no substitutes wonderkids rotting in reserves at 24 years old buying players for 50 mil to play 2 games in a year
j league kitsplayers not complete at release and even still isnt zero communication external internal cheeky adjusted the text of j leaugue from the website
most attributes dont matter speed and physical all the way every year
me is improved a bit lets wait till they fuck it up again in the next patch
only gegenpresssee fm arena is overpowered again
tactics creator is just outdated and just flat out bad user has no control or little feels scripted due to attributes hardly matter and the instructions are so rigid feels old inflexible adding new roles like ifb and changing hb fb dont matter they are all hard scripted roles which means that you can put any player in the position and they play the same if there attributes are not too far apart
too many goals 2024 is hockey simulator
bugs like set piece coach wage cant be raised not able to hire a set piece coach for the reserve and youth team but you can train it with normal coaches
 great improvement of player interactions and media handling so much fun s
goalkeepers hands that break from touching the ball
 and other countless bugsfrom previous editions im tired to mention see fm community forum

but no this is the most polished version ever maybe in recent years it is the best but it worries me that they market this as the best when released in this state worries me for future games of si jk you lost me this year as a customer

year after year under delivering and then seeing the ceo miles being proud of this shite on twitter means this game is doomed looking forward to in game character customisation  the face paint unseeable watch and scarf has been top additions maybe monetize it like fifa as well

still setting up a save

#####

prepare for addiction

#####

better than shita 24 sorry fc 24

#####

turned the weans against me

#####

nothing has really changed its still basically paying 40 for a database update been playing since cm on amiga and the first fm when they all legged it

the frustrating parts for me are the obvious lack of intelligence when playing the computer

1 transfer deals are insanely favourable of the computer clubs if you try and sell a player at their value 96 of the the time you lose it doesnt really understand formmoraleconsistencyloyalty
2 the amount of dumb involved if you play in lower leagues is still total shit for example a club promoted to the premier  league cannot attract better players even if they are promoted with lots of time left in the season you have to wait until the new season actually begins and your clubs rep is increased this completely hinders squad building is completely unrealistic and changes the game massively
3 squad dynamics is hosed normal people do not just lose their shit from being removed as vice captain or not instantly getting a new contract or not playing for a couple of months at aged 17 because you signed them from some brazilian team for 250k or because you told them all they played like a bunch of 10 year olds in the sunday blind league and lost 70 to barnsley at home and then the result is half your squad descending into complete depression and hatred for your management style despite you being 3rd in the league and clearly in contention for the title
4what the hell is the point of repeated duplicated questions in press conferences which are clearly designed to influence morale and in terms performance there is such massively obvious weighting in your responses to these its painfully boring af and makes me want to scratch my eyes out with a rusty spork sort it out si the press dont repeat the same nonsense in real life and the answers are far too limited theres a complete lack of ai and general intelligence here it was cool for a few years but ive been answering the same question and smiling warmly for far far too fucking long just to maintain my squads unbeaten 7 game run
5 coaching your players are unhappy with training  except it doesnt actually matter wtf you actually do here they are always unhappy regardless of how well your team has done being promoted 3 times on the bounce and establishing yourself in the premier league within 5 seasons
6 how have you still not developed a tactical editor which lets you manually position your players with complete freedom have you ever actually tried to position 3 centre back together in a 352 manually during a game  lmao
7 chairmanboard negotiations are still dumb oh you have 13 coaches and have won the league and the champions league 6 times in a row have built up 500 mill in the bank sry m8 nah you cant have another coach on 45k a week  gonna ruin us
8 mangers need more control real managers manage football clubs from top to bottom if i want to sack margie the tea lady and old bill the 1 legged kit man so i can free up 500 a week to give my star striker in the caravan south east div reserves then i should be able to thats some basic heres a slider redistribute the wealth as you see fit functionality
9 more things ive forgotten
10 i will continue to play i love it but where are these basic things more camera angles chairman and owner modemore customising youve got all the footballer details spot on but its like playing the same game over and over every year without updating the tiny realistic business details 


#####

so many bugs so far
goalkeeper injury  broken bone almost every game
long shot everyone is now scholes my libero with 5 long shot scores a screamer every other game
def throw in no way to defend its scary than penalty
j league wrong rules players and coaches missing hg players not counted as hg players
player interaction broken as hell

#####

the only place i legally can stalk minors

#####

why my fiancee let me get this game weeks before our wedding ive no idea

#####

i lose my life to it if you wfm and are busy with work keep your computer off during work hours

#####

except the defensive third rotations which are a nice touch there isnt a thing in this game that is working correctly
ridiculous own goals and mistakes from defense and gk
attributes mean nothing in away games your players play like sunday league in 8 away games out of  10
opp gk regularly get 7 rating against you for no reason then returns to be subpar against other ai teams
st roles are purely there for decoration f9 tq af p dlf they all behave the same they stay central sit in the box run in behind more or less depending on the duty and they dont roam no matter which instructionppm you give them
winger roles are designed to make you lose the ball they get pressed down too easily and forget how to dribble or pass 8 times out of 10
this game should be renamed table foosball manager the whole am strata behave like theyre linked by a metal bar and they all move and attack at the same time same for the st roles
the through balls in this edition are so badly executed it hurts
the average decisions even with high attribute specially in away games are mostly rubbish
the instructions roam from position and move into channels do not work
the players stay static in their zones and make this edition boring to watch
most ai manager play with either iwbifb or both even when they dont have the staff for
the final third imposes a hidden timer on your players based on tempo once the timer is over the player with the ball shoots no matter what again rubbish decisions
once you get to the final third there is no role in the am and st strata that is intelligent enough to pull back or wide from the box to recycle possession or draw defenders they all behave like bulls and sit in the box

#####

i like emails

#####

intermediaries are my favourite update from any fm it just makes it a lot easier to get rid of dead weight or sell highvalue players who have no market interest

#####

another year another fm 

sadly just like last year sports interactive marketed well only to under deliver on their much promised most polished version ever currently the game is a mess ai squad building key feature this year is terrible players are still being bought and not played youth teams become empty squad rotation doesnt happen 

player interactions another key feature are just as wild 

match engine another key feature is wonderful in attack yet defensively is a nightmare 

and the japanese aleague super feature license is halfbaked 

sadly sports interactive and sega are the defacto football manager game at the moment so they can get away with these terrible releases its a shame really as the me defending aside looks great this year and the processing speed is lightning fast even with a huge database 

i just wish someone would muzzle and reign in miles jacobson from over promising every damn year and let the team fix legacy bugs before adding new halffinishedforgotten features that cause new issues 

as it currently stands i do not recommend this game hopefully one of the two allotted patch windows prepostwinter update will fix the majority of them hopefully

#####

too few changes to justify a new game every year feels like im playing 2022 version which already felt like i was playing 2015 version

edit so i played in serie a took control of genua rebuilt them and 2 years later  im in the title race i end up finishing level on points with milan they had better goal difference i had better head to head i beat them home and away i got the title winning animation at the end of the final match and then the game told me that i need to have 2 more play off games at the end of the season cool
i win the first game at home 31 second game happens 3 days later and half my squad went on international duty why is there no option to have players stay at club or at least ask them to do it and fight for the title that the club didnt win for like 100 years it wasnt even world cup or euros year so why would they prioritize some random ass friendly matches over whats basically a final anyway 30 loss at milan title lost back on the grind

#####

besides some really odd graphical issues this version of fm is pretty solid ive been kind of taking my time to get through the seasons and this works for me im going to try an win bundesliga before the new one comes out and then ill start a campaign in the americas to wrap it up i might even do a full usa league ascension from usl1 division to the mls ill have to download them but the steam workshop and tutorials on yt make things very simple i know next years with do away with all of this but si have done a decent job with this one

#####

i am not a dreamer i am a football romanticjürgen

#####

thank you saudia arabia for helping me flip all my aging players for stupid money realistic experience

#####

fm 24 really stole my life

#####

its already 5am fuck

#####

compared to fm2022 this is basically just a roster update for 60 euro which is ridiculous

95 of the game ui and dialogs is unchanged

#####

is this a joke 15 years the same unrealistic match engine sport interactive what the hell so greedy

#####

played it for a little bit pretty nice

#####

there is something incredible strange in this game more than ever i feel the game no matter what the tactic already chose what the results gonna be first of all i dont know what is the matter with away games but i completed 2 seasons with united and it always went something like every 20 home games i won 18 on them every 20 games away i win 5 or 6 no matter how much i tried to improve my tactics mentality etc  another very strange thing happened when i was playing a 2 division portuguese team that their goal was just not to go to 3 division and i just spent all season playing with a low block counter attack team with the most subhuman players you could ever imagine and ended up on a almost 20 win streak game and in the end being promoted to the 1 division or funny enough my first 10 games on this 1 division were  just draw and losses playing the exact same football with a very similar team like wtf 

maybe its just my experience but everything seems soooo weird and most of the time not even fun i just think theres something strange going on about this fm but maybe its just me

#####

if you never played any other football manager game then i recommend it
if you did then its not worth getting it at full price its basically the same as the previous 45 editions with a few tactical things added or modified that dont really impact the gameplay that much 
there is still a huge problem regarding ais decision making intelligence and men management especially when it comes to young prospects and old players most of the teams will use an old player until he retires or he becomes unusable instead of trying to develop prospects with really high potential  a good example would be endrick in my psv save in 2026 he still hasnt debuted for real madrid and is only a player for their third team most of the time you cant buy players that are under the age of 18 because they dont want to move even if your team is much better than their current one

another big problem youre going to meet if youre trying to build a better league is the way the rival teams will make transfers or add staff most of the time they wont improve their coaches and they will make mediocre transfers that dont improve them 

the red flag when it comes to player values is that almost every other average player that is a bit decent is worth 50m even if hes only got 2 years of contract lets say this way they keep resigning with the same team and you barely see any realistic transfers like in real life or any free transfers

the visual system is still outdated even if they improved it a bit its almost the same as football manager 2013 looking like an online free football game from the late 2000s

#####

not many of the new features actually work

still not able to start a functional japan save despite it being a headline feature

the match engine is much improved but other than that ive not noticed any massive difference to fm23

i love fm been playing for nearly 25 years since cm 0001 i buy the game every year and will continue to do so but its important that a monopolistic company with demonstrably limited appetite for feedback takes note of how a significant portion of its most dedicated player base feels

unfortunately miles only seems to care about the steam reviews these days so here we go


#####

its too similar to the past 10 games in the series the series needs a complete revamp better ui new designers and developers with all the money they drained from players over the years its still an excel spreadsheet very lazy and low effort

#####

totally not worth the price barely anything changes from previous games last i bought was 2021 game barely changed since then wait 2030 for a change maybe the company basically sells the same game every year at full price with a database refresh game mechnics are still flawed 

its also a clicky simulator press continue 50 times between each game press conferences are all the same players are all drama queens bringing just annoyance 

players have 30 attributes and in the end only two or three of them matters buy players with high determination he will shoot goals from 25m shot even if his shooting skill is 520 dev of this game loves to add layers of game mechanics which are very time consuming for players but in the end of almost 0 impact on the outcome of your save wanna spend time on crafting special training well does not change anything want to avoid players injury by resting them well they will get injured anyway during rest time and even during tactic session in the dressing room why because its primarily random 

sound design is catastrophic same as a game from attari computers

hire good staff barely changes anything to players development 95 of their development track is precalculated in hidden stats 

if you play a team playing in an amateur league you will see the exact same match actions tactics pace etc as if you manage a team like man city games are all the same whether its good teams or bad team vs each others 

i wouldnt be negative if they had been developing this game for 3 years but its in development for 15 years every year sold at full price for such little improvement over time 

game has turned into a cash grab very sad

#####

g

#####

way better than i think most of us fm veterans expected

#####

good as always

#####

yes i can recommend the game but with some reservations i am playing football manager since fm2008 this is the first time i feel i didnt do justice to my money with my day1 purchase    
  
  first of all this is a huge complex simulation game lots of players staffs in the game and their interaction hundreds of matches and its calculation there bound to be some bugs happen at release unfortunately this year the bugs were more than doubled none of them are gamebreaking but definitely many of them are immersion breaking   
    
    some bugs regarding ai managers and clubs decisions making this game very easy to break you will not feel challenged enough ai manager will not make subs and you can change 5 subs and win the game during last 1015 mins ai transfer still very weak they are buying players but not playing them or playing them in different positions making the player underperform ai players also making stupid decisions during transfer by chosing lesser team with respect to money or competition etc 
    
    steam doesnt allow number rating so i cannot say this is a 6 out 10 game so officially i selected recommended but with some reservations if you liked older fm then this game is immersion breaking if you are a newcomer this game is easy to exploit but you wont be challenged enough by ai   
    i hope si fixes this in future till then i will go back to fm23

h1b2 game experience  bh1

one of the standout features is the ability to import existing careers from football manager 2023 providing continuity for players deeply invested in their managerial journeys the game also introduces individual targets for players adding a layer of personalization to team management however its crucial to note that at the time of this review some information is still pending approval by rights holders potentially affecting the accuracy of realworld data

user reviews reflect a mix of opinions with some players praising the incremental improvements in the match engine the longoverdue upgrade addresses issues like player movements spacing and ball physics creating a more realistic and fluid gaming experience however there are still minor concerns such as premature anticlimaxes related to var rulings and occasional lackluster goalkeeper movements

while some users report a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience with no major issues others express dissatisfaction with the games current state complaints range from licensing problems particularly with the japanese leagues to ai squadbuilding issues where computercontrolled teams sign players without logical utilization the champions league format is also criticized for drawing clubs from the same countries against each other diminishing the authenticity of the competition

the introduction of new features like set piece coaches transferroom and the real world and your world game modes receives mixed reactions some appreciate the depth these additions bring to squad management while others argue that certain changes such as player interactions and squad dynamics feel unpolished and unpredictable

a recurring concern is the presence of bugs and the games reliance on denuvo drm prompting frustration among users the dissatisfaction is further exacerbated by licensing discrepancies especially with the heavily promoted japanese leagues not being fully licensed as advertised

h1b3 verdict  bh1

best fm

#####

head kick

#####

now the game has been updated i can recommend it the state it was in at release was unacceptable however  the match engine this year is a joy to behold

#####

tldr this is a must buy for every fm player and this is the best that fm has been in what it feels like a forever of copy and paste
if you havent played before than this is the best time to try it
i have been more than ecstatic with what i experienced and without a shred of doubt i will recommend it every day


well gather along gentlemen as its that time of the year again football manager 24 well the arabs are here and they mean business
starting off id like to just outright put it out there that fm24 is actually byfar the most complete and if i may the definitive edition of fm there are a lot of features in this title update and this has been so far my smoothest experience for fm till date si has huge plans for fm25 and i have never been less hyped for it than now after playing a good chunk of fm24
fm 23 was an actual turd when it came to what new features it brought to the newer title but this year fm is as feature packed as it has ever been there is everything that you need and plus theres even more that you mightve never thought you needed but its still here
starting off with the actual gameplay its so fucking smooth i have been just watching the football roll left and right and bounce everywhere and god am i edged already it is an orgasm to our eyes how well the player motion and football motion is this year
the lighting is brilliant as well and some of those evening matches look as good as theyll ever look
hiring intermediaries is one of the most needed features as well especially when you need to get rid of sergio roberto like deadwood with ceiling high wages
the overhaul for setpiece training is also a very good touch i havent totally indulged into that but great to know its there when i need to
setting targets guys hear me out please set targets i cant explain the feeling when a player asks for unjustly high playing time and then i set a target for him to complete if completed he gets the play time if they actually play like that then looks like they actually deserve it and mostly when they dont neither do i have to promote them and nor do they reject the contract and shake the team dynamics
the real world career mirrors the first season transfers and limits the transfers for the rest of the window and it is such an amazing and true to life way to play and goes miles towards actually feeling like a real life manager of your favourite team

#####

the game is the most complete version of football manager from the recent changes i like the new ball physics and transfer offloading options through intermediaries and agents the set pieces system seems nice but potentially may be abused with certain setups so i need more tinkering with it saudi clubs are feeding clubs with money but feel like reality this is the most stable game i highly recommend as the unity game engine in fm25 bears a significant risk

i hope the game developers will include more match statistics so i can do even more cool analytics stuff with the moneyballfm website moneyballfmcom

#####

you know the game engine is terrible when you hit the post 5 times a gamei only buy fm every 2 years to check improvements and honestly its got no better over 10 years your team dominates with 80 possession and gets rinsed 30 clearly scripted matches mean player ability counts for nothing constant disallowed goals and again the worlds biggest posts

its a no from me

#####

i always tell myself i wont buy the next edition of fm because of minimal changes and promised features that either never materialise or never live up to hopes so of course i bought this on preorder and of course regret it 

as with past releases the early days of fm24 are full of bugs that make the game lose its enjoyability  goalkeepers repeatedly getting injured for catching the ball shotgoal conversion rates being way out of sync with reality with regularly unrealistic sky high numbers of goals being scored across a season player interactions being the equivalent of managing toddlers who dont follow the most basic common sense arguments and all that doesnt even mention the features  a jleague billed as fully licensed being included in its bare bones dynamic revenue streams linked to success being no different than any other edition and plenty of other things that dont live up to expectations

i am sure given time si will fix the bulk of these things and at that point the game will be worth buying but until then save your money unless theres a sale going on one of these days ill actually follow through and not order these in advance but sadly its too late for me this edition its not too late for you

#####

一壶茶一包烟赛博经理当一天

#####

some cool new animations in the match engine but little else to set it apart from fm23 the big features feel like poor reskins of features weve had previously just the same info presented slightly differently

getting a little tired of the tiny incremental upgrades really hoping they pull it out the bag for fm25 and release something fresh cos this franchise whilst still being the pinnacle of the genre is in dire need of new ideas

#####

new year new game same 4231 dm am wide

#####

i cant recommend this game or football manager anymore years and years of false promises and some of the worst communication from developers ive ever experienced

#####

gets worse every year

#####

only downside is that when you turn off your laptop your girlfriend might be gone

#####

this certainly is an upgrade from fm23

#####

keeps refining and building strengths upon strengths every year

a further expansion of transfer options especially offloading players through intermediaries which is a great addition after last years scouting overhaul more indepth setpieces option although they can still be very much abused
lots of small qol improvements from ui to match engine fluidity to player interaction 
save carry over from the previous version is welcomed yet kind of unnecessary

feels like the culmination of about a 10 or so year cycle of fm releases before entering a new very intriguing unity based era

#####

same game as usual you need to play how the game is designed and wants you to play to have any chance of success you cant be your own manager and play with your own tactics

#####

ive been playing fm since i had an amiga 1200 and had to load 4 3 and 12 in disks it would take forever to load there use to be 4 of us and we would buy 4 cases of beer everyone would make sure they had a long weekend and we would play from friday afternoon until sunday evening non stop we still meet up once a month for a long weekend and play from friday evening until sunday afternoon and we still get 4 creates of beer we now take turns to goes to each others family home every year it would seem to get better but this year they have pulled out all the stops they have gone that extra yard its a lot smoother and more real o watch the matches its on of the most enjoyable fms ever we all still love it and still play the same teams all the time gillingham stockport notts county and aston villa as these are the team we support im 56 from gillingham russ is from stockport 64 billy is from nottingham 58 and steve is from birmingham 61 we all use to work together doing outside catering bars thank you fm for a great game and looking forward to when the womans game is incorporated into fm hoping thats the massive news next year

#####

not significantly different to fm23 for me to be able to recommend it especially considering the main new feature of fm24 was the jleague which isnt actually fullylicensed in the game yet which is disappointing it feels like false advertising to say one thing in promotions of the game versus what is actually released in the full version

#####

one of the main feature the jleague wasnt functioning properly upon release absolutely embarrassing and unprofessional

and wheres the imrpovement of manager ai realistic transfer player interaction the sheer amount of whiny players is a freaking joke

that being said i did find some improvements 
1 its super fast
2 the match engine is great
3 set pieces
4 it looks nicer but the bar is pretty low tho lmao

si need to stop with this kind of promises they should either delay the release or lower the price this is disappointing refunding the game rn


#####

i have won it all in europe and went to the japanese league just for the 36 year old team captain to tell me that hes not bothered by my achievements 

#####

let me see how good long term saves this year i will update this after a long journey hope the overall game performance player growth long term finances of clubs transfers tv and prize moneys for building up a nation improved this year


#####

japan has been advertised as headline feature as of release date full version 6th nov  japan league is not fully licensed if at all a blatant form of false advertising

all the other headline features are either missing at all or botched

 ai sees absolutely no improvement  the ai manager does no substitutions at all whatsoever disregarding in all the way possible the reality of the match say the ai team is down 03 at min 15 they will make their first substitution at min 87th 

 goals scored per game makes hockey teams blush  results such as 63 54 71 60 44 are the new reality horrible conversion rates double that of reality immersion breaking pass is back at 889297 

 there is no difference at all in the financial aspect of the game  no difference in how tv rights work

 no better development of ai teams in terms of squad selection and building over years stupid transfers young players see no game time except for the 87th minute sub just mentioned

 all the bugs reported and agreed as such in early access are in the game with the exception of ads boards not shown in 2d game mode for example  pep talks before the game or at ht lose their impact in morale status represented in player body language exactly one second after the whistle is blown to go on with the game 


#####

its better from the other ones

#####

is this a joke 15 years the same unrealistic match engine sport interactive what the hell so greedy

#####

very dope game with very nice graphics and carrear mode many hours of fun

#####

the most complete fm out to date feels redundant to say every year but this version feels the best out of any recent versions the updates to the match engine not only allow many more tactics to be viable but also make the game feel real never have passages of play felt as good as in this version as far as new game play features go they feel fleshed out but there is no big change is there enough change to warrant buying a new version yes 100 if you have not bought a fm in a while this a must buy if you love fm this is a must buy if you have been wanting to play fm this a must buy this game is addicting like no other and seems to have limitless playability

#####

once again the realism in this series is elite level the immersion you feel playing is so real hours go by without even noticing because football manager is so addictive even at my age i still love playing the fm series and i have to say this years is definitely the best one yet

#####

this is the worst edition of fm i played
it is all about scouting all the areas of the game stay so unclear and confusing no matter how much time and effort you put you can work on the tactics training or the staff but its useless
there is no feedback or explanation for what you doing all of the sudden your team play poorly same guys with great spirit and physical form but overnight they just cant play football for a month or two no matter if you ask same something as basic as a 442 counter attack you gonna get smack by some randos marking adaptative tactics are useless you just run a probality simulator and all your work and preparation is meaningless

realist game are ok but i really want a game fun to play and its not anymore i want to play a football coach not just a scouting nerd who gets wonderkid and throw them like its pokemon

#####

worst football manager ever

#####

relegation battle

#####

they said j league was fully licensed it isnt at least not at release false advertising is crime

#####

i always was a fan of saudi arabia mashallah brothers

#####

match engine is so badevery sucesfull tactic is forced to use gegen press with atacking mentality
most of player roles are not workingdefending is poor alot of ice hockey results
alot of bugs reletaded to cosmetic part of the game
nothing fixed after beta



#####

dissapointing

#####

best match engine to date

updated negotiations and improvements across the board for immersion and that deep dive into finding the next wonderkid never felt so good

hats off mega  upgrade on last year for me

#####

i sign player

#####

i left this a positive review originally its the most fun ive had in a fm for years and ive bought them all since 06 or 07 i cant remember which worldwide soccer manager days
anyway have to give this a negative because of the insane morale bugs that are present in this game and yeah hopefully they fix them soon but it blows my mind that nobody from si noticed these bugs were in the game  i found them after 5 hours of playing in the early access

players go apeshit over the most random things and you cannot fix their morale no matter what you do you can make promises to players and fulfill them but it will still count as failed and the player will hate you has happened to me at least 3 times i learned the valuable lesson of make 0 promises ever
what else oh i gave a harsh team talk after a bad loss once and i had a player make me promise to improve my team talks ok whatever i will  months go by hes happy with my new team talks then for no reason decides i failed on my promise and starts complaining to his teammates about me  months after the team talk  
captains demanding i sign more depth with 5 games left in the season despite not needing more depth oh and by the way i tried signing more depth to get him off my back and i failed my promise of signing depth and i had to get rid of that player

theres a lot of really bizarre interactions like this in the game that drive me crazy i cant recommend this game until they fix these and even then ill still be upset they released the game and expected us to beta test the game for them

besides the morale issues the game is fine i like some of the new changes they added from 23  theres a few weird match engine things that i wont get in to but nothing so big that it ruins the game experience

#####

its fm2023 match engine wrapped in a bit nicer rendering engine not worth the price considering all the bugs and nonsense from previous version were not addressed at all

#####

game is so scripted is actually painful to play seems the game does everything in its power to make it as hard as possible for injuries every 3 days to watching your team miss 20 clear cut changes just for the opposition just to play 1 long ball past all defenders and of course score the goal also when you are ahead 21 in 80th min will be a chance for the opponent every single second oh but when your losing 21 no changes from 50 mins to end of the game my team has played 27 games this season and hit the bar 44 times and the post 31 times like wtf is this pure bullshit game

#####

worst fm so far  the game engine is fucked enjoy conceding all your goals from set pieces as there is nothing you can do to stop them fuck off

#####

zajebista giera tylko szkoda ze kuponow nie mozna stawiac

#####

i prefer not to speak if i speak i am in big trouble

#####

football

#####

game was great in beta since full release has felt like a completely different game and not for the better

#####

what was the point of reporting database issues for them just to be ignored

#####

love it its frustrating but thats football

#####

extremely addictive

#####

same old fm

#####

its a same scripted game with slightly adjusted graphics but same math behind which didnt change in last 5 years buy only if its your first ever fm

#####

to samo co rok temu tak samo dobre i wciągające 3 gra ideał

#####

i have been playing championship manager  football manager for decades and i love the latest edition possibly the best yet

#####

enjoyable game as usual

#####

i like how detailed and realistic this game is sometimes

#####

menu looks worse but the game is better

#####

i play from day 1 beta after 40 hours of my playtime i must say that this year fm so far are the most stable and bug free comparing to 2 years prior series yes there are some minor bugs or exploit but for me it didnt have big impact to my game at all and still within reason

there are some new features but what i like the most is on how they change color schemestyle when playin on 3d mode its refreshing and for me the match engine like how players moves are more fluid and natural

if you own fm23 already i think this year fm24 are so so in terms of whether you should get it or not you can save money for fm25 next year that si said will have new engine and much more new features for this year you can get custom database from many fm site like fmscout so you can still play fm23 but with new market transfer for 2324 season

final score 710

#####

i am playing fm series for the last 15 years and oh my is this onefm24 the best one i have ever played
already on around 100h and cant get enough of it
engine is so much betterball movement is incredible and player movement is over the top
only words of praise for devs and team that made it this yeari can only imagine what are they gonna do next year in unity
im enjoying it so much every second of it

#####

its a bit of a mix

the match engine is the best its been in a long time you can make all kinds of interesting tactics work well its not a case of having to play in a specific way with one exception  the pressing ill explain that below

the core issue is that fatigue has a pretty low impact in order to have fewer injuries and generally be less of a problem than it should because players always complain about injuries if you try it youll see you dont even need to rotate that much long injuries are rare and you can play pressing all season by just giving players rest days from training the side effect is that even crappy ai teams can afford to play a hard press all season with relatively little drawback and of course pressing hard makes them more effective than they should be able to other than buffing bad teams this also leads to a climate of mayhem in the games because everyone is running around like crazy and you get some wacky results and leagues

one more issue is that morale is more overblown than usual goes for you and the ai you can ride a morale wave to a season of invincibility or you can have a rough patch just because a couple of guys complained about playing time and your rival then rides the morale wave to a season of invincibility morale matters but in this version its oversensitive

one last thing i like is that in the match engine you can now make use of players who arent fast or big they arent as useless as in the past you can even play old players who are intelligent but slow and they can still do things even at a high level team

#####

the game frankly isnt finished and is a buggy mess been playing fm for 13 years and every year the release gets lazier and lazier  in this edition

 interactions are completely broken they are totally illogical and will destroy team morale

 ai squad building heralded as a headline feature is still as nonsensical as ever young players never develop as the ai misuses them

 the argentine league is completely broken  the correct winners do not get awarded trophies instead going to other teams

 the oceania champions league is still broken and has been since at least fm10

 the j league is not fully licensed as si claimed in the game promotion players missing from the game entirely managers with fake names stadiums do not have correct names the rules are bugged an embarrassing mess

 players get called up for the wrong national teams despite them having no first or second nationality of that particular nation

 far too many goals conversion rates are almost double those in real life

 the editor is broken kits do not appear

its a mess the football management simulator genre desperately needs another serious competitor because sports interactive are just resting on laurels now and releasing lazy games every year miles jacobson will post on twitter about what a success the game has been but long time players know that fm12 was a far superior game to any of the recent editions they should be ashamed of themselves for false advertising and their pathetic attempts at qa testing

but hey at least manager face paint is in the game right

my playtime is due to leaving the game on whilst im away in reality ive played around 15 hours

#####

the games fine but denuvo

#####

ingame editor should not be dlc therefore not recommended

#####

not worth for now every single edition we need to wait for patches to patch some obvious stuff like competition rules and some bugs that are carried over version by version

but now for fm24 the deliver has a lot of problems like the players tutoring overload of gols from throwins excessive complaints by the squad about lack of depth and not to mention the jleague licensing issue with some players missing

this is not how we deliver a full game after the paid beta access where they had some feedback about those issues

now to play it we need to wait one month for the first patch and will it fix all the stuff i dont know

#####

ai managers are bugged and make dumb transfers squad building and almost none subtutitions

play a few games and look at your bu21 teams only 11 to 13 players will get match gametime all others will rot in the bench this makes the youth development horrible and long term saves impossible

#####

ai is as bad as ever despite smarter ai being one of the marketed features its abysmal at squad management it doesnt rotate doesnt use substitutions  it keeps buying players without any logic

player interactions are an utter mess players are throwing a hissy fit at smallest things wage demands of players  agents are also completely broken and unrealistic because they are just based on the reputation of your club  league which makes the game infuriating to play 

for example after managing benfica for 5 months joao mario feels like he deserves a new contract to reflect his ability as a player despite him having 25 years left on his current contract i save scum to try every single option to persuade him to change his mind and none of them work then i tried to negotiate a new contract which i cant because of completely unrealistic wage demands that are far above of what i can offer now majority of my players are upset because i didnt give him a new contract that he deserves after 6 months i had 5 players asking for a new contract with the same reasoning and all of them asked for 20k30kweek more than my current highest earner

#####

too many injuries in friendly matches fm really needs to tune down the aggression of ai in friendlies
doesnt matter how i set my tactics the other team is out for the kill like its a cup final

#####

this year the match engine is great looks stunning  much more price worthy than the minor upgrades of the past few edition

#####

as an avid gamer and a fan of the football manager series i approached football manager 2024 with high expectations unfortunately ive encountered several frustrating issues firstly simulated games lack substitutions entirely which makes me question the ais effectiveness and detracts from the realism of the game experience additionally despite promises of a fullylicensed j league ive noticed a disappointing absence of real players and logos which diminishes the authenticity of managing in japan also the ais squad building appears to still be lacking in depth and intelligence undermining the new features that was promised i honestly feel scammed and mislead

#####

im staggered to be honest while theres pretty improvements in the match engine its overwhelmingly disappointing 
ive purchased 8 of the last 10 editions and have thousands upon thousands of hours on it  its gone very very badly
i can waste plenty of time on it but the underlying quality has grown so poor its saddening the bug reports forums suggestions raised issues are either ignored or utterly dismissed
i wish id looked further into the forums before purchasing this is by far not the first year this has happened but it feels the biggest stagnation on important matters

do not waste the money until you are sure si is going to behave less toxically 


#####

so far so good only played 117 hours which compared to previous fm games is nothing wrexham save well and truly under way

#####

unfortunately cannot recommend the game in its current state due to serious and immersion breaking bugs compounded by another year of false advertising or features not working as presented or at all 
overall sad and disappointing as this was supposed to be the most polished fm ever 

match engine has overall improved but aspects of the match experience are both game breaking such as ai not making subs unless players are injured excessive goals scored and conversion rates teamtalks not working 
graphics features not resembling marking videos such as shadows almost nonexistent 

jleague not licensed as marketed which wouldve influenced lots of peoples purchase decision 

the game has not changed from beta to full release at all which is the second year running which again is very disappointing 

i may change my review once ive seen significant change but until then this is my feeling and thoughts about this release

#####

better than the last game as usual 

#####

игра во 10 из 10

#####

7 hrs already

#####

we cannot replace him we cannot  pep guardiola

#####

ssdy

same sht different year

#####

game feels unfinished too many bugs and some of the headline features dont exist

#####

i like what they did to the match engine and overall game speed 
i feel this game is a step in the right direction cant wait for next year though d

#####

i have bought every version of the game for 30 years  this version is the first one for years that i genuinely hate  it feels like torture rather than fun playing it  ensure you choose the one correct team talk option or you are getting nothing out of your players   they will just sit there unresponsive and then go out and play like braindead morons on the pitch  

wining by a couple of goals and comfortably on top with only a few minutes left  then make sure you make the exact tactical change the ai wants you to or 8 minutes of added time is coming and 2 late goals for the opposition every time without fail  

defensively your players can only do two things hack down everything that moves or constantly wave them by on their way towards your goal like a good citizen helping an old lady cross the road  finding any type of consistent balance seems impossible

want to play 442   no chance

football manager has always been about building the team the way you want to and playing football the way you want to play it  all too often this version of the game forces you to do almost everything the way it wants you to or you are not winning  

sorry but really nice cosmetic changes dont stop this from being the worst version in years


#####

just another repackaged edition im not sure if fm run out of ideas if maybe the tech isnt available yet to improve to the game  or what but i see no improvements the very least fm could have sold us an update instead of advertising a new game which this clearly isnt if you havent already brought this years edition i can tell you youre missing nothing from previous editions

#####

frustrating
i love a challenge however fm24 delivers an abundance of desk thumping monitor punching sofa kicking moments that are simply put absurdly unrealistic
half way line own goals three goal leads lost within injury time staggering amount of draws and a clean sheet is as rare as rocking horse #t
a real disappointment

#####

unfinished product misleading advertisment
doesnt deserve full price

#####

the match engine is getting worse and worse every year and this ai joke

#####

at least they did graphic update finally and the game now feels better in that regard still same problems as ever though its so expensive and yet the developers are so lazy year after year after year it really wont matter much what you do what tactics you use or how you train or motivate your players if the game wants you to win then you win and if the game wants you to lose you lose its lazy programming at best

#####

banger of a game with ongoing support has great mod support and an extremely helpful community
one to watch and definitely worth a punt

#####

if you gonna buy a football mananger game buy this one  lot of improvement from all the other fm and still have a great engine before they switch to a new one  amazing game  highly recommend  now imma go buy some 18 yo and sell them off to bigger and richer club  no it not human traffic  it legal  they have work visa

#####

honestly they fixed most of my initial issues i still think miles blatantly lied in his advertisements of the game and on twitter but that is a character issue for him the game was not refined and still feels behind fm232 in some ways i recommend the in game editor for some occasional bugs or at least dont force disable it in your save

negatives
 the ai still doesnt rotate well so you can run into very tired teams somewhat early in the season
 they stated on the forums that some player development issues such as fbwb crossing are engine issues that can not be fixed so long term saves are stillodd
 goal scoring is still a little higher than i would like to see but its also up in real life so who knows i just know parking the bus should not consistently result in 33 draws
 defends just dont do anything sometimes cant tell if its a match engine or display engine issue but they will refuse to challenge an air ball giving attackers free headers

pros
 managers do sub somewhat intelligently i had teams bring on defenders to hold a win or forwards to chase a point the subs are early enough to make a difference with some coming as soon as half time
 beautiful match engine overall outside of the defender issue above i love the bounces and player gestures the deflections feel real and it hurts to concede from thembut that is realistic
 injuries bring a challenge without feeling game breaking lol at tottenham irl forces me to use players and formations i might otherwise not for a few games here and there

too early into my save since the update to tell if squad building is fixed but its at least playable now without major frustrations

#####

fake promises bugs that were reported in the first day of access and no word
mods deleting bug reports and real complaints in the forums
sports interactive walking back and editing their websites
miles is a cunt 
i have bought this game for more than a decade no more
i will wait at least two releases until i decide to even bother with it anymore

#####

after all this time always 1010

#####

good as always

#####

the only game that can make you feel all 27 emotions within 5 minutes

#####

following this fm series since 2007 series year 2006 its just so addictive as you play on each and every season good simulation game overall

#####

it is good

#####

time flies when playing a massive fan of the series

#####

idk what im doing but im addicted

#####

i struggle to talk to women good game

#####

absolutely the best version of fm so far

#####

awful game  seems to be way worse than previous fms unrealistic simulator and gameplay is very poor would not recommend

#####

yes

#####

spaß

#####

i absolutely love fm and this another good instalment of the franchise afc crewe to the moon

#####

great game and a 13th reason

#####

there are so many worse and more detrimental ways to lose track of time become addicted and enveloped into a boundless amazing fantasy world and come to the realization that youve kind of lost grip of the reality and ruined your life  go for it gaffer

#####



#####

enjoyed the game but found a game breaking bug after a while scouting focuses dont work and youll have to manually go through u21 u23 etc teams to find any talents

scouting and finding new talents is a large part of my enjoyment with this game series incredibly frustrating to sit two ingame years tinkering with focuses because no new players come up only to find out that theres a bug making that excersise useless

#####

spend so many hours on these games

#####

good game but just please you cannot keep pricing your game 60 bucks for just the same game with database changes and a new skin you can basically get this game in fm23 for 60 bucks in game editor should also just be free

but this is still def better then eafc since ea is just really really annoying when it comes to making games

7510

#####

my scout is still on a 6 month trip across brasil

#####

fbi come to my home and asked why i searching 15 yo boy with good ball handling skill 1010 would scouting in real life again

#####

players losing faith in you as the manager after winning a league and champions league double nothing says realism to me more than that perfect portrayal of the modern day diva football player 1010

#####

good game distracts me from the wife

#####

whether you like to micromanage your team or you would rather just focus on the big decisions fm2024 has a bit of everything for you and even better lets you play your own way

the databases are quick extensive regardless of size and you have plenty of creative freedom to build your teams

sadly the licensing and the portuguese localization leave a bit to be desired some teams have different names such as real sociedad nappoli and others but thats nothing the community hasnt fixed through emblem packs and such

strongly recommend for football lovers and management enthusiasts

#####

wondering if the games algorithm is reliable
lost 4 times in a same match after rollbacks even with a 7030 possession advantage and 2 expected goals in the last match is the outcome really based on tactics
is there someone trying machine algorithms focusing only on tactics ignoring transfers player mentality etc to find is there distinctions between different tactics and exploring which factors weigh more in the game if not then its just a simulation game with a skin of football disappointing
in fact there are some tactics created manually those may rely on player mentality so its not my concern and maybe using ml will be much faster and i didnt find one on websites its weird

#####

same as the last 3 versions of fm same old garbage

#####

loving this  game

#####

10

#####

n

#####

its alright

#####

fantastic stuff though wish the graphics were a lot better however i guess that isnt the point of the game

#####

very adictive

#####

honestly the game is great yes it may not change much every year but the game is still amazing taking your club from the low leagues to the top is a great feeling and this game by far is the best way to simulate a manager career you actually get full control of the club and feel like your really making a difference with every decision the only bad thing i will say is the in game editor should be included with the game but thats not to much of a problem  

overall rating 810

#####

fm has been very repetitive and has not been progressing much fm2024 is a bit different 
pros
match engine got improved 
goals are very realistic

cons
lots of licenses are still missing germany premier league teams 
saudi arabia market is crazy they pay unrealistic amounts to novalue players


#####

its a very fun time

#####

base game

#####

good

#####

hi

#####

i have an old alienware computer which was really good 10 years ago now it doesnt recognise the nvidia card so is just playing on the integrated video card for this reason i was concerned at getting fm24 but considering the computers limitations the game gives it 1 star the matches are really enjoyable and play much better than in previous versions well done to the devs who havent left those with old computers like me behind

#####

im busy taking flekkeroy to champions league so ill just leave my assistant manager mr cat here to have his say

#####

incredibly addictive  best version of fm yet
i get into this game much more than i do real life football

#####

in general its still a great game i like the little updates with the in game graphics the change in the transfer layout and the general level of detail  i understand this was done last year but 

like other comments have mentioned it seems they have not even attempted to fix the very serious bugs that have been in the game for years now the biggest one being the slow sometimes rapid decline of your players whenever you some elite or world class players its almost like it re balances  your side whenever you get that 45 star rated new signing very demoralising when trying to build a side 

the worrying thing is though this bug was in the 2021 version the last one i bought and it still hasnt been fixed are people paying 45 for basically a database update its really not on

#####

very good game

#####

i like lamp

#####

cdfghfjkll

#####

its the known and trusted fm experience with some new tweaks 
the differences from fm2023 is not that massivenoticeable think of it as a new iphone its pretty similar to last gens model and the differences are more apparent the older back you look 

so if you are a newcomer someone that hasnt bought a new fm game in a while or a hardcore fan i am sure you will love this if you are a casual and already own fm2023 the new features might not get you as excited though

#####

the best is yet to come

#####

this is basically just fm23 which was an awful game itself with some little tweaks like the game modes which arent really all that special i wish i could take a team recruit a certain type of player and play beautiful football but doing that you can see results like man city losing at home against luton man city havent lost at home for a year or so biggest thing for me is cm position being null now instead having to have two dms and a bunch of cms retrained there just to get something working they say something new and big will come for 25 but the lack of anything this year how could i want to purchase do better si do better miles your game is awful

#####

everything

#####

fun

#####

good game


#####

im just gonna play 1 hour
10 hours later  wtf happend to time

#####

#####

#####

good game

#####

best game   

#####

forgot to shit until my ass gonna blow

#####

i am really surprised how few people play this game it is once again a masterpiece if you like football and you think you understand it you should definitely try it out and see if it is really the case

#####

solid

#####

 belter

#####

fun game

#####

best fm so far

#####

seviyoruz bu oyunu kopamıyoruz her sene tekrar tekrar alıyoruz

#####

the addiction begins again

#####

i enjoy it as much as the past games

#####



#####

stupid game using 100 cpu

#####

its such a fun game


#####

milking the ip for one last hurrah worst updates of any fm they couldnt even be bothered to update the me with the data update
fm2024 was a pump and dump

#####

lost my job and friends thanks to this but at least dinamo bucharest finally won a ucl

#####

ljudi  ovo je fudbal

#####

false advertising with the jleague not being fully licensed at launch and then si changing their marketing material after people noticed

#####

been playing this series since 1996 bought the game early access basically the same game on release date they havent updated the database at all since early access havent fixed the following bugs
teams not subbing players
player interaction unpredictable
teams stockpiling and not playing youth players
gk still getting injured too often
team morale too crazy
even the jleague license still hasnt kicked in

all these were reported on the forums and they didnt even inform us that it wouldnt be fixed on release day

i will review this again once they release the patch

#####

too many bugs regarding ai making bad transfers and not being able to use subs all makes for a poor game newgens development also broken if these things get fixed in future patches its worth buying but right now the game is basically still in beta for teh next few months unless things get patched

#####

too many keeper injuries ai managers not making substitutions j league not licensed as promised still too many big moneys signings not getting game time and limited squad rotation from ai meaning

#####

i got so good at it the fa offered me a role in the england setup i took woking from the conference to the champions league in 6 seasons stuff like that doesnt go unnoticed

#####

really huge improvements in both match engine and tactics for me its the best fm in the last few years 

good job si

#####

hi im addicted and this is my 10th year playing football manager 

i recommed signing the contract with the devil that is sports interactive and let them take your life and soul away while you enjoy the wonders of playing in obscure leagues get to know unknown players and cry when they want to move to a bigger club

#####

good

#####

top game like always this year better animations make your matches unforgettable 1010

#####

swear every time a new fm releases half the discussion is just cope from people yelling about issues that are easily solvable

waaah too many injuries literally just change your training intensity rest players when theyre fatigued or if you have a severe skill issue theres reduced injury editor files 

please can we get some valid critique of si and you know the numerous actual problems with the launch of the game like the jleague license and not your whining

game is decent definitely the final form of fm on this engine which is admittedly dated hence the fm25 engine change announcement ages ago still has some nice qol improvements and runs incredibly well idk what they did to optimise the game but this is the first fm ive played where the game actually feels responsive more than 70 of the time loading simming navigating thru stuff etc etc is all noticeably and measurably quicker and the match engine is pretty buttery with minimal jank def recommend if u wanna run this on a macbook runs great on even a base m1 air although ive mainly played on pc

j league licensing  squad reg rules are still broken if you want to start a j league save get one of the many j league fix editor files theres a couple actively maintained ones rn on the sigames forum if youre bad at the game theres editor files to cut injury rates and if youre still whining about press conferences please get your head checked for moderate to severe brain damage and delegate your life to your assistant manager still unplayable after a month bro if the game is unplayable for you  rn youre using a toaster or you just stuck your hand in one

tldr if you know you spend more energy complaining about things  with easily accessible fixes than actually using them dont buy if youre running some couple generations old hardware an m1 mac or something similar the performance is night and day

#####

8 hrs already
here we go again

#####

i figured fm24 would have few improvements or new features since they announced fm25 would have a whole new engine earlier this year but despite that theyve gone and improved so much if youre the kind to buy fm every couple years this is probably one to sit on for a while its worth it

#####

i feel like don carlo

#####

i buy it every year and this is the best yet nice new features and love the new match engine 
910


#####

still the best football simulation out there

#####

if you like fm then youll like this one if you have 23 or 22 you might be fine skipping it tho

#####

back to godaan game terkutuk hahahahha

#####

i mostly use steam for football manager throughout my experience playing the game every year fm24 has obvious changes within the game and the big difference in the smoothes ingame is something to be excited about

#####

another year of false advertising where is bestter lighting during game better ai squad building licenced j league ai transfer improvements but numbers are good for si so they will keep doing what they have been doing in the past few years

#####

good

#####

another bug filled mess that needs to be patched asap

#####

im really not happy about this game  i have played fm games for a number off years and this is the worst one by far for game crashes i have now given up trying to play it now so so so sad

#####

some really useful updates main improvement is intermediaries and agent generated offers for transfers makes it much easier to move players on

#####

igra je odlica svaka preporuka

#####

loving the new match engine animations we are getting ever closer to real life this will be the final edition of its kind so it will always hold a special place in my heart ive got over 1k hours in every edition going back over 10 years that probably says a lot more about me than anything else but what i will say is yes it doesnt always make as much progress year to year as youd like but it is in a constant state of evolution and i feel like we are at the point of culmination for a lot of those features 

get yourself a newgan face pack and generator they are very easy to set up and youll have completely real faces for  your generated players which can turn a 23 season playthrough to a 1020 year one

#####

im still setting up my staff and training schedule great stuff

#####

challenging and fun

#####

ez game ez lyf

#####

much better and more indepth than ea 24


#####

love this game think this version is the best yet and improvements have made it feel more like real life

#####

several bugs reported during the beta and that si acknowledged and claimed to be working on are still present in the game a month later interactions are seriously broken any player becoming unhappy is immediately supported by the entire team regardless of hierarchy rep and social groups yknow the features that are supposed to influence how squads react to a player being unhappy for anyone thinking haha skill issue go check the si bug forum where they have repeatedly acknowledged and promised to be working on interaction bugs unfortunately its not the players its the game 

i got 24 after playing 22 for a couple of years running and honestly i have been so disappointed the only area that has improved is how the match engine looks everything else has declined we can only hope that 24s poor performance so far is because theyre going all in on 25 with the complete overhaul theyre promising

#####

great entry in the series little qol improvements across the board the squad planner feature is great and the whole game feels polished

#####

best sports management game by a mile

#####

it comes with its struggles but after my 1011 hrs i can say this game is clear of fifa career mode it does have its faults like graphics and sometimes stupid var deicisions dumb luck overpriced players its got them hidden gem wonderkids that are yet to be discovered and a big database you even get new unheard of players id give this game a 810 i mean i stream it on twitch mysticflxmezz so it has to be good if i want to play it on stream but yeah seriously give it a try and if your unsure hop on my streams ill showcase the game and hopefully you buy it

#####

balls

#####

its great


#####

good football i like football mmmmmmmmm

#####

started unemployed now fan of a team in finland 1010 would play 5000 hours again

#####

this is the type of game that you make it as hard as you want its easy if your doing whatever you want once you figure it out but if you limit yourself and choose challenging clubs it alot more fun

#####

great as always 3

#####

editör tamda bunun için var

spreadsheet simulator 2024

#####

to the developers of si
i play its simplified chinese editionwhen i read the scouting report of the player frimpong of bayer leverkusen it said his contract has a cancelling clause which values 40m but i then checked his contract by editor it said the  cancelling clause which actually values 82m please fix this bug thx

#####

its good  i have played lots

#####

good game

#####



#####

too difficult

#####

its important that game has some funny flags all around it but they didt get the rules right for 11league in europe all mistakes were reported as soon as beta came out but it looks like the devs didnt have time to tweak 2 things in editor shame on si

#####

good adjustments made looking forward to getting middlesbrough to the prem utb

#####

tis fun

#####

i love football  soccer and this game satisfies my passion for the game

#####

i like this game but i would not recommend it late release late winters transfer update and it has been the same game 7 years now i mean yeah ofc you add more staff to the game  but we dont want that what we want is improve the most used fixtures like scouting scouting plays a huge role in the game and needs an update  not more scouting tabs but better and improved core scouting system that also gives quality of life fixtures and this is only an example

#####

much better than fifa career mode

#####

better every year

#####

i think its football

#####

unrivaled depth unrivaled replayability unrivaled realism unrivaled excitement and unpredictability it is without a doubt one of the most successful strategy simulations ever created in the history of our world if you love football you will go completely crazy playing this game and lose your life forever

#####

no game compares when it comes to football simulation
