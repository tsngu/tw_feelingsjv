the game name says flatout but do not think of it as flatout it is not even made by same developers as the original flatout flatout 2 and ultimate carnage this is made by team 6 team 6 has not made a single good game ever and this is not exception

this game is absolutely horrible i do not recommend it for anyone
the physics are one of the worst i have ever seen in racing game
crashing does not feel good when it should in this type of game
the graphics look just ugly even the first flatout from 2004 looks better than this in my opinion
there is not even a proper career mode just a boring challenge mode that has random single races you can complete
this game is overpriced it should cost 55 at max and even then i would not recommend the game to anyone

play the good old flatout instead or check out wreckfest by the developers of original flatout games bugbear entertainment that is the true successor to flatout

do not buy flatout 3

my father smoked his whole life i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him if you ever want to see your children graduate you have to stop immediately tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake he gave it up immediately three years later he died of lung cancer it was really sad and destroyed me my mother said to me dont ever smoke please dont put your family through what your father put us through i agreed at 28 i have never touched a cigarette  i must say i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because your game gave me cancer anyway

#####

just bought this game to give it a negative review

#####

i want my money back

#####

this game is rubbish if you loved flatout 2 or uc then dont buy 
flatout 3 features cars that have some of the worse systems of damage eg you trade paint and explode you hit someone face on no damage maps that have the track missing in places eg a map where you have to jump across a black hole and never make it including the ai zombies that should be road cones they dont move graphics that are worse then flatout 1 maps that have nothing in them called off road maps 
this game was not made by bugbear it was made by team 6 think pizza dude and taxi raser it is the same quality

#####

the best part of this game was the exit menu really well detailed very simple to understand with yes or no in plain and simple english overall the exit menu was extremely well crafted the rest of the game is a dumpster fire

#####

when my kids misbehave i make them play this as punishment

#####

yikes

#####

are you kidding me what is the point of this garbage release
this is a serious downgrade from the awesome flatout 2 this is clearly made by some cheap company that just bought the title so they could get sales a scam  bad driving mechanism bad soundtrack bad graphics and horrible level design its not even worth 1 on sale




#####

i support global warming so team6 studios in the netherlands sinks faster into the ocean

i will never mentally recover from this

game was gifted to me by a friend hence why im tagging it as having received the game for free

having the dishonour of being one of few items on the steam storefront to hold an overwhelmingly negative review score among steam users bflatout 3 chaos  destructionb is an absolute travesty of a flatout game if not of a video game in general one does not even need previous experience with the preceding titles in the series even outside of comparisons to its vastly superior predecessors flatout 3 falls flatstrikeoutstrike on its face

the key distinction that needs to be made here is that the creators of the flatout series bugbear entertainment ihad nothing to do with this titlei after the release of flatout 2 they were asked by bandai namco to develop iridge racer unboundedi and to make up for their absence the publisher istrategy firsti assigned development of the third title in the flatout series to bteam6 game studiosb

this is an important detail because not only it absolves bugbear of the shame related to the reputation of the series being tarnished it also gives us information on what we can expect from this title team6 are a dutch game development company with plenty of racing games under their belt most of them being remarkably low quality bug fiestas with clunky mechanics no plot or poorly written plot and unpleasant to the eye in terms of their visuals

the racing aspect of the game  arguably the most important aspect given that its you know a iracingi game  is bland and uninspired the cars handle nowhere near comfortably enough to make the races enjoyable 

before each race you can pick your character model from a variety of awful puns and pop culture references zario the mechanic ufer bull pete saman being phonetically similar to pizza man also silen einnor which is the name of team6s founder spelled backwards which changes absolutely nothing in gameplay

as for the list of racing gamemodes

list
 the race gamemode is a collection of 6 environments with 13 tracks each also existing in a reverse variant to pad out the length you get the steam achievement for completing the gamemode if you play all the races and their reverse variants the tracks themselves are filled with many turns unsuited for this games car mechanics mountain environment races will often include uphills which the cars have massive difficulties surpassing without nitrous iandi a prior rolling start 
 speed takes the player to 5 closed f1like tracks with f1like cars the experience is often spruced up by poor visibility and sight obstructions in the form of uphills before sudden turns or flames bursting from the ground and sudden cracks forming in the road in the final track of this mode nothing to write home about
 the nightshift mode is an interesting concept that perhaps could work better in a higher quality game unfortunately its stuck in flatout 3 in this mode you race against only one opponent and the weather in each track is set to a thunderstorm its meant to be the ultimate test supposedly the rain is meant to worsen the handling of your car but in my experience the cars have handled just as bad as in the rest of the game advertised as the most difficult gamemode in the game its held back by technical limitations of goofy ai able to hold good racing lines but losing its head if its sent off those lines even for a bit
list

aside from racing the series is known for its stunt and destructionfocused gamemodes flatout 3 of course couldnt fall behind though looking at what we got it probably would have been better if it had

list
 stunt man is all of the crazy ragdoll launching from flatout 2 with none of the fun often the objective is to score a certain amount of points which is only possible by hitting a specific target a 1200 point goal in a hit the target mission doesnt mean you can potentially score more than that  1200 is the bullseye the middle ring is 600 points and the outer ring is 300 points
 battle arena is a destruction derby with 12 participants destroying enemy cars is honestly harder to pull off than it really should be because the impacts barely ever seem to do anything and they sure as hell dont feel like youre actually crashing vehicles against each others
 big battle is the same thing but with 24 cars no idea why they made it into a separate gamemode
 monstertrucks is a series of 5 events focused on monster trucks push objects into goals run over props etc if it sounds bland thats because it is
 the offroad gamemode tasks you with driving through 2 courses and getting points through drifting jumping destroying enemy cars and breaking things in the environment 
 splatout is flatout 3 at its most mindnumbing you play through basically each map in the game as zombies keep spawning everywhere you sit on the map for 3 minutes or so and try to run over as many zombies as you can to score points there is no deeper meaning no strategy factor and practically no reason to devote your lifespan to well the game in general but also this mode in particular
list

flatout 3 also includes a bchallengeb gamemode which is a series of 50 events taking the player through most of the games content i can only express my commiserations to those who have subjected themselves to the mode in its entirety i felt the urge to tap out after the challenge which asked me to jump over a gap in a bus which even with full nitrous power cannot reach enough speed to pass the gap the solution is to treat the track as less of a circuit and more of a horseshoe driving back and forth between both sides of the river i dont know what team6 had in mind while designing that but by that point id had enough

all in all i sincerely bcannot recommend flatout 3 chaos  destruction to anyoneb its not one of those games that are so bad that they cycle over into being good because of how broken they are its just plain bad with very few if any redeeming factors no discount warrants the purchase of this game and i will forever curse the name of the friend who gifted this game to me 

seriously dont buy it

#####

the quit button worked flawlessly

#####

a spit in the face of all people that enjoyed any of the previous installments created by a different company offensive ugly disjointed bloted and hardly playable game

#####

this game is a disgrace on proportions which are verbally unaccounted for dont even get this if youre a huge flatout fan dont get it on sale if someone gifts this game to you delete it and just spare yourself the agony of defiling your memories of one of the most chaotically fun racing game series

its an originally licensed flatout ripoff developed by a different team trying to cashgrab with the brand name and doing an abysmal job at it

#####

i bought this game because i wanted to own the worst rated game on steam and then overwatch 2 came along 1010

#####

please dont give an ironic positive review for this game it truly deserves the tag of overwhelmingly negative reviews

#####

what to do in fo3
step 1 delete
step 2 be happy

#####

dont be stupid like me and dont buy this game its total garbage if you want nice destruction derby game get flatout2 ultimate carnage soo much better than this crap or get bugbears new game called next car game thats a great destruction derby game but still in making

the real problem with this game is that it isnt made by bugbear but by some shitty company
graphics seems at least to me like downgrade from flatout2
it have horrible original music and not licensed music from rock bands like the other flatouts
from what else i saw in that half hour i wasted on it was horrible maps like simple square with some houses around and thats it thats your city race track no destructible props at all
the throw your driver out of car minigames are worthless so much better in flatout2

my verdict its 110 one point for cool name that can charm fans like me who played and loved previous flatout games
seriously dont buy this crap hell dont even pirate it its just waste of time

ps on the other hand if you want to torture some clueless friend get this game for himher heshe will get this monster big mindfck and will do anything for you just not make himher see this game again

#####

this crap is the reason why refunds exist

#####

i didnt do my homework so my dad made me play this

#####

i have a strong urge to microwave a pipebomb after 12 minuets of playing this game

#####

had to play this for an hour because i got this game for christmas i hate christmas now thx game

#####

best uninstall simulator i have ever played

#####

id rather teabag a bear trap than to play that ever again

go play flatout 2 now

#####

this is not flatout

#####

who all bought and tried this game just to validate overwhelmingly negative reviews lol

#####

my friend sent me this game as a gift and i still paid too much

#####

would rather buy a ponhub premium membership 010

#####

id rather get railed by 4 dudes than play this

#####

this game is the virtual equivalent of leprosy it makes you miserable it makes other people avoid you and you really wish you didnt have it the gap in quality between flatout 2 and flatout 3 is astounding i can only assume that everyone at bugbear was in a coma and they passed the third game onto a group of blind baboons that dont have arms 

i dont have to talk about the game play because it doesnt have any unlike other arcade racing games flatout 3 fails to inspire a competitive atmosphere burnout need for speed splitsecond are all games that encourage you to perform better because not only can you actually understand why you would be winning or losing but also because winning in those games makes you feel cool because those are cool games flatout 3 isnt cool its really lame with characters that are ugly and 1 dimensional with all the different car options in the game it would make you think there was much of a difference in how each class plays nope apart from the speed class most classes feel very similar in terms of handling and strength not to mention that winning or losing doesnt have as much player agency as it should you could win a race with zero effort or get your ass pummeled by every other racer coming after you specifically the ai are able to take turns far better than you because of the whackass physics but its not like that matters because the ai is so stupid they will routinely crash into obstacles and on the monster truck open map type of game the ai trucks basically just drive in circles

the game doesnt even function properly not only does the game crash every time you launch it and will continue to do so several times but after trying over and over just to start you get rewarded with the worst racing game experience on earth the automatic soundtrack option in settings is to take music from your music folder that isnt actually a bad idea because it makes the soundtrack custom to the person playing this has some issues however if the players music isnt fast paced or exciting eg they listen to bob dylan it can lead to the music not matching the game the other problem is far worse though because i for instance didnt have any music in my music folder so the game had no music at all given that most people listen to music on portable devices such as phones and if they have music on a computer they likely use spodify or some other app it wouldnt make sense for everybody who played this game to have their own soundtrack also it is likely that the devs added this feature so that they didnt have to make the ost or pay someone to do it 

in conclusion avoid this game other wise you might as well set the money on fire and piss on it

#####

unfortunately flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts 
what went wrong 
gameplay has lost this catchy spirit making this game addicting controls has changed and physics as well you dont have any feeling of the vehicle you driving the game seems to be at faster pace too fast form me  too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste soundtrack is flat and colorless it isnt bad but there is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously graphisc has not made any progress it has made a step backwards as it stay in place
 flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all 

i like speed mode it has something good 

the rest is kind of fun  for about 5 minutes there is no career mode 

to be honest  flatout 1  2 have their own style and leave in gamers minds an unique impresion and lots of good warm memories fo3 does not

#####

this game made me racist

#####

i honestly just bought this game just to see how bad it really was i wasnt disappointed
please dont make the same mistake i did

#####

sobbing look how they massacred my boy

avoid this version of flatout at all costs  jump back to flatout carnage or buy its modern version wreckfest  both are much more enjoyable games

#####

why did i buy this i guess i just flatout hate myself

#####

i was not able to complete even one hour game flatout 3 chaos  destruction i at least when i bought the game expecting a flatout 2 with slightly better graphics and either innovation in gameplay its true i did not expect much out of him but what i saw is unbelievable

cade the excitement of each race in flatout 2 there is none of that here this is a completely different game where every minute in this game seem hours if you played flatout 2 please do not buy this game guarantee dissatisfaction

#####

i practised safe sex my entire adult life only to get aids playing this complete abomination

#####

got stuck in a tree

#####

flatout 3 chaos and destruction more like shatout 3 chaos and destruction am i right fellas

#####

no

#####

flatbug 76

#####

its bad

i used to believe it was good

i was stupid at the time

forgive me

#####

for those of you havent notice that they have change the developer of this game from bugbear entertainment who once make flatout 1  2 and ultimate carnage best game to team 6 studios who make flatout 3 completely out of flatouts origin so blame the studio instead of blame the game itself

#####

id rather drink my own semen mixed with gfuel than play this game again

#####

this is the second worst game ive ever played still better than overwatch

#####

heyyo dont buy this game its an insult to what bugbear the original developers of flatout created this was made by some shitbudgetrussian game studio and its every bit as bad as its metacritic score of 23  100 the text is poor it feels like a free game a college student made in a week and its nowhere near the price theyre asking for this game deserves to die buy any other flatout game or bugbears upcoming next car game

#####

no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

#####

game is meh look at this instead












#####

this is too childish bad physics bad gameplay bad graphics all flatouts look better than this a lot better i dont recommend it and i think that there are no people who liked this game

#####

better campaign than hunt down the freeman because there isnt one

#####

bad

#####

the title flatout 3 chaos  destruction was taken a bit too literal aside that great

#####

so bad it makes north koreas missle test look like a success

#####

i read all the reviews thought they were probably exaggerated and was proven wrong i have literally played one single race and that is enough to never touch this game again

a short summary
 character models look worse than n64 games ive seen this same comment in another review and it is not exaggerated
 the car selectiontuning options before a race are ridiculously uninformative
 ive seen children with better understandings of physics than the devs of this game im not saying it should be hyper realistic especially not when playing a destruction  combat racer but accelerating from 0 to 200 in less than 3 seconds and then when everything is already flying around you suddenly you need several more seconds to reach a speed around 240
 the cars are so ridiculously fast and you constantly send objects flying around you that you have no idea of where your oponents are

for me its too late ive wasted a whole 7 minutes on this game that i will never get back and again as much on writing this review if you want to torture yourself please seek help or at the very least seek better options than this game

#####

by the nine gods i have commited a great sin by buying and playing this game when i saw all the reviews i thought it would be a fun experience with my friend to see how bad a game can be i was wrong i was a fool when i started this game trhe gates to hell opened up on my screen and i saw pain and death this is an abomination that should not exist in our universe this game i believe is the reason why god is dead 
look how they massecered my boy

#####

im absolutely speechless 
this 11gb piece of crap is disgrace to the flatout series
its like bad rats on wheels
110

#####

no

#####

this game is just as much fun as having severe depression at least it made me feel something again even if it was just more pain

#####

take flatout 1 add a little flatout 2 and then smash it together like a toddler with cake throw it at the wall eat it digest it vomit it back up scrape it up and hey presto flatout 3

#####

dont buy if you expect flatout

i played flatout ultimate carnage and flatout 2 a lot and some day i saw flatout 3 on sale for around 5  totally blinded by the awesomeness of the previous flatout games by bugbear i ran into this trap without checking what i was actually buying

after playing maybe like 30 minutes i was really disappointed since i expected something like a worthy successor for ultimate carnage which flatout 3 clearly is not i uninstalled the game and considered this my worst game investment ever

some years later i installed the game again and played it for some hours to get some of the achievements and i came to this conclusion

if you expect a flatout as you used to know do not buy
well if you expect a game that looks like a bad flatout clone and is not perfect at all then you could maybe enjoy this one its actually fun to play to be honest but you need some time to get used to it and you always have to tell yourself that this is not flatout

at least there is game mode that puts you in a splatter car telling you to kill some zombies on the road  every game is better with zombies and so is flatout 3

if the game wouldnt be called flatout it would just be some not that good car game i wouldnt recommend either but as a part of the flatout game series it feels like a malicious deception to make some money with the good name of flatout

#####

please buy this game i dont want to suffer alone

#####

i lasted 10 minutes how long will you last

#####

i really loved flatout 1 then flatout 2 and flatout ultimate carnage although they were pretty much the same game the latter graphically a bit tuned up and more to do so since i bought the fo1fo2foucfo3 package why not play flatout 3 although ive heard some pretty nasty stuff about it note one of my steam friends told me to keep my memory of flatout as it was when i did install he uttered dont play fo3 uninstall and never look back 

naturally i rejected his advice because i wanted to form an opinion that i made myself how i wished i had listened the game has graphics worse than flatout 1 driveability worse than flatout 1 a damage model worse than sonys f1 20052009 and that was horrible and looks like a game made in1998 at best no even the half life 1 graphics were better 1996 1997 for the dutch in my list it looks like a2 racer the first one

just one race but enough to scrape the pieces of my flatout memory to what it was after ultimate carnage dont buy and if you do i hope you are buying the other 3 flatouts with it because this game should pay you to have you play it

updated without information for the 2017 autumn sale steam awards

#####

so i originally found this game by watching a youtube video on it and i was like damn thats a horrid game one day i was bored and it was on sale so i bought it and decided to stream it to my friends on discord to my dismay some of my friends decided to get it and we ended up playing the online mode this allowed my hubris to get to me i decided to host a flatout 3 tournament and this is how now t e n other people own the game this is the consequence of my actions this is my tragedy the shakespearean play in which i live every waking moment in dont play flatout 3 unless you are willing to lose everything

#####

better than overwatch 2

#####

so flatout 3 we are not gonna talk about flatout 3

its like postal 3 just a lot worse

#####

this game is a shame to the original flatouts if you think this is good youre an idiot and let me go into gtreat lengths about why

1 has no damage model a flatout game without a damage model is like nfs 2015 without customization

2 no career mode this dissapointed me greatly because all other flatout games had one

3 horrid controls

4 blatent ripoffs of todays popular cars like the mitsubishi evo x scroll through the car list and youll see what i mean

5 the biggest one this abomination isnt even made by bugbear this is what really gets me because its in a pack with games by bugbear and those games were and still are awesome to this day

#####

the only redeeming part that i found from this abortion of a game is that it has steam achievements where the previous games dont then again playing this game will make you question where or not youd care in the slightest to try to get them when the video settings options target framerate has an option for 15fps you know youre in for a sht show 

racing
the laughable driving mechanics feel clunkier than the 2nd saints row game and you dont need to worry about avoiding obstcales your car plows right through everything minus a building or a tree with minimal speed lose the racing aspect is pitiful and cartoonish if not downright insulting think boost is hard to come by takes some slick maneuvering to gain nope you start the damn race with max boost already let alone the cpu has virtually unlimited boost as well blast all the way down a straight away only to have the cpus a car length right behind you stuntman mode is trash instead of having multiple tries to get a specific score you have one which happens to a target that you need to hit perfectly and not a set distance or height also one of the male characters justin case has a female voice which is sadly hilarious

controls
the controls are vague in comparison to the previous games which will make you go to the control options screen youd think that you cant use a controller with the device settings on keyboard youre wrong actually switching the device setting from default to a controller option disables the controller and enables the keyboard because its opposite day when you play this game that is if youd even care to go in and manually set every single controller button in a game that has the option to use a controller but failed to auto set it for you

the only enjoyable part i found was the splattout zombie mode despite it being completely pointless for this type of game you simply have achieve a specific score but it wont tell you that you have 2 minutes to achieve that not as though it would matter anyhow its embarrassingly easy that you can complete it with your eyes closed and using one hand the game quickly turns into a personal test of how high of a combo you can get example score at least 50000 points in the 2 minutes i ended up scoring over 8 million points by driving the course and keeping a combo

the monster trucks mode proly wouldnt be half bad if it wasnt for the damn team icon floating above your car and blocking most of your view the fact that simply driving around the level and going off of jumps damages you just as much as ramming the enemy teammates your teammates are utter jackasses that actually ram you at the start if you dont purposefully avoid them and the enemy trucks can easily overpower you and just grind on you until you explode this of course will end at some point when you lose and the game crashes after the thirdfourth retry with a pure virtual function call as if the game itself is selfaware and pulls you out of the matrix

#####

the worst incarnation of this series this game was not developed by the original dev team of flatout 1 flatout 2 and flatout ultimate carnage

while the previous titles sported a delicate balance of racing wrecking and arcadelike elements this game throws it out the window and shares little in common with previous games aside from the genre of being a demolitionstyle racing game and its title

visually the game looks worse than its predecessor the two are not even comparable it looks more like a game i would have expected to play on the originally playstation or maybe an arcade

gameplaywise the cars have no real life to them and again feel like something i would expect from an arcade game i pop 1 into in previous iterations cars felt like they had weight you could slide beautifully around dirt corners drift through tight turns and could manipulate ai cars by using your forcespeedinertia all that is gone in this game even the most difficult looking turns are easily mastered by simply momentarily letting off the gas and simply hitting your left or right key gone are the days of worrying about oversteer understeer or compensating for loss of traction even the ways cars bounce off each other seems more like you are in a pinball machine getting popped around by the bumpers  you dont really have much control or force over other ai vehicles so you are at their mercy if their line gets in your way

also gone are the days of customizing your car tuning probably one of my favorite parts of any racing sim or for lack of a better term any car game in general is the ability to swap x for y and make your car your car all the white knuckle driving done to take 1st pays off for that next much wanted upgrade not here  you pick from the standard layout of cars and then you can pick from 2 or 3 different predefined tuning settings which invariably just give you more speed for less durability or vice versa but in reality it doesnt matter because every car feels exactly the same

im not usually too harsh but i cannot recommend this game to anyone if you are looking for an arcadestyle racing game i am sure there are many alternatives that would be better if you are looking at this game because youve player previous flatout games then skip it entirely as it is not the same development team and therefore not the same game at all ive just installed dirt showdown and while it seems a little different than flatout it has many of the same feelings and elements and a bit more uptodate graphics i have also heard that the original developers of flatout have been developingdeveloped already a new demolition racing game which i will be eager to check out so maybe do a quick google if you would be interested in that

#####

this game is a complete scam some dev team that doesnt even know how to make proper games bought the name to release this piece of crap and say hey buy it its flatout
but this game has none of the qualities the previous games had
graphics are unbelievably bad which wouldnt matter much to me if the game would be at least a tiny little bit enjoyable
the soundtrack which was a big plus for me in the other games is complete garbage
just like the physics engine why make a game about wrecking shit when the physics engine takes out all the fun of wrecking shit
the controls are reeeaaally clunky you will drive into a lot of stuff if it doesnt move out of the way sadly not a lot of stuff is moving out of the way
and there is a zombie mode a really bad zombie mode why the fuck did they think flatout needs a zombie mode

really dont buy this game
ever
not even on sale
not even for the hey i bought a crappy game to make fun of 5 minutes of amusement
its not even good enough for that

#####

i said to myself probably as many others how bad can it actually be intrigued by its review score that i dont usually come across overwhelmingly negative i wanted to see it with my own eyes and oh boy let me tell you that this is absolute trash it is bad in almost every possible aspect starting from graphics continuing with mechanics and ending with physics

the worst part in my opinion is that failing does not come from skill level and that might make you easily rage  i know it did for me for instance a flip might come upon a failed landing after a simple jump or the ai might be too aggressive and can turn you around from behind

the only positive aspects i found were that the achievements can actually be unlocked and there is plenty diversity in terms of game modes but thats obviously not enough to recommend this garbage

#####

this game is tagged as psychological horror for a reason when you realize you spent money to purchase this game it will leave you with such an overwhelming sense of dread you will need to be checked into the psych ward of the nearest hospital

i wanted to enjoy this game having enjoyed the first 2 games as much as i did instead im left with this scar on my steam library a constant reminder of how life serves to accomplish nothing more than total destruction of hopes and dreams 

thank you team 6 studios truly the best psychological horror game ive ever played

#####

not worth what i paid for it

#####

the best feature was the uninstal option

#####

best game to refund

#####

worst flatout game everi used to play flatout before i had a steam accounti have played flatout 2 demo for atleast 15 hoursit has been some years thoughbut look at my activity on this gamei couldnt stand itatleast i bought the flatout complete at a big sale so i didnt waste too much money on this awful game

listen to the reviews

cars are stuck to the ground yet slippery you drive up a hill at 100 mph expecting air but you stick to it as if youre in an f1 car but at the same time your rear tires will get loose from the tiniest acceleration

game looks like garbage runs like garbage and the controls are horrendous

flatout 1 and 2 are the only acceptable titles

#####

brought the flatout pack a few days ago and played this one first i shouldnt have done

graphicspoor
gameplaypoor
everything  poor

please dont bother with this game
 
im going to uninstall it now

#####

flatout 3 is one of my favorite psychological horror games  silent hill 2 should really take some notes  thank you youtube for showing me this game

#####

flatout 3 or the one where the flatout franchise shat down its legg
the first two flatout games were good fun but its third installment felt like a step backwards so big that i would have believed you if you  told me that it was released before the first game the biggest issue with the game is one that writes the whole experience off the physics are horrible cars dont feel right their acceleration turning and collision feel simply horrible you can really tell a different developer made this title

cant drive stick out of ten

#####

as a flatout fan this is absolutely horrid

#####

h1 dont h1

a few years ago i baught the flatout complete pack when it was on sale when i tried to launch this game it would never launch and i spent hours searching on the internet on how to fix it i finally got it to work just so i could find out how terrible the game is even not looking at it as a flatout game its terrible 10 minutes of gameplay and i asked myself why did steam just throw in the #1 worst rated game on steam with 3 great racing games and why does it cost more than the ones bugbear made 

b i cannot reccomend this game unless you are looking for the #1 worst rated game currently on steam b

#####

i wish i were dead

#####

i glanced at overwhelmingly negative and thought to myself 1 and 2 were great fun what could possibly be wrong with this and then i played it oh my god dont make my mistake there seems to be a ridiculous amount of characters the graphics seem to have gotten worse how does that even happen theres no music at all it seems the way the car moves is just not right its like asphalt is now ice the goddamn boost noises at the start of each race the 2 tracks i played werent particularly good this game is 7  i like racing games but you genuinely couldnt pay me to finish this i can only encourage people to buy this if it goes on sale for a 1 and you need something to laugh at

#####

 





 



 

team 6

#####

i have no idea why people are hating on this it puts my family to sleep within minutes so i can get the tv all to myself

#####

this game is not worthy to be called a flatoutgame
it might not even be worthy to be called a game

the cars are bad the steering is bad the boost is bad the gameplay is almost non existant the damage model is broken 

this game should be erased from steam my memory the world and history

#####

wow you would think with the first two games being so awesome that this would be at least kinda close to that but everything about the game sucks for literally no reason they seriously dropped the ball with this one

#####

yes it is as bad as you have heard it is

#####

no

#####

its games like this that drive you to becoming a serial killer

#####

get new vegas instead



#####

i paid just 099 for this garbage and its still not worth it this doesnt control or handle like any racing game should it opens in some weird resolution and then jumps up to another weird resolution that either isnt even 169 im running a 2560 x 1440 monitor or the textures and menus are weirdly stretched no controller support from what i can tell drifting is like floating on ice heck just driving around feels more like youre driving a jet ski around a harbor or a pond i accidentally austin powersd my car multiple times just because of how poor the handling is there are stutters in the menu when you switch cars and characters im not one to jump on the hate bandwagon im not the kind of person who just wants games and studios to fail i want indie developers to succeed i want most games in general to succeed flatout 3 is just a mess of a game though and it isnt worth your money at any price point

edit
it has controller support it just doesnt always work and its hit or miss whether or not itll register that you have a controller plugged in it also still shows kbm controls even when you have a controller plugged in and registered so thats super helpful

#####

                       no career mode














#####

the worst flatout of them all infact probably one of the worst racing games ever made which is ashame because i really like the flatout games especially ultimate carnage the gameplay honestly isnt that great it sucks infact its terrible there isnt much of a career its prity much just random quick race events and game modes car selection is not too bad i suppose ai is very ruthless they will shove you out the way if they get the chance menu music is insanely loud and so is the sound effects from the cars and engines also the controles are just dreadful

you wont like it its not a good game dont pay full price for it 110

i flatout cant bring myself to play this game for more than 30 mins 1010 best gift i could have gotten

ithis is the b6thb review of the steam redlight series a series where i purposely seek out negatively or controversially rated games on steam to see if theyre as bad as the internet says they are its accompanied by a video review that can be found burlhttpsyoutubej4h2ptrhzk hereurlbi

bin summary i cant recommend this gameb this game isnt absolutely the worst game ive ever played as steam would make it seem since its the lowest rated game but its just not worth the time the driving physics are really shallow over half of the gamemodes dont seem to be well designed or have terrible pacing and the game just overall iisnt funi
h2 introduction h2
i was recommended this game from my channel but i was already aware of it since its regarded at steams bworstb game by reviewcount anyways flatout 3 is a racing game that emphasizes on destruction as the subtitle would allude to theres absolutely no storyline but there are several game modes to cover each one briefly

list
    racing mode three laps versus several other people
    stunt mode nonracing eject your character from the vehicle in an attempt to score points at a distant target
    big battle you and 23 other cars bump uglies to get points until either you or everyone else explodes in a fiery death
    regular battleyou and 11 other cars bump uglies to get points until either you or everyone else explode in a more intimate fiery death
    monster trucks hit things with your big truck score points while doing so
    speed racing highspeed racing with hyperfragile formula cars on a circuit
    night shift a nighttime duel of racing on wet tracks
    off road race while gathering points by drifting jumping or desbtruckbtion they said it not me
    splatout hit zombies with your car get a combo get big points
    challenge you get challenged by team 6 to be a better person
list

this covers the foundation of what you need to know before we get into the good so lets move on
h2 the good h2
i found stunt mode to be the most enjoyable game mode i definitely spent the most amount of time playing it i feel like i imighti like it because it has just about nothing to do with the driving physics in the game
the game is also very memeable albeit not good ones i make some weak attempts at humor in my video

these are about all the good things i got out of it  and im sure for many these points would be moot for you nonetheless lets get to the ungood
h2 the ungood h2
the driving physics are really shallow and easy to take advantage of i get this game isnt trying to be forza or anything but its just that they lack any semblance of complexity or depth the recipe is to tap your brake or handbrake depending on how sharp the turn is to reorient yourself then hit your superboost to commit to that direction this makes just about any concretebased race including speed racing easy to complete save for getting hit by your opponents

the ai plays out pretty terribly in night shift my opponent consistently crashed on the first turn on the first map in subsequent maps it was just short of being common that my opponent would crash and then id just bnotb see them for the rest of the race in battles the ai gets stuck in loops and will just drive in literal circles even if the last two cars are just yourself and them

there are also plenty of game modes that just really seem to be poorly designed either through pacing or mechanics the racing modes save of offroad are all fine but that leaves many others to start big battle and regular battle just seem to be ioffi if i run into an opponent at full superboosted speed knocking them a quarterway through the arena and manage to do more damage to myself than to them thats just not fun that consistently happened throughout my gameplay

offroading bshould haveb been fine the downside is that theres only two maps to play on itechnicallyi theres four but thats because the two maps have been reversed its just really shallow  offroad racing is typically very fun in games but we dont get a lot of opportunity to experience it in this game to the point where i wonder why it was included at all

the two game modes that are pacing nightmares are splatout and monster trucks in splatout i constantly found myself driving slower maybe even at ispeed limiti trying to keep my combo going it really didnt seem intuitive for a racing game to make me drag my speed down for the sake of a combo  it ended up being less fun and more like a chore monster trucks suffers the same fate where the trucks seem to be just as fragile as the formula cars im not sure what drives health loss but occasionally me just popping over a steep hill would deal a percent or two without any body contact shocks maybe but its unpreventable damage that can lead to a shortened run just like splatout i found myself creeping around the map staying away from everyone else just trying to hit my targets i dont even think the ai is even trying to compete against you in this mode terrible experience

finally we come to challenge mode theres nothing challenging about this mode except for the fact that its just making you play the game youre already playing theres no special objectives or experiences to go through  its just having you complete objectives in their relative game mode with no caveats for example there are several challenges that are asking you to place in first but the experience is no different on the track  no new obstacles no weird circumstances iother than them choosing your car but theyre all normal carsi nothing new or exciting they even change up the wording of some of the challenges but are alluding to the isame conditionsi as if you were playing the game normally ie ileave them all behind youi just ask me to place first dont polish a turd

lastly minorly are just some bad experiences andor bugs i experienced
list
    the game has no tutorial
    to follow up each game modes instructions are packed into the loading screen bhoweverb the loading screen just progresses to the race without any button confirmation commonly leaving you without enough time to comprehend how to play
    specifically for stunt mode the game tells you to ihit the eject buttoni but makes no effort to tell you what that is if youre kbm its bshiftb which i had to learn by looking at the controls menu in settings
    for the offroading maps it didnt save any of my scores
    the game tracks your attempts on maps and tracks but doesnt count an attempt if you restart the level from the pause menu i played a stunt mode track for over 20 minutes and only accumulated 4 iattemptsi
list

h2 the end h2
that just about covers as much in a nutshell as i can fit theres a lot of other written and video reviews that cover different angles and i can mirror my experience with most of them in case im missing anything i figure that id cover mostly my displeasure with the gamemodes since thats what bothered me the most

in case youre wondering team 6 is still producing racing games flatout 4 isnt poorly as rated and theyve released another game in 2018 called super street the game both on steam both sitting at imixedi ratings i wonder what went wrong internally between everything post 2011 and flatout 2

idid you like this written review watch the video review which does have some different coverage not talked about herei httpsyoutubej4h2ptrhzk

#####

flatout 3 this game this bloody game i dont think this game needs any introduction as everyone knows about this game considering it is the worst rated game on steam a record that was close to being broken but has yet to be i am about to rip into this game and tell you why exactly this game has the reputation it does

history this game was actually not developed by the original team bugbear interactive at this time they were busy with ridge racer unbounded so to get this game out they outsourced this game but instead of going to someone competent they went with team 6 they were the same team who ported flatout to the wii considered a terrible port why did they outsource the game to team 6 of all people and the game suffers because of it but i guess complaining time is over lets get this over with

there is no story

gameplay the game is an arcade racer with barely any racer in the racing you have your standard arcade gameplay stuff ya know driving braking drifting and nitro the basics itd be hard to mess that up however there is a new mechanic that lets you power up after filling a meter destroying opponents in your way sound fun its underwhelming and doesnt even fully ko your opponent what a waste when youre in game youll also notice that this game has approximately 0 physics you jump you go in a straight arc without any form of weight drifting feels wrong in every way and you barely go any faster when you nitro i myself am not really a fan of how the flatout games play with how their physics work but this feels so much worse doesnt help that collisions are stinky you smash into someone and only do 1 damage but someone grinds your cars asshole for 2 seconds and youre at 25 health thanks team 6 outside of the barely functioning gameplay there are different modes including a destruction derby that sucks super derby that sucks collection mode that sucks nonlinear mode that sucks nigh mode that sucks minigames that sucks and splatout that sucks all the modes suck because the game barely functions and the ai is poo most of the time it seems like theyre drunk because they can barley go in a straight line or even turn slamming face first directly into a wall and riding it at this point id prefer the overly difficult ai in other games 110 how could this game get worse i know

graphics and presentation this game just looks so stupid its like you took the nokia arabic ringtone and turned it into graphics unorganized and messy areas do not look memorable at all and cars are inconsistent too in menus they look very dirty and messy but somehow become clean when you play also say goodbye to memorable characters with actual personality now we just have stupid parodies that arent even slightly funny and only exist for the oh i recognize that factor ugh 110

sound and soundtrack stock just stock everything about the sounds in this game is stock in fact the music is so stock and bad they give you an option to use your own which i admit would be cool keyword would why because it doesnt work what did you expect because when i tried to load a custom song that wasnt a sound effect the game just crashes nice game testing team 6 plus the game doesnt automatically advance songs or sounds in this case meaning the same sound will constantly repeat over and over until you get sick of it press the dpad to advance and then crash the game because its terrible and deserves to die 110

replayability there is no reason to even look at this game again not only because of how terrible it is but also because there is no incentive like really they did not try at all 110 unless you are a masochist in which case 1010

final thoughts no there is a reason this is the worst rated game on steam the fact a game in a well known franchise like flatout turned out like this is just ugh if it wasnt a flatout game itd be forgotten but this being a flatout game helped this game get its infamy do not buy this game not even at a joke especially at a price of 999 the only score this game deserves is a 110 with a side of a turd team 6 remove this game this game is awful in every sense and i cannot believe bugbear gave this the ok they had to have at least seen the product yes its the worst game on steam by far its an achievement of crap but still an achievement just in the wrong way this game basically killed the flatout series entirely there was an attempted revival of the series named fl4tout which should have been a reboot but in the end it did not successfully revive the series and this game is to blame this game is awful in fact you can say that its just bad

#####

this game killed my pets slapped my grandmother pissed on my pc and burned my house down

#####

just no

#####

maybe i couldve write a real negative review only if the game really worked

#####

if you love flatout dont play this ever

#####

 b depression restored b

#####

could this be the worst game ever made

#####

this really is a travesty of a racing title and i dont wonder for a tenth of a second as to why its at the time of writing this the worst rated game on steam

the handling is indescribably bad the devs tried to go for a simple arcadey handling resulting in all the vehicles barely being able to turn which means you will probably end up crashing into something you were frantically trying to avoid 5 seconds before the impact
the ai is just garbage making the outcome of a race or battle purely random there is no common sense behind some of the decisions made by the other drivers sometimes they just become suicidal and go full speed into a brick wall while other times they are just unbeatable godlike drivers
the damage physics make no sense a crash in 200 kmt can give you 5 damage and barely scraping by a brick wall gives you 30 damage somewhat comparable to russian roulette

and really the most important part of this review literally the only thing that separates it from the fun terrible meme games to just a huge steaming pile of garbage the optimization
this game crashes constantly it could crash once every 3 hours or like my case it could crash every 5 minutes it could crash at the end of a particular race or in the middle of the main menu 15 seconds after launching the game hadnt it been for these constant crashes i could honestly recommend this game purely for the batshit insane things happening in this haunted hellhole of a game but that doesnt matter if you cant even get to the fun stuff at the other side of the crashing nightmare which is the main menu

i just cant recommend this game not even for the 1 sales it constantly goes on because i know that money goes to the devs and they just dont deserve that money if it was optimized fine but when a game crashes this much its just impossible for me to say its worth it

steer far far clear of this dev studio and stay with bugbear at least they know how to make a game

#####

worst flatout ever  do not buy

#####

after playing amazing fun flatout 2 ive decided to buy the whole bundle and this is how its going
 flatout 1 is way too old to be fun especially compared to 2
 flatout ultimate carnage wont run on windows 11 no matter what the hotfix doesnt work
 flatout 3 is just terribly bad how did this game passed any kind of testing before it got released for the public is beyond me
 flatout 4 installing now my expectations are low

#####

if only steam refunds existed in 2011

#####

1010 truly the best game of all time i really loved the exit menu

#####

i won a race because the car in front of me decided to go full speed into a wall blowing himself up right before the last turn this is an awesome game if you look at it as a comedic parody of flatout

#####

this game made me kill my grandson

#####

i came i saw i left

#####

this game is truly a piece of garbage i have nothing good to say about it i would be disappointed if i downloaded this as a free mobile game

#####

why

#####

a terrible disgrace to what was once one of the greatest racing franchises of the 2000s got 400 hrs on flatout 2 on just this account hundreds of more on my dads steam account from childhood days wish this game had a proper third edition or no third edition at all


#####

its that bad

#####

a terrible mess so bad it should be banned worldwide
1010

#####

this game gave me a permanent dopamine debuff 

#####

they didnt even get the title of this game right instead of flatout its flatout that alone should be an indicator that there is something wrong here if you didnt see it from all the negative reviews but onto the review i cannot believe that after the masterpiece that was flatout 2ultimate carnage we got this piece of junk here everything about this game is worse than the previous titles the car handling is janky physics are nonexistent glitches everywhere graphics are muddy ai doesnt know how to drive among other problems even the soundtrack sucks instead of real music its now some generic background music this game is a disgrace to the name it bears the only redeeming thing in this game is the fact that they seemed to somewhat try something original some of the modes and stages are pretty interesting but that doesnt save this abomination
only get this thing if you want to play bad games or get the full flatout collection

team 6 studios more like team sht studios

4510

#####

this game is good if your a fan of flatout 3

#####

even 99 cent are too much for this shit

#####

just not a flatout game buggy

#####

you know i knew this one guy keith he was always trying to start fights with people we all said it would come back to haunt him one day i forced him to play flatout 3 and keith jumped off a bridge to escape the game but he died so thanks for helping me get rid of that problem

#####

this game is not like the other two first two gamesflatout flatout2 and i got to say that this one dose not feel like a flatout game it feels like a trash game that they just took the name and slap it on just to make money  one of the disappointed first racing game i have played in my life

#####

i heard how bad this game was so i decided to spend 999 of my hard earned money late at night to see how bad it really was i thought it was going to be funny oh how i was wrong this game was so atrocious so incredibly awful it wasnt even funny it was depressing all i could think about is how i could have decided to not buy this game do not make the same mistake i did save your money please

#####

pls dont buy this

#####

this isnt a flatout series game

the new developers only develop shit look at the other games of team 6 studios to understand how much awful is flatout 3 compared to flatout 1 2 or ultimate carange

and is the first racing game that i see with glitches in the fucking direction when you turn yup leftright
i can expend half an hour trying to get used to the fucking new physics that the devs though optimal they are not but how im suposed to get used to a fucking turning glitch it happens once every 2 races minimum

cry

#####

didnt believe it had to see it for myself i cant believe this is a full release it feels worse to play than a ps1 game

#####

i believe by playing this game for five minutes i have enough play time to give it a wholehearted review
the following are my thoughts as i was playing speed mode
this game is awful
where are the soft body physics present in previous flatout games
the hud youre forced to work with is an embarrassment
who made this game
why did they make this game
who thought this would be fun
jesus christ is this a joke
what the fuck is going on
my life just got 16 times worse
i feel suicidal now
my emotions are getting the best of me
i never thought racing games were meant to get you emotional
ive never seen such an embarrassment to the soft body physics racing community
who is this prick in front of me
fuck you  b i say as i crash into him b 
1 damage  b the game tells me when i hit him full speed into a wall b 
what the fuck is this
i didnt get this game to lose brain cells
i didnt ask for cancer
i got it for 5 though
at least its almost over
 b crashed like 20 times because the steering is repulsive and impossible to control among other things b 
 ending of my thoughts while playing speed mode
get it if you want to die as well
anyways i digress
b irreparable b damage to the flatout series bugbear did it right
whoever the fuck developed this game destroyed everything
this game is essentially the product of an autistic kids project in coding class
i cannot imagine a single sane person recommending this game to anyone
unless theyre just trying to give someone a hybrid composition of aids and cancer
i rest my case

#####

one of the worst games i ve ever playeddont waste your money for this crappy game

#####

i bought this game on sale for 3


i want my 3 dollars back

#####

this is one of the worst games ive ever played its great

#####

one of the worst games ever made the other flatout games are awesome but this piece of shet was developed by another studio avoid at all cost

#####

it gave me neural damage

#####

avoid this game at all cost  ruined the flatout franchise
id pay steam to remove this game from my list

#####

mandatory negative review

#####

i bought this with all the other flatout games for 5 dollars still feel ripped off

#####

this is a game that is so bad it makes et on the atari 2600 look like gold you can be gifted this game for free and still want a refund because of how horrible this god awful game is this game is basically one giant error with crashing while trying to change songs from my music folder to crashing in general and yet it was beaten by a game released by the fallen saint that is konami for the worst video game ever but this is the worst racing game eve next to big rigs over the road racing stay away from this cow dung even if you are a fan of flatout go buy flatout 2 instead or flatout ultimate carnage because that game is a enhanced version of flatout 2 go buy anything but this god awful excuse of a flatout game this game is a big middle finger to flatout fans racing game and the gaming industry as a whole this giant error is a joke

#####

garten of banban doesnt seem so bad now

#####

so so bad that moment when the loading screen shows up in the first time and you have bad feelings about it then the game loads and you saw the sad truth youre right the first two flatout game is a must have title i have so many hours in 12 not in steam the flatout 12 better in graphics and in physics way much better its not a flatout its much like an old and bad version of carmageddon which dont exist   i absolutely dont recommend if you are a flatout fan like me its an absolute disappointment 

pros
 it runs in ultra settings basically on anything
 various selection of cars
 more challenges and races
 funny characters for why with pop cultural references

cons
 absolutely bad car physics like a flash game
 very aged graphics its predecessors looked much better
 tuning system is a joke three modes per car not configurable
 low res textures
 leave out all the experiences that are in the first games

#####

lets you turn on red sun in the sky earrape while looking like something made in the year the song was written unironically one of the greatest unintentional comedy games of all time

fucking horrible game but you need to experience this at least once in your life to truly appreciate every other game out there

#####

i did it i played the game until i won first on every race and it was ugly
there is nothing in it a good racing game should have
and for shure not the name flatout

crash crashes are glue enemy car sticks to my front roof side cant get it of except to stop

this is really not fun i just played it to the end because it was hard and frustrating at first play
now at second attempt i finish races first 
this game is more to overcome oneselves and master the bad steering and make the best of it

do youreself a favour and donst waste your time and money on this

#####

im a fan of the flatout series and i bought this on release thinking it would be the latest and greatest but this game is tough to get into if not for the fact that the controls operate like your gamepad is begging for an immediate and swift death the adrenaline of ultimate carnage is illsupported here and the game lacks a lot of the punch that made past titles great

worth noting  this game was made by a third party studio not the one responsible for the earlier games

#####

no

#####

flatout 3 came to me at the perfect time in my life before i found this game i was apart of aproximent 69 percent of people that are battling depression every day i wondered why i was still here because there was nothing left for me it took all the energy i could muster just to get out of bed in the morning i was down to my final days and i eventually just gave up and layed in bed all day one day something inside of me caused me to get up and go check my computer to see if anybody was wondering where i was to see if anybody still cared i saw that i had a steam notification i felt the most miniscule glimmer of hope as i clicked to see what it was all of the hope faded as i loaded up the page just to see a hunnnie pop trading card was added to my inventory i was crushed just before i logged off for what i thought was the last time i saw that there was a steam sale i decided to take a look when the page loaded up i saw a few games were on sale nothing really that interesting though then all of a sudden my heart stoped beating and my face went pale i read the title aloud flatout 3 to this day i dont know what caused me to stop at this paricular title it was 25 percent off so i had just enough funds in my steam walled to purchase it i downloaded and installed the game when i launched it my eyes began to water i felt my lower lip quivering the title screen alone was enough to make me feel emotions i havent felt in a long time was this it was this my purpose i begin to start a race and am greeted by a wide select of colourful zany characters i went with the giraffe and a chose a race as soon as it began i was lost in the pure detail of the landscape and the individual personalities of the characters i couldnt hold it in anymore i began to cry i felt something racing along side these new found friends made me feel like i wasnt alone suddenly i had a purpose in life this game is truly amazing and it saved my life i could not recommend this game more i hope that when you play this game it will change your life like it did mine or in my case save it

i will now give an in depth desciption of the game and list some of the pros and cons before giving it a final score

well this is definitly not flatout this might have been a decent game some 10 years ago totaly not worth the money they tried something with physics which are way off graphicaly the game sucks neither cartoonish nor real there is no ingame music if you ever loved the flatout series stop with no 2 i cannot believe someone would publish this and think it is an okay game to follow in the flatout series

#####

its so bad its fun so good and bad

#####

thank you team6 game studios i now have brain aids

meme review have to downvote to continue this games legacy as one of the worst rated games on steam however

i did have fun the ai is terrible and the rubberbanding is strong sometimes the enemies will drift at top speed around corners and the graphics omg the bloom is so obnoxious and the game is so orange you might go blind the physics is so bad especially when jumping ramps and the collision detection and you might clip something you can barely tell is an obstacle that will end your race 

on the upside you can set career mode events to one lap meaning you can charge through most races in under a minute and not lose a lot when you restart maybe flatout 3 did make an effort to carry on the legacy of the previous entries with the additional content and bonus modes and there are some fun to be had there but you wish there was more and that some of the events were better executed

the soundtrack which has been a hall mark of the identity of the series returns with equal aplomb with lesser known artist than the previous installment but although a mixed bag of wailing rock and energetic numbers i believe has been wellreceived by those that hold the game near and dear to their heart

doing reviews for an old forgotten game like this might be a bit redundant now as racing games and technologies have progressed but to take a moment to appreciate the nostalgia and to see where weve come from honestly a big part of the negative reception to this game was the high expectations set by its predecessors and part of me wants to appreciate the spirit with which the series was attempted to be carried on here

as with some genres weve seen a decline in range in car combat games like arena shooters maybe as well i mean theres like three good ones and infinite bad ones where there is that perception that people will never get tired of triedandtested classics and the consensus usually ends up being why dont we see more of these games but secretly we know these genres and recent attempts have been stale and subpar and boring and met with indifference in the greater market

in that i think this game does deserve recognition in what it tries to be and despite its numerous technical flaws i find myself asking if i would play this if its the only game i have and the answer is yes

also seen a price increase recently and is now three times more expensive than i payed there is an issue brooding over pricing in games its not what it costs but what you can make people pay in that there is a caveat of its good depending what you pay which is unprovisioned in reviews systems unless explicitly mentioned

#####

calling this game a trainwreck would be a flatout insult to trains

#####

for 50 cents this is a very economical enhanced interrogation device make your guests play this game and watch them confess everything

#####

my playtime of this game is more amusing than everything about it combined

#####

i finally lost my last 2 brain cells in my 9 minutes of playing this game

#####

pure garbage
uninstalled

no

gave me penis malfuntion

i picked this up in a multipack with several other games as i had played previous games in the series before  honestly i think i might have been better off paying more to buy the rest of the pack separately without this one 

avoid this game and here is why
the graphics are at best mediocre  however despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up especially when turning corners  this quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner  textures applied to the walls around the track such as graffiti on the concrete will flicker  keep in mind this is on a pc with an i7 cpu 8gb of ram and a geforce gtx 670

the car handling is distinctly fishy  half the cars will stick to the road like glue  the other half will be sliding all over the place  there is nothing in between 

the ai is even fishier  when they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls  to make up for this the ai will quickly catch you on the straights  passing your car with no problems even when youre burning nitro  

the damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing  where flatout ultimate carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled  there is no damage in between these two options  as soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 wheeler

#####

its just bad

#####

worst flatout wouldnt recommend it even for free

#####

why did i think launching this game was a good idea even though i played 24 minute  its horrible to see what the developers have done to the flatout franchise so avoid this game even at a lower price not worth your time and money i can easily recommend you to play flatout 1 and flatout 2 which are still quite impressive in 2021 and wont be a waste of time with real physics and good running even the characters in flatout 2 are awesome i miss them  flatout 3 chaos and destruction is a terrible nightmare and still dont know why you can still buy it really who want to play this even for a joke

#####

ive played almost 8 hour of this and have completed almost all of the modes except the nightshift and the stunt but my sanity finally couldnt push through it anymore and just give up

what a fyckn abomination
 whoever design those tracks should be fired
 whoever design the physics for the cars should be fired
 whoever thought it was a good idea to calculate the car damage based on percentage should be fired

i want to point other things but there are just so many of them that 3 points is my main problem with this game

#####

h1racing with a broken axleh1

this is one of the games on steam where a ineutrali option would prove useful
in its current state i simply cant recommend this game certainly not at 30 maybe if you pick it up in a bundle for 3 or less or a price tag of 510 but no more than this

i actually enjoyed the game having played to completion the two battle arenas but it fell short on racing and monster trucks due to one fundamental problem  the ihandlingi of the various vehicles was just horrible at speed its recommended in the first race tips to master the handbreak though this seemingly does very little on its own used in conjuction with the boost or being slammed from behind i was able to take corners and finished the first race on fifth or sixth position but the problem with that was the even further loss of control often resulting in slamming into someones living room least for the first race

then theres the damage control system to contend with i completely fail to understand how slamming into another vehicle at 160 kph headon can deal only 13 of damage while a slight scratch at half that speed can deal 515 i won and lost many a times for this during the battle arenas even if did still technically win on points alone which feel like for npcs points are stopped been counted as soon as the player loses instead of artifically continuing until the last one standing was revealed 

graphics wise cant complain too much theres a wide selection of vehicles colours and even characters behind the wheels seldom repeated by the npcs if at all so theres plenty of variance on the track though at no point did i actually see for example a wheel flying off or a character being thrown out of the car when the car itself dies off which can apparently be done in one of the other game modes where you land them in a target following a crash a game from 1995 destruction derby 2 was based much the same as flatout 3 and even for its time if you took too much damage various parts of the vehicle would go flying the wheels included which then was supposed too but aided sometimes negatively affected your vehicle control or you had the hood bouncing around obstructing your view until more damage knocked it flying off these are relatively small things but they matter to the overall experience

 very poor vehicle handling in certain instances a 1 star vehicle was easier to control than a 5 star
 poor damage control system scratching doing considerbly more damage than headon collisions
 damage control system based as a whole rather than individual parts of the vehicle
 vehicle clipping occasionally at speed youd drive straight through another vehicle rather than hitting them
 maybe just me no or little ability to recharge your boost gauge tips say it recharges during jumps or causing damage but it seems much more random than this
 damage having little to no affect on vehicle control no losing of wheels until completely destroyed
 lack of varied sound effects eg horns announcer discussions crash sounds
 random unexplained flatout3exe has stopped working errors or in some cases inability to load the game at all according to some users
 no trading cards 
list

so once again i cannot recommend this game in its current state at the current price 
if you can buy it in a bundle then by all means otherwise wait for a 8095 sale by which point it may be worth a couple of hours of entertainment but overall if the developers ever come back to this game it does have its potential if cared for properly

#####

terrible optimization terrible controls and an arse load of forced post processing effects you cant turn off
this game isnt even worth your money if it was only 3 cents
this game is worse than a rushed unity game slapped on greenlight as early access

#####

this game is absolutely horrible and does not deserve to carry the flatout name

#####

pain

#####

you can select from 21 characters each with an unique backstory
if you enjoyed baldurs gate 3 origin characters these will blow your mind taking it to a whole new level

rag doll movements and sound 1010

#####

i got this with the previous flatout games and after reading all the reviews i got curious and installed it i was wondering if it was one of those cases where a game is fun but somehow the fans were offended because the game changed a lot from previous instances

yes tihs is a bad game

i started the first race but couldnt even finish it the handling the physics all the crap in the screen that makes it hard to know where you have to go the terrible player models and bad puns makes it feel like if it was one of those terrible steam indie games made by 1 person following a game development tutorial

#####

unbelievable       i remember when i was a kid having a homework deadline and throwing it together at the last minute not caring for the details or the quality    that is exactly what this game is  if you dont believe me go ahead and waste your money on it  the first flatout is a major improvement over this latest release   these guys must have given up or just not cared  i dont know but its just plain awful

0 stars i would vote negative if possible

#####

dont buy this this wasnt made by bugbear like flatout 1 and 2 this is just garbage the control of cars is horrible the optimization is horrible the ai is horrible

#####

hot garbage buggy mess its not even worth 050

#####

just no nothing like the old normal ones please watch gameplay before buying it its from another team plus might aswell be a cell phone game

#####

truly the best car game one of the only games where your brain can degenerate after playing if a game could have a mental disorder this would definitely be the result well if you decide to get this game ive got a few tips on how to have fun

step 1 choose the green car for some reason its the only car where i can actually drive properly
step 2 choose the most drip person
step 3 choose the map castello reverse
step 4 turn up the volume to listen to the beautiful sounds
step 5 watch as the ai suffers since they have 0 iq
step 6 and observe itll be one of the greatest things youve ever seen in your life

also there are some minigames like the big big battle one i think where there are 24 cars and you gotta slam into each other for points i highly recommend turning up the volume all the way omg the sounds are so beautiful i probably risked going deaf but its truly worth it

anyway this is probably the best 145aud ive spent in my life truly an experience like no other

#####

this game is trash

#####

i dont think that this game deserves to be named as part of the original flatout series because it is basically missing everything that is great about flatout 1 2 and uc

#####

a 100 fee was paid to get this hate crime of a game on to the steam platform a litteral spit in the ass to the flatout series

#####

bruh

#####

one of the worst games ever made right next to et for the atari

#####

if someone gifts this to you slap them

#####

wow really is bad but idk if my bads are what others encountered the game dosnt run properly for me at all it will run but in races i get some strange freeze up then it will unfreeze then freeze again goes back n forth like this constantlyraces is the  only place it happens lol shrugs  gfx are bout as piss poor as they can get 2011 gfx no more like 2006 with vasaline bloom effect lol cant really review a game that dosnt work like a game should i am more than capable of running this game i can run mankind divided at 100fps on ultra settings but i cant run flat out 3 properly so whats i to blame my pc or this games optimization pretty sure the answer is clearly my pc right  dont bother with this trash title flatout 4 is better than this one and it sucks to lol

#####

there are
bad games
horrificly broken games
horrificly broken bad games

and then theres flatout 3

#####

from now on i will play this game on every halloween its truly a horror show

#####

press left  car goes right  fucking dies amazingnt game

#####

tell your friends why they should buy this game

because i apparently hate them i mean if im going to tell a person to buy this genuinely i clearly have ill intent

i loved fo1 and fo2 they will be forever staples of softbody arcade racing games in my book but this i have no idea what i just played for three minutes but in apparently five years fo2 was 2006 fo3 was 2011 quality tanked frame rate spiked and texture models were literally expelled from a baby chimp labeled as a racing game and then sold on a gaming community called steam

just get fo2 crack open a cold beverage of your choice and call it a day

post script
so i know i said three minutes and it turns out i had to play it for two more minutes before i could post a review as each minute passed as i tried to complete a race or two my virulent rage grew by every half minute

fck you for making me play this game any longer than i wanted to

#####

truly as bad as everyone says
one of the other reviewers said what happened  the publisher is the same
maybe but the bdeveloperb isnt  fo12uc are by urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikibugbear_entertainmentbugbearurl fo 3 by urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiteam6_game_studiosteam6url fo4 by urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikikylotonnkylotonnurl
i guess what happened was similar to urlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikioperation_flashpoint#codemasters_seriesoperation flashpointurl where the publisher kept the ip but had no idea how to make another game

just for fun i started here then switched to flatout 1
within ten seconds i can see what flatout 3 bwantedb to be
dont buy this at banyb price

#####

i love flatout flatout 2 and flatout ultimate carnage even though uc is a rehash of flatout 2 and so i bought this without a second thought that was a mistake this game is nothing like the originals the car handling is dreadful the graphics are awful and the gameplay has none of the originality and all out fun of its predecessors avoid this title at all costs to call it sht would be an insult to faeces instead buy the first three games and mourn the fact that well probably never see a sequel as good

#####

well that was awful

#####

after playing this game buying a noose seems like a great idea

#####

for a flatout game this is poopoo ass if this was like pro racing 3d mobile game then i would say this is decent but flatout hell no

#####

ppap

#####

the 10 minutes i spent playing offroad mode were the most terrifying lifechanging and worst minutes of my life worst game ive ever played 1110

#####

we reviewed this game on our podcast garbage game night where we try out poorly reviewed games and give them a second chance either trying to find something the critics missed or enjoy them because they are so bad

this game was genuinely entertaining trash to me i dont know how long trash can be entertaining for but it was enough to make it worth a 5 purchase for me on our scale of 10 to 10 i gave it a 5 so bad its enjoyable but not great there is enough unlockables to keep you going but youll get bored quickly theres enough silly things the engine can do between using a tank and a double decker bus pileup that its worth laughing at with some friends 

if youre interested in an indepth look into the background of the game and our reactions to our first playthrough you can urlhttpsgarbagegamenightcomflatout3check out the podcast on this episodeurl

#####

my childhood game but still 210

#####

terrible feels like a completely different game comparing to previous flatouts

#####

literally the worst racing game i have ever played

#####

fuck this cancerous piece of repugnant urinereeking personification of vulgarity flatout 3 is the most egregiously primitive plebeian game in the history of the fucking unequivocally illbred misdemeanant that we call the platform steam the amount of times my car has committed suicide like a wickedly ignominious nosepicking degenerate is starting to take a toll on me harder than fucking dropping an egg on a rugged piece of adamantium my 2000 pc has crashed 4 times trying to open the game and even my computer cannot withstand the degraded nature of this monstrosity the sheer sadistic hippophilic maniacal heartsickening shameless exhibitions of gameplay shown in flatout 3 are enough for me to fucking die internally in an endless loop of an infinite lifetimes this game doesnt deserve to be typed out with a capital f and the fact that flatout 3 even takes up 58 gb of my disk space is an insult to humanity god is dead and this game has killed him fuck anyone who supports this neurotic cancer

#####

not enough tiddy

#####

by far the worst game and greatest missuse of a game series name ever dont buy in fact run away fast

#####

i cant even launch the game piece of shit game

#####

this might be the worst game ive ever played literally nothing in human life can be worse than this surely this is what rock bottom looks like and i can only go up from here

#####

utterly broken game do not play

#####

if you looking for a game like flatout buy flatout 1 or 2 this is just not worth your hard earned dollar i mean it its onsale for 90 off making the game 99c and its still not worth it
the gameplay is poor to say the least if this was a game on the ps2 back in 2000 it would be ok but things have progressed so much further that this also the great music from 1 and 2 are missing one the things that make flatout great are its gameplay and music and its not here 

play flatout 1 and 2 wreckfest is also not bad but still in dev leave this thing in the dust bin 
if your looking for a simulator beamng drive is a great game

#####

thats it last nail in the coffin was the broken achievement
not gonna elaborate about completely and utterly broken
gameplay nor the sound or the fact that they didnt test
this garbage abusing the name that was created by bugbear
or dared to publish this in prealpha state

#####

wow this game really does suck  definitely the worst of the flatout games

#####

it cant be that bad

it really is that bad

#####

words cannot describe how much dread i felt launching this game for the first time

words also cannot describe how much anger and genuine terror i felt while playing this scummy disgusting mess of a game

#####

most likely my favorite game on steam i loved the 40 hours of play time i got with this game the tracks controls and cars are all so amazing put together in this game its honestly a shame the critics put the hit out on this game because its so good

#####

i just wanna add to the overwhelmingly negative review rating for this gameits that baaad

#####

sarcastic observation its woke

#####

no wonder it has psychological horror as the first tag ive been crying for the past 10 minutes this game is the grossest looking game ive ever seen and the worst game ive ever played

#####

first one i played was flatout 2  love it  910
raceschampionshipderby  good
game physics and car control  interesting and cool
the stunts omg  spent more time on them than actually racing
soundtrack  love it  

after that played flatout 1  not bad tbh 510 
racechampionshipderby  okay
game physics and car control  still good same ol but still good
stunts  less but still satisfying
soundtrack  to be honest it sucks white trash garage bands but maybe fits with the scenery i dunno  

and then i installed flatout 3  010 absolute piece of sausage
racesno championshipsderby  more types but completely without soul and a feeling there is not even to upgrade your car
game physics and car control  garbage like turning a box 
stunts  absolute garbage 
soundtrack nonexistent

in all fairness i couldnt last longer than 15 minutes with this sausage this poor excuse of a flatout game it doesnt deserve its name its a flatout sausage 
you want a good flaout game take 1 or 2 
avoid this monstrosity at all costs

#####

all the other flat out games are good and fun

this game is neither i played it for a little then uninstalled it

imo this game should be buried in the desert like ataris et game as its a steaming pile

i do not recommend this game to anyone

after playing please go and get some therapy and no not mention the words flat out 3

#####

i am absolutely fuming  devs please listen


i waited 16 years for this game sixteen years words cannot describe how excited i was i booked two weeks off work which in itself was really difficult my boss was like you do realise theres a pandemic with lots of unemployed people  i can replace you in a heartbeat

i said i dont care i want to play flatout 3  chaos  destruction

as the game finished downloading my heartrate stayed at steady 200bpm whilst i burnt it onto multiple cds and proceeded to install it on to my gaming pc only for all my hopes and anticipation to be crushed like a paper cup under a hydraulic press

this game isnt supported on windows 98 are you serious give me one good reason why my perfectly fine pc has been excluded from support ive never had a problem with this computer and the crt screen even still has the original vacuum tubes it would be a crime to throw it away simply because greedy developers are in bed with microsoft and hardware manufacturers

this practice is anticonsumer and all it does it stick a middle finger up to all the hard working people who simply cannot afford to replace their computer every 20 years

words cannot describe my disappointment youve lost a customer forever thanks for nothing now what am i supposed to do with all these cds throw them in the bin great lets destroy the environment as well

#####

this game ruined my marriage

#####

well here we are the infamous flatout 3 chaos  destruction i dont think i need to say why this game is awful but because ive reviewed every other entry i feel obligated to release a review anyway keep note that while my playtime is 26 minutes i did play this game outside of steam for over an hour which i feel was enough to really get a feel for how bad this game is so this game was made in 2011 and wasnt developed by bugbear entertainment the creators of flatout who developed flatout 1 flatout 2 flatout ultimate carnage and flatout headon for psp as they were busy making other projects so instead noobie developer team6 games was given the reigns instead most seem to forget this but team 6 actually developed and released a game on the wii a year prior just called flatout and in many ways its a precursor to this game it even has the same menu music and similar physics that game is terrible though but is often forgotten flatout 3 however is not so lets dive in shall we

sowhere do i start well lets just be blunt everything in this game sucks the car physics are terrible and straight up broken at times sometimes youll ram full speed into something but you wont take any damage but other times you just love tap something and take insane amounts of damage in this game you have a health meter unlike other flatout games while in flatout 2 you can get out of the race if you take enough damage but its rare in this game it happens so often because the cars drive super fast and turn really badly and the tracks are so terribly tight that avoiding crashes or winning a race is near impossible 

the character selection is a joke as it has nothing but a bunch of generic and bland characters who look like they belong in a crack den rather than a racing circuit there are also some chicks in here who feel like theyre thrown in to get some ta in the game its pathetic these characters dont even feel like they belong in a flatout game and their inclusion only shows just how little care was put into this game

another thing that really sucks is what they did to hotseat its just ruined nothing about it is good the mechanics make no sense and the events themselves have awful premises the best way to describe it is like a bootleg version of flatout 2s mechanics for hotseat but even saying that is an insult to flatout 2 and the legacy of hotseat as a whole they took the most standout mode of flatout and totally ruined it in this game which given the rest of the game isnt too surprising

special events also return and theyre really bad for instance a capture the flag like mode is here and its horrid because of the physics and the designs of the arenas destruction derbies suffer from the same problems other bad inclusions include a formula 1 racing track yes a formula 1 race in a flatout game do i need to say more i just cant with this game like honestly what else can i say but everything about this game is bad im quite shocked there isnt a single redeeming quality about the gameplay oh and did i mention the game does this awful motion blur effect when you drive fast like man its like they wanted nobody to enjoy this game

before i wrap this up i want to say 1 positive thing yes you heard me 1 positive thing that is the nicely designed exit button on the main menu it functions great for leaving the game and youll definitely need it only after a short while of playing clearly the development focus was spent on this ok in all seriousness this game does have 1 good thing the controller support surprisingly it functions rather well it can be used on menus and unlike flatout 1 you dont have to use the gas key to select options its pretty amazing they managed to make better controller support than flatout 1 and 2 which is sad but thankfully flatout 1 and 2 more than make up for that

so yeah as a whole this game is an abomination and you should stay the hell away from it for your sake flatout 3 is an abortion and a stain on life and gaming as a whole playing this game will only induce suffering and depression it hurts me even more being a fan of flatout ever since i was a kid this is without question the worst game i have ever had the misfortune of playing stay away from this horrible game and please play flatout 1 and 2 instead the team who made this game should be ashamed of themselves for nearly killing the flatout franchise im amazed a flatout 4 was even made and thankfully even flatout 4 is much better than this pile of crap play literally any other flatout game than this save yourself the money and time youll waste on this it was the lowest rated game on steam for almost a decade for a reason only being beaten out by the dreadful xiii remake avoid this game like the plague youll thank me later

needless to say flatout 3 gets a 010 an absolute failure

#####

i recommend experiencing the pain and suffering that i experienced when i beat out platinum in this useless shit 


#flatout ultimate carnage its cool

#####

is there a way to get a refund for the 16 minutes i played this game  stairing at the floor while releasing my bowels is worth more than playing this  this is a joke more than it is a game  this game doesnt deserve the name flatout and shouldve never been released to the public

#####

ů

#####

just dont

#####

i looked at the reviews and thought nah its impossible to be as bad as everyone claims its literally the 3rd part
then launched it  looks fine
then went to single player  wtf is all of this and wheres the campaign 
then selected first option  suddenly game starts randomly in a random car im confused
i start to drive  i start to feel like im on shitty crack  everything about the game is just wrong
i decide to bump into a car cuz its flatout wow 1 damage done oh and whats that ah i now have 30 health because of that ok cool uninstall 
thank god i got a cheap ass bundle and didnt buy this crap 


#####

please dont buy this

#####

wtf oh gods my eyes

#####

no joke this game actually caused me physical pain my right arm neck and shoulder are so tense because of this game

#####

good for interrogation purposes

recommended for torturing brain cells 

pros not considered a war crime to use it on the subject

cons the radiation of the brightness can damage the interrogator eyes even from a distance

#####

this game is absolutely terrible i loved the first two titles so im not even sure what happened here the controls are buggy the graphics are terrible especially for 2011 standards the physics are somewhere between unrealistic and nonexistant even on sale this game isnt worth buying if its free its not worth the time youll waste installing and uninstalling 010

flatout 3 has historically been one of the lowest rated games on steam only dethroned from first place as of last year a feat like this made me expect the worst and yet i was somewhat surprised 

it is no secret that the game is uglier than sin the style is truly awful once i got past this though i was surprised to see some level of competence went into this game having checked the settings i saw custom key binds were a working feature keyboard controls were given a level of respect i wouldnt have expected 

getting into a race its safe to say that it wasnt enjoyable the first thing i noticed was the lack of music during gameplay so not off to a good start yet gameplay aside ingame technical performance was actually fairly acceptable i have encountered a couple of bugs during gameplay but nothing game breaking so far i have also tried some of the alternative game modes such as destruction derby the ragdoll launch and zombie knockdown the first 2 were admittedly more interesting than the actual racing dare i say the destruction derby and ragdoll launch were actually somewhat fun

for some odd reason the game features selectable characters they dont really serve any purpose other than how your ragdoll will look like theyre a odd mix of references or ocs with one character clearly being based on mario from super mario bros another on vin diesel and then theres one based on film director uwe boll for some reason its a nigh useless feature yet i feel it adds to the experience the games sense of humour has this alien charm to it

im a bit conflicted here as the 89 minutes ive played so far have been bad but also quite entertaining i also received this game for free so i had nothing to lose yet i feel that flatout 3 stands as some sort of so bad its good game it entertained me beyond my initial expectations of none and displayed features that some games considered good or rated very positive on steam lack the out of the box experience of flatout 3 worked for me without issues which i think is a delicious piece of irony to end this on is this a good sequel to flatout 2 heavens no do i recommend you buy this game not really maybe for 50 pennies or less if you want to have a laugh with a friend if you can get it for free try it 

tldr a surprisingly competent but still terrible game

#####

this game is not worth 3000 its not even worth 199 i bought it for with the other three games

#####

i felt the urge to get a tetanus shot after playing this game

#####

lol where should i puke

#####

welcome to team6 we have received multiple awards as you can see our awards are very consistent with the only type being worst games of the year awards

#####

its a fat game

#####

dethroned from the top 10 worst rated steam games but not forgotten overwatch 2 is just as shitty and deserves the metaphorical crown even more

#####

the biggest pile of dog shite ever created by a human i wouldnt even let my worst enemies play this horrible excuse of horse trash

#####

everything about this game is a fail

#####

youre winner

#####

wanted to relive some old memories from 2013 but the game wont even launch

maybe its for the better

#####

its so good that i now have aids this game is so fun that my wife left me with the kids this game has truly changed my life i will now go shoot myself in a dumpster for the respect of this hot garbage

#####

i couldnt even edge to this i exploded immediately clean up aisle on my pants

racing games are easy to make  you put some cars on a track make them drive around in a circle and award the win to the guy who completes the track  thats how almost every racing game works its a simple formula 

you start at easy races and then as your player gets skills you continue to make the races harder until he is racing almost perfect lines 

flatout 3 chaos and destruction doesnt seem to agree with this  it gives the player options of modes to play  theres a lot of variety here that would be a good thing  the problem is the difficulty of this game is extreme  theres no tutorial and the game just is very hard  if you turn the difficulty and number of cars down the game is better but still quite difficult   

there are no tutorials which means theres no explanation of the boost system it seem it awards boost for style points when near other cars maybe and the ai is incredibly difficult  if you dont race near perfect on easy youll lose  even when racing perfect you better be boosting  at medium you dont have a shot you probably need perfect boosts and even then theres no rubber banding if someone gets ahead so expect to lose often 

the game has the following modes 
race standard difficult race 
challenge mode seems like race couldnt beat the first challenge 
splatout kill zombies race around the track for points 
offroad
nightshift night driving
speed faster cars easier to crash
monstertrucks
battle arena fight 
big battle bigger fight 
stuntman a variety of annoyingly hard challenges 

all of those would be amazing if done competently but i would say none are properly executed on  sad because i love racing games and high adrenaline games are fun but this does everything except getting the blood pumping 

a shame but this is a very firm do not recommend  if you like racing dirt 3 is good if you like carnage burnout paradise is bar none the best  if you like killing zombies go play carmageddon  but whatever you do dont even boot up this game   its not worth it

#####

pov you got this when you bought the full flatout pack on steam

#####

is this still on steam wow

#####

to put it simply this wasnt a flatout game
sure its a racing game with the same style
but it just clearly isnt a flatout game at all
the previous games are actually just better
flatout 3 is quite frankly a huge step down
the visuals simply look extremely outdated
and not even the gameplay gets the point
it feels like the ai just barely works in here
so the racing doesnt feel satisfying at all
and the other game modes werent better
it took me 90 minutes to realize its trash
truly a huge disappointment it is just sad
but hey at least they did get the title right
chaos and destruction is one way to put it
this almost destroyed the whole franchise
but thankfully the fourth game is better
not by a lot but its better than this trash
i simply have to give tis a negative review

#####

just no

#####

if you wanna buy this game because you think flatout 1 and 2 is good dont buy this game

its not good

#####

this game sucks my balls so bad

#####

replace the fl in the game title with sh and you get a perfectly succinct descriptor of what this game feels like

buy it if you want to gain a deeper appreciation of how other racing games and developers do a comparatively godly job with ai car handling track design with decent signposting graphics and audio 

seriously you will come to admire how well other racing games lead your eye around the track to give you an idea where youre going this game has an infamous reputation and its fully deserving of the criticisms thrown at it yet perversely i have had some entertainment out of it as a cheap knockabout racer albeit one that appears to have been thrown together with little testing

made by team 6 not bugbear like the previously well regarded entries in the series this feels like a shovelware ps2wii game i can only assume that the 6 in the developers name refers to either the amount of devs they put on the game or the maximum time in months they took to develop it probably both it comes across like a quickly churned out knockoff that fails to grasp or replicate what made the originals so enjoyable  merely existing to cynically leverage the brand name at the time 

received as part of the complete pack i thought id give it a go after ultimate carnage the game i really wanted to play refused to start up i wasnt expecting much which it delivers on but it is possible to get some fun out of it for a while despite all that is shonky broken and just bad there is certainly some chaos and destruction to be had some of the cars handle okayish and changing the speed in races to classic instead of default makes things a little more manageable theres enough modes to keep you occupied a while but none feel like theyve had enough attention or refinement

i wouldnt even recommend it to achievement hunters as some of them are tied to seemingly impossible tasks that are more likely to come down to luck  some of the stunt events feel broken due to the unhelpful cameraphysics and the night races with magical rain that sometimes lands in the air several feet above the road surface appear to be filled with opposition that can supernaturally whizz and boost around the track as if guided by a divine hand

its a shame the brand got lumbered with this sequel just enjoy the first 2 games andor flatout ultimate carnage an updated version of flatout 2 instead  theyre a lot of fun the 2nd being perhaps one of my favourite racers

#####

team 6 ruined flatout why bugbear why team 6

#####

not to be played under any circumstances

#####

what happened to this series one of the biggest dropoffs in quality i have ever seen the gameplay is atrocious the cars feel like they have no weight the tracks are badly designed the hits as well feel like they barely do damage graphically as well it feels worse than flatout 1  2 one of the worst games ive ever played 110

#####

uninstalled after 10 minutes

#####

a game that took crashing too seriously

whenever i have kids im gonna discipline my child by making them play this racing game

if this belongs to anyones game library be grateful that you hold the achievement of owning one of steams worst reviewed games of all time 


#####

worst flatout game ever

#####

let me give you the tldr right now worst game ever

i played a single race yes i made it that far so i earned the right to judge the game i immediately remembered a really funny parody of the fps games of that era duty calls now for those who arent familiar with this name let me describe it briefly duty calls is a parody of many fps games based on call of duty franchise it was made as an advertisement for bulletstorm whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game with the message being nowadays fps are like the one you just played here is what it is supposed to be like bulletstorm trailer begins flatout 3 felt exactly like that here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today and now real flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games even ultimate carnage which was basically flatout 2 resold to you suckers but turned out to be pretty good anyway disappointment begins it was no joke no real flatout 3 started flatout 3 really is the horrible ummm i cant really say that its a game its a software where you control no not control more like watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller

ok jokes aside graphics are extremely unfinished simple and undetailed but not intentionally just due to lack of skill andor effort just look at the screenshots at the first glance they look pretty decent now look closer inspect details dont tell me its a 2011 game compare it to dirt or just flatout uc you will see it has horrible graphics

controls just dont matter you dont feel in control of the vehicle not even a little bit the car just goes vroom vroom no realism no control no fun for those who will bash me for looking for realism just go play the previous games you will see what i mean junker cars used to slide drift bump etc now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt when you try to turn it either doesnt turn enough if youre too fast or turns successfully if youre slow enough it doesnt drift slide unless you pull the handbrake but if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues its hovering over the road here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience asphalt 8 ios and android the need for speed 1994 fifa 96 also im using a logitech f710 when i set the controls to the gamepad it stops working if i set them to keyboard i can use my gamepad with xinput mode fuck logic

sounds there are 4 sounds in total one of them is the menu sound click three in game sounds are vroom bfffttt and dufff now vroom is the engine sound made by the cars engines the sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs that just made the sound with their mouth i can almost hear one of them saying screw the consumers they will buy our games anyway in the middle of the sound recording session faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine bfffttt is the sound nitrous makes and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray dufff is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects again it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance 

music literally nonexistent

car tuning do you remember the simple yet fun car modification system flatout used to offer its gone here is the new system would you like to tune the car yesno if you choose yes then the car is tuned by standards seen fit by the devs i swear to god i am laughing at the stupidity of this as im writing while crying on the inside because it isnt even slightly exaggerated ladies and gentlemen a new era of modification begins where cars are either tuned or arent

please just watch a single gameplay footage from any source even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is dont take any of my word for it just look it up on youtube yourself watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here is describing that video

i bought the complete pack for 10 i am not sorry because i love flatout games i played them on ps2 for long hours i am glad to have 1 2 and uc in my steam library for just 10 but if you want a flatout game just buy uc 2 was better than 1 even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself and uc is just a graphically and realistically superior game that is essentially flatout 2 with additional content

#####

wow just wow

ok im just going to tell you my experience with this game my entire 8 minutes thats all i played of this and thats all i will ever play of this so ive heard past reviews ive seen videos of it and i was convinced that this was a disgrace so how did i end up with it because i bought the pack that came with it i legit only wanted flatout 1  2 and this thing tagged along with ultimate carnage cant get that to work but thats probably still way better than this because of that i decided to try it maybe it isnt so bad i thought to myself maybe its just a letdown and thats why its lower rated than ride to hell retribution

oh i was wrong so so wrong

so after this thing eats 11gb of my hard drive yes 11 gigabytes of valuable space i hit play and brace myself the loading screen pops up the game loads and i configure my controller i choose a race select my car and character theres another loading screen and the race starts

now heres my first of many problems with this game the visuals
why do all the cars look like the toy cars from that burnout paradise dlc excuse me even worse than those
not to mention the stage i was racing in was completely bland and uninteresting with only right corners yes only 90 degree turns in this stage even flatout 1 had curved corners in its first track and yes i know this was done by a different studio then bugbear the original creators but still have some variety in your stages to get the player interested not like i was to begin with
 
second of all and by far the biggest complaint from everyone whos played this the controls and physics dear god
the car turned so stiff around the corners it was literally the most unresponsive control in a racing game ive ever experienced and the physics do you know how crazy and wacky the physics were in previous flatout games well theres little to no physics here when the car hit the one ramp in the stage it was like it was on a preset jump path it only went up and down it didnt even turn to the side it was kinda like that jump in the original ridge racer except this isnt 1994 or on a playstation 1 this game was released in 2011 also do you know what was one of flatouts main selling points or what made it fun the crashes and ragdoll physics here you tap one wall going 30 miles per hour and explode and theres no ragdoll cam and it doesnt even look cool have any of the developers who made this even play or see a flatout game before because it doesnt feel like it

and now for my last point which kinda ties into the physics point the stunts thats right i actually played a different mode after the race i tried something that i dont think anyone did before i went one step further and tried a stunt event

so after the stunt stage loads i hit the accelerate button press eject at the ramp and oh my god what
if you dont know which you probably dont you can pick different charactersragdolls at the menu i picked the first guy who has a trenchcoat on when i launched him during the stunt it cut to a ragdoll camera for once and well
you know how sometimes games have that bug where a hair piece or piece of clothing stretch out in an odd way like into a wall or something well my ragdolls trenchcoat did that the first time then i retried the stunt and it did it again i actually think the developers gave up after the first stage of this game and never bug tested it you hear that a lot with shitty undeveloped games but i truly thought that when i saw it 

so in conclusion dont buy this please dont buy this abysmal mess even if you got it with the pack dont download it shitty graphics controls physics this game has it all did i mention that this takes up 11gb of space i did but did i also mention this game costs 30 normally thirty dollars you can actually get flatout 1 and 2 on sale which are way way better than this for less even when this thing is on sale right now at the time of posting this you can still get the original 2 for less

i now know why everyone despises this game why its the lowest rated game on steam and its still up

dont waste your time with this game it took me longer to type this than play it and this was a better experience than that

#####

very bad game graphics look like this even for 2011 standards seriously some playstation 1 games look better then this game dont buy it the game should be 1 cent

#####

god why do i have this game

#####

it came with the flatout pack i regret playing this one

#####

dont waste your money this game is absolute garbage

#####

b 010 b

#####

worst game of all time i played it like for 11minutes and i cant recover from this
and i also i think i acquired cancer and soon or later stroke too 
this game is just so bad i cant believe it even exists 
not worth even a penny

#####

it plays like a mobile game i really love flatout series and i thought people were just overly negative but no all the reviews are true and honest

the camera follows you like it was stuck between tpp and from the inside you cant see the road before you controls are clunky cars have random physics during same race just slip on the track or are hard to get them off of it theres different collision mechanics so the same objects that were destructible before now are solid and completely ruin your progress on the race if you even lick them

both graphics and effects look like they were the first game in the series not the third it takes such a dive with quality it saddens me after binging previous two games the ui is so disgusting and unreadable you cant even follow your progress in race as the markers on the minimap are all the same colors and theres a ton of different words all around the screen taking your attention off the road you dont know which bar is nitro and which is your cars health everything suddenly needs to be told in a sentence instead of for example health bars damage ratings or just stupid road signs to show you where to turn next theres a counter of how many metersfeet are to the next checkpoint just to name one

theres also no personality to this game previous ones had some characters coming back in every race you knew their names you knew their cars their strenghts and weak points it built some tension and made you more competetive you knew who to watch out for if you were few points away from each other to win the cup theres none of that you dont know anyones name until the race finishes and the list with places show up you dont even know who is who as all cars look so similar and bland and as ive previously stated they all look like it was from a mobile game 

the worst of all is that the crashes are not even satisfactory they dont recompensate us h i tu you cant visibly damage opponents cars as even the text that appears usually says youve dealt 1 damage while one collision with a rock on the track sends you to space you get more damage done to yourself by rubbing against obstacles than by hitting others  while if anyone hits you youre already dead kid

please dont waste your money on this trash even if its 2 it would be worth more if you just took 2 bill and threw it into thrash because maybe some rat or racoon will eat it or some crow or pidgeon will make a nest out of it

ubdont buy this gamebu

#####

its a terrible game but hey at leat i got it nearly for free with the complete pack on sale

#####

just throwing another on the pile for the fun of it

#####

110

#####

part 12 was good part 3 is really bad its not made by bugbear had to refund it

#####

for me this is simply not a flatoutgame the whole feeling is different the driving feels like another racing game but not even a good one i enjoyed the zombie and destruction mode for a few rounds but that was it for me

#####

haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha haha

#####

110 bad game would rather play pizza dude instead

#####

run
run as far away from this hellspawn as you can
no its worse than what even satan could ever create
im on the verge of pulling the trigger on this shotgun right now
please just run in the other direction
unless you want to play it just to see if its as bad as people say
it is
and much more so
you will truly wish you could just end it all right as you start the race


#####

half of everything ive purchased from steam doesnt work

#####

dont play this game d

#####

abomination

#####

not very proud of 100 completing this one

#####

god damn this game sucks flatout 2 is awesome this one is utter shit

#####

no

#####

incredible

#####

the biggest waste of 10 minutes ever

no seriously is that supposed to be a part of the flatout series

#####

really bad game it doesnt deserve its name physics of cars are awful cringy ass character design bad game design ui looks awful aswell the only reason why i bought this game is because it was in flatout pack on sale so if you are planning on buying this game dont go spend money on coffee in starbucks and grab something to eat

#####

when changing too much is a bad thing

#####

to simply put only worth to get extra gift compies for the flatout anthology pack for this games price but it still feel cheated

game is ugly and just a bootleg version of the previous games if we can gave it that much of a honor only fun is the option to use your short music tracks in race if using the beta version otherwise music bland gameplay bland

in conclusion messing with music was fun uninstall worked wonderfully i rest my case

#####

i own both flatout 3 and flatout ultimate carnage which is a improved flatout 2
flatout 3 was designed by a different team from original flatout series
and it totally destroyed the name of the franchise

the control and the present are so bad compared to flatout ultimate carnage
other cons i cant list here it would consume all the storage of steam

so dont buy this buy flatout ultimate carnage

#####

unlike most reviewers of this game i dont actually like flatout all that much im more lenient towards it now than in the past but its still not my most cherished racing franchise by far so when i looked upon all the vitriol of flatout 3 i figured i could at least give it a shot since people were complaining how bad it was and i being someone who isnt a big flatout fan could bring less skewed perspective to the table

noooooope this game is as much the car crash as everyone else has already said flatout has problems but none to the degree of this pile

to start with the controls are completely busted in my opinion you cant rag on a racing games control right out of the box you have to take time to understand the nuances of the way the game handles before you can write it off one of my biggest problems with flatout is its handling which has a very loose and bouncy feel to it that makes it hard to predict what will happen while troublesome at least you could make the car do what you wanted if you were patient and meticulous with the controls that doesnt apply here any driving finesse you could hope for is blown out the window thanks to cars that drift like theyre on glass using the handbrake is an even bigger crapshoot because it spins your car 90 degrees and redirects all the momentum in the direction of the turn which is completely awkward in addition the crappy controls make racing a chore because you can never seem to get a good amount of distance having to struggle with the terrible controls more than race

the graphics are bland like an early xbox 360 game and the camera has a weird fisheye perspective especially when you kick in the boost that doesnt feel natural i get what they were going for but it would have been better just to leave it out one fresh innovation over previous flatout games is the ultimate move which occurs when you fill up a secondary bar when maxed you hit the button and time slows down as well as makes your car invincible being able to plow other cars off the track with only the slightest bump neat but hardly something that makes the awful racing worthwhile beyond that flatouts signature plow into roadside junk and earn boost mechanic is still present which is something i never really cared for in the first place since combined with iffy physics you end up doing yourself a mischief while trying to energize your boost meter by hitting objects the wrong way

one thing flatout has gotten right for me in the past is having a pretty good licensed soundtrack this game has none the menu music is just generic and baffingly theres no music at all when you race why part of a good racing game is having fitting music pumping in the background as you speed along having nothing is dumb as rocks

anyway i didnt get very far because this game is such a junk heap this is definitely one of the worst racing games ive played even as someone who thinks flatout leaves a fair bit to be desired i only played this because of the upcoming flatout 4 total insanity and frankly i wish i skipped it

#####

i bought it for the memes and while i would say there are worse games on steam like uriels chasm being somewhat of a fan of the first 3 flatout games its really sad to see a series started by bugbear butchered so badly by a developer or maybe publisher who just leaned full force into the wackiness of flatout games without offering any replacement for generally great damage and physics model of flatout games before it alright maybe expect flatout 2 so yeah lets burry it deeper  enjoy the title of the worstrated game on steam

#####

couldnt even play enough to get my steam cards lol

#####

disgusting

#####

hey guys you forgot the unity logo at the start

#####

i played it so you dont have to play this garbage
