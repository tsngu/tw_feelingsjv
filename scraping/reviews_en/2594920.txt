so loading screen this game i loading screen s actually pretty loading screen again ok but loading screen the gacha rates loading screen are terrible loading screen and you loading screen have to loading screen go through loading screen too loading screen many loading loading screen screens bethesda loading screen would be loading screen proud

#####

so i want to start saying that i absolutely adore the atelier series although ive roughly been a fan for only 8 years its something thats near and dear to me as i review this i bluntly state this is a game that never should have been made from gameplay to cinematics to story everything felt half baked here are my thoughts on the alchemy system the combat gameplay and the story itself along with any tangents that may or may not be relevant

first off the alchemy system what is the pride and joy that is the core of the franchise itself is an extremely shallow system gated by the need to roll on the gacha the alchemy system in every atelier game and a few other gust games allows you to mix and match items to create equipment and combat items every game allows you to fine tune each item or build on the next iteration of any given item to make them stronger using resources you can find in exploratory maps resleriana requires you to use units you to roll on the gacha in order to build said items forcing you to spend in game currency or real world money to obtain effects you would not find anywhere else

to put into detail when crafting a recipe in resleriana it requires you to use 2 support units from your roster and an item that you gathered in a dungeon recipes start off with 3 specified characters you are not required to have but give specific starting colours and you are to choose units that follows those colours and an item that follows the last units colours once you have the necessary parts and fully craft a recipe the product inherits the stated effects from your units and the item youve chosen this greatly restricts the customization of any item you can produce and heavily relies on the gacha to produce items with effects you want in addition they also want you to roll for duplicate characters as the system will mostly produce low quality effects until you have higher star ratings for better consistency effect quality is also tied to the units at hand alchemists are provide a bonus chance to increase effect quality and increasing their rarity vastly increases that chance

as for the combat gameplay resleriana uses a battle system similar to its modern cousins or if you want a specific example from a more recognizable franchise final fantasy 10s atb system the atb system for resleriana gives full detail of how the battle flows from your own units initiative to when the enemy acts from here the game describes when someone acts as a panel turn which gives the game its own twist individual panels will have a buff effect or a debuff effect that you can see on the timeline the atelier franchise is unique compared to other jrpgs in that it asks you to manipulate action economy in battle whether it be by item breaking an enemys stance if applicable or by status effect the games give you multiple ways to do so that being said reslerianas combat loop wants your units to obtain buffs on their turn and force the debuffs onto your enemies except thats when it begins to fall apart

one of the core ways to manipulate the combat timeline in resleriana requires the use of items panels can be pushed back in the timeline by using an item during your own units turn items are locked to a charge gauge that require a certain number of turns to pass before you can use an item those familiar with blue reflection 2 would see a similar system with its supporterreserve party member system where they can use an item or a special action done by the character in reserve

every differently named item has its own unique effect modified and expanded on via the alchemy system for the game products with effects that inflict debuffs are wierd for lack of a better term when applying a status debuff onto an enemy these debuffs will eventually expire after a certain amount of turns each panel that passes and for every action taken counts as a single turn meaning that debuffs expire very aggressively with items that produce status buffs they instead last for a number of attacks instead that isnt much of an issue with the exception that your enemies have area of effect aoe attacks of my current list of recipes ingame as i am writing this products with defensive buffs last for 1 attack from the enemy this can be easily be removed if the enemy has an aoe attack in queue you may say that you can push the enemy back with the given mechanics and prevent that but multiple aoe attacks can be and will be queued up against you when possible

in addition the effects that you produce for items via the alchemy system have very small benefits for whatever reason the resulting effects from crafting have very small modifiers with some of the best results being a 10 bonus for a general buff or debuff specialized buffs have a much higher modifier percentage but still requires you to roll on the gacha to obtain those effects and if you do managed to get those effects your party may not be able to capitalize on that due either your loadout or the enemy loadout presumably the reason why these effect modifiers are so low are due to the status effects provided by the panels in combat or because of the gacha equipment that you obtain when rolling for characters which is its own can of worms

now for the story admittedly the story is one of the things i dislike the least for resleriana it is however very meandering which is par for the course for many atelier games a lot of the story beats in this is similar to an early fategrand order where for no applicable reason you are shoved into a combat encounter clear the encounter or do not progress the story a lot of the marketing for resleriana is centered around gals being pals going as far as having the pull animation for the gacha being an adventure with title character resna and the secondary viewpoint character velaria except they never interact with each other in story i have only progressed as far as chapter 235

there have been several points in the story where a character accompanies resna to act as a guide to protect her or simply as a companion they never actually show up in the combat encounters from the start you are given resna and a freebie unit named shallistera if you never engage with the gacha at all they are the only two characters you have in the entire game izana best friend of resna is introduced as the absolute third character in the game who touts herself as guardian of resna and wants to be a knight she is not playable you never get her as a unit nor is she acquirable from the gacha for whom is essentially a core character and part of resnas character growth you never see that in gameplay

in my opinion atelier resleriana is an insult to the franchise itself which is funny as they had another gacha game that was shuttered called atelier online and it was mechanically a lot closer to the original games itself than what resleriana does with its own mechanics

i have far more grievances with this than what i have written down for this review however what is written down is what i believe to be some of the worst issues it has without tapping into how bad its monetization is this game is a high effort cash grab it does not respect your time and wants you to open up your wallet it costs 40 usd or 50 cad to perform a set of 10 pulls from the gacha it flashes splash screens of deals touting massively inflated discounts without telling you how much it would actually be

to repeat myself this is an insult to the atelier franchise do not play this game do not download this game and perish any thought thinking this would be something to check out play the actual atelier games instead not atelier tia that is a porn fangame whether be it purchasing the games on steam or emulating the old classics an atelier game should be worth your time resleriana will never be

#####

youve played one gacha game you have played them all the usual fixings beginning that barely tells a story shows you the cool characters you could get if you drop some cash some early summons to get you hooked on the feeling of gambling for a character game play is fairly standard with turn based combat and a flashy if long animation for the alchemy if you are a person that likes this kind of game just remember for 20 the price of their launch guaranteed 3 star summon you could probably get an actual atelier game on sale if you wanna see ryza jiggle wallet be dmned then go for it i again wish steam had a middle of the road rating as this game warrants it remember just because it is a bunch of anime women in a game does not make it any less gambling

#####

its a shame that resna will be stuck in a gacha game she really deserves better than some game filled with predatory mechanics honestly if you are a fan of atelier games just get through the story and have fun checking out great new models for the old characters do not spend any money on this game its not worth it

#####

this is not an atelier game  as a fan of the series im seriously disappointed that this is what they gave us  its a gacha game with overpriced currency and the exact same gameplay loop as every other mobile gacha game out there  do better kt

#####

its a gacha game and you should know what those are before getting into it glorified gambling with anime girls and you can only lose money not win it with that being said here are the key points of interest as of launch as far as a gacha game goes

1 rates
 4 for top rarity character
 05 for featured featured character
 2 for top rarity equipment memoirs in this game
 same gacha pool for characters and equipment in one banner

rates look pretty standard if youve come from other gacha games until you realize it costs almost double to buy the gems for the pulls a 10 pull costs 50 cad 3740 usd they do give you an option to use a limited paid banner thats half off but also only gives half the amount of pity tokens 

2 pity
150 tokens to select character of your choice from current banner from my understanding the pity tokens carry over to different banners so you can eventually save up to pick a current banner character you want if you do a full priced 10pull you get 11 tokens or 1 token if you do singles that means it takes a little over 13 full priced 10 pulls to secure a pity from 0

if you were to buy the top priced package that gives you the most amount of bonus gems a full pity costs about 568 cad 420 usd for 1 character thats right pity in this game is 2x more expensive than hsr or genshin

3 stamina
following the trend of more recent gacha games like the hoyoverse games pretty much all materials tied to character progression and development require doing content that needs stamina 100 stamina takes a little over 8 hours to recharge and you get 280 in free recharges a day provided you log in after certain times to claim 200 of the 280 if you watch ads on the mobile version you can get another 30 everything from gathering materials to craft gear materials to enhance characters exp equipment all require stamina so theres a mountain of things that need it with barely enough given if you decide to pay for stamina recharges the price increases the more you recharge

4 gameplay
with all the gacha bs out of the play the gameplay is a pretty standard turn based rpg with optional autobattle while there are some nuances of turn management since there are certain buffs and debuffs that appear on the turn order that if you manipulate your turns well you can get better boosts while giving your enemies the debuffs enemies have a break gauge on top of an hp gauge where if you deplete the break gauge their turn gets delayed and they receive more damage

its a decent battle system in theory but unfortunately due to the nature of being a gacha game where the main gameplay is grinding the same dungeons they even let you skip maps youve cleared fast enough with no one dying over and over again there is very few moments where you need to ever engage with all the systems that is worth doing

being an atelier game of course alchemy is in it but due to everything costing stamina this also includes your ability to gather materials being shared with needing to do other content that powers up the characters you have a limited about items youre allowed to craft as mana is another time gated system to where even if you have the materials you need to wait for mana to regenerate to craft it its just a shame the game like many others is all waiting on timers and stamina to do anything 

as of now there are no events currently running so gem acquiring rate is about 50 a day from dailies and another 60 or so if you watch 3 minutes of ads and it costs 300 per pull

5 graphicsmusic
pretty amazing as far as anime gacha game standards go if you didnt know it was a gacha game and just saw gameplay footage of it it would pass for graphicsmusic of a new regular atelier game title its unfortunate that all this effort went into a gambling simulator 

6 ending thoughts
its really a shame that coming off the success of the 3 ryza games is this colossal money grab of a game to just fleece the fanbase res is cute and she deserved a game that wasnt this a game where you have to wait 4 hours for mana to regenerate to synthesis one item a game where you can gather materials from 3 areas before running out of stamina and having to wait 8 hours for it to regenerate a game that has the balls to charge more for their micro transactions than some of the most famousinfamous gacha games while offering way less for what they charge

#####

h1do not let this mobile gacha be your first experience with atelier just because its freeh1
the only good things are the visual presentation and the crossover aspect it looks great and it puts all the alchemists together but then again we already had a fangirl meets the alchemists spinoff in nelke go play that if you want the fanservice bhonestly all the value of this can be gotten by just watching all the cutscenes on youtubeb 
its a very basic mobile game as in theres no overworld of actual gameplay outside of battle its all menuing you progress the story by clicking next on a typical generic mobile game menu saturated with prompts to log in daily buy currency mail rewards friend invite codes the mobile f2p works 
theres also a stamina system where you have to expend sometimes premium resources if you run out the game is divided bewteen menu screens cutscenes synthesis and battle s and both synthesis and battles have been oversimplified into the ground to the point these are just not ateliers systems anymore they are a basic mobile games  even the crossover aspects enjoyment is tainted by the fact this is a gacha game so you have to wishpull characters from the franchise by expending the real money buyable gem currency over and over to get the characters you want if it was a gacha crossover game but at least had a full atelier games gameplay and mechanics it would be more tolerable but its a super simplified experience that feels like an atelier skin on a generic mobile game than atelier even if it looks nice its not  say a mihoyo atelier nothing that feels that much like an actual game
hey some people must like these type of thing if they become so popular with so many franchises but for me its just sad
im really afraid this will make people think this is what atelier is about and turn them off it please i beg you do not let this mobile gacha be your first experience with atelier just because its free

#####




i honestly fell in love with atelier series few years back and seeing a new one come out was a treat

tldr  do everyone and favor and play any of the many other atelier games this one is plainly worse compared to even 2013 releases 

then i noticed it is a f2p
has a mobile release
is a gacha

regardless my level of simping for the series not the characters i swear officer was strong enough to get me to try it
made it past the intro that took over an hour had some fan service and was generally cool  but it made it obvious that they significantly simplified the crafting from the original titles and also the combat  not that there was a lot of depth to it in the first place but when i started playing it felt challenging enough 

oh in case you assumed i meant here no here its simple enough where they not only allow you to fully auto the combat but also fully auto character selection and their equipment 

speaking of equipment  its basically copy and pasted from the previous games again so i cant even give them credit for that

add to that the whole payed characters thing so if you want to play ryza sophie or marie  well you gotta dish out money as depending on luck is not a valid way of getting characters 
add to that they use the fomo systems like for the next 70 hours you can get 500 value pack for 5 bucks and for only 20 bucks you can get whatever character you want if you do it in next 70 hours  simply disgusting 

#####

gacha rate sucks and currency for purchase is too expensive despite that

#####

beautiful presentation paired with outdated and archaic gacha game design i was hoping that the game design would have matched with the lavish animation and great visuals on display but the game plays like a gacha from 10 years ago with freepaid banners a stamina system way too many currencies and a monotonous story system this could have been something special but gacha has come along way since fgo and granblue and copying those games isnt going to cut it in 2024

#####

why bother playing this when you could be playing one of the 24 proper atelier games 
all this game does is try and copy all the fun aspects of atelier games only to water them down into a boring gacha game format

#####

skip this game teach gust that we dont want gacha in atelier

#####

mobile game that misses what makes real atelier games good

no exploration its all a menu
battle system is simplified and boring
characters from previous games are just shoehorned in
free to play mobile stuff invite codes paid currencies timers stamina etc everywhere

too bad because the art and music are nice

#####

no exploration no material gathering too much gacha this is honestly disappointing for players who like the atelier games

#####

this game made me realize id never want a series i like to turn into a gacha game

#####

i didnt have very high hope for this game but after 40 hrs of f2p playing and finished chapter 4 i am honestly surprised how good this game is let me explain

first lets get the obvious ones reviewed the graphic is top notch everyone agrees the character models design acting are 5 stars the scenery are beautiful music is good as well

now the gameplay i find the gameplay mechanic very good not just you need to use the right element characters you need to have a plan which monster to attack first which to ignore and what position you want to put your character in the turn sequence to have maximum affect and use the items in the right time sometimes determine win or loss of the battle that is just the battle you need to synthesize the items and decide which ones to equip the characters it all become very interesting especially the bosses tower floor and to get 3 stars on higher difficulty orb mission you need to pick your brain to come up with a good plan

so the gameplay is good how toxic is the monetization actually you dont need to spend money i use free stars to pull and get 3 star characters sometimes and you can buy 1500 stars 10 pull from shop using free stars so you dont have to spend that much free stars for pulling you dont need to pay to win at all the energy they give everyday is very generous as well also story and tower you dont need energy to play so you can try different things and not afraid to fail 

this game to me honestly is an aaa rated game good graphics good gameplay than some paid rpg games to me i find it very charming relaxing and peaceful to play i really get into a good mood every time i play that is enough reason to play the game and that is why i like it a lot i see myself play this game for a very long long time

#####

get showered with free shit and have no control for 30 minutes get to the point where you can play the game but then realize that its just a nothing sandwich all you do is click through some menus it takes a couple core mechanics from the main games and thenstrips them down until theres nothing left if you get tired of the combat having three buttons to click you can reduce it to one thanks to auto battle the only positive thing i have to say here is that the girls are cute obviously and its quite nostalgic to see over 2 decades worth of characters from the series with new models and more animated and expressive than theyve ever been but when thats your selling point its a given 

if youre a gacha gameidle game enjoyer you might find some fun here somewhere somehow but if youre a fan of ateliermana khemia then youll probably find nothing but disappointment here unless you want to see some shiny new models its all style and no substance

#####

highly disappointing kt you can and should do better than this there is a decade worth of gacha games out there doing better systems gameplay and overall experience than this

the goodish
characters look good with the exception of any instance that a character has a cape or sleeves there is a lot of antigravity fabric in the game that is becoming less excusable with each passing year
story is okay but because of how the gameplay systems are it lacks the feel of an atelier game

the bad
as a gacha it makes every single bad or wrong choice possible rates are awful duplicate pulls are meaningless powering up characters feels empty and is extremely slow as well as gated character role alternates which are already in the game seem to be the bare minimum of rework removed the coat
synthesis has a neat idea going but is ultimately broken as everything is tied to materials that cost stamina and each synthesis requires mana you are expected to synthesize up to 30 times a week which is pointless in this too far away from the franchise
earned gacha currency is clearly absent from the very beginning of the game if players look through the sources they are earning as startup currency from they will quickly realize it is a limited well that dries up fast
navigating to any content tends to be really slow and tedious everything plays an animation and usually has a load screen this is fine at first or once in a while but it rapidly becomes an annoyance
combat is often broken and unbalanced its not very fun nor interesting you only get so many items to use which is directly counter to the franchise you make a lot of items to use in battle in actual main line games the only nice thing is that your items are replenished automatically which seems like it was a bandage on a problem

the super bad
premium currency is very expensive for what you can do with it what you can do with it is not much by the way
as mentioned gacha rates are very bad and handling of duplicates is player hostile
if i had used premium currency when i got 4 tao in a single 10 pull i would have immediately uninstalled
the pity system is also far from good as some pulls just do not count toward it if there were actual incentive to play for a long time it might be justified but the negatives quickly drain interest in bothering to open the game

kt has made some really good stories with this series its been one of my favorite franchises sad to see this mess that feels like a cross between a cash grab and a buffer till they make the next proper installment in the franchise nobody should be surprised if this is shut down within the year if they can fix the problems and learn how to do it right from other gacha then maybe it stands a chance that said kt has tried multiple atelier gacha now and still not learned anything

#####

i play a lot of gacha games i saw the reviews and wondered is this a bad gacha game or do fans of the actual atelier series just hate gacha this motivated me to leave a review

maybe its a mix of both  it is not an outstanding gachamobile game but it does a lot of things better than the current competition and seems like a decent one to play the strong points to me are the fully voiced story and the good quality of life features so i can currently recommend it if you like or dont mind this type of game
the biggest con is obviously that the regular atelier games are better or rather they are a different genre that usually has a different audience and is also less predatory its hard to look at resleriana in isolation but i dont want to get into that here i dont know what gust is planning

more detailed thoughts on the game
 graphics are very pretty you can easily look at them yourself though
 gameplay is quite standard 90 of the gameplay is turn based battles with no particularily strong gimmick they are fun to me but nothing special there are a few different modes like dungeons where you have to manage your resources over the course of many battles challenge battles where you get score etc there is barely any gameplay aside from this the crafting is quite simple and the few overworld segments are corridors where you run from left to right i definitely think the game could have had some open areas you can explore freely to gather or some other additional gameplay
 quality of life is good above average in 2024 in my opinion auto works for everything skip battles are available for your daily grind rerolls are basically instantaneous and dont require you to create additional accounts there are buttons to upgrade all of your character nodes at once etc to me this is an extremely strong pro since not having good qol is the main reason i quit gachas
 controls are very mediocre on pc basically nonexistent but im honestly happy it has a pc port and i dont have to use emulators it runs well on my phone too the large ui simple controls and the fact that my phone doesnt immediately overheat make it relatively enjoyable to play on my phone as well which i cant say about any of the other gacha i currently play
 rateup seems very bad  sophie is only a 05 compared to the nonrateup 02 of all the other 3stars im not sure if this is better on single banners rates seem decent 4 for a character 2 for a weapon for 6 3 rate total but i havent looked at the bigger picture pull income pity etc so i cant say much you can pick any character youd like after 150 pulls though regardless of the current banner which seems quite nice
 story is fully voiced and often has nice cinematic cutscenes im not a huge fan of the visual novel style presentation in the average scenes though the isekai plot with random characters from the old games feels a bit odd im definitely enjoying the new characters the most
  characters are really good though you might as well play the normal atelier games looking at the jp roadmap it seems most of the future banners feature alternate costumes of characters that are already in the game which makes the roster quite lackluster as well but somewhat mitigates the just play old games point by introducing content unique to resleriana characters are often the biggest reason to play a gacha game but like i said you might as well just go and play the real games here

#####

first and foremost most of the negative reviews are just atelier fans whining thats its a gacha so heres an objective review having not spent a dime and reaching rank 5 after a couple hours

what the game does well
fully voiced dialogue
animated cutscenes
fluid animations
enjoyable music
short tutorial
custom synthesis stats synthesize gear specific to your needs
fully skippable cutscenes and dialogue for the impatient gamer
free instant auto clears replay content for instant rewards time saver
free to play friendly based on story progression and cleared content gacha not required
free stamina recharges 200 daily from pies 1 free crystal recharge every day
easy dailyweekly quest requirements
auto combat smart enough to ss score battles
can increase characters stars awaken them for free through daily content on lowest difficulty 3 shards a day


when you compare what other gachas in general often do this game shines
this game doesnt have a vip system to exclusively reward high spenders
this game doesnt have a battle pass or monthly pass
this game doesnt make you pay for instant clears of content unlimited
this game doesnt force you to roll duplicate characters to max their stats
this game doesnt make you pay for x2 or x3 speed in combat

as for the paid vs free banners fgo romancing sagas gacha ff7s recent gacha and many others have paid only content its not even worth complaining about at the end of the day no one can play if they shut down the servers due to server costs

as a free player being able to experience a new story collect and level up characters and progress with ease unimpeded by paywalls i can say that this game is objectively good when placed next to competitors

#####

doesnt beat the actual atelier games in the series this better not be the direction they take with these i prefer having actual gameplay

#####

been playing the jp version since its launch

a short foreword 
fans of the main series will be understandably disappointed by how simplistic the alchemy system is and how its more character dependent rather than on materials downgraded world exploration and the fact that this is inherently a gatcha game these are likely the leading factor for majority of the downvotes to those people i will say that this game is developed mainly by akatsuki games and that this series will not hinder gusts production of the main series

with that foreword out of the way there is fun to be had in this game by its own merits 
one will immediately recognize the care and quality put into the characters by team ninja dead or alive series animators through their animations in and out of combat which breathes life into all aspects of the game from cutscenes to menus to the pivotal story steps this aspect is likely unanimously praised although some characters do seem to appear a bit different in their transition ryza series claudia being one of the worst offenders but she still looks good

i would highly recommended playing this game mainly for the story and events in this respect atelier fans and newcomers alike will certainly find enjoyment here  its basically what nelke and the legendary alchemists tried to do as a crossover spin off but as a gatcha game this has the longevity to include more of the cast gradually over time simply more of that slice of life moments that atelier games are known for rather than worldending catastrophic events of other jrpgs although other characters will mostly just take a supporting role in the main stories the side stories do feature them as the main focal of their respective stories ultimately the side stories are inconsequential to the main story
the main characters themselves undergo emotional development and without going into the spoilers the story itself is well written enough to make you invested in these characters special mention to izana who undergoes her own character arc starting at the end of chapter 4

the combat is a turnbased timeline system taking inspiration from the atelier series and blue reflection but the twist here is that burst skills and certain debuffbuffs are tied to the timeline instead of an expendable resource this requires a certain level of foresight from the player before acting and sometimes stunning enemies immediately isnt always the optimal option in addition buffs and skills being tied to the timeline becomes a double edged sword which can conversely be utilized by enemies as well 
so the foundation of the combat system is solid but overtime becomes repetitive boss fights do add to the mix by introducing new debuffs to the timeline which can also affect the bosses but hopefully the developers further expound on the system and add more variety

overall i highly recommend this game for the story but your mileage will vary with the gameplay

#####

what a cynical soulless turn for the franchise

do better

#####

do _not_ play this game unless youre some kind of buddhist with no wants or ties to the materialistic whatsoever 

i love atelier im an avid gacha game player too the gameplay is solid the vibes are good atelier times 
everything atelier about this game is fine good or great 

the gacha though the fing gacha this is by far the worst most egregious scummy gacha system ive seen it makes companies like hoyo look like santa claus in comparison 

pity system is awful 150 pulls for any top rarity character released regardless of banner if you know gacha that sounds pretty dang alright no woops wrong the amount of free resources you get for playing the game is absolutely pitiful and theres no light spender options like daily gems or a bp every banner you can buy 20 pulls from the shop for the price of 10 but guess fing what they dont give you pity so if you dont get anything you just wasted a lot of time for a fckload of nothing oh also theyre limited to the current banner you cant even save them for better banners 
and the rate they drop new banners at are absolutely insane in the worst way possible its every week or two about one and a half week per banner on average

did i mention dupes are literally worthless and youll be getting a lot of them for the shittiest characters you dont wanna use anyway

ive played this game since launch now and ive payed a bit 100 i havent gotten a _single_ good character from the gacha except the ones i rerolled for hours for in the beginning and im still 30 pulls away from pity thats absolutely insane 

its absolutely vile and the people behind the monetization are not only morally bankrupt but incredibly fing stupid they could have had a solid gacha game that wasnt the most cynical cash grab and a loyal playerbase they could have raked in waaaay more money if they just had any business acumen or brain cells for that matter 

ive played dozens of gacha games of varying qualities and gacha systems and this is the first one whos gacha system literally causes me physical pain out of sheer stress and frustration this is the kinda stuff that will put the people in the company at danger because of how intent they are at pissing people off

sophie best girl

honestly this was a tough game to rate as both a regular gacha player and an atelier fan

as a gacha game atelier resleriana is f2p friendly the units you get for free and the 12star units are perfectly usable allowing you to clear all content in the game without much issue so long as you pay attention to break bars and the turn order the rates are not terrible either but atelier reslerianas biggest failure as a gacha game is undoubtedly the currency gain

compared to the currency needed to execute a 10pull the gacha currency gain is simply disappointing theres not really any other way to put it and the paid currency only banners are nothing short of maximum cringe yeah they need to make money somehow but ive played a ton of gacha games consistently and none of them have paid only banners yet are still staying afloat arknights aether gazer limbus company etc

aside from that the game itself is fine combat and combat length feels appropriate for a gacha game and the lack of rng in acquiring board upgrade materials is a huge plus but thats all

as an atelier fan i cant help but wish resna was reborn into the game she deserves to have as a character i feel like she has great potential and charm like the other atelier heroines and i look forward to reading the story between battles especially resnas interactions with izana and the protagonists of the other atelier games i want to see resna solve the problems in her world and become a great alchemist i want to see izana make her dream come true and become a knight

but what i dont want to deal with is the lackluster alchemy system and how its practically screaming at you to roll for more characters so you can add better qualities to the things you craft the research system is also equally boring and uninspired as is the gearing and everything else in between gathering is a snoozefest rather than a fun activity and the ability to auto through it really shows us what the developers were thinking when they made these aspects of the game

its obvious that the components of what makes an atelier game atelier werent the key choices that the developers were prioritizing when making this game and its sad to see that as someone who loves the series and the characters therein there isnt even a lore reason for memorias what they are or why they exist im pretty sure the developers just saw craft essences andor light cones and decided to shove it in there

crazy

in spite of all that i cant say this game is horrible it succeeds at what it sets out to become a gacha game featuring characters from the atelier series purely basing my rating on that i think this game is a solid 610 and its actually quite decent as far as gachas go 

but its not an atelier game the story allows it to cosplay as one but the illusion quickly falls apart i hope this game is just a stopgap until they manage to give resna and friends the real atelier game they deserve but thats enough copium for today

tldr its pretty okay as a gacha game but its not really an atelier game its just cosplaying as one

#####

i wanted a comfy gacha that doesnt take too much time and i got it

#####

i am a very big atelier fans and im so sad seeing this turn into a gacha game

i would rather pays 100 for big atelier game to enjoy the new story and character rather than 100 just for gacha 1 character in same game

please dont support this stupid gacha game
big disappointment for atelier fans

#####

cute characters but boring gameplay

#####

i need a real atelier game without gacha

#####

this may have atelier in the name but it isnt an atelier game dont be fooled by the free to play the amount of animations and camera angle movements and sparkly ui gave me whiplash its all too much i love ui im a ux designer its my job and i appreciate the beautiful layout but it has no purpose bar to confuse you 

there is no freedom in the game you watch a story cut scene click the 1 or 2 buttons to battle more story rinse repeat there is no exploration tbh this should be only a mobile game i played those before you play gatcha get items see some story which is boring here and then click a button to fight done 

the interactions are designed flashy like a childrens game but its not kids who can afford the gatcha prices lol so who is this made for 

very very disappointing dont play this teach these game companies they cant just dump garbage on us and we will give them money be more picky with your wallet

#####

installs f2p gacha
leaves bad review because it has gacha mechanics

its one of the better mobile games but still a mobile game and the worst in the atelier series with its generic turnbased system with a few mobile buttons to push until you winlose a battle can restart at least and has a fast forward button to make battles go faster extremely grind heavy invite a friend code all its login dailies weeklies events and achievements to keep you coming back for more garbage time wasting stamina system with timed events wish gacha mechanic currency packs free and paid loderstar gems memoria character cards that give power once you start getting into the story youll unlock recipes to start crafting items for your characters after a few battles youll unlock quests training these rec power level and have easy normal hard and elite challenges to beat stamina needed and then you have materials that have score battle and dungeons

we cant forget the shop where you can spend the different currencies in monthly with ingame gold you acquire for items like xp candy mana return etc then shiny coins you can purchase gold orbs crafting material then other where you can purchase powerup xp and memory cores for loderstar gems in bundles spend loderstar gems for tickets or bundles that have xp board panels and gold there is piece exchange and wish medals that you can purchase characters with if you have youll be given pieces instead but all this is to get you to be a pay piggy 

there is massively jiggly anime boobs and upskirts all the fanservice shots for poorwhale gaymers

#####

ive been gated out of the story for 3 days in a row now i just log in try and fail to improve my characters and then go play something else there is nothing for me to do other than boring exp quests or watch my characters die

#####

this game isnt really an atelier game lets get that out of the way first if there was a meh option id choose that but its a yn question

its a mobile jrpg with gacha mechanics everything is accessed through a convoluted ui you dont even have to play the game because its an auto battler with a skip option and you can buy upgrades in the cash shop so you can play even less

the story is fine and of course the character designs are great if you like the previous atelier games and just want to spend more time with the characters in a fluffy sol vn with optional combat this is fine but i wouldnt recommend it to players looking for a starting point to the franchise and id hesitate about recommending it to players returning to the franchise

personally yes i do like the game im a gacha addict but no i dont think id ever recommend it to anyone

#####

bi understand people getting worried that the trend of atelier games will shift to gacha i feel the same but that alone doesnt let the game deserve a bad review i gave it a chance even after reading the mixed reviews and so far im enjoying itb

if i were to describe this game in one sentence at the time of this review it will be a cute  chill visual novel with strategic turnbased battles ive listed the good and bad below

the good
banimationsb they really went the extra mile for this like making expressions lovely  the way clothes and hair sway also if you bring a different character as the leader into a dungeon they will do unique animations and to the guys yes this includes boing boing physics
battention to extra detailb im not only talking about how good the game looks each time i hop into a story cutscene pop out and i see the characters chilling in a different scene on the home screen i love it that they took the extra mile to create different scenes and not make the home screen look dead totally wallpaperworthy especially on an ultrawide screen totally wallpaper material
byou can meet previous charactersb this is a nobrainer for fans and im very happy to be able to meet and see previous characters in hd while bringing back memories through their skill animations and cute victory poses aka you dont need to wait for eg atelier totori remake
btheres fastforward featuresb battles have auto mode and a fastforward feature for those who dont have much time and dialogue can be skipped entirely but do note that each and every sentence is voiced which i highly respect

the bad
bno freeroamb i guess to cater for mobile they tried another approach to this game all you need and farm for are available through quests which you can complete in bulk skip once you beat that difficulty at least once there is a little bit of controlling the character but its only left or right during certain quests
bthe battlesb although this is my personal preference i miss the usage of mp for characters who arent alchemists also for enemies that have a counter mechanic we unfortunately do not have the ability to defend anymore so were forced to attack and be countered if thats the only enemy left other than these the battles are quite fun with most earlygame battles requiring a simple strategy to break the enemy then smack it good with different characters having different roles

the bottom line is give this game a try the gameplay is not for everyone generic story line included im ok with it but hey its free sure its a gacha game but they are currently quite generous and you still can enjoy the story without putting money into it as its not pay to progress at the time of writing

#####

disappointing and simply unfortunate in the beginning i was honestly very pleased with the aesthetic voice acting and the soundtrack the battle system was enjoyable enough for me and it was nice seeing fully animated models rather than reverting back to 2d or chibi models between cutscenes like other games however after getting through the tutorialprologue and getting access to the home screen i dove into the shop to see the damage and wow was it rough to look at every other gacha game i play has a 10 pull cost between 15 usd and 20 usd outside of the one time x2 gem packages and the time limited 50 off banner a banner 10 pull will run you 40 usd which is outrageous the reason i look only at the raw purchase cost is because thats what it will cost in the long term those one time x2 packages are only good for one purchase so to me its not standard

another thing is how they choose to display the gems there being a paid and a free gem isnt out of the ordinary for other gacha games many do have a premium rate up banner voucher and a non premium standard banner voucher but in this game they dont even bother separating them on the home screen for the player to quickly identify how many paid and free gems they have you have to manually click on the gem icon to enter the shop and then it will show you individually how much you have basically conditioning you to keep entering the shop i know its a minor detail but to me thats such a simple thing and its so misleading to the player and could very well cause confusion is just separating them on the home screen too much to ask for come on 

now listen im not opposed to spending money on gachas here and there ive done so over the years in blue archive and azur lane and in general never felt cheated out on the price to me in those games plus those two games are true examples of free to play friendly and the devs like handing out resources to the players this atelier game howeverit really was painful seeing the general cost outside of limited packages to see what you are really in for in the long term 

overall i just cant recommend this game the shop pack cost is very aggressive firstly gacha games are simply gambling that part is always a rough recommend but i can draw the line in the sand and ill gladly stay on my side with free to play friendly games like blue archive and azur lane for those of you out there that ignore any money related things in games like this and like the atelier franchise well there may be some substance here for you but if youre anything like me and might drop a few bucks here and there for a big event character skins etc then just turn away from this game theres plenty of other options out there and more to come over the year that treat the players more fairly if youre looking for a gacha game to play

#####

angle yes i am an atelier fan no i dont mind gacha games review is based on what i have played not some valuefornomoney equation 

credit where its due cut scenes are beautiful and the characters eyes look so alive they are practically sparkling  being intensely cute at all times moe fatigue ensues however clearly going in the right direction or would be

after some hours battle system feels drab synthesis alchemy for dummies no exploration
i have about 10 unfinished atelier games which consistently look worse and offer so much more than this some i bought twice for the sake of getting yet another costume kt can definitely squeeze money out of my wallet try again

these are first impressions i will update my review not there is no reason to play this on steam 

would play it on a phone pretty sure half an hour of this would put me to sleep in a good way

#####

its a gacha people on steam are quite split about those hence the mixed reception if youre not put off by that the game is alright and has good production values

#####

although i do love the atelier series and in some ways i do find this game fun i would never recommend this game as a way to engage people into the atelier franchise because it removes every charming thing about the games outside the art

#####

its not horrible its a bog standard gacha game though its missing some core features like a friends list for one negative review because atelier online was better than this

do not let this game be your first experience with the atelier series please play any of the others theyre great games i recommend the mysterious dx games starting with sophie or the ryza trilogy

#####

sleepy game

#####

i get people dont like gachas and thats fair personally im a big fan of the format as it typically produces significantly above average mobile games this is in part due to making more money but also bigger budgets because of the expected income and long term gravitas

one thing i will say is that if what others say is true that this is infact supposed to be a mainline entry id personally feel like thats a betrayal to the long term fansmyself included i just viewed it as a culmination for the characters to interact with each other which has been super cool

in terms of standalone performance the game has all the standard gachaisms skip functions character growth party building and stamina most of them are on par with the average experience within the field some things like the daily bonuses and pity system are pretty far above ime overall probably about a 355 standalone like 455 because its atelier

#####

this review is for the gacha game veterans out there

 this one is very free to play friendly gives you enough currency to roll 10 after the tutorial and rerolling is immediate since you can skip the tutorial after doing it once just delete profile data in menu then it gives you enough currency for 20 more rolls doing guide missions and buying the 2 of the 10 roll tickets in the shop all awakening materials can be gained by a skippable after the first time mission that awards you with shards for the characters in your party 3 times per day but you do get them from duplicates as well among other qol features i wish so many other gacha games had also there are non 3 star units that are actually worthwhile to have

#####

story is kinda bland

gacha rates is trash the idea to mix memorias with characters hilarious

if you are into casual games go ahead but there are much more better games out there this game just doesnt cut in

#####

i can recommend it as an occasional time waster since it is free and the animations are impressive for fans of art anime and casual crafting gacharpgs however you are missing out if you dont play some of the main atelier games they are all far superior and a much better use of your time i would also suggest you check out honkai star rail which is similar but more polished and fleshed out

visuals cinematics animations
music
free
characters story
includes past atelier characters
some exploration dungeons
amount of content overall
turnbased battles

meh dont pay for this grind go play a real atelier game

#####

tldl
its the most meh atelier game ive played its really cute but i hate to see this franchise being this bad do you wanna play a good atelier game start from rorona in my opinion

pros 
60 fps
good intro
adorable characters
free
japanese voice acting seems fine

cons
gacha game with a predatory market with items you can only get from buying ingame currencies paid currency
battle system isnt fun or engaging  and to not waste time you need the 3x speed
frame drops when changing menu
bad transitions from quests to character menu
the characters arent prerendered they are models with a skeleton moved around so hair and clothes glitch out sometimes
ingame downloadupdate forces you to listen to the intro over and over
confusing marketwish system at first


soooo i played it for a bit tried a few things

decent enough intro song but you have to listen to it when downloading the update so had to listen to this song 34 times before it was done updating so there goes that hype of a good intro 
even that there is no setting to mute the song or not play it when updating either
i could go into my pc settings and mute the game overall but they should have through of that 
and when the update ended it didnt just go on it waited for me to click return to title menu wtf

i love atelier games been their fan ever since rorona and loved all their games until ryza the combat ruined it for me in general i kinda get that changing up combat is fine with turnbased systems but ryza felt so ruined as your party just felt like puppets acting and it gave me no way to get interested in their characters unless they were the main character in combat 

this game tries to do what other gacha games does with exp farm and material farming they even make a dungeon that does the exact same as farming materials and there is a pie system to give you 100 energy everyday i see what they are trying to do but everything is such a mess of many weird things they wanted to include without much personality in it only personality is the character they use in here from the previous games 

i wanted something like this to be good because they arent doing great with the franchise the budget they could use on a new atelier title would change things up not in a way where they make people gamble with wishes but in a matter of them making a good gacha game and then earning some on the microtransactions  someday we might see a better atelier game sincewell of course this will give them a lot of money whales exist in any form so they will play this and buy many things but this game is not okay 


sorry about the wall of text and hope this helped in any way 

dont play this play their other titles

#####

i like cute girls and thats enough

#####

this is my first introduction to the atelier series i love the character design and the soundtrack truly stands out however its a gacha game and gacha games icks me out am i going to continue playing this game no while the gacha system may be a dealbreaker for me i am intrigued enough to explore the main game maybe one of these days perhaps a nongacha experience would provide a more satisfying and immersive gameplay environment for someone like me who is new to the atelier series

#####

i cant stop playing this
resna cute and you didnt need to spend any money in this game to clear everything
use the 1 star and 2 star characters you damm meta slaves from other game

#####

this is coming from someone who has been playing gacha games for 10 years and has played the atelier series

play the game i know there are other people yapping about and comparing the game to the previous series  but its also a mobile game and a gacha game so it should not be completely similar the game has a 4 pull rate for ssr and that is 4x better than most gacha games and other games actually have 01 pull for their ssrur i know someone who pulled 4 ssrs in a single 10pull and that says a lot

the reason why people are giving it a thumbs down is because they were trying to compare this to the original you can almost see the comparison in majority of the thumbs down comments here for people who never even tried the series try it if you have played the series try it its completely free why should you tell other people to not play it

play it if you dont like it then its not for you

#####

now this is what i call an overall disappointment atelier gacha titles barely last 2 years if even one year before shutting down and some stupid executives decision to make the next main series title into a gacha game is only going to cause damage to an already niche series for a struggling series thats slowly been improving and seeing some recent growth this title was a monumental waste of resources

#####

another atelier game but this time they removed all the good parts and just added unnecessary gambling

#####

h3as of now you can reroll your account pretty easily if you didnt get your favorite waifu just delete the player data on the login screen buy the ticket bundles from the shop with the gems from the login gift for 10 rollsh3

read it as a sideways thumb its an alright gacha with the atelier feeling but certainly nowhere near the quality of the mainline games its a great sidethingy just login click on a few things and enjoy the story

without a doubt the game has a lot more work put into it compared to koeis other gacha title cough doa cough also it seems less predatory not only compared to that but most gacha games in general what really is koei ill or something that being said its not a cheap game to spend money on so if you decide to spend just be very careful

graphics and audio wise theres nothing to complain about the story itself is the lighthearted cute girls doing cute things type much like the newer games in the franchise

now for the gameplay combat itself is the hey mihoyo can i copy your homework yeah just change it up a bit so it doesnt look obvious type it is truly the honkai star rail we have at home so imagine that with minor changes like everyone can break the toughness bar for example there are synthesis and gathering the former is pretty good but sadly the latter kinda sucks because the maps are kinda limited

as a gacha game its ok you have 6 chance for an ssr3star to appear in a 21 ratio so 4 for a character it has 50 for it to be the rateup character so the ssr rate is good compared to similar games you also wont have to fish for dupes the f2p income is below average or average at best they could buff the rewards for sure buying gems is fking expensive to no ones surprise

overall its an enjoyable sidegame but i sure hope koei wont go down the gacha route like konami did id rather buy their overpriced costume dlcs to be honest 

its free so try it if it caught your fancy but watch your wallet very closely

#####

pretty mediocre at best the fact that there is a gacha system on a single player game is janky do not recommend fan of the atelier series but this is a money grab atelier online was much better at least they had online play and a sense of community

#####

this is a typical mobile game that plays itself as you are in a casino slot machine as long you put enough money in it

sad since the presentation is nice but i like to play games with a challenge
before you know it you keep following the dopamine rush of all the rewards achievements and level ups you get

#####

this game has the potential to be good im sure it might even get there eventually 
to preface i was expecting an open world turn based combat game its not open world but im not entirely disappointed by that as i didnt dig too much into what this game would be like or what the prior games in this series were like i was really dragged in by the art style of the game and it being free to play 

here are my personal pros and cons as someone who has not played the prior atelier games
pros
 diverse character types
 semiinteresting story
 cool character design
 lots of rewards early game
 can easily skip dialogue
 relatively easy to understand turn based combat system

cons
 theres a level cap early game
 the game is very grindy
 character scaling is different and some seem to scale poorly
 eventually the story feels boring and repetitive
 the chapters have 60 parts each example ch 11 through 171
 when the free rewards begin to slow down dramatically i might add progress almost completely stops
 there are no sr or ssr guarantees like you might see in other popular gachas
 in game currency to wish or roll is rather expensive and after the first reward flow its hard to come by
 2 out of 3 banners are paid currency only this may change

would i recommend it for people who can afford it yes for someone new to gacha games no for someone who has time to kill yes i unfortunately do not have time to add another game to my roster

#####

idk man i know it is a gacha game but damn the game way too boring to play compared by many other gacha games i played for me at least

#####

game runs poorly despite being well over the recommended specs around 20fps in hub area game freezing on wish screen etc

avoid this game and go play a decent gacha like genshin or honkai at least those games run well and arent just splash screen after splash screen this feels more like a menu simulator than a game

#####

wheres the gameplay i had heard that gacha fans have really low standards but i didnt know it was this bad

#####

actually plays on cellphone as well which is not nearly as good looking but seamless switching between them so when i go outside or something i can fool around on that i have most of my hours on the phone because while it does look extremely good and your favorite alchemists will look amazing in high resolution with max everything on pc 
i often have other things i wanna do while im at my pc 
not going to forget the clear twirls of colors in resleris eyes when you boot the game on pc for the first time well second time because for some reason the settings are not maxed out by default despite running super well 


aaaaanyway now obviously 
if you have gambling problems dont play this unless youre 100 sure you can manage  the gacha stories 
weve heard right

however if youe not a hater or a gambling addict and you like gacha games this one is cool 
if you like atelier games then you have many good reasons to play
 there are very few atelier games that are not in the game already looking at you iris but i assume theres always time to add them over time as long as the game is being updated theres iris art in the form of cards but no character yet i believe which is weird because theres even mana khemia characters that are playable but anyway 

main points are
 story is great so far simple as usual kinda feels like nelke a little bit with the many alchemists from different worlds all stuck in an unknown world away from theirs whether you do get one that you like or not youll get to see them plenty in the story 
 if you play on pc and you have a good monitor it truely looks amazing at least after maxing out the settings lol 
 gameplay is easy to learn hard to master and you can do everything even if you dont use the free currency and play completely free to play nothing is not achievable with free characters some of those include quite popular alchemists too so you wont feel like you really need to pay anything to get to play with cool characters 
 music is great as usual
 quite a lot of content for the games age just beating the story takes quite a while especially if you watch cutscenes 
 rorona is back just this by itself should be reason enough anyway you can play as the arland trio again 

so yeah overall pretty good id say 
im just so used to people hating on everything especially gacha free to play games that i just cant be bothered to listen to negative comments its like people focus on them or something so much so that they forget about all the good that this free game is offering like worst case you can just do the story if thats all you wanna do and quit once youre done not like youre tied here 
there is one complaint that i dont mind hearing over and over again
the lack of english voiceovers  dubs in the past few ateliers like the one thing you should be complaining for is this 
voice actors have always been really good and they deserve to get called back no idea where they got the info that people dont care about english everyone i asked mentioned this so either im very lucky to have found the only people who care either theyre lying about the reasons why they no longer include those maybe one day we can get them back 

so yeah to finish of course its not a regular atelier experience but all the character art is amazing the story is cool voices and personalities are accurate and all 
and through the environments and the music the puni fights the barrel comments and general atelier vibe it feels like a proper extension of all the atelier worlds imo it doesnt feel bad or like theyre not respecting the franchise or anything 

personally im very happy about the game and enjoying my stay with a party of my favorite trio of alchemists 

#####

story is not that interesting need to remember that this is a gacha game so theres possibility that the game will eos before they finish the story which is sucks character development system is pretty shallow the synthesize system is pretty bad especially the need to have specific characters if you want to have a certain traits which you need to roll gacha rate is trash they put memoria and character together in single banner no guaranteed sr for every 10 pull imagine you can get r rarity characters or memoria in 10 pulls with your hard earned lodestar lol lodestar is super scarce you can buy but its pretty expensive and also they differentiate between paid and free lodestar me personally regret buying the 2x lodestar package

the only good things about this game is the artstyle and how almost every dialogue are voiced

this game is your typical cash grab japanese gacha game with a sprinkle of fan service and everything can be auto atelier online already eos and that game got pretty good reception from atelier fans where this game is not and so i hope this game can last to the point where at least the main story is finish 

if you want to experience true atelier games go play the main atelier series especially dusk trilogy which are more worth your time and money or nelke if you want to see atelier characters gather in a same game instead of this trash cash grab shame on kt for ruining atelier series

#####

i like gacha games and i like atelier the game is so sweet itll give you cavities definitely has that wholesomeness that the atelier games are know for down to a t 

as a fan of the atelier games its great to see all the beloved characters again in one game and resna the new protagonist is super cute i loved her almost instantly 

the game looks very polished with beautiful artwork and animations they really didnt skimp on them i love how characters gives each other high fives and such too during combat and like holy cow even the animations for doing alchemy are really elaborate and a sight for sore eyes i am sure eventually ill tire of it a bit but theres always the option to skip the animations 

in terms of animations i especially love how well their faces are animated all the expression they make especially resna are delightful in many anime games the characters suffer from what i call deadeye syndrome but in this game their eyes are all really expressive too its gorgeous

we all know thighza is a thing and the direction atelier seems to have been going but so far this game is just cute and not oversexualized i hope it stays that way theres enough big tiddy anime waifu gachas out there 

in terms of gameplay the game is pretty much your standard turn based rpg gacha game you dont run around a world to gather mats for synthesis but simply do battles for drops gear and usables are obtained through alchemy 

the game has good quality of life features such as autobattle 3x speed up combat and the option to skip battles entirely after having cleared said battle once 

the music is also gorgeous classic feel good chill atelier vibes

that said this is a gacha game so make sure to spend responsibly

#####

pretty much just a mobile style gatcha cashgrab game the kind that shouts give us all your money in exchange for basically worthless in game currency to maybe get what charakters you want or need
has a stamina system so the gameplay loop ends up as go in spend your stamina on quickfights hope that the low droprate mats you need to upgrade the 5 charakters you use drop and get enought xp etc to actually progress
the game encurages to use a wide variety of charakters by using elemental resistanceweakness system as well as a charakter based alchemy system this is not really an option because youd need to waste money on draws to even get enough high star or to star up charakters even if you had more youd need to use lots of stamina to raise said characters even if you ignore the rare drops you need for their upgrades
not something id reccomend due to cashgrab mechanics

#####

pros
camera work in this game is brilliant its always exactly where i want it to be and yes im a pervert

cons
gacha is gambling any gatcha should be rated 18 including this one

#####

if you just enjoy a story of care and hardship you will like this game no you dont really need to know all the other atelier stories to enjoy this no you dont need to study a lot of things just to get through the game

its a fun story and the crafting is simple much more simple than the actual crafting in most atelier games i would have to say the ogs would understand what i mean 

just sit back relax and enjoy i feel if its not for you thats okay also

#####

sadly even if enjoy playing this type of game i cant with this  big4 paywall i found cant even get a trash 3strar ch

#####

boring and stingy the two worst things a gacha game can be

#####

i absolutely adore this iteration of atelier resna is absolutely adorable and i just love her as well as her bonds with the other characters i appreciate where its doing just four chapters into its story already its villains actually feel like villains and its a little darker than other atelier stories its a little too soon to say if it will be a good story but i do enjoy its pace combat nods to the core titles and seeing all my faves in one place its cute lighthearted and a lot of grindy fun 

this is a super tight controlled experience that it think is much better for longtime fans like myself ive played 24 of the titles now than newcomers as it feels a lot more like an anniversary title like nelkie than a core title i can see the overwhelm of characters being a barrier for newcomers but its a pretty simplistic series of systems with lots of nuance that still feels really good ive had a ton of fun with it and am excited to see what this installment does for the future of the series 

i do think pulls are too expensive to be really worth it but i have found that it does reward f2p fairly well ive had a lot of fun with the events and those generous rewards to keep playing quite literally everyday 

it runs absolutely beautifully on the steam deck for the record i dont think it was really meant to but its a dream and really comfortable with touch and simple controls on the touchpad and triggers

#####

a massive pay2play cash grab terrible gatcha with weak results that left me feeling ripped off after every pull paid or free mattered not story was fine but the gameplay was terrible

#####

im very disappointed in this game theres two things about this game an atelier game and a gacha game both of these part seems to be done badly

while my only experience with the atelier series is atelier ryza and my experience with gacha game is soso i feel like this game was made to wallet drain loyal fan of the series and thats pretty sad

my major disappointment is in the fact that this game is just a menu game everything is done through the various menus and you never ever really have full control to wander off in the world theres no world like in your average atelier game you just experience everything through menu and silent cutscene most are comparable to an average visual novel with some voiced cutscenes out there

the gacha part is par on course like the average gacha game except i feel this game gives you less pull in general leveling your character and increasing the various features of your character to make them powerful feels convoluted since you gotta constantly swap between different menu and youd do that for every character you want to power up

the experience of going through the different menu feels iffy theres too much time between the moment you click to the moment you are taken to the menu you want and theres a constant back and forth it feels quite simply tiring

i played this game for almost 3 hours about 50 minutes was to download the game since you actually download sort of the launch screen through steam and actually download the game after you launched the game 3 hours of this game and i feel exhausted

all these beautiful character model just to make a below par game shame

#####

the game is really good you should try it at least until you hit the boring part for me its resetting character style

great game its just like an idle game but story rich
the great part is the story progresses with 3d animation scene so its just like watching an anime
the animation is really good whether the story or the battle

sadly we play atelier because we love crafting items
but the crafting where the equipment will get 2 traits after being crafted is a randomized chance and that chance is not pure chance just like if you get the greater grade of the crafted equipment the traits it gets will almost be always just the normal traits after 100 crafts only 1 equipment that has a half of the traits 1 of 2 that is good enough not perfect because its not suitable for that equipment
this is because i havent fully upgraded the stars of the characters those were used to add traits to the equipments traits i guess youll need hundreds dollars to max it you know the gacha to get same character over and over until all of the characters stars are full filled
a character can only give 1 or 2 traits to some certain equipment so you will need other character with the same trait for some other equipment and other character again for the next equipment and so on depending on the color matching between the equipment needs with what the characters own color

you will really need the good traits because its really hard to get your character stronger in the battle to advance the story and quests so when you get stuck you need to craft new equipment
but you can only get energy to craft 1 item in some hours you can get more energy from doing daily quest or leveling up your profile
so everything that you wanna do will need energies
there are 2 different kind of energies such as battle needs stamina crafting needs synthesizewhat the game call an energy for crafting that you can get only 1 for each 4 hours so you gotta do quests to get more

after playing for 1 event around 2 weeks im too tired to continue the game
well im just playing the game for free i wont get those beautiful things but ive had fun with the game
making more than 100 same items even though i cant get what i wanted but its quite good to have played the game and seeing beautiful resleriana
so i waited for the new event and doing all the gacha with all the free coins and its time to get some rest since i didnt get the main event character now and im bored with other characters that ive been playing with for 2 weeks thoroughly
its meruru damsel event now so thats a pretty good reason to continue if you get one


the reason why im feeling enough with the game

the problem with these characters are there can be more than 1 type of a characterex wind elementthen the other one is ice element the characters are just the same in example meruru so wind meruru is different from ice meruru you gotta level it up and star it up each but when you wanna bring them to the battle only one meruru can be brought to the battle

so its like resetting a character not getting a new character actually its really hard for me since leveling up needs energylimited so even if i can get the new great characterice meruru that is just having new cloth but actually its a character that i have had beforewind meruru i still need to level it up again to use it
but when i use itice merurui can not use my other character that i have leveled up to max level beforewind meruru

so basically getting a new characterice meruru means losing other maximized level older characterwind meruru it feels like resetting my character

i like the cloth of that character but i cant use the cloth because its a different element even though im playing with the same character

the most down part is i cant use resleriana original clothfire because the bolt element resleriana is much more powerful
almost 2 weeks have passed then the new event brings the new meruru so there will be more character reset i guess im too tired for this style because im not playing the game which will keep resetting the character ive leveled up

i have no complaint about the gacha since i just used the free ones but i still get many 3 characters
thank you for the game

#####

fun from what ive played might play more later for the story but for now quitting because gachas are dangerous for my wallet

i really like the atelier series and thats why i gave this game a chance despite my low expectations i was really disappointed this game has nothing to offer beside its pretty graphics the gameplay is really boring because there isnt any real exploration and the battles are really boring as well the story is okay and the characters are really likeable but im not willed to waste my time with nothinggameplay to experience this story this game is absolutely not worth your time

#####

its a gacha game most of the negative reviews are just people telling you its a gacha as far as character designs visuals and combat go the game is fun if you dont like gacha youre not gonna like it

edit definitely positive for a gacha lots of nice quality of life features and daily freebies so being f2p honestly feels decent

#####

having a separate paidonly banner is what killed it for me i dont mind that its a gacha but this is just a next level of predatory that said given how koei tecmo sells dlcs and addons for this series it should not have been that big of a surprise that they will try to leech what they can from the whales

unless you have cash to spend and you are okay with such practices just avoid it and play any of the other games in the series all of them are better and more fleshedout than this crap kt is peddling

#####

h3if you are expecting a mainline atelier series title you will be disappointed h3
this game is essentially a mobile gacha game with atelier characters and a story worthy of the series but its gameplay has little in common with other atelier games or has been simplified to fit the target audience 
inearly all complaints for this game can be traced back to it being first and foremost a mobile gamei

if you are looking for a proper atelier experience i recommend sticking to paid mainline entries of the series instead of a free to play mobile game
despite this its not actually as bad as some peeps in the steam review section make it seem

bon the topic of gacha b
you dont need any ssrs to progress the story and there is no pvp or any other form of competitve game mode either so when people use the term pay to win they really dont know what they are talking about even dupes are of little value because you can farm every characters awakening material via a daily quest 
the main draw of the gacha part is collecting characters if you have a favourite character you can very easily reroll for them when you start the game or save resources either pull currency or pity medals for when their banner eventually comes around
if you want all the waifus then thats on you the game is free and moneys gotta come from somewhere

bon the topic of synthesisb
people seem to forget that older atelier games had even simpler synthesis mechanics than this game does
a recipe determines which colors can be used in the synthesis first step and you have control over which two characters and what item you add to the synthesis to affect the traits that come out in order for it to work you need to chain the characters and items colors to me that seems a lot more complicated than just adding items with guaranteed traits

personally i am enjoying it a lot as a casual secondarymonitor story and team management game 
the only real complaint that i have is that there are no lowspender options as seen in other mobile titles
that said i do hope they continue making proper mainline atelier games because we dont need more than one of this kind of game

#####

an another ryza game masquarading as a new series if youre advertising this game with the following quote
an epic adventure with a new protagonist the first one in four years since the release of atelier ryza embark on this adventure to revive alchemy with a cast of charming characters
then make it so the main character is actually the new alchemist without ryza appearing in every goddamn scene

if youre putting in the other alchemists and characters from most previous games then make them appear in the goddamn story that 12 lines they can say before ryza robs them from their screentime just not going to cut it all the more so cause there are no character stories like in other gacha games only the main story

gameplaywise the game is probably what you would expect but it feels most of the mechanics are just there cause other games use them the most horrible thing in this game is navigating between menus there are so many useless screens you have to go through and between each of them theres a transition animation for example when youre selecting a quest why the hell do you need to go through the team selection screen when a miniatured version could be put straight on the quest select screen you know like in other games this horrible ui is what burned me out rather quickly

ps send ryza to a whorehouse where she belongs or if you want to make porn this much then make an actual porn game instead of this halfassed pandering

#####

though its cute and i like the ability to get most every previous alchemist in the series its painfully obvious that this is just a super basic gacha game with copious boob physics that has the atelier series label lazily slapped on i mean you rarely even do alchemy in the game which is what the series is built on

#####

gacha trash

has nothing to do with the other mainline atelier games  gathering combat and alchemy are all underwhelming one click affairs 

shame on gust

#####

as an atelier fan this game is really disappointing the characters look really good but this is such an soulless gacha the gameplay is so generic and theres no exploration if they made a real game with those 3d models the game would be nice but as it is its just a bad game

#####

ryzas ass 

#####

if you dont like gacha games clearly this game will not persuade you otherwise 

if you do or dont mind them its a pretty and charming little gacha lots of cute anime chicks very well animated and full of life and there seems to be a story  ive played so many jrpgs i just dont care about story anymore myself  if youre into that kinda thing the rest of the game is typical gacha fare energy limitations daily grinds hoping for good pulls etc 

enjoyable so far id say its a step above your typical gacha game its very well made with lots of polish

#####

its beautifully made with a lot of love regarding the atelier series that much is very easy to see this level of visual and detail love in a manseries game would be absolutely fantastic

however thats not what you get with resleriana and that shouldnt surprise anyone paying even a little attention this is a gacha game through and through and it is not afraid to doubledown on all the prompts for you to spend more on that chance to get the atelier main character you love im not spending hundreds of dollars trying to get marie or ryza when i can just play those games once more

memories are excellent illustrations and id gladly buy an artbook with those images rather than spend my money on a slots machine for a small or big bonus to one character

play a little check the loving animation made for resna and the other alchemists but dont go too deep in there since you will only find a treadmill powered by your wallet in a couple hours from what i could gather with players that have played the mobile version more extensively you will have seen everything this game has in terms of gameplay and even story

a shame really back to waiting for the next real game in the series

#####

i have 5 hours in the game so far and have not played the actual game would reccomend

#####

nice booob physics 1010 wort it to play

#####

i would recommend against this game just for the gacha alone

its an awful system designed to be intentionally frustrating and forcing you to spend if you want any good heroes from the banner barring good luck not only are the rates abysmal the game decides that it will lock you out of the better banners behind a literal paywall where you need to pay actual money to access these banners and cant use the free premium currency you get from playing the game not that it actually matters since you get such a pitiful amount barring the initial frontloading of resources you get from starting the game for the first time

#####

no milk no life

#####

as a gacha game passable at best
as an atelier game absolutely inferior
as a game lowest effort cash grab cashing out on fans nostalgia for their favorites

#####

ive only had resna for a day but if anything happened to her i would kill everyone in the room and then myself

#####

too much cutscenes

#####

its a mobile gacha except its on steam and with an atelier series coat of paint story so far at 120 is alright and serves as nothing more than a vessel to tell you that all your favorite alchemists are here and can be gotten via gambling but it doesnt rely too heavily on the fanservice of past characters in fact theyre all supporting or secondary characters as the main alchemist does her things what are those things normal atelierjrpg things do odd jobs set up your own shop do alchemy and save the world from some kind of disaster i have yet to reach part 2 and it tells you about part 4 with the intro dialogue and cut scenes that being said all mechanics have been heavily simplified to fit the mobile game play style 

my only complaint is the wish animation is way too long and doesnt have a variation or way to tell you if you got a 3 starbanner character like many other gachas for example blue archive give you a pink envelopesparkles to tell you about the 3 star genshin makes the starcomet that falls bright yellow and star rail makes the screen warp heavily and gives the ticket that is floating away a nice redblue effect before the very golden door blows pompom away hell even azur lane tells you what you got with the time limit before a ship is done building which happens before any animation is even played 

overall a decent game so far and again its on steam so you can do other things on your phone without having the game pause itself or disconnect other games really should do this

#####

i played this for about a week and a half on jp launch 

theres not really much in the mainline atelier series present here its marketed as a mainline entry mobage novelty but its a simple excuse for them to take longer than a year to develop the title succeeding ryza 3 im very happy about that what im not pleased about is this runofthemill gacha treatment of the series

for reference there have been atelier quest board and atelier online in the past its sort of just the names and themes put on show without substance if youve played a turnbased gacha rpg youre probably not missing anything here

field gathering and synthesis arent fleshed out whatsoever the characters across series in one place angle was very bad in nelke and doubly so here its a kind of midvisibility gacha to reroll in then forget about afterwards ive been told its not fair to judge mobile games on the basis of regular games but i do think thats kind of hogwash theres nothing here but maybe youll have fun rerolling its just filling the war chest for upcoming proper atelier titles 

i definitely mirror some other reviews in emphasizing that you should give the actual series a try nothing here is indicative of the scope of crafting field gathering and elaborate bossnuking the jrpgs have to offer gacha games blow there are lots of great titles out there that arent hounding you for easy money at every turn just to eos after a year

#####

the best example of modern day gaming cut scenes of dialogue yapping with occasional battling that is automatic turn based snooze and unskippable this is the gameplay paired with a cash shop for the gambling mechanic to obtain new characters 2024 videogame slop

#####

its a cute game but the gacha system is shit more than half of the banners require real money currency

#####

pretty meh as a gacha game progression is slow and frustrating and enemies are huge hp sponges crafting system is interesting for a gacha game but only 1 of an atelier game do not recommend

#####

as a gacha games its not bad lets face it game companies need to make money too

as an atelier game its pretty bad this game could be so so so much more the fact that this game is a menu based game is really just a shame this means no exploration at all

im still going to play and recommend it simply because i like to see cute waifus do cute things great character design great voiceover great graphics great animation and its free just dont expect it to be an atelier game

#####

h2i hope one of your favorite series turns into a soulless gacha with a shutdown looming 7 months awayh2 is a sentence i wouldnt say to even my worst enemy but it just keeps happening to me for some reason

while it is fun to look at different atelier characters from different games interact with each other with decent va choices and good ignoring anything with physics since they freak out every minute models its not enough to ignore the inherent negatives that all gachas have those being stamina limits just so the game cannot be actually finished greedy monetization on everything relying on lonely single 30 yo asian businessmen falling for them constant grinding for minimal gain bad core battle system that gets a bandaid solution in the form of auto and 3x speed toggles just remove battling if youre gonna make it so insignificant anyways and of course the inevitable death in 7 months because this is a gacha of a niche series 
people who splurted to ryza did not explore the series any further they do not count or are of any worth 
edit and lets not forget the koeigust tries to count this as a bmainlineb atelier entry what a disgrace

uthe biggest value of this game is getting the artwork and music ripped from it since they seem to be really high qualityu

#####

oh yis my favorite addictiongacha time

#####

nope

i dont expect kt to support this game for a long time so i figured id at least give it a look for a few hours so i can say i experienced it before it goes eos that said i feel like ive seen enough of it now to know that even if i didnt resent this game for bringing more gacha game poison unto this wonderful franchise i would eventually come to find it a boring disappointment of a game

ive actually played quite a few gacha games and while i wont claim i have no prejudice against them im perfectly capable of admitting a good one is good when i find it enjoyable to play but atelier resleriana is not good its gameplay hooks start getting stale almost immediately its story is creatively vacant and disengaged even by atelier standards its gacha system and currency distribution are obviously stingy its progression systems pressure you to get more characters from the gacha and overall it just doesnt have enough going on that the notion of playing this game every day or even once a week seems like it will end in anything but my own frustration resentment and boredom its a dud of a gacha game and an embarrassing addition to the atelier bloodline

#####

beautiful but outdated in addition it is being treated by the company as if it were a main installment pretty disastrous this is what they announced on the 25th anniversary there are plenty atelier games in steam all of them are good even nelke this is not one of those its just a gacha mobile game and i dont think we deserve this

#####

pretty good
very nice slice of life story
3star base rate is 4 which isnt as bad as other gatcha games

#####

i wanted to like it i usually enjoy gatchas but this is one of the worst in terms of free content so few draws too frustrating and slow

#####

pros u can rerolls till u get more than one ssr

#####

do you like anime girls fighting with super legendary monsters such as slime and other creatures  thats good  you have a good jrpg system epic fights and a good story in this game  what more could you want

 additionally you have two girls one who believes in alchemy again after the fall of alchemy  resna is heading to the capital for this purpose  the second one lost her memory  what can you do when memory happens  hmm  maybe try to remember something  well no  because our valeria works hard for her beloved city but lets hope they will help her with her memory

#####

this is a very reluctant recommendation but after spending some time mostly on mobile with this game i cant say its without its merits however i will say two things right off the bat firstly i dont care what kt says this is not a mainline game its a spinoff through and through and many of my issues with this game come from what calling it a mainline atelier game possibly represents for the future of the series secondly this game is not f2p friendly at all you do get discounted pulls on some banners and currently you get a free pull daily but even with that these pulls do not give you any mileage towards pity and the premium currency is given out very sparsely even moreso in the steam version where you dont even have the option to watch ads daily to earn a little more on top of this dupes are important not essential but still very important

so why do i still recommend this well as a spinoff yes im being insanely petty it actually makes for a fun little atelier akin game the turnbased combat is fun and requires a little more thought when going up against harder bosses but my main reason for the recommendation is that the story is actually kinda fun is it my favorite no but for a free mobile game i found myself enjoying reading through it every now and then there are other mobile games that i think have better stories some of which are even available right here on steam shout out to limbus company and honkai impact 3rd but still its good enough to keep me engaged im no stranger to downloading a mobile game playing to for a few hours going ok this sucks and just deleting it and never touching it again and despite my gripes with resleriana it hasnt been one of those games for me

#####

this game has

 an hour long tutorial with absolutely zero way to adjust game settings or even to go into fullscreen because the game treats you like an idiot that must have their hand held even by aaa gaming standards strike 1 for not respecting my time and patience theres a special place in hell for games that do this

 gacha rates so bad that id rather be playing a mihoyo game strike 2 for not actually having an enticing system for whales who want to support the game

 a bugged out main menu that will show 3d rendering at a far lower resolution than you have set in the game settings alongside a completely arbitrarily implemented 60fps cap when its using an engine that can handle unlocked just fine from a group of developers that never had this issue before gust and adding insult to injury unlocking it with external tools for unity games results in the game working just fine that team ninja programming is really showing in this department considering how much the pc version sucks and thats a constant from their games wild heart and wo long were some of the worst ports last year and the nioh  ninja gaiden games dont fare much better pair that with a lot of stutter and thats strike 3 for somehow having a worse port than gusts mainline games despite this one using unity

 writing thats already laughable for atelier standards at best and soulless crossover metaverse fanfiction at worse strike 4 for hackjob writing im aware its already past strike 3 but lets see how far this goes

 censored game content much like the blue reflection gacha game on ios at least because mel kishida at least has some standards and isnt a complete cuck to platform holders to let the other versions be altered a high impact sexual violence strike 5 for not respecting your core fans despite basically profiting off yuritards and safe horny weebs on twitter thirsting over reistalins thighs for many years but this is to be expected for a company with a square enixesque ethics department cornyass type gender options in their new game character creators and that chases after esg scores nowadays

 can we also talk about how koei tecmo has three different gacha games and the only one thats actually making any money is the dead or alive gacha game one that is technically available in english but for some reason is region locked on steam unless you managed to download it before the region lock occurred like i did makes sense that only the doa one is successful considering thats the only food doa fans are getting after dealing with karengamejourno slanderdefamation for a decade much like senran kagura nowadays strike 6 for having too many cooks in the gacha oven

cant recommend the game in its current state go play the blue reflection gacha game if you want something from gust that hasnt been flanderized and cucked by lolcowlizers like what happened with atelier and like a dragon or just go play blue archive if you want a gacha game that isnt developed by greedy cucks and actually respects you and your time

#####

hammer

#####

this game got released in 2024 and looks feels and plays like a 2010 game atelier games are aa games at best so its understandable that theyre not pushing for graphics and most people who are into them definitely dont expect great visuals and industry breaking game play 
this game to be playable needs a lot of qol improvements and it looks like they have absolutely no idea what is on the market in terms of gacha games
i dont expect them to fix everything and i think this game will die in 2y max

what i feel about the game
pros
 characters are cute
 team building is great
 pity rate is reasonable
 autofarm is easy just click one button and youre done
cons
 loading screen is horrendous
 combat has only one playstyle outspeed the enemy or get lucky with your skillupburst tiles
 light core drops are random light cores are used to upgrade your characters
 endgame synthesis are frustrating getting good rolls on your synthesis is completely random even if you have high chance to get good rolls
 certain endgame skills are locked behind gacha you cannot synthesis those skills if you do not have those characters

ps im leaving this as a bad review because the cons outweigh the pros

#####

way too grindy and they are very stingy with the gems

#####

its like an fgo 20  visual novel with turn based rpg combat and without open world 
insanely high production quality almost everything is voiced animations are incredible ost is very nice very cosy dont have any complaints besides absence of some sort of monthly pass like welkin moon from the shop its not a f2plow spender friendly decision
long term success of this game depends on quality of storyline going forward foundation is 1010  out of all gacha games ive seen this is the only one that looks and feels like a full price single player game even more so than genshit and hsr 
also this game was developed by actual developers of the atelier series not by some chinese outsource company which is a plus for me

　atelier resleriana is a gacha anime mobile game with numerous cutscenes and a turnbased battle system allowing up to 5 characters in your party though the turnbased system isnt particularly deep its a straightforward game where equipment plays a significant role in utilizing your character stats well i dont care much about those aspects because ive been a turnbased player for much longer than those who pay 60 for standalone atelier games who never interacting with females and stay playing game

　if youve never played mobile games it involves having different characters on your account with varying rarities you use and level them up usually i look for the time when they introduce the gambling aspect since some fans distinguish between gacha and gambling considering them different because theyre well idiots this game literally has the longest prologue until they finally throw you into the gacha menu but i have no complaints although im not sure why they dont have a friend list system like many gacha games forcing people to share weird invite codes and making the forum a spaminfested mess oh i need to mention the music was the best i remove music review section since imnot an music expert but oh well overall the community forum sucks

please dont be like what happened to princess connect en i love this game now

#####

worse customer service ever

#####

if it wasnt a gacha i would 100 pay full price but it would need to be a less suggestive idk about you guys but ever since ryza theyve been making these games waaaaayyyyyy too horn doggy b make it to where you earn the characters like in literally every other atelier game 

why i wouldnt recommend
i dont like how there arent specific weapons for the characters you could mass produce a single weapon for the whole team 
kinda funny they put the stamina bar at the top knowing someone somewhere because people whale gatchas and they know it would spend hours upon hours ingame 
if this is your first atelier game i promise you waiting for a sale would be a better option get sophie firis or escha  logy they are great a lot better than a game that almost forces you to buy ingame currency just to progress at some point 
ive only played for 4 hours but as soon as i loaded it up i didnt feel it was a pc game it felt like a phone game
there is no controller support
you dont get to openworld explore like you do in the other games you are confined to quests and extremely repetitivepredictable fights the dungeons have zero freedom and you cant choose your fights to either collect resources or exp 
the recipes are progression locked so if you cant get passed a chapter interval you wont unlock a recipe in the other games you simply fulfill resource requirements and or interactive character quests
the crafting is lazy to put it nicely there is no strategy and the special effects of an item depend on the characters you line up if you want better quality or different effects youd probably end up spending money to get them
you dont have interactive quests with character or a friendship level

overall it feels like a lazy attempt at a money grab and lowers the bar for the games made in the future the only pro i could think of is that its visually appealing during the fight animations i dont care for the panning shots of ryzas crotch within the first 5 minutes of the prologue or the jiggle physics that dont even reset correctly if this series is really moving towards this direction i just wont buy any more gustxkoei tecmo games not worth the brain rot

#####

plays like any other mobile gacha game which is to say its a casino full of blinking red notifications and bare minimum content wrapped up in cute anime girls intent on robbing you imagine if we got an actual game for a25

#####

an abomination skinned as an atelier game containing all the problems of the mobile market this is what you get when you remove open world exploration gut the crafting element simplify item collection and water down the core combat system into a cash grab gacha game i love the atelier games been playing them for over a decade but this game is honestly insulting everything i love about atelier is devoid here leaving only an atelier skinned gacha system yeah the characters are nice but 20 per pull is insulting when i can buy a full mainline atelier game with more and better content for the same price

#####

this is probably one of the biggest disappointments ive seen from a game i was skeptical when i learned the next atelier game would be a free to play gacha game but kept my hopes up and really wanted this game to be good its not unfortunately gameplay is boring and while the character designs and idea of the game where previous heroines from the earlier games join the new heroine its unfortunately in a game where combat and story is boring i really do love the design of resleriana and veleria especially it just saddens me that they didnt make it a traditional atelier game

if you enjoy the game i am happy for you and i wish i enjoyed it too but i cant bring myself to like the game it feels to me like they are trying to monetize on the recent surge in popularity of the series since the release of the ryza games and wants to milk the series as much as they can

#####

the discourse around this game has been a bit disappointing to see i can understand why hardcore fans of the franchise may be disappointed but i wish to offer an alternative perspective as someone who has never played an atelier game before i enjoy this game i think its presentation is top notch its soundtrack is super catchy and it has some genuinely adorable and endearing character designs i also love the combat im not a big fan of turnbased games these days but the use of a timeline means theres a level of complexity and depth you dont usually get with turnbased games  especially f2p gacha based ones when you add on the crafted items you can bring into a stage it gives me an impression of why people might like this franchise in the first place without overwhelming me with too much complexity all at once its really interesting tackling difficult stages by planning which support items to bring with me as well as manipulating the timeline so my strongest characters can get their burst skill and preventing the enemy from using theirs

the actual story is a bit hard to describe the game is seemingly set up for longtime fans of the franchise as it features so many different characters from so many different games but i find the most compelling characters to be the ones original to this game alone this is mostly because the ones from the other games are not really allowed to grow or change as people and are mostly relegated as supporting roles or side characters id say on launch the story has its high points but it definitely has room to grow im looking forward to the journey of resna and valeria in future updates

as for the monetization i think its more of a mixed bag then a wholly predatory or negative implementation  at least in comparison to its competition the good free daily pull never need dupes spark carries over infinitely and you can recruit any released character with your spark the bad rates are low pull currency income is low and the rate of new characters is pretty quick as with any gacha game if you have to have every character id avoid this game but otherwise i think youll be okay playing as a f2p you might even get lucky and get a ssr on your free daily pull

i wasnt really expecting to play this game for longer then 20 minutes but its somehow managed to really capture my attention and i look forward to seeing where resnas journey will take me ive also really enjoyed some of the characters in my roster maries victory animation for example is really cute and when i saw her game pop up in my suggestions i actually considered picking it up for purchase a game i would have previously skipped without hesitation ultimately games are an investment and it can be hard to dive into a 20 hour experience when theres so much competition out there for your time and money atelier reslerianas small peak into the world of atelier has turned me from a skeptic to a hesitant fan and i look forward to playing on of the fullpriced titles someday but for now bring on the updates im eager for more story chapters

btldrb its free its fun its wellpolished if you dont mind playing a gacha game you might be surprised how fun this game actually is

#####

i think this game would have been much better if it were just a normal single player jrpg instead of a free to play mobile game nontheless it has good quality the characters are great and the graphics good

#####

h3 this is the best game for you if h3
 you can bear with i genshin impact i like b banners mixing both units and equipment b with 5 pull rate for featured 3star units

 you can bear with the complete b lack of keyboardcontroller support b

 you have a remote job andor you dont mind rerolling for like 10 hours in order to have a decent starting team with at least a couple sr units with the abovementioned banner mechanism in mind thank god rerolling takes like 25 minutes

 you prefer navigating on b sluggish menus b or rail tracks over freely exploring actual 3d maps in a mainline atelier game 

 you can bear with prerendered 480p unit presentation videos with recycled animations while rolling on your modern pc

 you never played gacha games like i princess connect redive i or i blue archive i and you dont mind b horrendous pull income b while 10 normal pulls usually cost 3000 lodestar

 you dont mind b rosterbased alchemy b like imagine you have all required materials but the traits combo will be suboptimal cause you dont have units with the right colors combo and with the traits you were looking for again in a mainline atelier game

 you dont mind having only for now maybe b units with one single element type b that only can do 3 moves from that same element type in a mainline 2024 rpg game available on pc

 you think that kt will be finally able to handle an atelier gacha this time i atelier online alchemist of bressisle i lasted 35 years on japan

 you are here mostly for the fanservice andor the other atelier protagonists and im not kidding the main protagonist is currently the only og character available in release week banners while her first partner and childhood friend is not and the very first battle tutorial is with spoiler ryza spoiler and spoiler i rainy season wheat wind i spoiler as the battle theme

 you like atelier music yea its honestly good

#####

its a bad gacha game and an even worse atelier game its just a worse version of honkai star rail in every way less f2p friendly and less accessible in terms of building characters the content is pretty much nonexistent without stamina and the stamina puts you into auto scolling dungeons or just cookie clicker menus to get materials for rng synthesis i bet this game gets scrapped in jp after its first year

#####

as an atelier game this game gives a very bad experience and outlook of the series outside the pace and storytelling every other thing is a bad implementation of the atelier mechanics
one example is the crafting system that is the hear of the atelier series in this game is a rng fest where everythig you need to fight rngesus to get something good in the atelier there is some random but most synthesis you can control the outcome leting you minmax the equipment and items more easily and plan your equipment 

as a gacha game this is also a bad game there is mixed pull making getting a certain character very hard also the game gives very little of the currency to pull making it even worse for free2play
even worse that that is that this is the global version of the game even if you started at launch you will still have an worse experience than japan they decided to launch the game beat by beat of the jp timeline but they are not doing the seasonal events like halloween new year christmas with that global did lose many resources to pull many strong units many recipies of strong equipment
even worse is that they are not accellerating the global server making the possibility to reach jp a cloudy proposition and until then global will be an experience without any seasonal event

if you want to play this game is your choice but i cannot recommend it even less spend money in this game that look it should have never been released

#####

its a mobile gacha game with fan service both of the atelier series and for those who are attracted to women not what i was looking for

#####

stinky but okay

#####

day 1 player 112 hours clocked and more in mobile uninstalled because i never get any good character after the second banner 
this game has very good visual and the cast design is superb especially the girls you can play it for free too like most gacha game but the gacha rate was very bad i was lucky in the first two banner but after that it just became hell aiming for memoria was even harder

game difficulty was good enough not hard but not that easy too 

the freebies they gave was not much also you cant get any pity medal if you decide to bought the discounted ticket gacha saving for pity is really hard here if you are f2p player since the jewel they give was too little i hit the pity once but it feels nothing
anyhow if you are a fans of atelier series you can try this but if you look for meta then this is a bad choice

#####

ooga booga


#####

great cinematics pictures and a story overall
but in general it is the default gacha p2w pay to win or everlasting grind game

#####

usually im very lazy to write a review but this game is so cute just watching them heals my heart yet its very hard unlike the offline counterparts as many can get stuck very early like on ch263 but the game mechanic is fun and in depth  ofc this game is not for auto fight people i have only use auto battle oncehah

also gacha rate is bad but we dont need duplicate character and chip quest gives 9 chips a day which is really generous

#####

decent
in terms of gacha games its one of the good ones free daily pulls good graphics good song free other than that its a generic gacha game with some simplified atelier element sprinkled here and there
in term of atelier games it sucks period still better than atelier online i guess all atelier aspects in this atelier game is below standard i played from rorona to eschalogy at console and this games overall quality is even below those those are great but old i love rorona

if youre here because its free and have good characters youre interested give it a try if you find a character or two you like play their original game
if youre here because its an atelier title run away dont look back or give it a try its fine i played atelier games since i like their stories most of the time

im just happy i can hear roronas voice again after almost a decade cant wait for that mama rorona to appear in the game if it will ever happen

#####

i am really enjoying the game so far i heard that a lot of people are disappointing by it because its an f2p gacha game but its really not that bad the story is interesting it has every element of the atelier series and all the cool characters are in it resna is also sweet and funny and valeria is a great character too i really hope for the game to become successful and for the developers to keep updating it so we can learn more about resna and valerias stories

#####

good story but the most important is

pillow thighs

#####

if you like atelier youll probably like this its an atelier game but very linear and with  gacha elements optimization needs to be worked on since it stutters a lot especially audio wise even on lower settings

edit ive played the game for a bit so heres some additional thoughts one of the kindest gacha games the devs keep giving out free pulls along with the daily free single pull lots of stuff to do like dungeons score attack elemental tower etc and frequent events about one every 9 days to make sure theres always something to enjoy every week main story is fun and apparently will be getting a lot more interesting in later chapters music is amazing really like this gacha game and wish more people  played and enjoyed it too

#####

thank you to the artist team no thank you to the marketing team 

#####

no gameplay just pay to progress or wait miserably the game itself is really bad the animation is great and the voice acting is great but it doesnt help the fact that this game is literally devoid how gameplay

its extremely boring

#####

its the dumbest thing ive ever seen

#####

tried to give it an honest chance but nothing about this game reflects the fun gameplay of the atelier franchise the whole experience is so linear and dependent on the gacha that theres 0 fun to be had in its systems even beyond just judging it as the so called atelier 25 its just not a fun game as youll be exclusively watching cutscenes and doing repetitive combat encounters till you hit the next wall and have to either grind or roll for a better party

#####

nah gacha

#####

nice game  just dont shut down pls

h1atelier resleriana copy paste and the lack of inovation	h1

if there is a word i could describe this game would be basic in a way its not a suprise considering this is from a traditional triplea developer and what we have is the traditional development cycle were they look at the current successeful games and copy paste from it down to its design choices that it just works on that title not the first and not the last game that will do that but more on that

here are the main issues

bthere is no dormb this is shocking considering there is a atelier so we would assume that like many gacha games including doaxvv there is a dorm were you can decorate and make it your own and put characters there for various systems but instead there is nothing likewise there is no interacting with characters at all they simply exist within the game story and thats it

bgem income is pitful and worst the banner is both character and weaponbthis means the pool is poluted by garbage since a r memoria is utterly useless as even if you raise then to v since they will cease to have any other use beyond leveling other memory that you can already do with a item characters on the other hand are more important since even a fail to get new characters you still get pieces to raise the rarity of your own characters the way its set not only you barely get any pulls but get flooded with useless memoria more often then not this is of course by design as even genshin with its economy have the good sense of keeping character and weapon their own banners

bcombat too simple and complicated for its own goodb the problem with combat is roles yes  there are roles in this game but its mockery since there are no healers or debuff removals so if one of you characters get poisoned there is no way to deal with it that is rather oddin a game about alchemy i also cannot help but to compare it with  hokai star rail were its much simpler but roles are better understood combat itself lacks not much depth outside break the enemy and deal as much damage you can there are weakeness but because of the barely existing equipment system and the crapshoot that it is the characters you even have access to there is really no planning you can realistic do at least they understand that and just use about the same enemies over and over also your party seems unsually weak just taking a couple of hits and being knocked out when enemies will take several hits before being deated even if there is a argument about being 6 vs 3 or 4 it feels as you have no real tanks because they all are terrible and by that i of course mean the ones i got

bterrible uib its menus within menus within menus ofen there isnt readible avaible information and the fact this is a mobile title is even worst you cannot tell see all the information about a character in the same screen but have to navigate across to see it

balchemic rngb whatever effects on items you create you get are very much within rng this naturally by design so you go waste time and stamina due to the game story being 3 chapters so far of course there are problems here as well since a lot of enemies deal physical damage so you want to invest in physical defense and then branch out to elemental defenses right wrong it suffers the problem of you need to have the characters to activate the bonus enchatment they offer dont have then then you have worst gear but even then you have to craft again and again until you get better skills on then no experimentation either

this game feels like something that should have come out in 2015 its a symptom of the game industry trying to get into the gacha money train but offering nothing outside dated and shallow experience i would say it would be hard to screw up this formula however it seems this is more of a main line typical atelier game being reworked as a gacha game you have what it seems to be wanting to tell a main story following traditional games formula by adding new characters to the party and with a straiforward leveling experience yet because of the mechanics you dont have any control of the characters even if you managed to get then by gacha there is no exploration at all feeling you are in a strait path since you are and what there is in the game a very stingy single player game that is free to play or rather free to install since the honeymoon period in this game will be rather short reisalin stout and the other atlier characters can only get this game so far and even that they screwed up in implementing 

i played many gacha games and true many are cash grabs i am not thumbing down because its a gacha game but uhowu its a gacha game it seems to a running theme with japanese gacha games to be as stingy as possible that wouldnt be a problem if they had a solid design behind it this one simply doesnt and commits many of gacha worst tendacies in exchange for nothing

not recommended

#####

if it looks interesting just try it its free dont spend any money on it until you know if its something you want to invest some time in

#####

it says its a mainline atelier game mainline games should not be gachas

#####

while i love the atelier series and have played through all the nonmobile titles this aint it  it lacks the charm and the wit of the mainline games and it feels painfully gatcha  theres not much to do besides battles and gatcha mechanics and the story isnt anywhere near as engaging as other games in the series which makes the whole thing fall flat

#####

i saw the reviews in the game heres my take if you love the atelier series play this game
why because you will see characters from other series in this game again rather than
not seeing them forever from their original game which are already over

the story the story is great every chapter has this heartwarming ending
the development of the character plus the qualities of resna is so great that
all i could think is atelier nailed the perfect main character

the gameplay is a turn based system which is actually good yeah atelier series
has always been turn based but with dungeon based maps which if they can apply
in the future would be awesome

the art is so great nothing else i can say next is the physics of the game and i like
them jiggling and you will notice that in some cutscene when a character gets wet
you will notice the clothes get wet which is actually so great

music its just inividual preference and i have loved atelier series music
if i could hear shimotsuki haruka here it would be awesome

the synthesis of materials is actually great others would say that it is gated
by characters my take is that its actually fine that way i mean why hurry to become
strong the game will be there for so long unlike the original series just get the characters and
grind for it 

verdict if this is f2p friendly yeah this is f2p friendly you can farm piece
to upgrade your character so you only need to draw the character once
and upgrade it to max easily but i cant say for sure since the current event
give a little reward will wait and see



#####

this game is so relaxing and beautiful  all girls are beautiful and the boys are so cool

#####

i cant wait to make lent serve cvnt in the synthesis animation

#####

lot of gyatttt

#####

i love everything on this game as a fan of atelier this is the best 3

#####

its awesome

#####

massive pay2win cashgrab even for a gacha game this stuff is insane
the ui is slow it loads way too much with ton of long animations that waste your time
the gameplay is nothing to write home about completely unbalanced and made to extort you of money when you hit a wall and need specific characters to counter things some stuff isnt even properly shown in the game like element resistences of the enemies or their stats to counter properly with thought instead of bruteforce with gacha

canr recommend this game to anyone other than whales deeply into atelier but i guess even then replaying old games might be better

edit one thing i forgot the mobile version same servers no crossplay has ads you gain more stamina to play and more than double the amount of gems by watching those ads stuff you cant do on the steam version essentially cheating you out of more than 50 of free gems on steam or as a nonad player

#####

list
    has a skip tutorial button for the rerollers  no need for weird workarounds just to reroll
    no pullfomo because all banner characters are added to the shop afterwards
    pulls generate permanent pity currency to use on the shop
    no pvp hassle which could influence meta or money spending
    insanely quick story sequence skips if you so require
    the free units are stier
    ability to reset your characters and get all resources back
    you get a free pull every day
    on mobile you can even watch some ads to generate pull currency or stamina cookies
list
this game has a lot of qol improvements designed to help players enjoy the game without feeling too much of the underlying gacha genre this is also an excellent way of getting to know many of the iconic atelier characters for free and this might boost interest in their respective titles 

i consider this gacha to be beginnerfriendly although as of now i am unable to evaluate its end game loop


h3edith3
after 2 weeks of playing i feel like i am qualified enough to assume what the endgame will look like
this gacha game has a hidden difficulty spike for events and highertier content that is designed around abusing type weaknesses  which in turn favors players with a large and competent character roster who have those favorable types covered

pull resource accumulation aka how much lodestones you get is 95 covered by firstclear rewards events and community mail rewards an astonishingly low amount is actually covered by daily and weekly rewards which makes it a must to become dependent on watching ads on your phone for at least 60 pull gems per day aka 20 of a single pull

based on the system of pull resource accumulation it becomes clear that after some while the acquisition of lodestones will drastically slow down which makes it impossible for f2p to plan around banners or even pull at all those accounts will stay with whatever units they have and brave events the harsh and conservative way

the banners are insanely varied and while some are meta it is ultimately desired to court specialized teams around each element which is not possible if you are unable to accumulate pulls it is not an exageration to say that some may play in misery and poverty for 46months to afford guaranteeing a unit they wantneed

lastly it should be mentioned that none of this is of any impact for those who purely play the game for the story with minimal dependence on having certain characters this gacha is not meant to be a character collector not even with the power of lifelong perseverance as it is the case with many other gacha

h3verdicth3
i still recommend this gacha with all the bells and whistles just please be mindful if you do decide to spend money as there is no soft pity aka guaranteed 3 after x amount of pulls so people might realistically pull 100 times without getting anything in return

#####

i didnt get ryza 010

#####

extremely too moe for me but still giving it a shot newcomers to the atelier series should consider the mainline games everything is more in depth

#####

atelier goated

#####

nice game to play casually

#####

very f2p friendly so far so if youre capable of not spending money its pretty fun
graphics very pretty and gameplay is decent

#####

im no genshin player so this is like the peak of me being impressed that this is a mobile game well until the mobily elements happen kinda find it strange a niche franchise like this has a gacha game but hey im playing it enjoying the music and character interactions 
all the longtime fans have their say on the gacha and stuff me im just here for the free ride till i play some actual atelier games i love the vibes of this so god the actual games gotta be this but 10x more

#####

its a basic mobile game the stamina makes you feel rushed on story line then you run out and suddenly you cant touch it at all they made the maps either auto fight or in dungeons linear than fight yet still somehow made it possible to miss the gatherables due to bad camera angles the gatcha at this point isnt to bad simply rerolling gives you a good team since you have so few characters to chose from and earning character shards for the ones you fight with is easy fighting itself is so simplified a toddler could do it  definitely not an atelier game though its got the graphics and character types the storyline what little i caught seems normal for the brand too i may try it on mobile so i can keep up on stamina but am uninstalling on computer and may just rage quit this game altogether please if interested in atelier series try another before you give up

#####

for sure its segsable

#####

very good gacha and a fun story up until now

pulled escha already me happy 

#####

if you know what to expect the game is pretty fun just do not forget that this is a gacha game
the pro is that we get to see a lot of old characters again and the graphics are quite nice
while gameplay is minimal the dungeons are not bad managing the characters and gathering items can be fun and all of the story cutscenes are fully voiced there is a lot

#####

takahiro is my favorite writer and i hope he gets hired again for the next console atelier entry

#####

i think this is an ok gacha game for now cool graphic and stuff but dont play it if its your first experience with atelier just because it is free all the other games in the series are better than this typical slop gacha gameplay loop

#####

crappy mobile gamelike tutorial
click the attack button to attack press it now to see what it does
click the burst button to do a burst attack press it now to see what it does
click the item button to use an item press it now to see what it does

mobile games are made for the lowest of low iq people thats why they need these 20 min tutorial on how to press one of the three buttons on the screen the company obviously doesnt think very highly about the wouldbe players of this game

i gave up becuase of how dumb these tutoral levels are but at least the characters and animations were good looking

#####

the gacha rate is very bad its very difficult to actually get good characters
but its free so why not

#####

the game is first and foremost a visual novel so rating the game purely based on that its good the story is interesting and even with many returning characters its completely unique there are some fights between the story bits but even without interacting with the gacha aspect of the game everyone should be able to get through the story very easily

the actual combat and crafting in this game arent awful either but they dont even come close to what other games in the series have to offer they are just underwhelmingly passable 

the gacha is probably what puts most people off this game though and i say dont let it the gacha is very much optional and if you do interact with it from time to time its actually pretty fair each version offers 20 pulls at half price and characters are fully upgradable slowly through gameplay without having to pull multiple copies of a limited character

overall i give the game a thumbs up just for the story if you are into visual novels then this is something for you

#####

the worst gacha rates ever

#####

the mind boggles that this is supposed to be a mainline game its a crying shame because the story from what ive seen appears to be interesting but its buried under a massive horde of tedium outdated game design and even outdated gacha mechanics

animations and visuals are amazing though the alchemists from past games have never looked more charming and never been more crisply animated also as a mana khemia fan and having never played nelke it was great to see vayne in 3d

i think my biggest criticism of the game is that synthesis is time gated each synthesis requires mana and each mana only replenishes with time or by buying mana from the ingame not cash shop gathering and synthesis are at the heart of the entire series and somehow someway they decided it would be a good idea to time gate this and synthesis has been reduced to matching colors on characters

honestly there is zero reason to play this game if youre an atelier fan just play ryza if youre a gacha fan you can give this one a pass and miss nothing

#####

so this is free atelier game that actually preatty decent but i cant recommend to everyone because theres gacha system wow free game gacha what do you expect and i dont know if you are an atelier fan  or not because some atelier fans are mad about this game

the graphic is stylized atelier series always been like this the gameplay for a free gacha game is good enough for me but the exploration is kinda bad if you are an atelier fan you will understand how bad it is and lastly the gacha tbh i still dont know about this because i play this at the first day of release

for me who just play atelier sophie also sophie 2 and a veteran of f2p gacha player i pretty much kinda enjoy it and will continue play it but again i cant recommend this game yet lets see how generous this game about the gacha

also sophie is the best girl

edit
after playing for a week i can say this atelier game is like average gacha games out there i want to recommend it but atleast must play one of other atelier games i would recommend the mysterious series if you like those games maybe you will like this atelier reslerianas story but i dont expect you will like the farming and gathering mechanic in this game 

and if you are a gacha player maybe you can try it i dont expect much you will like the story but the mechanic of farming in this game is so much like the other gacha game i usualy play

also i they gave me sophie so i more recommend this game now 3

#####

wow this game starts out amazing and give you a grand adventure is about to start resna is also just such a good addition to the series shes is really cheerful and up for anything after all she just wants to be a great alchemist 

the presentation of the game just flows with so much charm between the handling of the cutscenes introduction of characters the alchemy scenes then who can forget about this music the music is off the wall here its so good

while i cannot comment on the gatcha and the longevity as it still early game im loving what im playing right now i hope this stick around as so far the games story is really unique and interesting

#####

this game is good i usually skip music and cutscene but not for this one marvelous music and graphic lovely story line  keep up the good work developersif you ever see my comment

#####

god damn gacha games i wont pay to get random trash characters

#####

its fun slow build but fun 
add more mana khemia characters and lilaserri from ryza

#####

i just downloaded the steam version but  ive been playing it on my phone too ive got about 15 hours or so there

look everyones criticisms about this game are probably right but i like it its pretty the girls are adorable the gameplay is fun to me its hard enough that progression feels like i have to earn it but no so tough that i feel like im paywalled i like the music a lot and its really nice to see a story where everyone is just positive and supportive of each other normally i just skip stories but its fun to go on minor adventures where mostly everyone is nice good gamefeel

#####

how are you gonna make an atelier game then not have it be a large world with open field gathering its not a bad game its just not the one i wanted its about as enjoyable as any other gacha game and theres a lot of polish

i just somehow feel like i was misled that might be 100 my fault for not researching but still

#####

the worst gacha rates that ive ever encounter i will go back to my other games thank god those games were generous unlike these bu##s#it

#####

beside the gameplay is fun the story are little bit slow

#####

menus for everything do this load do that load loading screen everytime you want to do something

#####

playing this just makes me want to play the main games its not that bad by any means but i am just tired of gacha games so just go play atelier ryza 



#####

lila when

#####

i love the series however this takes the best parts of the series and completely restricts them play any other atelier game but this

#####

this gotcha not gacha lol game is beautiful and stingy  best not to play unless you do not mind progression stopped due to game limits and gacha rates  hard pass  do not let this gacha gotcha

#####

as an atelier fan im disappointed but not surprised i played through the prologue but im not interested in playing any further the story is shallow love resna though she deserved better the gacha is extremely expensive and not f2p friendly and theres no exploration alchemy is heavily tied to the gacha system

i like gacha games i like atelier i gave it a chance its clear this is a quick cash grab if youre not an atelier fan maybe itll be fun to you but to those who know what this game couldve been its a skip

#####

a nice gacha game with cute visuals and bgm its a nice change of pace from the usual gacha games ive played
however its somewhat grindy and abit difficult to get lodestar gems
clearing story mode doesnt give any gems so well have to rely one onetime clears or daily quest and other freebies but either way its easy to run out of gem resources very quickly

id suggest more ways to get gems or increase the rewards or hopefully create a daily gem pass

tldr grindy gacha game but has cute visuals and nostalgic atelier girls

#####

it makes me feel happy 

edit it seems you can watch in the mobile version some ads for the wishing currency it doesnt exist in steam though still this game makes me feel happy 

#####

the game is genuinely enjoyable and you can make significant progress without spending money ive been playing the japanese version since day one and i havent experienced boredom

#####

trash

#####

i downloaded this game as an atelier fan and while i understand the frustrations a lot of people whom reviewed this game have as atelier fans i want to give my honest thoughts on this game

you can usually tell pretty quickly when a gacha game focuses on the gacha and just tacks on the game part but thats not the case here when i play this game i feel like the focus has gone into the actual game play elements and the gacha is just there

you can go into this game and ignore the gacha part and progress perfectly fine yes it will be slightly more difficult but the overall balance for characters in this game is very good


 the positive game play elements 

this game features a wide array of characters from the atelier series and 2 unique ones exclusive to this game and the voice acting from all of them is amazing 

the visuals story and character animations are all also top notch there are moments where ill be in certain dungeons and forget that im playing a mobile game

the autoplay in this game is actually extremely impressive i have played many mobile games and usually the auto play for hard content is terrible but here its enough to get max rank on difficult content

the actual combat in the game does have strategic elements from the team you build the synthesised battle items you bring and the order you use character skills it is turn based but there are tiles where if your characters turn falls on them they can afflict certain statuses like decreased accuracy increased skill damage and ultimate skills on the surface the combat seems simple but is actually a lot more complex

as this is an atelier game there is an alchemy system you will be able to craft certain items and the game lets you use 2 characters and 1 material to craft these items each character and material has certain attributes tied to them that will carry onto the item crafted so choosing who and what you use to craft is very important


 a review on the gacha elements  

the gacha in this game mixes both characters and memoria akin to character weapons in other games

every banner in this game will introduce 2 new characters the rates are 0505 for the two rate up characters combining to 1 out of the total 4 for the 3 rarity character pool

while the rates are low the gacha can be ignored in this game as many 12 characters are very good some even better than 3 if you do however decide to roll for these characters 1 copy is enough and dupes in this game make barely any difference

paid pulls are half the cost of free pulls 1500 gems for 10 pulls and provide 6 medals the free pulls will provide 11 medals hard pity in this game is 150 medals and medals remain forever

duplicates in this game provide character shards for that character and a currency that allows you to purchase shards for any character from a shop do note however that shards can be farmed completely free for any character in this game as long as you have 1 copy and it doesnt take long to max them


 a review on iap pricing 

iap is short for inapp purchases and i can only speak for the gbpusd currency 

as of writing this review there are no packs monthly passes battle passes or level milestone rewards purchaseable in the store only raw gems

every new banner offers half priced pulls exclusively for paid gems real money purchased gems 1500 gems instead of the usual 3000 for a total of 15 times 15x10 pull or 150 total afterwards its 3000 gems

like with every gacha there are first time purchase bonuses offering double the paid gems

currently for 8080 price is the same for  you can expect to get 6k paid gems and 1200 free gems totalling to 44 pulls the pricing per pull in this game is standard to most gachas


 my opinions on the current story  

there will be no spoilers here so fret not

the story features two mcs during the first half we only really focus on one of the mcs until later on the game switches occasionally between the two

there is an interesting contrast between the two mcs and their stories on one side we have a very cozy character with an unshakeable positive attitude towards alchemy and the other has more serious badass mc my main appreciation from the story was seeing the many different characters in a modernised atelier game 

the story is fully voice acted and the character models express their emotions very well not to mention the music that accompanies certain core moments really suit it

this game is still in its early stages the main source of pulls will be from 
1 dailiesweeklies
2 ad watch rewards exclusive to mobile
3 events

personally ive found the game fun more so if you treat it like a game and forget the gacha part

#####

came because i see rorona and ryza stayed because of the gameplay that made me addicted to atelier again

now wheres my sophie

#####

i only got dudes from pulling a lot im sad

#####

good bgm btw

#####

now remake the rest of the salburg series or else ayesha will bonk you 3

#####

really disapoited
as gacha game the game is cheating
pay to win

#####

booba jiggle is over 9000
a solid gacha game

#####

if you have never played an atelier game stay away from this one and treat yourself to atelier ryza
the only appeal in resleriana would be for some fans to see their waifus smiling at each other and those are who koei tecmo is trying to milk here

so what makes the atelier series shine is obviously its unique and incredible crafting along with exploration some even had great dynamic turnbased combat gameplay and ryza 3 even dared have a proper storytelling
theres none of that here none as in simply nonexistent
instead there is gacha and timelimited actions per day

theres nothing worthwhile and no reason to spend your days farming it

but hey at least it supports ultrawide screens something even 2022s game of the year never bothered with

#####

this is the only atelier franchise that i will not recommend to anyone especially when you like atelier games
the main reason is that its a gacha game well if you dont mind it being one go ahead and playtry it

aside from that the game story is quite decent the auto battle system is decent shallie is cute as ever
pay to win not really but for new players that doesnt have any idea about atelier it might be difficult to grasp how the game system works like what to prioritised and such
also stamina system like most gacha games stamina is the killer mood of any games
and id rather play an actual discdigital atelier games than this one here

despite saying all that ill still play this one as its an atelier nonetheless but i will never recommend it to anyone i know

#####

jiggle and camera angles   ʖ 

#####

im not really sure what to make of this honestly i understand its a gacha but the game is just kinda whatever i think i wouldve been a bit more happier with the game if it was less of a visual novel and more like the previous games gathering and alchemy both take up different forms of stamina but are much more faster outside of the like 3 or 4 loading screens than the previous games 

the way you gather is either 
1 by selecting a stage spend stamina to do a battle then collect rewards
2 entering a dungeon where you literally move in a straight line going from point a to point b and collectingbattling

alchemy is essentially color matching which is much simpler than previous games alchemy systems and 1000 less in depth however its character gated so hopefully you have the characters to color match with

on the bright side the graphics are really nice everything is fully voiced so far which is a surprise to me combat is turnbased and kind of fun right now plus you can auto battle you can also skip dungeons and stages previously completed which cuts down on the tediumitem grind

rerolling is pretty of straightforward and fast takes about 2ish minutes to reroll since you can skip the tutorial after the first time completing it so thats kinda cool i guess

ill continue to play for now but honestly not sure if ill keep it up longterm its okay for a game but not what i want for a mainline atelier game hopefully its a oneanddone kind of deal and its certainly better than the last atelier gacha that didnt last all too long that one wasnt touted as a mainline game though

update actually now that i think about it why is alchemy stamina gated why do i need to wait to make new equipment why do i need to skip 2 cutscenes every time i do any alchemy also all these loading screens are getting ridiculous i forgot to mention rolling in the gacha is highly annoying not as annoying while rerolling but you have to swipe your mouse across the screen for every single or 10 roll why

#####

day 1 player here i have not gotten a new and exciting character pull in many weeks and months the pull income is low and the rates worse duplicate character pulls feels terrible the game play was fun at first but each new event just adds more enemies that are only weak to the newest limited characters the synthesis  gear system is all rng i would not recommend this to anyone looking for a gacha game or an atelier game

#####

gacha game alert
that said this is one of the better ones as in nonpredatory
that said itideallywouldve been a better visual novel except for the fact it wouldnt earn enough to pay off the ninja gaiden developers if it were sadly 

#####

90 cutscenes
7 navigating through the ui
3 battling monsters  and the battle system is boring

#####

okay i dont recommend it last time but have mixed feeling i actually still has a mixed feeling
i completed the available 3 chapters prior to 04022024 this is my take 

story 910
its actually pretty good i thought the story will be bland since the arrival of many elchemy from the main title but well i can say that the story is reaaallly good even better than ryza seriously the pacing and character interaction is great the plot is serious and the character development is great

gameplay 610
the gameplay is simple basically breaking your enemies break gauge and dont let them getting a turn the annoying thing is burst in the game is based on the turn panel not energy or something that we can build up ourselves so we also need to make sure that the enemies didnt get the burst panel or we can just die in a turn if our battle power isnt high enough with a thoughtful strategy and panel alteration using item can move forward 1 panel we can actually beat much harder enemies i defeat 6900 chapter 3 last boss battle with only 6130 power which is hard but viable so its not that hard as long as you know what to do

music 810
most of the time its usual atelier vibe good but some important bosses really have their own theme which is perfection i hope in the next update they will retain bgm for each bosses so hearing them again would be immersive

gacha 210
a shame really a good story behind a liveservice gacha game i doubt it will be ended soon and i also doubt if the game can survive until the story concluded why the gacha are bad no guarantee separated free and premium gacha which is insane not to mention the hard to get gacha currency seriously this game needs to adapt to recent gacha system applied by many new gacha games this is too ridiculous and predatory this is why i dont recommend people to play in my first review

synthesizing 310
yes a synthesize system where the option hide behind a predatory gacha system we need to have the character that give certain option because the option mostly tied to the character the synthesize system is easy to learn but with limited character it would feel really boring creating many items to get the same option also the strength of each option is rng based so you probably need a lot of mats and time to get good items just to raise the battle power so battle wouldnt be too hard

conclusion 
if not only for the sake of the story i wouldnt recommend this game at all but the story is far too great too miss at least for now i just hope the story can be concluded at least a year from now or so shame that this masterpiece of a story is behind a predatory gacha game

will update later after story update to see if the story still worth my time if not then i will change my review again to not recommended this is borderline recommended

#####

great game

#####

resnas feet

#####

another f2p hell
only play for the story if youre a fan of every mainline atelier subseries besides iris for now
positive just for giving us 3d vayne and raze though

#####

together we are atelier

ps game itself is just an ordinary game that speculates on being a25 in series shrug

#####

terrible

#####

between the dumb censorship and the shitty gacha rates and diluted pool seriously fuck rolling for memoria this isnt worth it rerolling while not as much of a pita as some other games still sucks 

i look forward to eos and hopefully a single player version coming out

#####

came for the thighs stayed for the game

#####

i miss the part where synthesize actually fun

#####

the fate of all great jrpg ips are to die as a half baked gatcha that they somehow poured a ton of money into yet you can never see where that money went when you play the game 

what a waste of cute designs for the new characters to be wasted this way

#####

the game atmosphere is very good and with a likabledecent storyline overall the game gives you good enough characters to forward the main storyline with ease

the cutscenes animation is mile ahead compare to the old games and graphics is very good give it a try i insist the game is generous enough that you shouldnt even have need to spend

#####

tldr  gacha turnbase visual novel like games with great graphic and nicely animated but its mobile game so dont expect too much overall this is a good anime game to fill your free time

many negative review just because its a gacha game i mean its a free mobile game what do you expect
of course the quality is very different from the premium games available for pc
but its nicely ported maybe the ui is a little difficultcomplicated for pc there just a one keyboard shortcut to exit the game esc
the story is enjoyable not too good not too bad you can meet all the characters from other series such as the alchemist of salburg and read a little about their backgrounds
the turn base system is just ok at least for the main story you dont need to focusing on the weakness element of the enemy you dont need to gacha too just use the free character they given its enough to progress the main story
take your time its casual game its meant to be played just for an hour or two a day 

i agree the gacha system is suck but you have 1 free gachaday and i can confirm with a luck you can get an ssr from it haha but i just wanna enjoy the story its nicely animated and have voice
the event suck to the duration are to short but yeah i just want to enjoy the story so i just play the event only to progress the story i mean there were no special prizes to be had

if you want an anime turn base game with strong main story  just play honkai star rail then its much better and the gacha system is good but with little animation at late game its a bit boring to read every line no skip button and iif i can stop one heart from breakingi  it will much much better spoiler damn you hoyoverse spoiler

#####

ryzas boobs bounce more than usual resna is cute n stoopid a top tier girl wife material good game

#####

i cant say i dont recommend because its cute but not really my type of game

edit ok i love how cute it is i got some new characters

edit 2 ok so they only let you farm the mission to get awaken tokens 3x a day but you need 80 nah thats dumb i cant recommend this

#####

say no to gacha games

#####

i thought it would be simple like previous atelier mobage but what i got was a game thats just all about flexing graphics with alot of female characters the male ones are still there but theyre not the main selling point

ui transitioning is very slow synthesis is too forced to follow modern atelier games game is off better a singleplayer but i guess they learned their lesson that single player games dont make money but gacha sure does

#####

nice graphics chill story interesting turnbased gameplay

#####

 mobile jrpg with gacha mechanics it is those sad cause for the game since i play one of them on playstation and enjoy it a lot 

#####

theres a lot of junk to level up and keep track of and you need to keep on top of it because story progress is gated frequently by random objectives that usually require it all so its a bit miserable to play gacha rates also seem bad and theres a lot of predatory packages that cost money

but the yuri is soooooooooooo good so thumbs up

#####

decent gacha game bad atelier game

#####

censored crap

#####

a gacha game with atelier series characters nice to play and develop characters but needs too many daily logins compared to competition to get optimal development done

update

in the long run game requires too much time and gacha makes it constant rat race to develop characters and update gear its better to play some newer nongacha games from atelier series

#####

repeated works no fun at all there were so many fun games out there this one is just a waste of time if you want to know what this game is about just go watch cutscenes

#####

first of all sophie is best girl
we got a free atelier game  what a time to be alive 
you get to meet all of the older atelier characters  the graphics are gorgeous as usual  the music is so good  the combat is turn based like the older games and not ryza thank god 


#####

this is a gacha game released on steam and your enjoyment depends entirely on whether you already enjoy gacha games or not 

if you do not like gacha games avoid this game because there is very little here for you if you do not know what a gacha game is and are looking for a fun pc game then avoid this game

if you enjoy gacha games then this is a pretty decent title for the mobile market i would only consider downloading this if you already play the mobile version but wanted access on your pc for some reason which is what i am doing

as a pc game its a 410 as a mobile game its 810 despite my do not recommend i will keep playing for now

#####

i need mana khemia  atelier iris graphic style back

#####

generic turnbased gacha game with atelier skin not to mention unnecessary censorship

steam port has no keybinds other than pressing esc will ask you if you want to close the game

the alchemy system tries to incorporate the characters youve gottenwhich honestly is super boring considering alchemy is the core of every other atelier game this is awful theres not really a minigame for alchemy like there usually is you just link different characters together by colors to choose traits you want to see this is leaning too heavily into the gacha aspect without any actual fun

if you are looking for a standard gacha game to kill time with and you like atelier this could be for you
otherwise star rail might be a better use of your time with similar gameplay

#####

you cant gather and the crafting doesnt fit the recipes that we been crafting over multiple games ex uni for a weapon with no metal all it is a fighting sim with atelier girls and characters to distract you if your a fan of atelier i doubt youll like this in my mind this isnt atelier

#####

if you value your time and money play the other atelier games instead

#####

this is boring compare with previous version

#####

features the latest advancements in game physics technology developed by koei tecmo and pushes the envelope in the realm of 3d models by redefining the anatomy of human thighs and asking the question ihow thick can thicc truly bei and isensei is it true that oppai are made of jellyi 

resleriana is a game about licking candy to teleport depleting a fantasy world of its natural resources petting your best friends cat ears and murdering hordes of adorable monsters all the while looking extremely cute

h2now the real reviewh2 
b pros b
list
 high end 3d models and textures it really does look like a ps5 jrpg 
 has some of the best music in video games ive heard in the past year im really looking forwards to a soundtrack release
 fashionable and pretty character designs with many physics elements
 turn based combat that uses an interesting timeline system where controlling the turn order determines whether enemies or your party can use their special burst attacks and get certain buffsdebuffs
 a lot of stuff to craftsynthesize and character progression boards
 funny and cute story so far that features cinematics with good quality jp voice acting
 high quality 2d art featured in memoria equipable cards and throughout the story
 vast array of new and likeable characters with unique background stories
 ryza
 other returning characters from previous atelier games
list

b cons  b
list
 exploration is very watered down
   dungeons are 100 linear 
   you can only move left or right in towns
 like most mobile games the game limits story progression through a staminaenergy system however you would need to play a lot every day in order to run out of stamina 
 no controller support you have to play by clicking everything with your mouse
list

b the gacha system the good the bad the ugly and the ireallyi ugly  b
list
 badcharacters are obtained through a gacha system
 good you get 1 daily free pull
 really good if you use free or paid currency to pull you get medals which can be used to buy characters from the shop these medals dont expire and can still be used to buy featured characters even after the featured gacha banner has ended
 ugly the daily free pull does not give you a medal so it doesnt count towards pity
 really ugly pulls are pretty expensive if you use paid currency even compared to other gacha
list
 part of the problem is that this game doesnt give you as much free currency as other games do
 the other part of the problem is that the game doesnt have a monthly subscription plan that gives you a lot of gacha currency for a good price if you log in every day of the month like most other gachas theres also no battle pass but i heard that at least that is coming a few months later however so far no news of an upcoming monthly sub for login rewards
list
list

#####

its okay the story is acceptable gameplay is like any turn based jrpg and the graphics are pretty nice for the most part but there are better alternatives i believe

#####

honestly the presentation isnt half bad the game looks really high quality for a mobile gacha game clean and fast ui which is always good to see

compared to other atelier games the animations models etc are really really good the story is fully voiced and paced well a lot of old characters are back and the fanservice with them is great now to be fair this is a gacha game but so far it seems to be fine

music choice is nice too was really surprised

#####

i dont recommend this game unless youre in for the story alone but keep in mind raising a strong enough team let alone get the good units will be tedious

its an average gacha to boot with an nice atelier coating yet somehow it manages to have a ui event worse than girls frontline and optimisation isnt the best to say the least its definitely not my hardware but on that front its is actually at least better than gfl the ui does look nice but it has to be functional first and foremost
gfl is my reference because among the big gachas its the one with the worst optimisation and ui combined among the gacha ive ever played 

im only going through the game until the end of chapter 3 so my friend can get a reward im not even an atelier fan but i play this gacha like i would any other skipping story and judging it by gameplay and performance alone and its not really good its average at best but even tho really my thing at least characters models look good and feel unique to the game unlike say the blandest things ever made yet most people love them which are mihyo characters from any of their games

edit this gacha doesnt respect the players time anything takes more time and click than it should

#####

45 great 4k interactive screensaver with a pretty forgiving gacha system

overall great for f2p gachavets

#####

good gacha game tbh i think they need to work more on major events in the future if they want this game to last long reminds me of tales of crestoria i love that game anyway i dont recommend it to those who dont like turnbased but its good side game to have

#####



#####

not fun to play no exploration and its a gacha game

#####

i really wanted to like this game since i like atelier in general but its just another overpriced riggeddroprates gacha piece of somethingsomething

#####

seggs

#####

fact 90 of gamblers quit before they hit big

#####

tldr it is a decent gacha with not much content as of yet takes roughly 10 days to finish the entire main story
you roughly earn up to 15k gems which is 40 pulls you receive 1 pull free each day microtransactions are limited for bundles and buying gems for pulls aint worth it so dont even think about it

for a gacha the microtransactions are treated lightly and kept to a minimum not much option no overpriced costumes no instant win packs and most of the forementioned bundles are buyable with free gems too
the gameplay itself is ok and decent a turnbased party styled jrpg with a simplified stat system and equipment slots that has 2 interesting mechanics in the form of the burst system and the action items which let you change the order of the attacks and grant you either boosts or bursts which are your special moves in this game and often deal more damage than the regular ones while still having a decent speed

besides the fighting system is the atelier system which lets the user combine certain characters to craft recipes with different modifiers those are active items armor and weapons this is the mandatory way to attain equipment and upgrade shards for the main character
gems are unlocked by either clearing a mission for the first time attaining events or progressing the main story with some missions giving you also a few very limited and adds up to roughly 15k when you reach the end of the current story after that its a long hard grind for more with the main way being to unlock further recipes each giving you another 50 gems

so all in all a pretty decent gacha with basic stamina and daily quest mechanics just like in most gachas gameplay is ok content sadly not enough but that will change in the future and you only get a very limited system to gain gems for additional pulls

#####

damn booba physics 1000010

#####

nb

#####

generic and boring gacha crap play the actual games instead  this one is an insult to the series

#####

i really tried to like this game but it does the exact opposite that games i like do

the story music characters are all s tier girls are all cuter than ever music makes me lose control and the story is actually interesting for a gacha so why dont i like this game because i have big issues with the gameplay among other things

the gameplay is so bad the game lets you skip it if you want to which is great if you dont like it but if the gameplay isnt good what else is there to do i dont know how to explain it but the battle system is just boring i guess when a battle shows up im not excited anymore i dread it the animations for your moves are the only good thing about it

dont even get me started on the alchemy that is hot garbage due to the story slight spoiler warning you can only craft a certain amount of times because the mana used for alechemy is running out while fine in the story you only get about 6 tries and then you have to wait for it to recharge you get more from completing challenges but early game you might get 10 max i cant talk for later game since i wont be playing more but it might get better later i think the main draw for the atelier series is the alchemy so not being able to do it when i want to is annoying

and the gacha is expensive as heck its 40 for one ten pull thats the price of a good atelier game on sale i wouldnt mind if the gameplay were good i played genshin impact for well over 1k hours and the gacha is so much more predatory but the gameplay is so satisfying especially when you get better characters when i get better characters in this game i still hate the gameplay so whats the point

for the last two weeks i have been turning the game on just for the free pulls and thats it i think its my time to drop the game had this been a fully fledged atelier game with better gameplay and normal synthesizing i might have kept playing even if it was still a gacha i cant understate how good the rest of the game is i really wanted to like this game but i cant stand it

poor resna hope you get ported to a better game one day

#####

how does one apply for the cameraman role of this franchise

#####

this is not an atelier game  if you replaced the characters nobody would ever know it was meant to be an atelier game from whats left  

the heart of an atelier game has always been the crafting system and its garbage here  you cant just craft whenever you want because you need certain limited items and you cant feed items into other items at all

#####

the plot really bounces 

#####

lovely 3

#####

for the next official entry on the atelier francise id say this is several steps backwards no real exploration done the characters move to the right and collect predefined loot story is not very interesting and i stopped following it events require a lot of grind for such a new game it already requires a lot of investment something im not willing to do it has the staple sweep and auto battle but often the ai will make you lose other times an unbeatable boss appears and you have to battle it yourself or auto battle will lose for you other times you need to guess what to do on a boss battle that will make you lose in just 3 turns this is by no means a good game id give it a 1 out of 100

#####

a lot prettier than the other atelier gacha gameand somehow even more shallow at least this one has a decent translation

#####

if you enjoy the atelier series this is great if you dont or know nothing about the series its bad

#####

review coming from someone that has no attachment to the atelier series but just a gacha crackhead that test runs new gacha for waifus cool characters and ip the usual stuff

for reference i have whaled in and played dozens of gachas dating back as old as brave frontier devil maker tokyo valkyrie connect puzzle and dragons and dokkan i am currently only playing reverse 1999 and marvel snap

to sum this game up i would call it boring eye candy it has cute waifus graphics and faithful fanbase it seems but its has afk like game play and little to no depth in game i was lucky enough to get a god roll to start out and my luck has continue from there i have gotten all the new units from gacha off the discount tickets and havent spent a dime i have cleared chapter 3 as of this review done entirely on using auto and have done the same for most of the side content i have yet to actually play the game and to be honest i dont think i will before i drop it the actual gacha aspect of the game are actually below what i would consider standard now of days there is no batter pass nor is there any dolphin friendly bundles just a bunch of useless beginner stuff and flash sales and they have a very poorly priced gem store 20 dollar multi with no bp or solid bundles no  no thanks

this gacha uses the paid and free banner setup which im not a fan of not only does it add two forms of currency and causes disparity but it always leads the player towards a sunk cost fallacy game is also very grindy even at higher levels this amount a drops needed to max a character board can be absurd you can easily use hundred of stamina to finish one a few nodes past the initially 1  30 levels its god awful even if you can skip it armor has rng rolled stats to if you like that and to top it all off the game loads very slowly and has so many unnecessary load screens which makes the grind longer  no its not my pc to cover that as well pretty sure a rtx 4080 and a ryzen 7600x with a top tier nvme could run this game with 1 resources expended game is just need optimization in that regard you can watch 9 ads a day for income and stamina smartphone only but even that has rng tied to how much you get lol

tldr game boring predatory and probably eos fandom whale bait im sorry atelier fans this aint it chief

#####

first 20 minutes left me with impression that this might be a good game
only to realize later that the whole gameplay is to do fight once on auto and then always skip it majority of the gameplay loop is browsing through different menus and occasionally pressing skip button on quests to get more resources theres also dungeons where character moves from left to right gather few resources and do two fights but   theres auto button that do whole dungeon for you  
and obviously predatory gacha with crаp rates and insane pricing
calling this abоmination a mainline atelier game is blasphemy

#####

horrible gacha mobile game i shall play it daily

#####

edit
just dont play this game its a massive waste of time please just spend your time and money on the actual games as youll get more bang for your buck as they are worth anywhere between 40  50 and you can keep looking at your favourite characters at your leisure with out leaving it to chance just please dont fall for this crap thats probably only gonna stay up for a year or two

original
if your gonna pay for roles only do it when theirs x2 currency on the shop

no one should be paying 40 or 80 for one or two chances at rolling on a banner now yes there is an event where roles are 50 off but thats a launch event and its only for paid gems

i have no idea where koei got there ideas for squeezing money out of players from but this is just as or if not more scummy than valkyrie connect counterside  insert any other money laundering gacha game here etc its insane that they price the gems it at these prices but i suppose whales will whale for games like this

i mean god i dont think genshin or any of the honkai games are this bad if you dont count the insane pity system they have

so please for the love of god please spend frugally on this game 

even though i cant see this game lasting long with these prices itll more than likely just be a quick grab the cash and shut down when their done kinda thing so dont get used to your husbandos and waifus as you may just lose them in a year or two use that money to buy the games the are from instead youll have more fun that way and you will never loose them

and with that no i dont recommend the game at its current store pricing just wait for the cheeky offline version they probably release to get the last remaining drops of money out of us

#####

why in the heck isnt sophie available on launch

update sophie was in the next banner and i got her

#####

ryza uwwwwoooogghhhhh seeeegggssss

#####

this game isnt for everyone and it is a phone gacha game the cost of things for real money is too expensive so far i spent 2 dollars and i havent used the gems yet from that purchase that is probably because there isnt anything good yet i do love how seamlessly i can switch between steam and my phone so basically this version is an awesome addon to the phone version my phones battery is thanking me

#####

beautiful characters design and nice storyline

#####

ignore my play time  ive almost exclusively played this on my phone i just started chpt 2 heres my honest opinion

its fine thats it its not great its good though it also is pretty similar to any other main line atelier games and i find the criticism of it being too simple baffling sure crafting is easier however ive had a problem with trying to get people to play mainline atelier games even ryza because they find it boring i saw criticisms of it being like a menu gacha my brothers in christ people have been hurling that criticism to other atelier games for years minus the gacha part

if you dont like gacha if you think it is absolute scum and a cash grab  look im not here to dissuade you i like gacha and im still critical of it i dont have a gambling problem and have probably spent far far less money on all of my gacha games than i have on steam games ill never play some people however dip thousands they dont have into it 

so if youre critical solely on the gacha basis thats fine dont recommend itreview itetc and move on i do not like the false narrative that this game just sucks and has a bad story because the story seems pretty strong so far the game play is pretty fun 

as long as you dont have a gambling addiction pick it up you dont even need to spend real world money unless you just want to get wives look up reroll guides so you can get an optimal team with the initial free rolls and just use them and your free rolls

anyway overall rating so far is 65710 true in modern reviewe terms thats probably like an 8 out of 10 lmao

if youre going to spend serious money id recommend picking up another atelier game first and just play it if youve already played an atelier game and want to just play this on the side go for it i think its well worth a try

#####

lots of cute girls and yuri best game

#####

one of the worse gatcha rates ive seen and i played fgo 
the grind starts immediately along with the added challenges of navigating what seems to be a half baked ui the dungeons are linear to the point of being redundant there is no exploration
graphics are nice which is a selling point of this game but this game fails for the same reasons ff ever crisis did had the right ingredients and a strong brand to make a great game but its just a money grab and they arent even shy about it its almost as if the investors for koei tecmo games made this loosely put together game on their own 
gatchas are predatory games by nature but this game stands to be the reason why gatcha games should have a predatory rating of some sort

#####

h1first impressionsh1
super annoying and dissapointing game claimed it has size of 800 mb which was the initial reason i decided to try it after launching it asked to donwload some extra 450 mb i though its probabably full files to get it up to date oh boy i was wrong after that a 52 gb started downloading and lagging pc so there was no way to play other game or even use browser and after that another 12 gb loaded

bthe thongsb
the first thing that meets you are numerous upskirts of girls pants over and over like every camera shot is taken undere skirts or in a way to make tits nearly bump into screen and jiggle around aka jelly then girls started making weird erotic poses like wtf is this why and game takes very close up angles to show faces like literally infront of characters tutorial is not explaining anything yet manages to waste lots of time it never told me how to actually surpass lvl 10 of heroes characters hair jarring and clips around unnaturally distracting player all the time while all npcs move like robots cmon you still havent learned how to make movement animation after releasing over 30 atelier games

bthe lagb
performance is fully rng sometimes menu decides to drop frames to 13 for no reason while battles and story show 60 fps backgrounds are blurry and muddy at random times antialiasing turns on and off on its own shadows cannot be shut down completly every attack takes way too long to actually reach target cus everyone in this game is dancing queen which requires 5 seconds of casting and moving around to throw a basic punch even at 3x speed it is painful let alone ultimate burst moves which are thrice longer camera is alive it decides on its own what to show when and switches at random

h1the badh1
 limited battle energy
 limited alchemy energy
 grind for no reason
 rng gacha drops with 4 chance for 3 stars heroes which i actually managed to get twice in a row but you know what that is not enough to awaken hero even once from 3 star to 35 stars so good luck landing in 4 3 times for same character xd and to get further in power you need even more shards hahaha
 story is 100 similar to one piece our main bumpkin girl wants to find alchemist treasure land and has partner who wants to become strongest knight in the world wow very unique

devs should take a chill pill and play limbus company to see how it should be done and remove this abomination from steam platform cus that is not even early access level of quality

i finished the first 3 chapters and this game is peak wholesomeness the kawaii and moe factor are trough the roof
im a huge weeb and especially enjoy cute slice of life stories and this is one of the most beautifully written stories ive ever seen all characters are incredibly lovely and cute especially resna took my heart by storm she is just peak cuteness
the whole story is fully voice acted and animated and the voice acting is excellent
music and character design are gorgeous overall when it comes to art and writing this game is a masterpiece

the gacha seems very friendly so far the rates are good initial rewards are very generous pity characters and pity currency which never expire so no fomo which is huge and no battle pass just remains to be seen how good the event rewards will be

the combat is turnbased and similiar to classic jrpgs or honkai star rail instead of farming artifacts you farm materials to then craft your own gear with alchemy daily tasks dont take much time i play many gacha and on first impression the gameplay seems very solid nothing revolutionary but on par with the competition

if you love cute and wholesome characters and stories like i do you definitely need to play this game
if you love gacha or want to try gacha this definitely is a great choice solid gameplay great story friendly monetization
if youre afraid of gachas dont be give it a try i play many gacha and they are not as bad as some people want you make believe you might not get every character instantly but who cares you dont need to and you can certainly get those you want most if you can accept that you basically get a quality game with constant updates and long lifespan for free and compared to current day aaa releases they are polished and playable at release too dont compare gacha to competitive games they are singleplayer games just stay away if you have literally no selfcontrol otherwise dont miss out on this beautiful story 

resna is best waifu

#####

the storylore cutscenes and character skill and ult animation are all peak trust me you wont regret it

非常别扭的游戏a25作为炼金工房系列无疑是让人非常失望的

乍一看有着不错的皮囊美术和音乐都有着不错的水准建模更是相当精细甚至超越了前代所有作品这可能也是为什么官方有底气把这游戏定义为正统续作然而实际上a25的游戏体验只能用差劲来形容很难想象这样的游戏是怎么吸引ip粉的首先是卡池和骗氪思路经典无保底混池有一种十年前打开扩散性百万亚瑟王的美开服三个卡池两个都是要收费才能参与可谓是司马昭之心了给人一种快要暴死骗一波就跑的姿态2024年了在国内手游不断内卷靠内容产出吸引玩家的今天日厂还在保留传统搞出这么个东西着实让人无语然后是核心的游戏内容大幅度缩水除了战斗还保留系列框架以外大地图的探索采集消失不见剧情纯一段又一段小动画过场炼金也变成了跟氪金强度挂钩的数值系统还要看运气毫无过去的策略性和设计感非常无聊光荣和gust可能以为凭借自己单机厂的技术积累手游的盈利模式就能赚大钱但无论是做单机还是做手游有些道理是共通的付费得有付费的理由和价值自我感觉良好而忽略玩家体验的游戏只有死路一条我真的想诚心地问一句你这游戏指望靠什么留住玩家呢不会是你这轻百合日常剧情和ip狂热粉的脑瘫吧

我作为一个a系列老玩家对这个系列的热爱和投入都是货真价实的特别是从来莱莎1开始每年年货700首发终极版都未曾让我退却但是这个游戏我只能说抱歉我玩不下去炼金工房很多元素都不是特别的但只有组合到一起才是这游戏的精髓不仅仅是美少女轻百合充满温馨的日常还有探索未知的场景收集素材通过考究的炼金系统创造道具运用策略挑战强敌而a25不过是一个空有皮囊的炼金工房并不值得让人投入我并非绝对反感氪金但同样是氪金与其选择这游戏我不如选择原神和星铁即将到来的新版本卡池对比这些市场上杀下来的真正赢家即便你全力做一个单机正统续作在综合质量上都很难追上别人更别说这样的一个手游

话已至此如果以后gust还做单机续作还是首发最高档超过700正常情况我也还是会买但这个游戏我只能说能活一年以上算他走运如果还想着投入资源长期运营下去放弃单机续作那我们也只能分道扬镳说句走好不送

an incredibly average and plain gacha game using the atelier ip it looks great story is alright and the new characters arent bad but everything else is very standard gacha game but only now its filled with many of the past atelier characters in hopes of having your favorite so you feel the need to collect them

its not bad but its not that good either its just ok 

for 40 usd you can do a 10 pull in this game or go buy one of the other atelier games and have far more fun however it does seem the devs are aware of how ridiculous a 40 price tag is for a 10 pull so there are specials where you can do a 10 pull for half the price

pros
 great graphics
 jiggle physics
 characters movements they change poses based on what category you clicked
 animations 
 arts

cons
 paid gems for 2 banners of 1time only 3000 and half price for the second one they are disturbingly expensive
 some animations after selecting the quest can not be skipped
 glitch noises and sound when it changes pages when loading to another pagemenu

tldr great game but not for the first timers gacha game

#####

finally been waiting so long for the atelier gacha i cant wait for ryza and marie to sit on my face and absolutely kill me

#####

this game is wonderful great package all around with high production values for the series standard and it has one of the best turn based battle system i ever encountered at least in the nongacha space speaking of gachas i got limited experience with the genre but i can say the battle system is at least better than the already awesome one in honkai star rail

the only downsides are the jiggle water balloons physics and the game is not very generous with rates and in giving gems for pulls but i feel like they are getting better at this

what can i say give it a chance and dont be scared by the gacha

#####

actually trash  horrible optimization horrible graphics gameplay is mid at best consistent network failures in the middle of lengthy missions which have nothing to do with my actual network and everything to do with the trash servers theyre using

#####

where is sophie

#####

this game is a series of inconveniences everything from menu browsing to summoning to combat is locked behind lengthy animations need to craft 60 recipes for the event prepare to click for about 20 minutes the gem income is abysmal and the enjoyable fights are basically rng reroll until you get lucky enough to kill everything before getting hit once because youll get oneshot

#####

h3 the story h3

reviving alchemy by reaching the worlds end and bringing mana back to the world its charming and while not outright funny it does bring a smile to my face the main star resna is tasked with bringing alchemist from all over together as she journeys to the worlds end by selling her wares and in turn based combat you recruit alchemists via the gatcha system its clear that the dev team enjoyed making this story as highly expressive and beautifully animated


h3 the combat h3

as per most gacha games of this nature closest i can compare this to is honkai star rail you have a team of 5 alchemists you can set up for combat the items you craft can be used to give yourself boosts or other abilities to help you push past your enemies combat has a unique twist as you fight you have to pay attention to where boost tiles and debuff tiles are located in the turn order you have to stun or defeat your enemies with some light strategy in order to land on the boosts to help you in combat
burst abilities allow for big flashy animations that deal tons of damage in an aoe


h3 the music h3

the music has a lot of flair and is pleasant to the ears without looking anything up and taking it at face value it fits well with the character designs and the world as a whole


h3 the animation h3

this game has much more movement and animations that i would of thought to come from a gacha characters react pose and move a whole lot more than i was expecting adding to the already charming game are well drawn stills to denote flashbacks along with some side stories


h3 the ui h3

the game throws you right at the paid section which is honestly the worst part of the experience right after the prologue the game sends you straight to the cash shop to try and coerce or trick you into purchasing story passes and buffs for the game big miss on that for me let me discover the cash shop myself and dont force it in front of the player as that is a major turn off to those not willing to pay other than that the ui is fairly well laid out as everything is pretty easy to navigate to


h3 the game h3

as with all atelier games synthesising and crafting are a major part of the game as much as the story crafting items is fairly straight forward as you can boost your chances and side affects by essentially matching the colours that the synth item is looking for with your team of alchemists youve pulled the colours determine what kind of bonuses the item will get depending on the combination you come up with its pretty fun to mix and match alchemists trying to synth a weapon or armor that will perfectly compliment a fighter you want to improve as you travel in the story mode youre met with all the lovely fully animated scenes i mentioned earlier during your travels you move from section to section via brief loading screen into wave combat you make your way through the fights and back into the story you dont have any control over the characters movements as its just a loading screen of resna and crew walking from place to place then there are the dungeons extremely linear hallways where you combat and collect it does help break up the monotony but the story does get stale about 3 hours in


h3 the rmt h3

the real money trade in this game is insanely bad to do a 10 pull by using lodestar gems the wish currency as well as some unique shop items is currently 3000 for 20 usd a 10 pull is 3000 gems making for one the most expensive pull costs ive come across worse still is that if you do not pay real money for gems it locks you out of certain pull pools paid gems and earned gems looks identical except one has a huge paid sticker stamped over it


h3 personal take h3

while i generally like to give gacha games a chance i usually play till the grind takes over the fun assuming its fun from the start it was very fun at the start but about 4 hours in the combat lost its charm and the lack of any kind of freedom ultimately makes things repetitive 


h3 is it worth the almighty dollar h3

being that its a free to play game you dont have any real investment so sure it can be if you like the atelier games and dont mind the gacha grind however the rmt is so bad that i cant recommend it the game starts off well enough but it gets boring faster than most gachas ive played


#####

game can have its fun moments if you just accept you will only use the f2p characters and if managing your premium currency non paid the best by buying ticket bundles you will have a very hard time reaching their 150 pity to let you select someone because these give 0 towards the pity there is a also the paid premium currency which is priced extremely high this is partially because each pull is essentially twice as expensive as other gacha games 

play to play and accept that you may never get a premium character and enjoy what story there is this does not mean you can not clear content but you will surely have a very hard time in the later portion everyone can be usable it just determines the difficulty 

if you want a better gacha experience i would look elsewhere i really recommend not giving them money for their gacha pulls if you want to play take what they give ya and hope you get that 5 chance at what you wanted pity system needs fixing

#####

i am not really an atelier series fan i am giving opinion from the view of a gacha gamer this game is kinda bad 
how many characters were released after the game released until now and now as a f2p i can only get enough token for one spark 
for the late game content it is not really good too the battle mechanics is bad tbh you need to reset the battle a few times just to get optimal condition to win is it fun resetting the battle for 20 times a row i dont think so overall it is a pretty low quality gacha and the only good points are the bgm and cg

#####

gacha rate is so bad and you cant have 2 same character in a team this game is just a money grab

#####

been a player on and off since launch what really set the nail in the coffin in for me was the new characters being paidgacha only hhhell naw

#####

abysmally low gacha rate a shame really

#####

waifus are amazing here but thats about it if you told me this was released 5 years ago itd probably be the biggest innovation by far but in 2024 and going forward there are much more ambitious projects worth your hard earned cash rerolled till i got the chars i wanted but still felt empty afterwards its a skip for me

#####

way too stingy in its rewards

#####

awesome game  cute presentation  f2pfriendly  aaa gacha game from a aaa team

the synthesis and gathering have been simplified and streamlined for mobile and light gaming  the progression is very well thought out and highly addictive  most of the characters from previous atelier games are present as beautifully animated 3d modles with the rest to appear in the near future  the story is very good lighthearted with fully animated cutscenes

i honestly dont know how someone with less than 10 hours of gameplay can give this a negative review  i dont know how endgame content will pan out but so far im having a blast  i cant wait to prototype the characters in resin using catmullclark restorationoptimization ill probably restore valeria or lara first who knows

tip for starting out you dont need a healer just a guardian shield tank two breakers razemarionetc and two elemental users  heal yourself with items if you have to but if you want to advance through the content quickly use an extra breaker marion can stun most enemies in first turn instead of a healer  also get the bundles for 200 currency to upgrade your characters quickly

just an awesome game  i cant say enough good things about it  well done team ninjaakatsuki

#####

there is a lot of assets in this game and by that i mean the developers decided to compensate shallow gameplay with stingy and very expensive gacha mechanics with strange camera angles that constantly exhibits the backside of your characters so if you love playing with one hand this is the game for you

if you can look past generic gacha game methods and predatory monetization the game is pretty good story is interesting graphics and char models are nice esp if you love looking at their assets combat has auto and skips and you will need to manual on harder fights to progress all characters are viable and their usefulness is based off what team comp you can make only thing that sucks is banner draws as its not very f2p friendly but if you can snag a copy of a character you want you can naturally max its rank after a very long time

#####

casual grindy but thats fine some brain needed but its not too hard quests are level gear score kept but youll eventually get there anyway

#####

garbage

#####

no

#####

i love it 50 day straight log in 

#####

only played roughly 11 days so far but i am hooked and will likely play as long as the service remains up i am a casual fan of the atelier franchise being familiar only with ryzas anime and the titlecover characters of several games but i still enjoy seeing and learning about the characters i dont know

a lot of elements feel similar to princess connect redive rip global and that is something i greatly appreciate it is a breath of fresh air coming off other gacha games that feel a lot more like a standard grindy rpg riddled with puzzles and heavy p2w elements

this game feels extremely f2p and budgetfriendly the star gems are super easy to earn for free and you can optionally get some nice perks with the first or second starter pack for under 2 instead of paying 20 or more for a battle pass like some other games i say optionally because you dont really need them its convenient like ordering delivery instead of cooking

#####

nice game i know how many people hating this game because of gacha but since this is free game i can say this is good

maybe i should buy atelier series

#####

why do people hate a gacha game with gacha mechanics

#####

best free 2 play gacha game for me 3
all those whining ppl can just uninstall it and those who love the game will keep playing
simple as that

#####

the people who are upset prolly never played a gachahates gachas like if you know what youre getting into then theres really no problem sure this is def not the best atelier game to start with at all but you cant lie that the animations during the story is pretty damn high quality though i highly recommend trying out the other atelier games if you really want to get into the series

#####

free game atelier series beautiful graphics best girls good story turnbased combat auto battler synthesis system crossover characters what else can i ask for thank you for the game
