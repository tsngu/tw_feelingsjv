no matchmaking to play online
no solo mode

if you dont have friends or a discord to share your lobby code you just cant play
were in 2024


#####

doesnt have online matchmaking

you have 3 options 
 host a game and share a code with other people that bought the game
 join a game by code
 host a game and invite your friends through steam remote play

sadly bought the game and cant play it i wont be refunding the game in hopes online matchmaking gets added in the future

for now this will be a negative review

edit got some friends and tried remote play and it was fun will be passing the review to positive as i had a lot of fun but still hoping for online matchmaking

very good game a mix between party game and fighting game 
quick and easy to get to grips with fun guaranteed from the very first game
the graphics of the maps are superb with the quality that ankama is renowned for
the blessings game mechanic is excellent enabling new players to win against the best 
whats more the numerous characters with their varied skins allow us to discover ankamas licenses
the game is really inexpensive and i think it will have a few updates such as matchmaking

i 100 recommend this game for an evening out with friends or family

#####

very good potential but lack of matchmaking and several game breaking bugs  refund

#####

frankly playing 50point games is the way to play krosfighter spamming 30 projectiles per second in 8 directions bouncing off the walls and exploding with every touch what more could you ask for

#####

super fun game for nights with friends  the possibility to be behind and having good blessings makes the game way more fun for us because we have a big variety of skills in our group
very cheap for the fun it gives 

#####

great  innovative fighting mechanics 

the blessings keep each game fresh and result in exciting combinations together with the inherent character attributes 

may the studio bless us with matchmaking soon

this game is very fun had a great time playing this game with my cousins and brother we played a solid 3 hours the game runs very smooth considering us being in different parts of the globe initially played on my keyboard and found out later that i could use my ps4 remote love how the game automatically senses the remote type and provides a variety of custom controls for that remote  big big plus one of the more unique traits of the game is really entertaining actually we really had a great laughtime watching eachother pick the additional upgrades and perks inbetween maps this game has a ton of potential for expansion on lore characters and maps really great start we have decided to give this a go on a weekly basis and look forward to keep playing

#####

very enjoyable game with friends quite casual i would say with the blessings mechanic even someone quite bad can win which changes from most quite tryhard games you do obviously need friends or to be on the discord to find people to play with the no matchmaking is quite surprising
i would still recommend it if a few of your friends are interested it could use more content though after playing 3hrs youve seen a lot of the blessings and divine interventions already
