ive played the game pretty much nonstop for a week its a good little simulator with loads to do i have one gripe however the recent update removed the ability sell basic raw materials this is the worst decision that the developers could have made it is a simulation of medieval times where people were not always able to get raw materials or had the skills to craft items the selling of the materials they did have access to was a vital component to the economy and way of life of the time not allowing the sale of such items therefore is stupid i like this game as a true simulation to life back then but this decision to remove the ability to sell basic resources destroys the illusion that the developers have worked so hard to create they need to remove the block on selling and instead make it worth the time and effort put into crafting by adjusting the value of those goods

i put some time in this game yes it is very attractive and has a great base concept  really i ended up spending most of my time wandering the map seeing what i could get in to and trying to see if i was missing anything beyond basic city building sim that it is 
the reality is it is a bland grindfest disguised as a very attractive game with a desired objective you want to be another peasant trying to make it work and survive you want to survive and interact with other villages you want to be in danger from bandits wildlife and war the reality is that you get a sniff of these things and nothing more 

see person in village tell them you have a village they are like aight cool and move along your wife greets you verbally like anyone else would actions are basic you need to strike a house roughly 80 times with one second animations in order to create it while only being able to carry around 2030 of the materials needed for those strikes at a time 

but at the end  for what you arent struggling to survive your villagers arent dynamic in the least they are empty shells with no engagement  there is no danger or change in the villages around you to be concerned of 

everything is static lifeless and only existing as a basic interaction the desire for this game to be more drags you further and further but you never reach a point to feel like it has delivered on your expectations so you end up sitting in the middle of a silent basic village wondering if making another house will change things or if planting another field would be fun  and it isnt it is just another basic task that reaps no reward other than visual stimulus

when an update broke my savegame one of the devs reached out and personally fixed the file for me

they are lovely people and this is a lovely game and still receiving major updates

#####

this is a fun game with a lot of potential however i have noticed in survival games the character eats way too much not just this game either all survival games someone wanna explain the logic in having to hunt three to four dear daily and drink 116 of a river just to survive pretty sure one dear would feed a family of 6 or more for a week not trying to dis this game as i said it does have potential but balance would be nice as well

#####

i have 766 hours in this game and have been playing it almost exclusively every evening since october 2020  im hoping the developers see this review because i have a few things i keep hoping theyll adjust

praise summarily its beautiful and the minutia of the gameplay transports a player into that time and that existence  sidenote to the devs thank you for not including corn potatoes or tomatoes in 9th century  europe  well done  most of all i like this game because it feels like a perfect blend of so many cats of games fps rts strategy survival etc  at start its completely a survival game but every so gradually becomes more and more of an rts game where youre managing resource productionconsumption ntc assignments based on their skills and availability identifying deficiencies and surpluses and making administrative changes to optimize your little towns efficiency  and i love the feeling that im playing what feels like an rts game while in first person view  i also love that each time i start a new game i can choose anywhere on the map to set up my village  it definitely makes each play experience different from the last  after all this play time i only recently discovered that choosing a flat area near a river makes for better efficiency and closer access to buildings i have to travel to but that it also makes my town look like a communist settlement  so this most recent play i chose to go to the hills  i love that theres that option in this game

criticism is more for the developers  to new players id say get the game but dont bother reading on

ill only say one negative thing about the game and then ill make broad suggestions for further development  but the negative is frankly very obvious how its not been corrected with all these updates is mindboggling  the ui is terrible  i give it a 310  its badly organized too little info in one page view and lacks easy access links  for example i would love to have one hotkey for buildings and see a list of all my buildings with max info about who works it what its producing its damage level etc right on that first summary page  then i click that building and on one page can change its production workers etc  as it is i have to click n to bring up management tab then i have to click again for buildings i cant see what its producing so then another click to open that building then another click to see what its production priorities are  and on that page i have to click again to remind myself whos working there  bottom line need more info on a single page and less clickingtabbing  with the hyperlinking ideally for example i click on the barn and i can see what its producing who works it and its condition etc  there i should be able to change its production but also the worker for example is beth  i should be able to see her info and also hyperlink her name so that i can click it and change the worker move her to another building etc  ultimately this awkwardness with constantly changing building production and sometimes moving workers from one building to another really slows things down  

i wanted to be descriptive in my criticism but mean it to be productive criticism  that is this game is phenomenal and unique and i love it  this is one players opinion about how to make it even better 

ntc politics you deal with one merchant and gain brownie points with himher and lose some with his rivals  maybe your prices with him are more favorable but less so with his competitors  this could be applied to quests too  even broader maybe family politics and factions  in general more human interaction with opinions and influence would be awesome

more buildings a well for locations you might choose which are further from water  an apothecary when villagers become ill with that skill herbs to supply it etc  also more items would be neat  

mantoman combat maybe bandits trading wagons and such  

day counter this one is a big deal to me you show the year season and time of day  but i have to keep a separate ms excel file that i use in conjunction when i play so that each time i sit down to continue my game i know that im 46 days into the season for example  how much time you have to plant seeds or accept quests or not is crucial to the gameplay and prioritizes what you do  therefore it should be included into the ui

road and fence building give the ability to make a road or fence which along the way can change direction rather than one linear section at a time it would be neaterlooking and easier to customize to your village layout

if the scale of further development were to cost more time and money i for one would be willing to pay more for the game than 20  this is easily one of the best costtoenjoyment games ive ever bought as it is

#####

do i recommend this game yes but

if youre happy to pay 1823 for a game that will keep you entertained for around 12  25 hours 1150hour then by all means go a head with the purchase you will have fun if youre into this genre and you will get engrossed in it but then youll just stop

youll enjoy getting yourself set up building your first village and investing in who you want to work in it
youll enjoy laying it out and doing the side quests and getting it to look pretty
youll enjoy the atmosphere hunting game and growing your dynasty as you explore and unlock more things

but then all of a sudden youll realise there really isnt that much more to do
all of a sudden youll realise just how bad the ai is at operating in its current state
youll realise that after all those villagers joined your town and theyre all working for you that you still arent making any gains in your resources

in its current state this game isnt finished but it never said it was the game is enjoyable but its just not there yet the management side for me was one of the biggest draws to this game i want to make a village have it thrive and use that as my base village to leech off of so i can go and make a better bigger more planned main village however at the moment this just isnt possible

so would i recommend this game yes i would but dont go expecting a completed game i think if the developers stick to what theyre trying to achieve this game will become a classic  weve just got to hope they stick with the original vision i love sandbox games and i love management games

what does the game need
 better ui displays making it clearer what villagers are up to where you need to place tools and what symbols mean
 more buildings orientated around the growth of your city  eg inns  enabling sleeping in other cities drinking in your  other cities money to go back into your city stores so you dont have to keep going and selling berries to the nearest town guest houses for passing hunters miners travellers traders localised laws etc etc
 life it needs character  at the moment your villagers wake up go to work and reappear before the nights end to go to bed thats as close as youll get to your villagers after youve got yourself a wife i saw no point in even engaging with any of them apart from the odd quest to benefit my dynasty points i want villagers to have dinner together to hook up together to celebrate years end together things like that
 transportation at the moment if you wanted to go live in a nice empty space next to a river youd have to do so many walks back and forth to build up your buildings we need something like the forest has that enables you to transport logs quicker than only being able to carry the max of like 13 i think further more if you decided to base yourself somewhere away from the starting town youd have to continuously travel back and forth to this town just to follow the main story line
 difficulty i just started a fresh save and within the first 15 minutes i had killed numerous deer 2 wolves and a bear if youve got a spear and you can aim at a head all you need to do is crouch up to them and hit the head ggwp you win
 a more detailed explanation on how processes work for instance if you were to make a lumbercamp and set a worker to it youd presume that would mean that worker would collect you wood and for a while it wood however if you do not continue to put axes in the chest of that lumbercamp then eventually theyll collect sticks instead of wood but your only way to notice this is if you keep inventory of your resources and log that your logs arent going up whilst your sticks are i built a workshop and assigned someone to that but ive no clue what they were doing other than lowering my sticks i put someone in a tavern i think they made food but im not sure do they needs tool i had people working my farms theyd do fine when there was something to harvest but they never managed to resow anything i had someone working as a farmer in my barn but they never processed any rye into flower  its just all a bit unclear
 travelling npcs  apart from the people in the town youll encounter no one on your travels this makes the whole area seem very empty i want to see people going from town to town trading or visiting family if carts or something similar were added to this im sure its planned this would help a lot

tldr yes i recommend the game if youre willing to play around 1020 hours in its current state but just please be aware this is an ea youre putting your trust in this developer which i recommend you do at the moment the updates have been coming in thick and fast theyve stated their intentions of what they want this game to be i just hope to god they make it because this could be bloody fantastic


#####

its been a long time since i found a game this immersive at almost 100 hours ive been cutting down trees hunting deer and wild boar chased through the forest at night by a pack of wolves and scouring the ground for rocks as i build stone walls for my house ive convinced people to join me by a lake in the mountains in order to establish a small village now ive married and have a son whos in his fifth year the heir to what i hope will be my dynasty 

while there are certainly flaws to the game the graphics are stunning and the music is beautiful for a small 15 person company its an amazing achievement its easy for me to forgive the somewhat confused technology tree that requires far too many levels in order to learn daub even though youve already figured out how to build wattle ages ago and somehow you can build a campfire but not be able to add stones around it for several levels um yeah

but i absolutely love the game and have trouble pulling myself away for that humdrum thing we call reality cant everyone see i have a halfbuilt wattle and well wattle house to finish before nightfall and a fuming villager waiting by the campfire 

ive heard criticisms that this game doesnt look like the middle ages but i think its fine on that front it looks about right for the early middle ages say around 800 or 900 ce and its clearly meant to be poland where the developers are located or somewhere else in that region where circular wooden fortresses were common rather than the late middle ages in england with armored knights stealing from and murdering the peasantry under the guise of chivalry i do want to warn potential players that the hunting can be brutal its unpleasant to shoot an animal with bow and arrow and before i acquired a bow i had to kill deer with my hand axe that method is nightmarish and bloody not as bad as it could be i suppose but still the poor thing gets covered in blood as it dies i hate that but i confess it adds to the realistic feel of the game

#####

i wish steam had a star system this game would be 3 out of 5 there are some issues i was really hoping would be resolved by release so i waited for v10 before posting a review 

the good
1 it can be a very zen  peaceful game
2 i love the survival and building aspect
3 they did a great job on immersion for many aspects of the game they obviously put a lot of time into the various jobs related animations resources etc which is great
4 the character isnt super human which really helps with the realism and immersion
5 overall its a lighthearted story with potential but see below
6 the music sets the mood without being annoying
7 i love that they added bandits since it adds a bit of motivation to improve weapons and skills

where it falls short in my opinion
1 one of the strengths quickly becomes a weakness it can be a peaceful game but there is an overall lack of motivating elements in the story and game in general why am i building the village vs just wandering around looking for my uncle why go through the trouble of managing buildings and people when i can get through the whole story without the trouble while i may like to do these things its helpful to feel a need to do it based on the story or some environmental element it needs a better carrot or stick reward or consequence or both
2 the story is clumsy in its current state and could seriously use a proof read
3 the interactions with npcs are not great for example when my wife is at 100 affection and happy she still sounds angry every time she says goodbye
4 some skills are very hard to advance in without serious grinding eg diplomacy
5 some of the tech and buildings are strangely misaligned eg how can i build a giant storage building but not a tavern why must i have a stable to have a mule why cant i have a simple wheelbarrowhand cart in mines or to carry stones and clay why do i need an entire log to make a plate
6 some of the ui mechanics are inconsistent and hard to find eg there are nice radial menus for building but when you want to switch wall types for example you have to switch to an upgrade menu off the hammer face a wall and press e i went an entire playthrough without realizing i could start a building off with stone walls user error maybe but this isnt the only example
7 there is some good behavioral coding but some things are weirdly out of place eg why cant my villagers get their own water from the well vs me having someone do it or doing it myself this is more obvious because some of the other aspects are done well when you run into one of these odd ones they really stick out
8 its still not clear to me why i care about dynasty points other than for village size

for the motivation aspect it seems there are some unfinished plans with mention of a war dynasty points which could be used to evolve statusskillsstory in some way and maybe even have the bandits attack the village at some point which would encourage me to build it up and build walls and other defenses what about traders between towns or with kingdoms off the map

overall i like the potential of the game which is why i bought it in prerelease i just wish they had resolved some of the items i consider pretty basicobvious before launch the motivation element and balancing some of the skillsresource gatheringtech better would go a long way to making this a strong recommendation for now ill let it sit in my steam library waiting for the next major update

#####

i never write reviews on steam but i felt i had to for this game if you love building survival games this game is so much fun it feels different from any other with the added villagers and management almost feels like a first person survival mixed with banished just be prepared to restart a couple times i originally played this game on the ea game pass but decided to buy it on steam to support the developers

some tips for the new players

 build in a dense forest
 build where animals constantly spawn
 build near a lake or large river so you can fish later in the game
 stay away from the roads villagers have pathing issues when they are too close 
 explore early game and loot some quality starting tools from abandoned camps and barrels

all in all this game is a lot of fun and i know i will play for 100s of more hours i strongly recommend this game

#####

fair warning i give this game a thumbs up but my description will be largely negative

the issue is the current balancing level

for starters at the beginning you quickly realize that farming wont be an option for a while  you create a field plough it and then  realize that you have to fertilize it before you can plant anything now you can only get fertilizer by walking across the map to the 1 or 2 npc who sell it  just to realize you have no money other option would be a pigsty but that opens another 2 issues issue 1 is you obviously need pigs which cost a fortune issue no2 is that you need to unlock the building first it requires 500 farming skill points now considering that most actions grant a meager 12 skill points you basically have to turn the whole map into farmland just to unlock it

other balancing issues the biggest field you can make it 16x16 tiles ploughing that field reuires 6 or 7 wooden hoes they break insanely fast  the only hoe you have at the start considering that each hoe needs a log and a tree nets 34 logs we are talking about 23 trees just for that other early game tools last about as long as that
most likely food in the beginning is gathering mushrooms  01kg mushroom adds 1 to the food gauge which caps at 100 so youre guy needs to eat 10kg mushrooms to be no longer hungry  and he needs to do that twice a day similar for other food 02kg of roasted meat adds 6 food meaning you need to eat 32kg of roasted meat actually the return on mushrooms is so poor you might actually starve to death while running through woods literally eating the shrooms from the ground

village management
you have to build everything yourself no way to get the ppl in your village involved a new guy is joining the village  he will become unhappy and leave if you dont build him a house cutting down trees for wood or hunting for food sounds like a good idea  other then the player your villager bots are incapable of hunting without having a hunters lodge build which you have to unlock first nor can they cut down trees without a woodcutters lodge which you need to unlock as well even if only to sustain themselves you spent ages just carrying materials from a to b mostly because you can only carry 35kg which includes tools food and your cloths and the game has no carriages either

villager management
noone will ever come and settle in your village you actually have to walk across the whole map and convince an unemployed hobo that having a house and work in your village is better then sitting at the campfire all day to do that you need global dynasty reputation and personal reputation with that guy why i dont know
why do you have to be of a famous bloodline and a good friend to convince an unemployed hobo to join a village where he can have a house and work
not like it matters once she joine she will immediately complain he is still homeless which he strangely did not care about before he joined your village  so yes you actually have to personally build him a house then he will complain that there is no food   or firewood  generally you have to build a ressource and fodd storage
this opens another issue  you always have a build limit at first its 1  you build your own house then it is 4 look above you need  your house #1 villager house #2 food storage #3 and ressource storage #4  cant build anything where your villager can workand you have to manually supply food and firewood until you unlocked a bigger build limit

storage
now this is the biggest issue your character can carry 35kg axe hammer cloth  food remember your character eats like 67kg roasted meat per day potentially water a weapon 35kg is nothing now since you have to build everything manually you spent ages carrying building materials you cannot build from the village storage eitherso you carry logs from storage to new building walking the distance multiple times per house it gets worse if you have to chop the wood yourself naturally trees dont instantly regrow so with every tree you chop the walking distance increases
this doesnt get better with the village building chests or storages is not possible instead you have a single chest in the house  which can hold another measly 50kg the storage buildings arent much better the basic ressource storage is a rather big barn  but the inside is completely empty except for a single measly chest which at least can hold 200kg

and im not done you are incapable of building anything within a very generous distance of exiting npc villages  and even the meager hut of the hunter counts as village also you cannot use anything you have not build yourself the starting village has a woodcutters which is needed to make planks  but you cannot use it so you cant make any tools or materials unless you actually unlocked and build the building yourself  which is insane considering the points required for most of them it gets worse though  the game has no pass time function so you reach a village late evening  nobody wants to talk to you anymore the only way to skip time is to sleep in a bed or at a campfire  bot of which exist in town but you cannot use either or to build your own  which you cant anywhere near a village so you either have to walk out into the wild so you can make a fireor wait we amount of real world time is needed for the game to reach day again

other issues include weapons and crafting you need 1 log to make a single hoe or wooden spear  now i reckon a spear that requires a full log as material cannot be lifted by mortal men same with damage a meager fox requires 23 wooden spears around the size of a man to the face before he dies seeing a tiny fox with 2 giant spears through his head comming for you is kinda gets worse when you fight wisent or bears  those still come with you when they have 6 spears stuck in their head that gets mildly questionable when you kill the bear with 3 or 4 meager stone arrows

im sure i missed stuff that needs fixing and minor details  so thats not even the full list
so why the recommend  well its still in developement
the game is largely stable i have encountered no crashes and only 1 bug so far my wife was reduced to a nontargetable robe sliding across the ground stuff mostly works with only minor issues daynight cycles are working fine it looks the job
in short the basics are all good the issue mostly lies with the details and those can easily be changed a decent survival game in a kingdom come world

addendum
spawning peasents
currently the game is set to spawn a fixed amount of free peasents at the camp fires of the villages and the peasents actually migrate between those  it would be easy to allow the player to build a spawn campfire as well and spawnmigrate peasents there

hiring new villagers
it would be easy to change that villagers without a job have no upkeep this reflects the fact that without a job he has 24hours a day to care for himself this would balance itself since a villager without job does not produce anything  and once you assign a job he requires upkeep

building 
they could just define a certain area around your buildings as village and allow you to directly buildcraft from storage while on village ground  or add a range check they can just add worker slots to unfinished buildings for builders using the crafting skill and material from storage  just like any other craft

so even if its not on their roadmap most of the issues could be fixed during lunch break
on a sidenote i made some videos about what it looks like httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvatrxzjh9jo

#####

apparently played over 150 hours of this game so here are some thoughts

positives
 gorgeous world im often blown away by how pretty the landscape is
 the basic gameplay loop is really enjoyable with being tasked to gather resources to craft buildings and provide homes to your villagers
 early game can definitely feel rough and offers a bit of an interesting challenge to new players
 any setting can be changed ingame any time you want to make the game easier or more difficult

negatives
 the game is oddly paced with a lot to do in the beginning to the point you can feel stressed out and overwhelmed but as you overcome that hurdle you suddenly find yourself with nothing to do
 city management could become more complex where upgrading houses and providing more complex or better foods and other amenities to your citizens are relevant so you feel you actually build a real village
 a lack of a proper end game eventually you just wait for the days to pass so you can see your heir turn 18 years old but game doesnt start over or take a new turn at that point but it just continues where your main character at that point died there is an update trying to address this to some extent so this may not be relevant after the q3 update
 i wish i could feel more involved in the lives of my citizens fetch quests do little to develop them as characters that you look after it would help if your village would face real challenges here such as your citizens becoming sick be attacked by wild animals or bandits and the like in addition to your villages having unique personalities and desires

in summary i feel mixed about the game it has some really nice positive aspects but the game is thoroughly lacking follow through and content in several areas to make you want to come back for more the most fun part of the game is the early stages where you are still lacking a home and struggling for survival and money and still staking out where you want to settle and how to do it 

they also need to seriously balance the hunting mechanic because the amount of food you can make by manually choosing to hunt wild animals is ridiculous even hunting rabbits with your bare fists is easy and fixes all your food problems early on i would envision that animal meat should be valued more and that hunger needs to be better balanced in this area without being oppressive killing a deer should net lots of food that lasts longer compared to a rabbit 

winters also need to be much harsher with clothing and heating actually being truly relevant not just to yourself but also to your citizens would also love to see more focus spent on farming with crops failing to mature due to harsh weather conditions struck by blight and the like so it feels like a genuine struggle for survival even after your settlement is up and running right now farming is ridiculously powerful as all good foods rely on farmingrelated products so alternatives would be nice and that citizens want better quality food or you could theoretically supply them with grilled meat all day

compared to others i am fine with the travel system as is but it could be nice if you could hitch a hike with local travelers to stay on their wagon to fast travel between city points at least or potentially rent a horse or a donkey for a fee i would also love to see wandering merchants beyond the merchants that show up at the taverns including yours once you built one while i am at taverns alcohol currently serves no purpose in the game either and also looks like one of these elements that come across as mostly unrealized ideas  ie citizens are intended to gain bonuses by providing them alcohol but currently that bonus isnt there at all or potentially being able to host festivals once you built a market square or a tavern or some such 

and as i mentioned before  since you actually spend many years with your citizens the ability to build meaningful relationships with them would be extremely nice as in they have their personalities and they expect you to come socialize with them and ask them how theyre doing once in a while they got their own unique needs based on their personalities and it gives them certain boons and downsides eg maybe one is a morning person so theyre up earlier to work than the others but instead likes to drink more alcohol and gets drunk more easily and causes problems with the other villagers and so on it would go a long way in making the village you build feel alive and that theres something more to address than building homes and solving fetch quests it would also pose you with problems such as maybe you need to kick that villager out because theyre actually a liability to you but they got a family with children and do you really want to make them homeless as it will drastically reduce your citizens trust in you 

and i think this summarizes how i feel about the game a lot  theres a lot of potential with a lot of great ideas but a lot of the time it feels like the game is just not developing these ideas to the fullest as a result it feels like the game is just lacking a lot of depth  its pretty and the basics are there but there isnt a lot to do beyond it i hope the devs will continue to develop the game in ways that deepen the gameplay

otherwise i can only really recommend it based on that its not a very expensive game and it offers some casual fun early but unfortunately the game also lacks that something that makes you want to stick around for longer

i chop a wood i make a bucket
i sell bucket
i recruit a peasant i tell them make bucket
i sell bucket
i make 20 woodshed i fill with peasant i make thousands of buckets
i sell many bucket
i become bucket lord the king runs out of money buying my buckets townspeople drowning in buckets their children are fed buckets they will only be taken to my bucket factory in a few years anyway to become bucketeers other towns are just made out of buckets now the peasants are also buckets buckets produced by me bucket lord

they have the bucket problem not me

#####

medieval dynasty puts you as a new arrived peasant in a valley youll need to survive hunt craft and build buildings to form a village that you manage and expand

its not so much a survival game survival is only a thing in the first few hours and not really difficult it becomes a village builder quickly and finally a management game

it is a very beautiful and peaceful experience aside from a few bandits and aggresive animals theres no combat 

that means it is also a very relaxing experience you can play at your own speed the game is highly customizable if you dislike something eg unlimited carry fasterslower leveling no hungerthirststamina easier or harder enemies etc

also it is still in development with cooperative multiplayer around the corner 

highly recommended



#####

so been playing more after release and i cant say that i can change my opinion its an ok game but theres still so much lacking before it can be called a full release that i cant recommend it to anyone in this state

a lot if not all of my former points are still a problem still need to micromanage everything every season to have an optimal production still a lot of math and notes about what i need on a spreadsheet on my 2nd screen still no way to decorate properly still a lackluster village you build with no need for interactions with your villagers at all still weird progressions in the different talent trees etc

i plan on continuing my playthrough till i at least reach a bit beyond the point i was before i had to start over due to the full release probably till i can get iron unlocked if im not bored by it by then but i dont see it suddenly getting better maybe ill come back to it once everything they still promise is added see roadmap once they post the new one but i doubt it

too bad this game had great potential but imho ultimately failed to deliver




old review

fun game but i feel like theyre taking it out of ea to early imho there are still quite a lot of balancing issues or missing features before it can be named a good game

for example my hunters produce a lot of meat but my villagers are too stupid to roast it themselves so i have to do it for them then i finally unlock a tavern but somehow that cant seem to produce enough meals simple ones just some meat and carrots for everyone either so i had to build a 2nd one that just roasts meat so my village has something to eat

i would love to see a needed a day feature recently got me my first chicken coop bought me a rooster and 2 hens for it but i have no idea how many animal feed a day i need for them

would also love a workload bar or something started a small farm but i have no idea how many fields i can make or how big i can make them can my 1 farmer finish everything i told them to do or should i assign a second one no idea also on that a seasonal planting assignment would be nice as well some crops only grow in certain seasons love that idea but micromanaging every season gets tedious as well

some tech trees feel wrong as well for example ive been hunting since i first started the game put the first few points into getting more xp for it but still its leveling up very slow and since you dont really need to hunt anymore after a certain point it just feels tedious to level it at all 

assigning stuff to make at workstation is weird as well you have to assign a percentage to the items you want to make and that sets how many will be made a day for example 10 to a wooden hammer would make you 12 a day but there is no way to see how many of an item you need a day unless you do the math yourself and since the number of items you need a day depends on the workload you assign to something for example you hunters need knifes to produce meat but if you set it at like 20 workload they need less knives than at 60 its again a lot of math to do again tedious and then you go up in tech you can use start out with stone knives can suddenly make copper ones its math again since the system is about durability and copper knives have more so last longer

also there are some immersion issues
 the houses that you can build lack in furniture there are 3 different houses you can build havent unlocked the 3rd one yet but the 2nd house has 4 beds a crate and a cooking pot with no options to build them other furniture yes you can unlock stuff like tables and chairs to build but theres no place for them inside the house also its very dark inside even with the cooking fire on
 you can get random quests from people that give you some gold or some food and some reputation your villagers can give you them as well but its weird that your villager that has access to a fully stocked pantry still tells you that her family is starving and she needs more food on that note would be nice that the quest would tell you what item is needed before you have to decline or accept i had a hunter ask for a bow and only after i accepted it showed me that he wanted a bow i cant even make yet because its locked behind the tech tree
 the village you can build and the items you can unlock kinda seem lackluster cant really decorate your place and it just feels empty since theres so few furniture for you to place down theres also no need to unlock items some just cost way too much to unlock certainly at the start and theres no use for them after why would i unlock a wooden spoon to make if i cant place it on a table somewhere or that i have to make a hundred of and sell them to make the unlocking cost back when other items make you more money for less resources on top of that you can just skip some tech i could almost skip copper have 2 items unlocked and go straight into bronze without any issue

cant recommend it right now because of these and other things

#####

the game has a good framework around it and great customization options ive been having fun with it
the problem is that the more you play the more you see questionable mechanic decisions unfinished or unrealized features or down right late game unintuitive logic

im not sure this shouldve left early access i mean its playable and it has some bones and meat on it but its clear that the scope is not what it should be theyre currently porting the game on consoles and opening new projects so im worried that features the game needs might be on the back burner i would like to see mood actually do something for example or builders hut actually build the buildings
i swear building everything by hand becomes very tedious after a while especially if youre like me and you want to give the best houses for your villagers
children are useless and bare bones as well they have like 2 lines and serve no purpose apart from boosting the mood of the family which again is useless apparently they take away your female villagers for 2 years so they can be mothers so thats a dip in your workforce but its cool right its an investment soon the children will be able to help out in the village and the mothers will get back to work
hah
imagine my surprise when a medieval child cannot work before the age of 18 seriously
ive been playing 42 hours and ive played like 5 years will have to check
im not even going to talk about the complete lack of interactions with your villagers except maybe they give you one of the 5 random quests every other villager can

i feel the game could be much more an easy way to fix this would be to give the community modding tools i have tons of ideas how to improve this game and i am sure anyone who played this for at least 20 hours has them as well
i know modding shouldnt fix a game but so much depth and tweaking could be introduced as i said the game is pretty good and it has a good framework but its just a shadow of something far greater it could be

if it really inspires you which it did for me get it otherwise i would be cautious and wait see where this goes for now its a bittersweet experience

mt wife sent me to the other side of the valley to get her fish soup  i was attacked by wolves bison boars and almost died several times over  when i got home and asked her how she liked the soup she replied ive had better

i banished her from my village  my new wife is much nicer  younger too  1010 would recommend

h1great game buth1

before i proceed to rip this game apart i just want to highlight the fact that at its core it is an amazing game with boundless potential considering that it is still in early access

in its current state i feel like there are some major missed opportunities some basic features i would have expected for the genre and some quality of life improvements that i would love to see

black of biodiversityb 
the amount of variety of mushrooms is on point the way it has been implemented is immersive and i love it but compared to berries i just get confused maybe the dev team just really like mushrooms or perhaps they are allergic to berries i dont know but i would have loved to see blackberries forestwild strawberries raspberries lingonberries and gooseberries
i can accept the fact that there seems to be a lack of wildlife diversity considering the small region the game is played out in but i would have liked to have seen more critters such as squirrels mice and birds

black of wagesb
you are literally convincing immigrants to enter into indentured servitude for nothing but food and shelter until the day they die of old age while you reap all of the rewards cough voluntary slavery cough

bmake houses great againb 
this is a big annoyance to me personally walking through my town i keep seeing the same house again and again and again and again and again i would have loved to see that each wall type would have 1012 variations a bit of ivy on one a cross beam on another a bit of moss here and an oddly colored stone in another it seems like something that wouldnt be overly difficult to implement in all honesty and a massive missed opportunity to create an engaging and immersive experience

bsmall structuresb
why can i not dig a well it seems like a fairly common object to find in a medieval village
why can i not build a watchtower hopefully thisll come with bandits it seems like another missed opportunity considering villagers will actually patrol at night let them go to a watchtower instead maybe the building is purely aesthetic maybe it increases happiness to villagers that live withing 50m doesnt matter it would have been immersive and given the players more range to create amazing things
why can i not build a gate whats the point of walls when you have to leave openings all over the place

bvillager professionsb
let me hire a villager to be a groundskeeper someone wholl simply walk around and make sure that all buildings in a range around his shed is fixed up at all times
let me hire a villager to be a scribe let it cost me 5000 to send that villager off for a year to learn the trade once back that villager should improve the level of information available in the management tab including details such as wood food and tool usage per dayseasonyear vs expected production per dayseasonyear to allow me to make better decisions regarding what to build where to assign villagers etc
the scribe should also allow the player to send them on trade missions to far off places making agreements on the export of goods i cannot stress how much this would improve the late game where often i have to throw away stuff at the end of every season because all the vendors are broke and i am out of storage

bintroduce religionb
in a northern european medieval setting not seeing a single church abbey or monastery strikes me as odd perhaps the setting isnt medieval at all but more late bronzeearly iron age but then there surely would be some pagan shrines or buildings of worship no 
add it please i would love to be able to build a church as part of a challenge from the king once my town reaches a certain size committing me to pay wages to a member of the clergy maintaining the church and providing it with the required materials to operate all in exchange for a large boost to the mood of the villagers

bsmall quality of life changes that i absolutely needb
allow walls and buildings to snap to grid and each other
allow villagers to be assigned to move soil to level bumpy areas 
while placing buildings allow hotkeys to lock them in certain directions such as facing north while the player freely moves around 
detach foundations of buildings from the buildings themselves and treat the foundations as fields when being placed
add clutter to building interiors
allow players to dig up sticks the small saplings of the 3 types of trees and replant them without fieldsorchards

please look at my recommended settings at the bottom to enjoy the game a lot more and feel like stardew valley instead of a time management game hopefully after playing for around 60 hrs i can honestly say rating 45


the good
1 its not to grindy for surviving while at the same time not making it so easy that you get bored within an hour or so
2 you have one life so unlike minecraft or other survival games you need to make sure you dont just run headlong onto a bear or a pack of wolves
3 seasonal change introduces different environment so not the same boring environment looks need for cold climate clothing etc
4 farming and base management needs scheduling and planning to work right during the season change
5 if done right you will realise that your not self sufficient just like real life you need to get good at making some things while using other settlements for trading and making your base thrive otherwise you will always keep expanding your base
6 combat mechanics are good and straightforward it feels good to lob spears at bunnies and other animals or bandits  
7 read a few reviews that made me doubt if the game is fun like the reviews mentioning why npcs cant just get water themself etc but this really isnt an issue ingame it just like irl where someone transfers water to your localized supply for you to get and consume however its only fun when using my recommended settings


the bad
1 too grindy when running on general sandbox settings too many items each weighing a lot and you can carry so little means that you need to run back and forth too much making the game stressful and annoying even if your not working a particular profession you may still need some of its ingredients on you for other stuff on a regular basis all the grind is because of the extremely small inventory carry capacity making it too back and forth over an already time consuming management game with several aspects in the game

2 default season changes every 3 days which is hardly any time to get things done so you rush around again stressful since you have hardly the time to get stuff before the next season sets in making other activities like expansion etc a chore to do in your spare time

3 main story is just pure garbage dont come into this game for the main story also quests are very limited would be better if there were more quests to get basic stuff for npcs for cash and rewards food etc alongside dynasty reputation points i feel like the rewards are inadequate and i need to rely only on selling stuff to make money you cant be the friendly neighbourhood all services guy since your not paid enough andor provided for to make a living out of it

4 the tech tree is sooooo looong and makes it boring to achieve want a mine to get that iron ore wait for ten years of grinding really hate when games show their deficiencies by making the game grindy to prolong gameplay however if you read my recommended settings below you may realize this game is a lot more fun than it seems to be due to poor sandbox settings 


recommended settings
1 season #days  4   
makes every season longer which gives you time to breathe and relax like in stardew valley while at the same time making it slightly difficult in that things like crops etc need to be farmed in larger fields since harvested you will need them to last for 4 days per season instead of 3 per season

2 inventory  infinite carryweight 
while this sounds like cheating unless you never try to build your settlement or are extremely cheesing it you will build storage structures and store stuff to reduce the clutter in your inventory and provide for your settlers the eventual mounts you buy will help change the scenery and speed of travel after your thousand years of running across the planet on foot trust me this does not change my gameplay by much but removes the most annoying grinding crap in this game like not going to one mine 45 times just to get some good metals for yourself and your base lets you focus on other aspects of the game

3 tech learning speed  150   
still slow progress but it seems a lot better and just as i start getting annoyed i get the building i wanted except things like mine or the garbage tavern that you may never get in a thousand years

4 villager demands  8590   
otherwise your in a never ending loop to expand to provide it makes it easier to manage while not being too easy

this really made the difference and while i still run around a lot i can focus and play it like stardew valley whilst staring at the sky from time to time or spear fishing when i see a perch from time to time

#####

looking back at 2020 this game in its ea was pretty funky with berries being insanely broken and duplicating items from chests its 2023 now and this game has grown massively most of the bugs have been fixed and a lot of new features have been added to the point of us finally getting coop which has been requested since day 1 of ea the devs are working very close with the community and actually deliver what they promise would absolutely recommend this game to every city builder  survival game lover

#####

please add online coop

#####

great foundation for a unique game 
the only thing i ask is for more threat add bandit raidsvillage wars and allow us to build defensive buildingswalls and recruit soldiers

thatd be neat

#####

decent game  worth 20 bucks or so 

needs to add fishing  also would be cool to to coop with a friend

#####

disclaimer   this review is to the games current state in alpha 0203 when posting this

as someone who loves city builder games this one has a soft spot for me and am beginning to become addicted to it  currently on my 5th year of my village i think its high time that i put in something as to why i am enjoying this game and to what i hope for in future patches

first thing ill list everything i enjoy about this game

the second you load into the game i swear i thought i accidentally got on kingdom come  the graphics is just as similar to that game which was pleasing to the eye  i just love walking through the forests and along the rivers on this game

the building aspect of the game is hands down easy to manage and interesting  i will admit that took me a few starts until i got the hang of things but that is because i am the kind of player who goes in without reading any prior instructions even if the tutorials and tool tips literally just saved it in my face  the part that i enjoy the most is how each of the houses can be customized with the proper materials and tech levels  after my 3rd restart i learned before you build the walls of homes you can change them to be walls doors and windows  no two houses has to look alike

the music i could listen to it for hours probably i am a huge geek for anything medieval  first time i loaded the game i caught myself listening to the music for a good 20 minutes before i realized it was night time on the first day

the fact the game works as a dynasty is a unique charm to the game  even if you die of old age you have a child successor that you basically respawn to granted if you married and had a child yet otherwise game over  this aspect has me wondering just how many years one can go


now for the cons which per say are more than bug issues than any other since afterall this game is in alpha when writing this

tools seem to bug out on me at times when for instance try to cut a tree  i swing even though in range and it doesnt register the hit  face hug the tree and look down i can then hit the tree  this happens once in a blue moon but it was still something that was happening to other tools like the hammer not hammering what you are building or spears not registering hitting the animal

quests as much as i like doing them just to get away from the settlement building and management parts i feel they are a bit repetitive  i know there can be just so much you can do but still i find the hunting quests to be the more annoying ones  not sure if the game bugs with them but when ever i get a hunting quest i go to a common spot that ive seen x animal to do the quest just to find them all gone  i travel to other several locations to find barely anything  not sure if intended but do find it annoying  can say that of all the hunting quests i have done i say i completed 2 out of over a dozen tries

npc spawningrendering seems to be limited to how far you are from them  an example is my main playthrough has my village east from gostovia across the river  i have a lumber yard little bit northwest and a hunting lodge straight north near a tiny pond  each night my villagers goes to the tavern to wind down and relax but those who i set homes next to those work stations never come by  only when i venture out to them they spawn in and then walk to the tavern  id like to see that fixed that the games code at least has them walk around without having you having to be nearby to have them be interactive

another npc problem is their pathing  have some get stuck on fences buildings trees even each other  i know its alpha but just something to keep an eye out for to better improve the pathing ai

now this part is just some suggestions i would love to see added to the game  some here are stuff already planned but i just want to say how much i will love to finally see them added

roads  i need my roads  d  i know this is coming soon but roads naow plz

signs  simple to add just something to add more roleplay like names to families or buildings

bigger map  nuff said

terrain editor  using the shovel to dig out the land a bit to level it out to build on  there are so many great places to build that is restricted to the uneven terrain  im a man who loves to build his villages in the mountains

with that that is my review to the game  so far i am loving it and plan to dump many hours into it

#####

i love the top reviewer of this game on steam talks about his issues with food storage and giving people in this game food but all you need is a food storageand everything automatically works

and this is coming from a review from this month 

the game is good unfinished  but good graphics are superb building mechanics are alright  could use a bit more inter activeness perhaps more customization before the building is constructed however thats just me nitpicking the game isnt close to being like the trailers but close enough to be one of the better first person management simulators out there 

you ever played skyrim and wanted to do more in your homestead 
bthis is your game b

you ever played kingdom come loved the graphics and feel of it but wanted to build your town with more complexity from that one dlc 
bthis is your gameb iminus the incredible combat in kingdom come i

but why am i praising this game so highly because its constantly being updated the devs seem to be listening to their community and doing everything in their power to make this game shine this game has a lot of enjoyable mechanics to it but it will end by making you want more that same feeling of playing the good harvest moon games and then finding stardew valley this game is taking the practical idea of first person management and making it a reality  and i want to see more developers try this more and succeed because im sick of unfinished unpolished farming sim 20 games

anyway get this game its cheap and it will hook you for hours 
also downvote the highest rated reviewer on this list please they dont know what they are talking about and they disallow comments sooooo please do us a favour and press no to this this review helpful on their post

edit  the negative review is gone horray also cant wait for the coop update this year

#####

this game is perfect for living out those unfulfilled fantasies like owning a house and getting my husband pregnant

#####

if youre a fan of kingdom come deliverance but dont enjoy heavy combat or want more freedom to customize this is a great game for you if you like building and survival simulators and cozy vibes this is the game for you if you need complicated and in depth story lines with a lot of voice acting this is not the game for you if you like games like green hell stranded deep the forest simply for their highly customizable building this game is not for you 

this game offers a very cozy atmosphere with a strong survival aspect fallinjury damage sickness hunger thirst weight limits exhaustion  but no sleep needs and a lot of freedom you immediately have the right to build but your building limit is based on completing one of the main quests the main  side quests are cute and quirky sometimes easy and sometimes challenging and add a sense of liveliness to the game

your success in this game is based a lot on your reputation as a citizen of this valley and how well you treat others you can invite people to your village based on their skills and your needs and can romance but this takes time tact and money but you need to take care of every villagers needs or they will leave you must provide food firewood water jobs and shelter in return they give you free labour and you can quickly develop a selfsufficient village that requires only a little maintenance from you

the environments are beautiful there are open fields deep forests mountains a lake rivers caves and ponds there are tons of animals crop types and different tasks and occupations there are a lot of different moneymaking routes there are some bandits but you can turn this off mostly you need to worry about your survival needs and wolves and boars i genuinely have become obsessed with the idea of doing building challenges in the different terrains

overall this has become an ultimate comfort game for me and i highly recommend it if you like cozy games without being too cutesy and has some realism

#####

so i played this game when it first came out it was enjoyable but nothing to keep me playing for a long time i sat on it for a while and just recently came back to see how it is i still feel the same way 

graphics are great in my opinion trees grass water animals and even the people all look amazing so a plus in this area 

gameplay is where i feel this takes a major hit i played 20 something hours back in the day and within the last 2 weeks i have play another 25 hours this is on standard 3 day seasons i am just into year 3 winter season now and am still crafting 100 stone knives to make the money required for taxes my yearly taxes for year 3 was 1500 coins and next year will be more because ive produced more fields and houses yet even with all my extraction citizens and production i can not find a more profitable path than the simply production of stone knives i can make a stone knife for 2 stone and 5 sticks which i can normally collect enough of this to create 40 knives just on a simple walk to a village actually roaming around would take me a little less than half the in game day to produce over 100 knives these all sell at 28 coins a piece if went out and made instant heal potions i would only net about 30 coins per bottle simply to make 1 potion of instant healing you require 1 wooden vial 2 broadleaf 2 dandelion and 1 bucket with at least 1 water in it to make the wooden vial i require at least a stone axe 10 sticks 2 stones and a woodshed requiring logs stone and straw and the purchase of the scheme for it in all just getting to a point of making the healing potion costs over 1000 coins if i have these made within my city i can produce 1 per day at 25 rate or 4 per day at 100 production 240 coins or 1440 coins in a year while making 100 stone knives produces me 2800 gold in less than a day this in my opinion is crazy and it goes toward everything you can make within the game 

for the most part all created items cost and amazing amount just to have the schematic for but then crazy amounts of resources to create that simply dont translate into decent timeresourcevalue ratios the game creates the amazing grind my making you sit there and funnel almost all the time into making money as well i have a city bigger then every other town on the map so i pay 1500 coins a year just for taxes but beyond that i dont have a pigsty effectively giving me enough manure for my fields so i have to buy that even buying straight manure is exceptionally costly then i have to buy all my seeds each year why because there is no way to tell your population not to use all the damn grain for animal feed so when the planting season comes up they are out of grain 

production in some buildings is insane micromanaging as well if make an herebalism hut you are required at the start of every season to change what they are extracting because you are only allowed to put in 100 production and every season there are things they can get and things they cant if i wanted to ensure not all my grain when to animal feed i would once again have to go into micromanaging my productions it is overly tedious 

overall i love the idea of this game i just dont enjoy the implementation i assume the only reason for the grind is because the game really has nothing else going for it say you go out and dont harvest a thing for an entire year what did you do basically all you could do is sit around your village and eatdrink from produced items so you dont die there is nothing to explore nothing that challenges your city and in reality no real reason to play for extended periods of time 

final thoughts

before writing this review i was going to recommend this game based off the little bit of fun i did have however after putting my thoughts down i cant rightly recommend this game i dont mind a grind if there is something to grind for however this game doesnt have anything to grind for and thats a major issue if you are looking solely for a grinding game here it is if you want something more than just a grind find another game because there isnt anything here for you

#####

hello

be aware

this game is going to be awesome if its not going to stop developing the problem whit most of toplitz production games are that after finishing the road map for updates there are moving to an other projects farmer dynasty for ex so lets hope that after the fourth big update there going to be a 10th and 20th update whit content so keep that in mind if you want to buy this game

#####

this is going to be a fairly lengthy review focusing mainly on the negative points as i believe focusing on the negatives more than the positives helps better inform a potential buyer

first the good things

1 the game is beautiful one can clearly see that a lot of effort has been put into creating a stunning map with a lot of features it really does feel like a medieval countryside

2 the amount of buildings items cities and general types of content is good there is a lot to do in this game

buuuut brace yourselves

1 the speed of progress is astoundingly slow building stuff takes ages collecting takes ages you have hundreds of meat and cabbage in storage and want to automate food production in the kitchen too bad the villager that youve assigned to cook stew only makes 45 per day you want to automate tool creation so you dont spend your time making axes for your lumberjacks and knifes for your hunters too bad the smithy takes 3 days to make a single axe furthermore technology points are earned veeeeeeery slowly want to build a mine thats 4000 or 5000 i dont rememberpoints to unlock after 40 hours im at slightly under 2000 even though ive build one or two of every building and have 15 houses in my village at this pace ill probably be able to unlock this in 2030 hours which is just too much of a grind

2 animals mounts and technology costs are incredibly high a chicken is 700 gold even though it barely produces any eggs a pig is 2000 even though it barely produces any manure every time you invest in something it just feels like youre sinking money into an endless pit early on i found out that i can make gold by selling stone knifes 2 stone and 10 sticks this nets me about 3000 gold an hour 40 hours into the game it still feels like my best source of income

3 even though the game is called medieval dynasty having children both you and your villagers is a major disadvantage the women stop working for 2 years and a villager cant start working until hes 18 years old for comparison after 40 hours of play im at year 4 of my playtrough people online will give you advice on rotating your villagers to different houses so they dont marry this is just absurd and goes against the concept of the whole game

4 speaking of concepts it feels like there should be some selfsufficiency of villagers if a villager is thirsty he wont go to the well thats right in the middle of the village he expects water to be handed to him a hunter without a knife would never make a knife for himself he would just wait around until a knife is provided to him it feels like youre managing a dysfunctional commune not a village i think the game would be infinitely better if all production tools for villagers gave them an efficiency bonus above a certain baseline rather than being a complete necessity

5 quests are boring and repetitive that doesnt seem to sound like a problem until you realise that you need to do them to increase your diplomacy so you can sell your goods at normal prices

6 while i praised the games map for being beautiful youll probably end up cursing yourself for not building your village as close as possible to an existing one the limited carrying capacity combined with the distances makes the game more of a walking simulator than a town builder every time you want to buy or sell something in a town i cannot overstate this  you will be spending a lot of time walking around now maybe getting a mount will speed this up but im yet to get one

7 with the small carrying capacity even with backpacks and such building is a chore you end up making endless runs to your resource storage for more logs more sticks more straw it never ends

8 while seasonality of crops and herbs is very cool as an idea and brings a lot of flavour and immersion its not implemented well when it comes to harvesting and gathering for example you cannot set a field to be planted with wheat in autumn and then with cabbage in spring you have to manually change the types of plant every season which is annoying the herbalist hut acts the same  you cannot select which herbs you want gathered for each season when allocating work percentages

in conclusion i simply cannot recommend this game yes its fun for a while and its not expensive but it left a sour taste in my mouth its a 3040 hour experience stretched to a possible 100 hours of grind with no meaningful progression in my playtrough i would have probably progressed in tech more if i didnt even bother with recruiting villagers and catering to their needs which defeats the purpose of the entire game im told that you can change the carrying capacity the speed of levelling the amount of stamina used and other parameters at the start of your game that probably would help but what kind of game requires cheats and fiddling with parameters to be good a game thats not good in the first place

#####

few things can relax me more than medieval dynasty among the survival games it is in the first place for me its like kingdom come had a baby with farming simulator

#####

controls and advice for the beginner

very slow start but worth it  its actually very well made but it doesnt give you really any context on how the controls work so ill lay some out here 

q  quick crafting menu where you can lay out buildings and craft tools 

tab gets you to the main control areas for skill trees and what not but its still confusing especially when your starting out 

p  changes to third person perspective

alt  holding it activates sense uses stamina

things to note

winter is harsh if you dont want to be running around constantly making torches to keep from freezing or just stand in your house next to fire waiting for the season to end youll need fur clothes no way are you going to be able to make these in your first year or even 3 years properly my advice head to hornica make loads of knives and sell them to the seamstress you can buy fur clothes from her that will make winter alot more manageable 

health  health doesnt recover really until the season ends where you gain all your food water and health back chicory plants regain points of health and st johns wart cures poisoning horde these plants to keep you safe on the road 

resources  wood is pretty self explanatory  grab sticks and stone off the ground use q menu to make an axe chop chop chop boom you have logs 
other resources arent so obvious  straw part of the main resources you will use in your building you will find straw in the form of reeds along the river bank dont need a tool to get them but they sometimes are difficult to find whenever you do find a source stay close by because your gonna need it trust me
later in the game you start farming and mining for other things like bronze but really youll fall into understanding these a bit more as you play main things are food  hunting water  riverstreamswell straw  river bank as reeds wood  trees rocks  on the ground or if you make a pickaxe in the ground 

there are bandits and they do come after you if your near them sometimes somehow knowing your there even when your stealthy run maybe try to pick them off at a distance but you wont have enough spears to carry that on 

animals will charge you especially if you attack so be prepared 

weapons  in the early days the best your gonna get is a wooden spear this works well for hunting small game and you will find trap making inside of the decorations part of your radial menu when hitting q 
goal though is to make the hunters lodge  here you can finally make a bow and arrows but you need linen thread not easy to get early game  remember the seamstress of hornica from earlier she sells it so make knives sell and buy linen thread 

make sure you get hunters sense and survival sense as quickly as possible and hold alt to activate it it highlights loads of environment stuff like rocks sticks etc  just makes it easier 

village citizens  eventually your gonna start adding people to your village and if your like me you do this far too early once you do invite people youll probably be hit immediately by annoying tags in the top left corner tell you how much your citizen needs and is missing in the village 
my advice  make a house for yourself make a house for your new citizen before you invite them and make a hunters lodge and well and assign them to one of them then the next citizen you get to the other 
important note when you assign a worker to a station ie hunters lodge  they will need equipment to do there job like knives  pop them in the hunters lodge box and theyll start working you can find what they need from the management section when pressing tab click on the work station and itll tell you what they need to perform the function you want them to do 
the more villagers you have the higher your tax at the end of the year

quests  some quests are timed for the season you got them make sure you check in the tab menu before sleeping for another season and losing it having said that  some quests have you travelling a long way for little gain so dont be afraid to give up on one or two if you cant be bothered 

travel  most if not all of the time your gonna be walking to get anywhere but eventually you will have a horse and im sure itll make it easier but in the early days if you find yourself with a lot of coin and a wish to venture somewhere distant you can use the travelling cart outside all villages to hire a carriage i havent done it as its really expensive but just in case you wanted to

just some things to consider but i absolutely recommend the game and youll find yourself quite invested if you make it past the first year sorry for the long review but i had a long journey trying to figure out the mechanics and im still learning and didnt fancy buying the guide 

all the best 



#####

for those who enjoy building and managing a village this game is best out there if you enjoy decorating places with smallest details than this is a must have overall its a chill and relaxing game but lacks challanges

there are lots o negative reviews regarding to slow gameplay and long grind here is my comment on it and tips for new players
 original game settings are meant for dynasty gameplay you and your villagers can have children and when they come of age they have better skills and you can play as your heir you earn experience points and unlock new items very slowly this is by design and things suppose to take ingame years if you want the overall experience abit faster or not interested in dynasty mechanics just increase the experience and technology gain by 130150 and make season 45 days in settings this will not only speed things up but also makes the game easier i recommend not using fast crafting setting since this makes the villagers kind of useless and it is basicly a hack

complete chapter quests first to increase building limit story quests are filled with long texts but complete them fast to earn lots of dynstay experience early on

get a mount by increasing farming skill asap horse changes the gameplay completely get 30 speed increase from skill tree and you will fly from one village to next

do not rush take it slow and enjoy the scenery because there is no goal

things that can be imporeved in game

 there are no threats for you and your village wild animals stay in same spots and couse no threat bandits are rare and stay in camps waiting to be killed whatever challange winter brings can be easly overcomed by few clothing items and some food food types does not seem to effect anything so you can spam berrys for villagers there can be bandit raids famine wild animal control around the village cold can have effect on villagers aswell guards watchers around villages for bandit threat etc anything to make players feel that they have to be prepared for a challange

 currently your village can produce everything you go from village to village to sell all you have produced this is a very simple loop coin should be hard earned and should have more value if i can produce every raw material and item the only thing coin is used for is paying taxes which is not a problem since you have lots to sell this renders tax challange kinda useless aswell

there should be more clothing and cosmetic options

some endgame buildings like churches which can take lots of time to build but brings benefits 

overall i am addicted to this game and i hope developers keep on improving it

#####

burned by this genre before i was skeptical when i thought of purchasing this game so to my surprise i was delighted when i got into the swing of things firstly the graphics are exceptionally beautiful and unique the gameplay is similar to other games of this genre but at the manner as to which you use them to further your base knowledge and skill is less than simple  it makes for a challenging play through of the current content i happen to like challenges while some others might not there was other pros and cons attached and im going to list them below before i do however there is one thing that id like to express my comment upon

the seasons currently are only three days long in the game  and you have to strive to doing a single day for hunting one for questing and travel and the next for other things farming working with the animals ect i know that this cycle will be elongated in the future so before there are complaints we need to remember that this game is first and foremost uncompleted it is my only gripe and i know in the future that this will change i saw a developer answer another review with this information it was a great answer as well

i also havent gotten so far in the game so this will likely be amended from time to time as i experience the game  and the mechanics to the game

pros 
 beautiful graphics
 smooth framerate
 good optimization
 challenging game play makes you feel that what you do ingame is worth it
 singleplayer specific
 interesting villagebuilding concepts
 dynamic character interactions between npcs and playercharacters
 potential for growth in both mechanical elements and storytelling
 hours of entertainment

cons 
 short season again this is not permanent
 earlygame stamina drain is hefty
 tree growth is unbalanced trees regrow every three years this drains the area around you of resources
 more coming soon as i discover them there arent really many cons at this point

at this point i want to give my accolades to the development teams working on medieval dynasty  you have a game that has the beginnings of becoming blockbuster for the genre so please dont do what most have done and give up in the middle of development i also believe that you should keep this game singleplayer and make it not a multiperson game as i believe not only will development be easier  but i believe the villagebuilding element would be lessened accomplishment wish

edit  9272020

so ive delved deeper into the game and im going to add a little more onto the review in consideration we must remember that this game is not complete and is currently in a state of unbalance im trying to be as just as i can about the game itself being truthful about the cons and pros 

some of the new cons that ive realized are
 the hungerwater drain substantial  very high and unfortunate
 the amount of meat taken from creatures big and small are the same not the quantity the amount meat of a boar gives the same amount as meat from a bear or rabbit
 gold in the beginning is hard to come by  and the game wants you to progress so fast that you havent the time to make gold unless you are constantly working and doing the quest objectives at the same time
 might be me but im not good at getting people into my settlement maybe im just not a people person lol
 not a lot of flat ground to build on maybe i havent found that yet though

some of the new pros
 there are a plethora of critters around much to hunt never runs out it seems
 easy instructions and help manual available to those in need
 some of the quest rewards are pretty helpful to get you started

im still in love with the game given the new shortcomings ive discovered it isnt game breaking it just makes me feel the need to delegate my time more effectively these things im positive will change for the better  this developer seems to pay attention to their consumers

this game is still great  just thought everyone should know

if you binged kingdom come deliverance and logged so many hours on skyrim that even bethesda was impressed at your lack of social prowess prepare to spend 17 hours chopping down trees running back and forth to play medieval accountant and having a longer conversation with your spouse than my parents ever did

so i give this a thumbs up overall  i dont feel robbed and it wasnt a bad experience  

me and a buddy chose this because we were looking for something coop and we went straight into the coop  we made it fun which you can do with a friend and in the end that is the most solid review

fun with a buddy you can laugh with

that said if we knew some of what we learned playing it when we started i think we would have enjoyed it more  here goes if you want to try the game hooked up on the basics

new game settings no spoilers

2020 hindsight the settings you want are 30 day seasons and default besides that

why minimal spoilers

you can advance the seasons any time you want by sleeping in a bed  most of the time 3 days of a season is all you will want or need its the default  if you dont advance seasons often you will miss a lot of the game  events quests and variety  

that said when youre figuring out the game hitting newbie traps bad documentation and getting rng quests that are sometimes a bit wack the option to have longer seasons gives you the ability to explore adapt andor google things  

the craft fast option looks tempting  who likes grind right  it ruins the economy pace of the game and any value of the village besides role play  dont do that  

the infinite weight option and lower hunger etc options same for similar reasons  

there isnt enough of a game left without these things shaping the experience  some of this is because you basically speed forward to late game  and there isnt much of one  maybe in a few updates

what else should i know miniguide moderate spoilers gets progressively more spoilt and silly

1  drink from the blue things on the map m  you can set a waypoint to get you there by pressing f when the mouse pointer is over the blue things on the map that are water  the waypoint is blue on the map and on the compass ui element  blue blue blue

2  skip hunting deer  trap stuff q  furniture and decorations  traps kill birds with thrown spears and even kill bearsboarswhatever else with more thrown spears  deer are best reserved for late game when you have keen gear and are bored and want some revenge

3  skip houses until you want to mess with npcs  make baskets q  decorations and furniture  storage and campfires q  decorations and furniture  campfire instead  furniture and decorations conceal the ways of power

4  build your first few buildings or better baskets near a wagoneer fast travel point and waterreeds  otherwise near does not matter

5  build resource storage buildings next to anything involving cargo that is far mines villages etc  they all magically connect to each other and nothing stops you from building as spread out as you desire  this is why near does not matter

6  skip farming for food  plant flax in spring  if you didnt consider restarting

7  ignore fishing outside of i found some fishing spears lying around in the early game  you cant make fishing spears until midgame blacksmith and sewing building  when you can fish  salt ruins the economy so maybe just skip it entirely

8  skip the well until midgame even when you wanthave npcs  buy full buckets of water for your npcs  they cost almost nothing and each  will cover a villager for 10 days or about 1 year

9  skip the workshop  skip making buckets or wooden plates or anything else from the workshop  recipes cost too much

10  herbalists are for berries which are for rotting which is done by throwing them on the ground and waiting a season  

11  foodwaterfirewood for villagers needs to be either in the chest in their home or in an appropriate storage building

12  some workplaces require tools andor materials that need to be either in the chest in the workplace or in an appropriate storage building

13  you need clothes or many torches or you will slowly freeze in winter  villagers do not  expect to spend 2k on clothes or walk around with a torch all winter  torches are much cheaper straw  a stick and the same coins spent on a backpack pouch and donkey will get you much farther having flax will allow you to make some clothes yourself year one but not enough to do the job   you have been warned about warming

14  more than anything else build a woodcutter first  it is a place of magic a teacher of great wisdomgame mechanics and all other buildings are pale shadows with valid arguments to be made for skipping them entirely

first it teaches you the needs and way of the building configuration  in addition to assigning a villager to work there some messing with the ui needed you need to set production levels buildings default to do nothing until you mess with the ui enough to learn this too and make axes available to the worker see 11 above  failing in these things you get to see error messages and build much character

thou shall give them tools of stone for all other materials make no sense if you do math  this is a hint of the broader teachings of stone supremacy  and its practical extension the blacksmith is for automating the construction of stone tools not smithing

second verse that villager shall be known as they who makes the logs from air and saves us from the grind your magic woodcutter will never suffer from distance to treesdeforestation being an issue produces logs about as quick as you can under optimal conditions and will slowly learn to log better until they log at rates far beyond the potential of any player  

in this vein you may come to anticipate the value of they who conjure the meat and they who gather the stones and straw the other most magical villagers in all the land who take not from the map but instead grow to be more than a player can ever become though they are somewhat lesser  for mysteries best left untold at this time

third it enables the miracle of the logs into firewood enabling you not the villager assigned to it for the love of all that is good see below to make logs into firewood which magically increases their value for heating by x4 and in this way thou can glimpse why insulation is valuable and that villagers are animals that will burn perfectly good planks rather then split logs into firewood themselves and from this thou shall know to manage them with a stern hand so that they do not act a fool

related have not your woodcutter make the firewood for it is so slow it is both painful and confusing  and this also is another of the lessons of the woodshed  thou shall be suspicious of the relative value of all production options of any building as they are often unequal and surprising

there are many other lessons you can learn from this most powerful and humble building like where do the logs go if you dont have a storage building and a villager wants foodwater heatingshelter and a job but ⅔ is enough they wont leave you no matter how much they whine and you may even derive magic principles like thou shall do all the refining and crafting for skill and technology progression and thou shall delegate the grindy and the impossible for players and do what thy minions cannot

lurking in the shadows cast by the woodshed there is the most powerful and meta lesson   trust but verify  and armed with this you are ready for this world and all others  godspeed 


if these lessons appeal to you you should buy the game and discover the rest

very fun takes time to develop and gain abilities levels reputation etc
if you enjoy a long chill journey def recommended 
you can also customize the games settings such as xp gain days of seasons etc
you can play 1st or 3rd view by pressing p
if youre mass buying or selling select the item and hit these fef to fill the maximum amount to sellbuy fast

advice on buildings
when youre bulding a house you have an e prompt to edit walls and roof you can actually select types of materials to use to make houses stronger to have less damages every season after you farm some materials
this along with internal decorations increases inhabitants mood
adjusting any buildings that arent houses isnt possible
resource buildings share their inventory and increase weight limit together other buildings dont

advice on animals
cowsgoats are adorable but pretty much useless they produce milk you need to wait one season for the milk to spoil a bit in order to make quark and mix it with fresh milk to create cheese
both of them arent used in any recipes
donkeys do nothing just cute
horses fun for those who like a riding challenge but mostly useless since you can fast travel or just chill run around on your own and hunt
id suggest having only chickengoose buildings for eggs and a pigtesy for manure which is turned into fertilizer that is needed for crop fields every season by barn workers
the tavern isnt a useful building to have workers only create beverages if supplied materials and cannot sell them nor food however this allows some additional visitors to your place who needs them

i hope for more content maybe more of the storyline and missions but mainly more types of buildingsservices maybe more crops and trees and pleaseeeeee an increase in buildings limit because i want to take in every single person and have a huge city family
im literally unable to catch them all cause im on 130130 on the 200 limit sadge

cons
 no character customization which is kinda lame cause its 2022 cmon
 as the main character youre only allowed to have 1 child a son your heir and no second child
all npcs can have 2 kidsbtw they can have 2 of the same gender
 limited buildings amount you cannot have as many stationshouses and families as you want
 massive fps drops near your owned animalstheir houses  fields in which wheatryeoat are grown
 the tavern is useless
 no option to assign barn workers to plant specific seeds in selcted fields

rants because i can
 you can hire up to 8 barn workers in reality only 34 per barn do anything ever tf
 some vendor npcs sound like robotic psychopaths
 not many places to visit in order to buysell stuff or build your community the map is too small basically you can barely find an even enough ground to base in

ill keep you all updated if i find more positivenegative stuff 3
aside of that now that im rich gotta step up the design game  in the making

#####

great city building and management game lots of room for creativity and a lot of game customisation options meaning you can make it completely peaceful although there is combat it isnt a heavy focus of the game as of writing this so manage your expectations if thats what youre looking for

youll probably like this if you enjoy
the sims  designing  decorating 
red dead  being out surviving in the wilderness  hunting
minecraft  designing towns  creativity  decorating
kingdom come deliverance  time period  map
mount  blade  time period  visually
going medieval  town builder  town management  time period
stardew valley  town management  decorating

you wont like this if youre not a fan of
the grind
running back and forth missions although you can pretty much play without doing any missions
games with no ending ie no final boss or end credit mission the years just keep rolling on
games with no main objective ie theres no end goal you just keep on managingbuilding your town
being creative the most enjoyment ive had out of it is the designing of my towns

#####

this game is something ive wanted for a long time
a relaxing atmospheric realistic medieval survivalmanagement game ive been having a blast with it so far and i can absolutely recommend it

the point of the game is basically to build up your dynasty shocking you interact with other villages build your own village find a wife have an heir manage resources and production farm grow animals hunt gather all while improving your skills which will let you unlock new perks and blueprints
i would say that this game is more of a rpgmanagement game

and just to add to this i saw quite a few people complaining about the short seasons in this game dont be deterred by this they are long enough at least 12h per day with 3 days per season for you to take care of your village run any errands and explore the world the games is not a rush you dont need to have everything built in one year and if the time wouldnt advance fast you could never get to play your heir which is kind of the point of the game

even though the game is in ea there is already a lot of content i cant wait to play the future content shown on the roadmap

i bought the game only a few hours after it was available and there have been bugs showing up but the developers were pushing out hotfixes every few hours i think in the first 2 days we got 5 small updates 


#####

i played lots of this game and i enjoyed it a lot but with each new patch came artificial difficulty spikes instead of fixing their broken economy they now have just made it to where you cant sell a bunch of items those items if youd been collecting them take up space and storage so you have to pack them up and hike deep in the woods and drop them there since theyll never disappear

anyway the game had a lot going for it but its heading in the wrong direction no ai poor ui that makes leveling up your skills managing your settlement etc difficult and tedious if you want a good building game that isnt trying to be real by allowing you to carry 400 berries on you and you cant sell thembecause that wouldnt be realbut where would i put 400 berries on myself if this was realthis isnt it ill keep searching

this is a dull lifeless world full of typos i have a challange for you and the people you build a village for just stare at you emptily with zero interaction sometimes the smiley face by their name has a red arrow next to it indicating theyre pissed about something that theyre unable to communicate to you

when i quit i did have a little toddler running around again just a little tiny thing staring at me when i walked by couldnt interact with it you dont even get to choose its name at all 

sometimes if you catch a glimpse of your villagers walking around in the distance youll do a quick take thinking the game was invaded by shambling zombies

more cool stuff you can build traps i mean trap you can build one single rabbit trap not two not three just one ah but i can build one of each kind of traps per animal what who are these people making these ridiculous arbitrary rules

june update the updates in this game remain sparse and limited in what they apply the developer themselves get mad at you for criticizing them it turns out and will publicly seek out your comments to shame you yikes

05 do not buy this mess

#####

great game it 100 needs coop devs please

edit they listened coop full release 1

#####

after almost 50 hours of game play i think i can give an honest opinion of this game

if youre like me youre striving for a good midieval times kind of game 
i want to play a sim where it feel like im in those times trying to survive and grow both myself and a family that i can respect

midieval dynasty kind of gives you this feel but its not without  its quirks for being a early access game
if youre looking for knights kings sword fighting and such this is not that kind of game this is the youre just that normal nobleman trying to live off the land and start a village kind of story

theres a general plot line and quests to fulfill most are your average quests of hunt this kill that or you may need to help a local rebuild a damaged house by giving goods in most cases your dealings with the locals is that of giving them things killing things and crafting things for them youll waste a lot of time doing this for what seems like small reward beyond text dialogue and some wooing you cant hurt kill move or do much to villagers most damage is dealt to animals and well yourself lol

no time lapse means this game makes you wait you wanna blow through a season to get that yield of cabbage 
cant 
gotta wait however long you set a season to i wouldnt go past a custom game of 7 days before the game takes waaay to long to do anything unless youre a resource grinding nut

game has only one song on a constant loop i turned off ten minutes into playing its a nice song but some other music from that era would be cool again im sure theyll add more content as it grows

nature ambiance is nice though

the cool aspect is i can build my own village put people in it make them do things for me woo a peasant have a kid as well as hunt craft gather and die

its a basic human life sim during the midieval era not much more to it if you want fighting 
go play kingdom come deliverance
you want a game you can smoke a huge bowl to and waste hours quietly building a civilization while listening to nature 

this is your game

side note they just announced a new dynasty game even though the devs arent done with this one id wait to see if they actually keep developing this game before doping what everyone else does and buy another unfinished game devs need to be held accountable and this game is no exception dont buy another game from these guys unless they finish this one first

#####

after over 1000 of playing in the beta i feel i should write a review for this very different village simulator my beta village had 110 buildings maxed and 132 villagers working and growing


if you are looking for a fastpaced action game this is not the game for you i consider medieval dynasty as a relaxing chill survival simulation game where you can come back to it and let the game grow it is more than a village simulator it is also a family generational simulator thus it takes a long time for growth which gives your character time to do whatever you want to do you can explore the dynamic map that changes as the seasons change and find things of interest and a few surprises there is different wildlife roaming the map some very hostile the map has dark forests open plains mountains lakes and rivers and diverse flora depending on the four different seasons through each game year at first traveling between the many villages seems daunting but after you learn the map running between villages becomes easy thank you autorun and horse


as a village simulator you unlock more buildings and building upgrades by gaining experience in four main technology branches as your city grows and has baby booms your village will become perpetual allowing you to go into greater detail in customizing and reshaping your village to your vision
there is detailed micromanagement you can sink your teeth into with your villagers you can decide who lives with who and how many babies each household can have beware baby booms happen a lot putting the females out of work for a number of game years as they raise their child so placing male villagers is key to keeping essential jobs flowing without interruption
you will experience npc storylines and daily side quests from many villages npcs that help you gain technology experience and dynasty points needed to recruit travelers to your village the game has many phases the first is your own survival to starting your village and providing the necessary equipment to get it started until your villages can do it themselves you will marry a villager and have a baby who will eventually grow up and take your shoes when you die of old age everyone ages in this game


when you start the game you can customize your gameplay i strongly suggest to those players who never played in ea to do this to learn the basics of the game without too much burden

#####

disclaimer this is a early access review and not for the full game

while i do enjoy the game enough to play it 30 hours in the last 2 weeks i dont currently advise to buy it the game is currently playable yes but

everything is a hard grind the economy is especially frustrating where you sell for cents on the dollar it is completely ridiculous to sell for 5 of the buying price in a medieval setting it would just never happen and in term of enjoyment there is none worst still the price of the blueprints is insane for things you will barely ever use like visual props without effects for a thousand gold
hunting the wild life is the only true danger and it barely qualify as one until you get the basic hang of it food and drinks is never an issue you can always be fed one way or another if you really need it
the npcs you control in the village are mostly a drain and dont really help
boring fetch questskill quests included that have no real purpose to the game
basically everything is gating you because getting through that gating is the game
animal spawn points are frustrating they are fixed spawns but they are not clearly defined so you always know where to go if you use a map outside of the game but cant do those kill quests without
you cant pin locations on your map you cant put a marker to follow either so you always have to go in full screen map mode
the xp grind is endless especially hunting
you cant fix items other than homes and you will get through thousands of tools this is always to be redone f sticks and stones

wierdly enough i think the game would be more interesting if it was grindier in a different way make the individual tasks for item housingcutting gathering longer but make them more worthwile a new wood hammer shouldnt be needed for each shed you build and you should have a much bigger margin on what you sell than 5 but you should in exchange work longer for your resources so you dont have to produce hundreds of items to make any money basically items should be worth more in therm of usage and value instead of making tons of them and cheapen them like now to balance things a bit and not having only long timers to look at let us make parts of item first a bow has strings to braid glue to make for the laquer wood to polish and bone tips to harden the extremities of the arms so they dont loose the string why not make it that way then assemble and give the item a real value and durability instead of making us do 40 bows also make resources scarcer id also remove the hard spawn points for animals and put a tracking system using the highlighting ability to spot tracks and follow them for a more dynamic hunting experience let us tracks bears and foxes over long distance instead of knowing roughly where to find them it would make the experience more engaging 

we need more events with in game repercutions like diseases for example and new professions something like a medecine maker with herbs a lot of the needed props are already in the game

now as stated the game is still in its infancy a lot will and can change and a lot is place holder so dont take my critique as a negative review i find the game somewhat soothing to play and i see a lot of potential it just isnt all there to make a good game in the current state of things


#####

i have played 83 hours of this game and i have to say it is incredibly intoxicating for those that enjoy craftingsurvivalbasebuilding game genres whoever said this was a grittier animal crossing was insanely accurate i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the genres i mentioned before even though its still in early access the bugs and issues have little to no effect on the gameplay or enjoyment of the game in fact i have to say i havent encountered many bugs myself

what makes this game so captivating is constant and achievable goals the game gives you to move on to the next chapter i find a lot of survival games dont give such a guide while it can be fun to not be guided given this games structure of depending on your dynastys reputation and how heavily its based on really grinding it out it allows you the ability to grind without feeling the frustration of grinding if that makes sense  

the most intriguing thing about this game that i havent encountered much in the games ive played previously is the affectionapproval system that the game uses to recruit villagers and a mate i like it because it lets you know where you stand and how far on track you are this prevents the player from getting discouraged too early on and reduces the frustration level in my opinion also the fact that it requires time thought and patience increases the realism of the game without making it too frustrating the only downside to this is the constant traveling to various towns which is covered in my feedback section below

the biggest feedback for the devs would be

1 faster travel whether its a simple fast travel button or something more realistic like a horse there needs to be some sort of way to travel faster in this game i get that it might need to be earned but ive played 83 hours have a wife and heir and a town of over 14 people and i still have to run everywhere i love that the villages are so spread out  it makes for a more realistic atmosphere but youre telling me that they bread geese but no one has horses 

2 side quests they need to be fleshed and diversified a bit more for my liking they become relatively pointless after reaching a certain level of growth in the game so they need more incentive to complete them im also not sure how i feel about where you fail or succeed being tied to being completed within a given season especially given that some of them require items that can only be found during specific seasons and the side quests are given out randomly

example a side quest could be asking for ripe berries but they request it during a season when berries arent ripein bloom and since you cant store berries without them spoiling you could be set up for failure from the getgo 

this actually has actually discouraged me from completing side quests as of now because the only way to prevent this is by saving before accepting a side quest finding out whether the quest is able to be completed within the time frame and then having to reload a previous save if it cant be its just tiresome especially for such little reward

3 better skill treepoints accumulation this may be different for other players but i found that the ability to gain technologypoints for the skill tree almost too slow it is right on the edge of frustrating for me i dont think it would turn me off of the game but it feels like ive put more into each category than they have rewarded me for i think thats the biggest issue  feeling like ive done an exceptional amount of hunting but not having much technology points to show for it

also the skill tree i have found to be useless overall when i finally do get a skill point most of the categories are just picking the best option out of a bunch of bad ones the only skills ive found to be truly useful are the one that allows me to see wildlife while hunting a bigger weight load and faster wood chopping everything else is relatively pointless in my opinion right now

4 fleshed out npcstowns this is very nitpicky and i dont expect this so early on in development but having npcs traveling between towns having your own villagers be able to sellbarter from your town and also varying the sell prices i dont think fur from a rabbit should sell for the same price as fur from a bear same thing for the meat in terms of realism it took more effort and risk to hunt bears and wolves versus rabbits and foxes that should be rewarded the whole barter system should be looked at once they get a minute to fine polish everything again these are all nitpicky and something id expect in the late stages of development if ever


overall i have enjoyed this game through and through im about to hop on it again right now i truly hope the devs continue to work on this game and continue the updates because the potential is so high because they came out of the gate strong i hope they continue to build on this amazing foundation

edit

please do not write comment unless you read whole review and understand difference on owning rights to a game and being developer to a game



fun game for early access quite impressed on amount of content but still much to polish

why not recommending to buy because i have come to realize toplitz will abandon development of games when they release next early access game leaving people who purchased game with unfinished product and no means to get their money back look for other dynasty games to verify

so do not buy until this has been completed or you end up losing your money and getting unfinished game in return

edit

people have said that this is different because there is different developers

fact is that developers work for toplitz not other way around publisher in this case owns the intellectual propertyfranchise

developers have no say on future of gamefranchise that is not their property and in modern game industry publishers tend to own rights for games and development is bought either from inhouse teams or outsourced cube states on their own website that they are outsourcing team

edit2

it appears people do not understand the idea of outsourcing game development so here is attempt to put it in analogy that should be easy for people to understand

i want to renovate my kitchen i outsource this work to some company i tell what kind of countertops i want i decide what utilities are put and where outsourced kitchen builders then get to work and do what i told them to do while i pay them money i might be unhappy for whatever reason and tell them all to pack their stuff and get out they have to get out because building my kitchen for me in exchange for money gives them zero ownership or control over whole kitchen renovation no matter how much those kitchen builders wanted they have absolutely no business putting a single screw into that kitchen without acceptance of kitchen owner

kitchen is medieval dynasty toplitz is owner of the kitchen and render cube is kitchen building company

#####

its a good game however id like to make a few suggestions

1  stable should be one of the first unlocks in technology
2  food should be more filling a deer is basically a light snack and it really shouldnt be like that
3  bridges would be nice
4  animations theres no swimming animation ive noticed a few other anims being really weird such as the horse animations and the riding ones 
5  dogs and cats pls thx

#####

this game is oddly static for the sort of game it is it can span generations but the small map will never change not a single tree will grow anywhere the devs havent placed one saplings spawn but never become trees if you remove them they respawn back in the exact same spot maybe its to the games credit that it inspires an expectation of realism but then falls short in so many ways

for a game that spans generations it is strange that there is nothing emergent or procedural year to year and so little is even randomized it doesnt necessarily span generations though you can have a wife and a son but thats the extent of the dynasty  your son can have a son and so on but the vast majority of players see the whole game and move on before the first heir reaches adulthood let alone future generations or a whole family tree it doesnt feel like much of a dynasty 

it could more accurately be named medieval homesteader most of the gameplay is survivalcrafting where you get to craft a home for yourself and then homes for the villagers you recruit from neighboring villages you build workshops and chicken coops for them to work at as the game progresses it becomes more about managing the village and less about survival or crafting but theres not that much to that aspect of the game collecting materials and crafting is where almost all the gameplay is its your basic formula of picking up rocks and sticks making the stone axe chopping down the trees eventually mining to make iron tools etc 

combat is minimal but it has a good variety of wildlife hunting and the occasional bandits you never need to defend the village or anything dynamic like that it doesnt even have armor or swords and the like you fight with a bow a cudgel or your gardening tools its a laid back noncombat game for the most part

on a scale of 1 to 10 id give it a 4 just barely a thumbs down it has some enjoyable parts i did find it addictive for a while and put a good amount of time into it i got my moneys worth but it ultimately felt disappointing too many frustrating design decisions

creative control is minimal for a game that doesnt really go anywhere the buildings you place are all prefabs you dont even get to name your character even though the textbased story is basic enough to adlib anything in there and all the assets are already in the game to look like any of the villagers its like a sandbox on strict rails

it does go on and on though if you enjoy the core gameplay you can keep at it for many generations

#####

4 years and 50k gold later my question is what am i missing here i feel like jeff bezos in a world where there are only 711s and a single target to spend my money at by the year 1 mark i had all the best clothing and iron weapons by year 2 id upgraded all my tools to iron and had a thriving mountain settlement going the first couple years i was enthralled with the games atmospherics and building my settlement but once my settlement was basically done i found myself passing the seasons by just to refresh my crops so i could grind my way to a horse im making money handoverfist with bronze knives and boots and healing potions everyones happy theres nothing left to spend my money on besides fast transportation between towns to accomplish the 1off fetch quest for a paltry reward and my child is slowly coming of age

so what now why am i working to make more money when theres nothing to spend it on why not just retire and sit on my porch sipping coffee as the seasons go by at year 5 theres simply not much point to anything aside from longing for a horse and a stable is that it i heard theres 30 years to the game but i cant imagine grinding out 25 more years with basically nothing to show for it other than overflowing coffers and a teenage son

do i recommend this game yes its beautiful runs smooth as butter and finding a spot to build your little hamlet is great fun but pull the plug at about 5 years and go play some darktide instead dynasty feels like a wellpolished proof of concept that could really use a whole lot more content



year 6 update  santa brings me a horse

its nearing the end of year 6 now and ive hit my second wind upon the realization that i could use my fortune to pay for road trips to try and find those golden quests that level my skills farming specifically so i can get a damned horse ive also invested in some overstock of iron tools for myself and the community and moved our family home across the river into a secluded area away from the hubbub of urban life

after reading some about the game im now thinking of expanding into a nearby valley and creating a larger more automated and sustainable farming town to augment my supplies as well as a market district in my main town  however im continually irritated by just how unproductive the npcs are i can craft hundreds of boots in a single day yet a level 6 npc can only make 4 hogwash that system needs to change if im ever to rise above worker status into a community manager role you really have to do everything yourself in medieval times

im super stoked that it appears this winter will be when santa brings me a horse the last major purchase of the game that im aware a representative of the king has made an appearance as of this year giving me even more laborious quests for major reputation im hoping this means new mechanics will slowly trickle into the game over the next 24 years to create some excitement but for now 6 years in and despite my technological advancements im still making most of my money off of boots and bronze knives still the most costefficient until i get the sheeps although bread now thats some nutritious not and lightweight amazingness glad to not be toting around potage anymore

at this point i find myself wishing the game also had the risk of dysentery when drinking from ponds and streams and potions to cure it as well as general nutrition deficiency as a result of eating white bread every day for years on end that cant be good for you my town still mostly consists of insulated stone tiny homes that i created at the start of the game as i dont see the point in upgrading them im still using the same iron tools and weapons that i got around year 2 im still wearing the same clothes that i got around year 2 and there really is no reason to try harder to make more money than boots bronze knives and healing potions can produce it would be great if my npcs could take over this work for me but apparently theyre absolutely terrible at productivity in general so it looks like busy work for the rest of the game

#####

come on co op

#####

if only this game had coop wouldve been a million times better

#####

i loved the game in the beginning because its beautifully detailed andyou get a sense of ownership for your character with the beginning of growing your own village this magic get lost a bit  you find yourself more and more spending a lot of time with finetuning the tasks of your villagers and for your buildings it would be great if i could trust my villagers in their unique trades that they know best what to do and let me know what they would need to perform best if my farmer thinks that it would be best to grow carrots then heshe should just do it at its best will it is just too much fine tuning and i cant enjoy the magic of this game anymore thats why i sadly stopped playing i hope to see some more intelligence and better  automatisations in the future to get the fun back even in the later game with your own viallge

#####

its a fun game needs some major rebalancing your primary resource is wood you use it for everything from houses to tools and weapons thing is when you cut a tree down you get between 2 and 4 logs per visuals these logs are about 12 ft long  you can build the frame of a house with just 6 of these logs yet those same 6 logs can only make 6 spears or 6 hammers  same goes for things like hunting where a rabbit will get you 2x meat but a deer or a boar will get you only 6x meat  there are some other small things like the cost of things purchased from vendors but it is still an early access game and things could change hopefully they either make the updates or open up to mods to fix some of these albeit minor annoyances

edit post 10 release update

the devs are really responsive to players suggestions many of the minor concerns i had with this game have been addressed either in game or via settings for the 10 release most buildings can now be built into slight hill sides which makes the map more useable you can now boost the rate at which xp tech etc are gained which is nice for certain play styles resource rates are still fixed but the devs have more in the works and i am excited to keep playing and seeing whats in store 

still going with two big green thumbs up

#####

this game is both very relaxing and extremely frustrating

the rate of technology gain is pretty slow and youll spend tons of time walking your wares too and from town do yourself a favor and build near an existing town or youll spend all your time travelling 

i was pleased when the game began and slowly started to grow my community making sure that i set up worker automation as best as possible the problems begin with work assignment in games like banished you can set work thresholds and when a worker satisfies a task or has no materials for it they move onto the next task not the case here if a worker cannot proceed with one of their assigned productions due to lack of materials they stop working completely ive also found that to keep up with the demand of dependent jobs and the materials they need you can really only assign one type of production per worker at a time and the rest youll end up doing manually yourself be ready to jump in and fill the gaps where your production cant keep up 

dealing with farming is a whole other mess you have to manually manage each field in each season its best to let your barn workers just make fertilizer daub and animal feed dont have them thresh grain or anything if youre hoping to save some for the next harvest without having to keep it in a separate storage if i have 140 wheat stalks id like to be able to tell my barn workers to thresh it all and then mill x amount into flour leaving enough for the next planting season

quests i really didnt want to be bothered with them honestly i want to run my town and my farms and be left alone but quests are basically required to grow your town you will have to undertake either story or side quests to increase your reputation because after a while people will refuse to join your town until you have enough reputation points the story quests will have you running all over hell and creation and remember no fast travel and no rideable animals or vehicles of any kind until much later in the game so be prepared to walk and to fight wolves robbers and the occasional angry boar will chase you down as you attempt to make your way across the entire map just to go talk to somebody to move the story along or to buy a pig

be prepared to spend lots of time just walking

i enjoy this game but lord does it annoy me im not sure id buy it again knowing what i know now and i think ill go back to playing banished instead

#####

overall fun mostly chill game if youre in the mood for a singleplayer buildersurvival type

good 
 building system is decent
 hunting is fun
 resourcetown management has a lot of potential but could use a bit of refinement eg stop working at this amount automatically sell everything over this amount automation by season would be nice to cut down micro

bad
 humananimal npcs tend to float or fly when moving
 midgame progression feels really slow unless you do quests
 villager skill leveling needs a bit of work lvl 23 takes significantly longer than 34

i had a really good time with this one but found myself getting bored on the road to the t3 crafting buildings so im shelving it before it starts to feel like a slog may eventually come back to it once more updates are released but for now id call it a solid good game


#####

this game is excellent some quick tips for new players

1 money doesnt grow on trees it grows in berry bushes  pick berries when theyre in season stupid asshole vendors will buy them for 1 silver a berry

2 carry a big stick i was in a big hurry to make a bow until i realized that bows and arrows hit for shit in this game make spears and remember that you can throw them

3 wolves only attack in 2d  wolves ganked my ass a lot when i started until i learned that those dumb bitches completely forget about you if you stand on top of a fence so if youre chased by wolves find a fence on any path or village jump on top of it and laugh at those fucking fur babies before you spear them to death another good reason to use spears

4 no need to live in the ghetto any longer than you have to as you build in building mode with your hammer youll see a prompt to edit the wallstructure youre building and can eventually use this option to make walls out of stone instead of sticks just like the three little pigs

5 there are tons of resources online with tips about making money i make and sell a metric fuckton of iron arrows and steal crops from other villages because fuck other villages recruiting new villagers and flirting with romantic partners generally dont be a douche  look these up before you get started

overall this game is a lot of fun and i didnt really expect it to be the devs are making great progress and im genuinely excited to see what they do with it in the future

#####

i l o v e this game  few things that i would love to see in the next update
 mod support
 fixed bugs
 more bandits in the world i want them to harass my village time to time
 new and bigger maps
 option for female character in single player for my wife
 to be able to sleep in the same house and marry coop player my wife

#####

i have to say i have enjoyed every minute i have spent on this game  the way this game works is very unique beautiful graphics was what first drew me in but the game play is very enjoyable too 
i enjoy delegating tasks to villagers and building my little kingdom 
i guess the only thing i wish was available was character customisation or at least a female character for me to play as

#####

good overall city builder more like a small town  if you like resource gathering and building your own little hamlet in an old world setting then this is right up your ally cheers and i hope you enjoy

#####

an amazing sandbox to chill build your settlement and get incredible lag from torches
lovely reminder that you neednt rush if you do things become repetitive relax take your time once you established your footing you have 18 ingame years to raise your son anyway you have nothing to rush for really well maybe the only thing to rush for is getting a firstborn so that 18 year countdown would start early but thats about it 
also i love that the game doesnt take itself too seriously and can poke a bit of fun at game limitations in its quests its a nice touch i knew my son was truly mine  aka pure of heart and dumb of ass  when he tried to romance a woman who was older than his mother at the tender age of 2 that made me laugh not gonna lie also watching him play with the toys i brought him was heartwarming 

pros
 nice setting
 nice dialogues
 very pretty with weather and season changes
 crafting and building can be sped up helps when you have to constantly go get tea when you dry your 1000 meat pieces overnight
 big diversity of farm animals i love building farms
 quite a lot of wildlife and vistas
 offers a lot of things to do

cons
 can become repetitive especially if you concentrate on farming duh but still
 no way of skipping skinning animation once its started even if youre mauled to death
 economy can be very weird
 torches both stationary and handheld cause an absurd amount of lag like not being able to walk or turn your camera amount of lag

#####

  5 out of 5 stars

i played medieval dynasty way back when it was in ea and it was a great game then but man the devs really worked to make this game even better and more rich and it really shows

you can see by my hours 658 that ive played this game a ton my heir has an heir now lol this game is a lot of fun and almost plays like a medieval version of the sims theyve added a ton of content since i first played including new buildings orchards and more personality and quests for your wife and child theres a level cap for how many buildings you can have but you can customize it in the settings though they warn you it will eventually affect performance if it goes too high i have a population of 172 and something like 98 buildings and it has started to affect the performance but it was easily fixed by turning my graphics down from ultra

unfortunately after so many years i think im on year 24 you do run out of things to do my village is selfsufficient now so i started a second village and then ran out of things to do there honestly if you take it very slow you could potentially just keep the same dynasty going for as long as you want which is great for people who like to replay games

my only complaint was that i didnt know npcs in other towns just died with no warning _ i got quite attached to an old lady named gryzelda in a neighboring town and once she turned 80 years old she and her family were gone and were replaced by berta and her stupid looking son berta even her name makes me angry how dare she think she can take gryzeldas place

sorry got sidetracked

anyway highly recommend especially if youre a fan of medieval games or women named gryzelda

#####

a mix of kingdom come deliverance banished and the guild ii renaissance this early access game already has a lot going for it immersion rpg flair fun village building stat management crafting family building etc etc and the developers keep adding new features on a regular basis horses are coming next meaning that the game still has a lot of replayability coming up definitely recommending this one

#####

its a decent survival crafting game thats sadly let down by the one thing that sets it apart  the settlement management the jobs your villagers perform are controlled by assigning the amount of time the workers in a given building will devote to specific tasks the workworker could spend 50 gathering logs 5 gathering sticks 20 turning logs into planks and 25 turning logs into firewood or any balance you feel is appropriate which works ok  you can set it and only need to adjust it if you foresee a need increasing its all done by assigning percentages through singlepoint increases and decreases its needlessly fiddly

once you get to more complex buildings like the herbalist hut and the barn things need more frequent adjustment the herbalist hut gathers herbs and mushrooms and creates potions different materials are available in different seasons and any time assigned to a job that isnt possible is wasted so each season you need to readjust the herbalist hut to change what its collecting unless youre happy with half of their time spent trying to collect things with no result

the barn requires idailyi adjustments as resources are harvested and dwindle and theres no simple way to convert fieldworkers to barnworkers and back as the balance of labour changes  because the barn has two different jobs associated with it and a worker cant be reassigned to the same building theyre currently assigned to you have to assign them out of their job which hurts their mood and then back into the new role and then again when you need them to switch to field work again

once youve got them reassigned you need to go back into the pointbypoint percentage system to stop them turning rye into grain and start working with oats and poppies instead while still turning manure into fertiliser and grain into animal feed moving points back and forth from each of the products the barn produces and then changing them again the next day so all your grain isnt used up in the animal feed leaving some to replant next season

there are no priorities no thresholds no perseason lists the process becomes tedious and tiresome getting in the way of the fun part of the game when the tedium comes from the one thing that sets the game apart from other survival games youre better off playing something without it

#####

this is the game ive wanted to play since i was a young teen every other medieval rpg has tried to squeeze me into some epic fighting story that involves battles and all i wanted to do was fish cook mine and become a part of the world the game is truly a masterpiece so relaxing definitely worth

strongly recommended

1010

#####

it would be nice to play as a female or even have a daughter

#####

ive never really reviewed a game before but i will say that as a mid30s full time working mom this game is super relaxing to play and fulfills all of my worldbuilding fantasies there are of course a few things that i wished were included i would love to be able to mark on my map where certain things are example berry bushes i want to be able to put a dot on the map and enter berry bush or whatever so i can refer back to it during the summer when i want to gather this is a feature that is in the game valheim that i have come to love i would also like the ability to either hold down the e button and collect items without having to tap it repeatedly or hold down like shifte and collect large groups of items within a certain range at one time the tapping of e repeatedly to pick berriedreedsrockssticks etc is exhausting and can interfere with my willwant to play because its so much time just hitting the e button lastly i will ask for multiplayer as lots of people probably have my husband and i like to game together in the evenings and he is usually my woodstone collecter valheim stardew valley so i can have adventures we like multiplayer please give us multiplayer so we can build a town together or build our own towns on the same map other than that im really enjoying this game and like to restart with each update looking forward to more being added

#####

finally i been looking for this kind of games in many years d

i love simulator especially builder kind of games and i also love medieval era medieval dynasty got everything that i need and what i always want to see in one game i couldnt be happier really a wonderful and promising early access game

bbeautiful and fun simple yet still much more to be learn in early access but full with content and look promising with it existing content already a perfect mix of simulation colony builder survival and rpg overall a wonderful experience i highly recommend it to anyone who interesting in these kind of game b

ibhere are what i love and what i kind of dislike that i gathering or experience it so far

love 

 you can build your own settlement from huts to fence brick by brick although we only use wood and stone here p invite other folks to join and become your townfolk assign them to helping and doing activities around your town such as farming go hunting and running your workshop 

 family you need to find your character a wife or find a wife for yourself i dont know i dont judge p this system is similar with a game like the guild as your character do age and get old so you need a heir that would continue your dynasty they can also helping you around the house cooking and tend to your wound 
 
 fun simulation and survival building farming hunting or go vegan friendly gathering wild mushroom berry and wild vegetable is work as well p crafting trading taking care of your animals taking care of your reputation most of all taking care of yourself build your skill and talking with townfolk around the map to improve relationship it is fun to be playing 

 beautiful world for you to explore a wonderful landscape that look peaceful and realistic season changing rabbit running around deer drinking water wolf howling and hunting in the night livestock animals walking around the town people tend to the farm and so on enjoyable medieval sight to be see 

 frequent updating a lot of new content from the day that the game have been release and dev really put an effort to each new update 

dislike for me 

 big learning curve what am i suppose to do next where do i find this and that it quite difficult in the first time for me and it feel like the game want you to discovery things on your own but i believe many people wont have this problem however it would be better if the game would explain it more and have some sort of helptips that can be access later  

 time and season it not that bad but it seem so fast i go hunting and gathering for a few thing in just about a short walk away from home and it already evening when i return also wishing the season to be longer than just a few days this have been updated you can now set your own season day in the game  

 hunting it difficult for me i sneak in throw my spear and running around try to chasing some deer silly me cant do it right and the whole day ingame i just manage to hunt two deer xd but that is not the worse of it some building and set of skill require you to go hunting eventhough you dont like it 

 most townfolks just walking around and siting still in the tavern or fire pit around the map however i understand that this is early access but it would be better if they would chatting eating or drinking too p it have been updated now they can talk to each other b

some game breaking bug that i have found and some funny glitch but this is early access game and dev always put out the hotfix it really not that bad a perfect early access game with some content that still in working progress if you love medieval and love a game like stronghold banished the guild series and want to see or play it from different perspective medieval dynasty could be the game that you been looking for d

only 30 minute in and i got hook up pretty quickly there are so many things to do and learn yet it doesnt feel force but rather reward your progression of your fun time it become one of my favorite game over in just a few hour i love it 

#####

the best way to describe it is an open world walking simulator with maybe one very simplistic mechanic thrown in  some of what seems like should be core concepts to game play just arent there

where to begin
survival  yes you need to eat and drink and stay warm but again the game fails on several levels  there are food recipes to be crafted but it doesnt matter what your character eats  theres no reason to ever go beyond roasted meat  this is the basic food staple and can be gotten in limitless quantities  you will never go hungry  drinking boils down to standing in a pond or next to a well and holding a button  water is never more than a 30 second run away and no need to boil or purify  staying warm involves getting 2 or 3 pieces of clothing to put on in winter  again done poorly  the player can craft various pieces of clothing after unlocking the recipes for money but theres absolutely no reason to  you can buy those few pieces of clothing from a vendor from day one and they never wear out  you also dont need to cover every body part  i could wear a quilted doublet hat and gloves and go naked from the waist down with absolutely no effect

there is combat but it involves only 4 hostile life formsbears wolves boars and bandits  all can be outrun by the player or simply avoided so theres no need to ever fight  id say thats a goood thing because there are no armor or swords in the game but thats not necessary either because you can defeat all of those with a woodchopping axe or basic bow and stone arrows from day one  there are no combat skills that make you tougher over time  the bandits are standing along the road do not raid your village or preset any sort of mechanic that would have you thinking of defending your village
the player can gain experience and unlock crafting recipes for tools and weapons which only include woodchopping axes bows cudgel club and spear  again none of this is necessary  there are wrecked wagons along every roadside and within the bandit camps where top teir bows axes etc can be picked up  they respawn every season so im still using the same bow i picked up in the beginning and have a chest full of them at my house yet to be used

village mechanics  again sooo disappointing  so if youre reading this and dont know what the game is about the core activity is to build a village and recruit villagers to join you  theres no reason to ever do this in the game but frankly if you didnt there wouldnt even be a game to play here so im assuming the player will choose to do so
villagers are recruited from a pool of 2 or 3 npcs that sit around a camp fire in neighboring villages  you simply walk up to them and ask them to join you and they always do no quest or convincing needed  villagers have 6 starting skills that range from level 1 to level 3  this skill is simply a modifier to be used in an equation to be discussed later
once recruited and in your town the villagers are completely empty shells programmed to mill around their behavior is limited to moving from their houses in the morning milling around for about an ingame hour and then moving to their work location where they statically animate for 8 or 10 ingame hours and then return to their houses  
your village will be composed of houses two types of storage buildings and various production buildings  the house is simply used to determine your villager capacity each villager needs a house to live in  the storage buildings are used for input and output locations for production and the production buildings are for production  the storage buildings are simply points where the player acceses the inventory 
lets go back to where i said the villagers are empty shells  one would think that you might want to put your food storage building near your kitchens so your workers dont have to travel so far  youd be wrong  as your villagers animate in their work locations inputs to the process are simply deducted from storage and finish products are added back  so a villager and their skills really end up boiling down to a coefficient in an equation where one commodity is decremented and another in incremented  thats itthe whole game in one sentence your villagers have a mood score which is probably just another coefficient for the coefficient  i also have not found anything that influences this other than builing them an insulated stone house
you have to provide food for your villagers which involves dumping calories into the food storage building where it is decremented at intervals based on how many mouths you have to feed  the villagers suffer no damage from wild animals do not require warm clothing in winter do not care what food you give them to eat  all of this renders advanced cooking recipes the need for weapons and clothing completely pointless which means theres no reason to build a sewing hut or smithy
the herbalist hut is used to gather herbs which just appear in your storage if you have a villager assigned to make potions but is completely pointless since there is virtually no combat  
there are no npcs in the world aside from the static bandits and the other empty shells that walk around the neighboring villages for show or to sell goods  therefore theres no reason to consider village placement aside from being close to a cave to mine materials which you dont need see below or a village to sell stuff  no traveling caravans wandering brigands people to talk to
the game only perfroms changes at the end of each season  there is a food rotting mechanic but it is so basic that its almost nonsensical  the state of food is only updated at the end if the season and the quality is reduced by a certain amount depending on where its stored  vendors have limited coin and inventory is static  until season change where their inventory and money is reset  resources in the world also respawn pretty much every season

to sum up
weapontool crafting skillssmithy unnecessary theres nothing to fight and your villagers dont need weapons  your wooden hoe made from sticks will work just as good as the iron one
potion craftingherbalist hut unnecessary theres nothing to fight and your villagers dont use potions
clothing craftingsewing hut unnecessary you can buy the 2 pieces of clothes you will need for the whole game your villagers dont need clothes and you wont need to make a bow string
workshoprecipes completely unnecessary unless you want to make wooded bowls or plates for advanced food recipes but
food recipeskitchens unnecessary since your villagers are happy eating dried meat from the hunting shack  
hunting shack onl needed if you dont feel like hunting for meat but this is really the only thing to do in the game  fun for 5 minutes  should i mention that you dont need to feed villagers if you dont have any and why would you need any if you dont need any of the production buildings
fishing shack totally unnecessary since your villagers love that dried meat
animal husbandry  only needed if you want eggs for advanced recipes manure to make field fertilizer to make vegetables wool to make cloth  see above for the need to make anything other than dried meat for those unclothed robot coefficients

  a few game years in and gameplay has completely devolved into taking whatever goods ive made around to the villages to take whatever coin the vendors have before they refill their coffers next season  now what to do with all that coin

as of this writing i have 88 hours into this game  why  because i continued playing with the childlike expectation that there was something more here if i just kept progressing  what a disappointment  the addition of some simple mechanics could make this game into something more than the empty husk it is presently

#####

as a new mother it has been hard getting back into gaming which was previously one of my favorite hobbies and ways to relieve stress from tough days i reluctantly bought medieval dynasty on sale after it sat on my wish list for months and have never found so much enjoyment in a game it ties in everything i love in gaming survival skill building town building hunting foraging farming the list goes on but what i was most surprised about is that the game is so strongly about family 

you get married have a child build them a nice home thats warm in the winter make sure they are happy and fed find them some friends to join your town etc its so heartwarming and feels rewarding 

i am happy to say that ive been able to rekindle my joy of playing video games through finding one of the most unique family oriented and relaxing games ive ever played 

thank you devs cant wait for coop soon so i can play with my husband and friends

#####

so heres the thing the game plays ok but not great the inventory systems and such are just cloned directly from kingdom come so thats nice the combat is shit friendly npc behavior isnt much better its a village simulator with a village full of idiots theres something wrong where they dont even seem to work especially like the fields if you arent standing next to them apparently they dont actually work if they arent in render distanceso you have to either do those tasks for them or stand there and lean against a shovel while they do it as far as collecting items and building things go congrats its a pretty standard survival crafting game where surviving isnt really a challenge in any way 

but this is the 3rd dynasty title that these guys have released in the last year they have 2 others in early access and they have two more dynasty titles under development that they are expected to drop into ea anytime now when you look at the publishers list of games its a bunch of obvious rip offs look at the artwork for ghost platoon and tell me that isnt ghost recon they even have a clone of football manager 

so while i want to say yeah this is an ok game or i could see where its going to be once development is finishedjust absolutely nothing that toplitz has done would lead me to believe that they are going to follow through 

knowing what i know now i certainly would of avoided buying this in ea and i recommend that everyone else do the same if they want to be trusted they can finish the game then release it and maybe people will buy the finished product no more abandoned ea titles and blatant rip offs

#####

add coop faster

#####

are you in your midthirties wishing to create a homestead irl but stuck working a stressful job unwind with a self paced chill game with soothing sounds feeling bored just cutting down trees try killing a bear  find adventure or just craft whatever you want  adjustable sliders for game play adds to the choose your pace vibe 

worried still in development continues to improve with updates it seems like every gripe i have gets adjusted no hard crashes


#####

mixed review after 113 hrs of recent game play

this game is currently more aptly titled the peasant ambitions of a medieval handyman and not worthy of the lofty and grand title it current carries of medieval dynasty  that title would inspire one to actually buy and try the game thinking you are hacking out your kingdom title an eventually crown and defending it from various survival elements one would encounter in the middle ages

but no all youre doing is building and building and building your village in a first person view against a middle ages backdrop in a bureaucratic management vicious production cycle just to make money  and to what end do you need to make money   to pay your taxes on the village you created and thats it game over

because theres no raiding of npcs on your village no outlaws to quell no fear of your town burning and losing resources from the real survival elements of the middle ages then theres no gamedesigned reason to really arm yourselfvillagers hence theres no higher arms beyond a bow and axe no armor only clothing or anything military related to contend with its not apart of the game  youre only using tools and hunting weapons to hunt the various animals and kill the occasional bandit that rarely spawns  your progression through copper to bronze to eventually iron technology isnt to make weapons sword please or armor to better fend of invaders like any sane person would expect no its just to make more durable tools so you can keep on building producing selling just to pay taxes what as a peasant

so in this regard the game really falls short and is a huge disappointment because it lacks the big medieval life ingredient and is just another buildityourself dyi game seriously you have to swing your own hammer ever single time you have an entire village of npcs working for you in various production shops but you can not assign anyone as a builder to help you build or repair anything what  so again youre a handyman commoner trying to pay your taxes with some extravagant backstory of undercovering the silly life of your uncle you idolize  congrats enjoy and good luck

things that would help immensely for the entertainment value

 allow villagers to be assigned as builders to automate building structures
 enable bandit raids on your town
 inject quests involving clearing out outlawbandit hideouts
 actually have a point to mining iron implement crafting swordsarmor etc to equip and to pay as tribute to the king against storyarc relating to the kingdom at war or some such  
 lower the entry point for getting a horse grinding through animal husbandry for horse transportation is really high at the moment set in late game
 split mines into mining i for copperbronze anything the player can swing a pickaxe at should be able to be automated with the villagers and mining ii for iron its ridiculous i can mine coppertin to make tin after a couple years using the smithy shop but i cant automate it until the only mine in the game is unlocked which then allows access to iron later game
 have a point to clothing theres no point to crafting clothes because holding a torch through the winter keeps me warm you can sell cloths but the supply chainproduction involved is immense from farming flaxwool to spinning thread etc  if its just coin ones after theres easier ways to make it
 theres no illness in this game despite that being a chronic part of medieval life  you can get poisoned but the remedy in herbs is littered all over the map like grass so you immediately can cure yourself
 theres no point to the herbalist shop or any of its potions
 change the games story to something more inspiring like ragtoriches where you as a commoner strove to become a knight for the kingso armsarmor etc was actually required to be produced and the end game involved providing annual armsarmor tribute to the kings army

the game was enjoyable early on in trying to survive get established and make money but once your village gets going it gets tedious fast  im not sure i can stomach playing late game or beyond my life because the game continues under your heirs after your main character dies because theres little point to just manage a town to make money to pay taxes over and over each year

#####

beautiful game and a massive amount of promise its like a mix of banished with a first person survival game only a few minor bugs so far but generally pretty smooth launch for an ea game 

unfortunately this one needs to bake in the oven a bit more before i play again the main issue is the day  season time 

everything feels rushed and is about 3 times faster than it should be how fast food decreases how fast time goes and the seasons only last 3 days it seriously feels like the developers sped up the game speed to test the seasons and then forgot to turn it off i started the game explored the village and then started looking around for a spot to start my village before i could even do any real scouting the first day was over so 13 of the spring season was gone and i wasnt even sure where i wanted to live so i sprinted around the 2nd day until i found a flat part and built like a mad person barely got my house built on day 2 and then was planting crops on day 3 in the dark before it turned into summer since some crops can only be planted in the spring just way way too rushed 

it also suffers from the balance issues that a lot of other survival games like this have where they make it artificially hard by making food worth hardly any nurtional value for example you can kill a big buck and youll get 3 or 4 meat when you cook that meat each piece will be worth 5 or 6 food out of 100 so an entire stinking deer barely even registers as a snack 

overall though i can deal with the minor bugs and the other balancing issues but the speed demon day  seasons timers are just a deal breaker its not fun and i honestly truly cannot comprehend how the developers thought that was a good idea

great potential will be keeping it on my hard drive to try again later but for now i cant recommend it

#####

dear reader

it has been 2 days since i arrived and i finally have some food hunting rabbits with a spear who thought this could be so fun 5 for 5 no misses but then i had to fight a wolf i was within a inch of my life hoping the spear would not break

who counts the days i dont anymore

 i found the perfect piece of land while healing my wounds and replacing my spear i carefully planted a rabbit trap while i set off to the nearest village to try my luck with the town i had a little money and needed to purchase some food no one had any food bummer so i hunted a deer 

next i upset a handful of ladies bunch of gold diggers telling me i not famous enough for them to visit my home i needed help on the land i headed back to my future farm and i built my small home in the north across the river just near some loners place close to the wolf i had fought there would be no more sleeping under the night sky collecting st johns wort to fight the infection from a mushroom i ate the deer was not enough 

during the next days i would be the greatest hunter around i woke to enjoy the view of the river from my porch with the mushroom forest behind my house in the spring before setting out to hunt and pick before heading to the river to collect water 

then one day i decided to become the lands greatest lumberjack but then i was a very upset lumberjack i took a contract that would send me to the furthest west i had ever been if you are reading this you must be in the west

i told him he would not have to wait i refused to go home till the job was done thats just who i am shouldnt take but a day at this pace 

a man back home warned me to prepare he knew i would be far from home i figured i would just hunt but then the foxes got scarce at nightfall and i need to find water 

i rushed this trip why did i not bring more rabbit meat why was food out of stock i find myself asking these questions while im lost in the dark a long way from home where is my fire i am so thirsty i dont think i will survive the night be safe reader may you find yourself able to survive in these lands  


very relaxing survival game i got gifted by a friend thank you 

i hope the developers continue to support this game and improve it i think the world is nice to look at  

i encounter only one npc bug so far in 7 hours where a lady was walking on a guys head i unfortunately ignored it to chop down forty trees i did not consider it game breaking just funny

#####

i like this game anyway i suggest devloper to add horse or any kind of transportation system  it would be great for traveling

what i realize in my gaming life is how much i enjoy longterm games with a relaxing ambience and settings that are absolutely chill

i also enjoy that primitive feeling of building something from scratch in the vein of rimworld during the pandemic i found my visits to steam have been more frequent with their epic summer sale im taking a closer look at medieval dynasty that is 20 off

still in early access i think its fleshed out enough to play in late 2021 its a town building survival role play game set in an open world in medieval europe and has evolved well in early access its a roleplaying family simulator too in a way the satisfaction of having to build something long term really is appealing where our attention in games can change on a weekly basis

the game is immersive and thats in part due to its ambience patient growth curve and the fact that you are building a town from the ground up because the game is roleplaying and town building in equal parts the appeal is not just with a single character though you do play in the first person the endgame content will improve dramatically in 2022 this is because the game has been more popular than the developers expected

medieval dynasty has a beautiful open world filled with dense forests dangerous wildlife and large bodies of water its really about the journey and not necessarily about what the game lacks having something to work towards this has elements of beginnings that rimworld lacks people say its like kingdom come deliverance and i can see how they make that comparison

for me its a bit like the guild meets rimworld its a peasant simulator in a beautiful relaxing world with a good balance of things to do seasons to behold and people to protect

this is not a twitch game it is not a fps or any kind of fast paced immediate satisfaction type of game play  you have to put a little work into it to obtain what you want but the end result is incredibly satisfying this is a mature gamers game its a builders delight game and for the price to hour ratio i think it has a very good roi and replayability key point many of the reviewers on steam have absurd amounts of time in game and thats what you want to see from game reviews

this is all about progressing through the medieval setting and building a town family and finding how to balance economy and nature you take on the role of a disposessed medieval peasant but the world is stacked in your favor this isnt really a survival game its not brutal its farming and crafting friendly for an early access game its been very popular this studio is really serious it seems about making this game a true gem

check out the graphics here on max settings its really quite pretty the studio has found the right formula for this building genre think about their history the production team has taken the best that farmers and lumberjacks dynasty gaming could achieve and merged them into a whole new medieval dynasty concept the medieval setting really is quite appealing in an age where we are overflooding with technology silos and isolation irl

in an era of valheim bannerlord rimworld and others the bar has been raised with that feeling of medieval glory and it has many forms that skyrim openworld feeling and the sense of building a longlasting dynasty is appealing for many reasons while so many medieval games focus on conflict here you feel a bit more nature immersion seasonal variations and the sense that crafting building and growing over the years is important for that reason i consider this game an important innovation for chill gamers like myself

start a dynasty for the journey gaming is the ultimate simulator as we mature we want games that are less about conflict and more about things like family and growing a town that feels genuine to us because we put in the work in a landscape thats plentiful 1010 perfect for city builders gamers like me

no monsters zombies or armies attacking you there are bandits but they keep their distance from your settlement just a chill game to occupy you for as many hours as you want to put into it

the game has been totally engaging for an extended period  i played using firstperson perspective they just added thirdperson and that alone distinguishes it from a raft of other  survival strategy citybuilder games  but it meant i really felt the crunch as it neared midnight and the season change and i was in the moonlight trying to get the last of the crop in the ground  

it has an rpg element too as you get perks in six skill areas as you progress  your inhabitants individually level up too  i spent a lot of time getting each inhabitant better in certain areas and then matching complementary couples because their offspring have an average of each of their parents six skillsets  i figured i never knew how long i would play but i should always take the long view

one reviewer panned the inhabitants because of their limited responses  while its true they arent very chatty hallelujah i had my goto berry picker my crack lumberjack a seller who could push large amounts of anything out the door at the stalls my allstar utility players  in short i oversaw the development of every one of my 50 or so citizens and was very familiar with the capabilities of each  it was my enjoyment of settlementbuilding in fallout 4 that got me interested in the added complexities of this game and this game did not disappoint  

much of the information out there on how to accomplish things in the game is shockingly wrong i think because so much apparently has changed from early access  getting a wife is seemingly much simpler now and the map is even different  so if a post or review is dated before late september view it with some suspicion 

medieval dynasty does a lot of little things right  there is an elegance to picking reeds for straw or blueberries because they are clumped together and the game gives you a big hitbox  i like how you can hotkey a water bucket or waterskin and then fill up every bucket in your inventory without going back into the inventory each time  the graphics are gorgeous  if you die in winter at least you will be in beautiful surroundings  

you can customize many things among them the number of days in a season default is three i picked four and am happy i did whether you want to meet bandits on your travels and eliminating the repetitive animations i didnt mind it in the early and midgame but the repetition got old in the late game  you can change the setting anytime

and the quest where your heir asks to accompany you on a hunt was a nice touch   i understand the dev will be increasing the interaction with the heir according to the roadmap which would be good actually enabling the option  of a female protagonist and a female heir or an it doesnt matter option would be the best thing the dev could do  my daughters are attracted to games with the option of a female protagonist as might be many females perhaps particularly in this genre  and give the player the option of whether the wife or husband stays home to take care of the child let the player switch the roles as often as the player wants  

there are no waypoints  felt as if i was in fallout 4 in survival mode  you have to hoof it everywhere and hornica down in the se corner never got any closer  got a horse as soon as possible and that is of course recommended but the riding mechanic is less than ideal  i get that they are trying to emulate pulling the reins to the left or right by pressing a or d on the keyboard but it is clumsy  so many games  the witcher skyrim come to mind  do it better using the mouse and reticule to aim the horse  those are what i consider the worst points yet some might argue that they add to the immersiveness  in the end i still give it a 1010

getting all the steam achievements is a bear as indicated by the fact that eleven of them have been completed by 6 thats pointsix not six percent or fewer  heck getting any achievement is apparently too imposing building your house is probably one of the first things you will do and it is the most common achievement  by only 351 percent  i have to believe that that number is a bit puzzling and can be expected to rise significantly now that the dev has placed hammers on the craft anywhere menu 

speaking of puzzling giving a gift to your wife each season for two years is an achievement only completed by pointtwo percent of players but you just ask anyone literally anyone you see where the special trader is each season and buy a little something stock up if you can afford it  as grinds go this is a one on a ten scale

but its true that the game does not do much handholding  i had watched enough youtube videos ahead of time and my wonderful wifes reading and research were of great help throughout when overloaded and walking in slomo by pressing the w key press the up arrow as well and your speed will double so i perhaps did not find it as imposing as some might have  

the end game such as it is involves living until your son is 18 and able to take over when you die  here is where i might have made a mistake choosing four days instead of three per season  but i established my own end game as accumulating one million coins in as short a time as possible  it was quite satisfying to get my hunters farmers cooks seamsters and stallholders all working together to maximize income  for me thousands of stone knives in the early game and then flax seed and cherry wine were the bigticket items but your mileage might differ

would i buy it again  in a heartbeat  should you buy it  if anything i described above resonated with you then you might give it a try  there is a great deal to like about the game  good luck in getting your house built

#####

i already loved this game but i wanted to drop some input about the new coop mode which i play only single player

wow they were working on this one a long time and from the looks of it they were working on it every minute of that time which i hope isnt true its almost like medieval dynasty 2 theyve added so much everything is a lot more beautiful and immersive its really a huge upgrade not to mention a whole new map im really just amazed at how much went into it vs how much effort most companies will put into a full expansion and happily charge you 45 bucks for 

an already great game made so much greater it nearly feels like an entirely new one im gonna buy a soundtrack ill never listen to or some other thing i dont need just because theyve earned it

#####

after 548 hours of play i must say this is absolutely the best computer game of the hundreds ive played over 30 years of gaming  requires and rewards careful planning resource allocation and population maintenance  the depth of play is incredible  oh and theres also something for the folks who like to shoot things like hunting and running into the occasional bandits

#####

the game is well done and feels full but i want to point out that this is primarily a town management game not a survival game dont purchase this game if you want to do medieval survival

#####

below is a review of the game from along time ago they have listened to us and or complaints of an unnecessary grind now they added plenty of new content and added a adjustable bar that increaases how much your skills level up which in my opinion means a great deal to me because at the time i was among the first to bring it up on this platform and i thank the developers for hearing our concerns if they are reading this you have my utmost respect and i highly reccomend this as a game to relax to i look forward to any future content releases  


old review as referenced abovei absolutely love this game and its a shame i have to write this  but i feel it is necessary in hopes the developers will fix it the question is what is so bad if someone who loves a game absolutely hates it mechanics and the mechanic in question is technology technology is broken up into 4 separate categories buildingfarminghunting and most importantly craftingyou level up these techs as you play craft and build your home from nothing as the game states at the start you level up quickly and it sets a illusion that it is not to bad then you play for a few hours and some more and you realize you are progressing at a snails pace at the time of this writing an 14 hours in i only have 550 building tech 240 hunting 50 farming and 145 crafting each out of ten thousand points to max even as i used every tactic i could think of event becoming a bucket farmer to level up quickly at 10 crafting tech per bucket which means i would have to craft 100000 buckets which is 700 hours just crafting yes 700 hours before you can unlock alcohol and i dread to think about all the other techs but a rough est to get everything max would be 1500 hours please fix this grind it is such a buzzkill btw my numbers may not be entirely accurate but it would still take a ludicrous amount of time to max

this is one of those games we have been waiting a long time for a dynamic medieval life sim  guild 2 was close saelic is getting there banishedforest village tried kingdoms has been trying hard to get there and kingdom come almost got it with their dlcs medieval dynasty is starting out ahead of them all

there are some janky bugs people lying flat floating across the ground fixed quests do not complete fixed animals fall out of the sky crops being harvested in fall that i didnt harvest and didnt get the materials forfixed and other funky nongame breaking bugs 

farming i was able to get a small bag and tried to spread manure which there is an option to do when right clicking however a regular bag is required nevermind this doesnt work either  fixed i wasted a lot of expensive materials in early game trying to figure that out and arbitrary limits to placing items i can only build one trap

building and crafting items are also locked behind long lines of points that you really dont have a lot of control over just have to wait a very long time to unlock what you need after a seemingly random list of technology want to build a cow pasture  unlock barns then hen house pig pens goose house food storages sheep farms then when you hit 5000 points you can make a cow farm  not done yet though you have to purchase schemes to be able to use the tech oh and building limits really how about the exponential taxes and decay are the limit

settlements are amazing after 20h of trying to farm hunt and scavange to see my peasants do it for me is very rewarding i like to just stand there and watch them work its very easy to manage them and they have skills for each type of work it is very well thought out still dont like the building limits though they are tied to dynasty points some of my peasants got married and had kids

skills on the other hand are a bit better thought out and there is more control with the literal skills tree most of which just decrease crafting times 10 or increase the rate of skill points 1 so not too exciting 

interacting with npcs is very mechanical when you enter a village everyone gets into place like the truman show ok everyone the player is coming everyone get into your places and they mosey over to the fields and stand in front of their houses trying to get someone to like you is like rolling dice rather than navigating a conversation i read the conversations are tied to the skills and profession of the npc knowing that makes a bit more sense but conversations are just so linear this was updated a few times since the review

quests are interesting as most are story archs but some smaller ones are a bit repetitive i really like when the quests change the village 50h in and i am still uncovering new quests

hunting is fun and my favorite so far sneaking up on an animal with a spear or bow trapping a bunny skinning gives a great feel to the world as you travel between towns 

building your own stead and eventually your own village is a lot of fun the building is mostly intuitive once you figure out how to build the first building   

forging is fun since it is tied to seasons spring has different flora and fauna in the world than fall planting crops are based on seasonal changes as well however my main source of income keeps being picking up sticks 1 stick 1 gold i really picked the wrong profession in rl i am quiting my job and will be a stick pickerupper

crafting is fun however by the time you can unlock the tech and craft the item you dont really need it 

so with all that the game is buggy and janky but fun to play they have patches every day and a great start to a great game and this is the beginning of early access i recommended medieval dynasty because it is ahead of a limited genre of similar games  its fun despite its flaws and the devs are very engaged i am excited to see where this goes over the next few years

imagine banished and kingdom come deliverance had a babymedieval dynasty is what you would get this game is finally bringing us the medieval openworld survival game that we have been waiting foryou start off as a small nobody running from war and injustice you find yourself in a nice peaceful river valley where you can hope for a new future i finally settled down by a small stream and the big river and decided that this would be a nice spot for my new home little did i know that you would basically be able to build an entire village you start off as a small shed but you have the ability to recruit villagers assign them tasks and make them work in your village this doesnt come freely though as you will have to pay taxes as your village grows i havent gotten that far yet but thats what i can tell from the menuatmosphere the atmosphere and general feel of the game and environment is beautiful the graphics are very well done and optimized and the game truly looks great economy craft scavenge sell buy create and rob all of these things are fair game in medieval dynasty so far the economy doesnt have a big impact on what you do in particular prices do not go up or down depending on whether you sellbuy items im assuming though that the devs would implement such a system building all of the structures are prebuilt structures you put down the foundation and general shape of the building take out your building hammer and complete it with various resources you are able to edit walls to different materials clay wood stone and you are able to edit where you want your door windows or just a wall to be travelling everything is on foot luckily the game looks great and the distances arent too great so i dont really mindhunting fairly simple as of now set up traps go away for a bit and a bunny will magically appear in it already dead poor little fella you can also throw your spear and bunnies who will die right away deers take more than just one spear and then theres bisonbuffalos who i tried to kill but i decided to run instead because he didnt enjoy being poked in the head by a spearsurvival aspects hunger and thirst are there but it doesnt seem that drinking affects you as of now eating fills up both hunger and thirst for now i would also like to see less food consumption i currently have to eat 6 pieces of meat you get 3 from 1 rabbit to get from 50 hunger to 100 seems a bit extreme all in all a great game so far and i cannot  wait to see what the future holds for this

#####

ive been looking for a good survival town building game for a while that doesnt send hordes of enemies at you and this one hit that spot much better than the others ive found so far

you cant build your house piece by piece like in others but the trade off is that you get specific buildings to give your villagers different jobs with different levels for the buildings as well as levels of technology all medieval age technology of course so you arent going to get advanced technology which i prefer personally futuristic technology would subtract from the simple beauty of the medieval scenery

you can also change the settings to suit your playstyle whether you want unlimited carry weight longer seasons a lot of the game is based on seasons more xp etc the only thing ive changed is to make the seasons longer which you can change in game i prefer to take my time with things and it gives you the option to sleep til the next season after the default season time 3 days

this game only has normal animals which is a nice change of pace from other games but in the future i would definitely like to see a similar game but with fantasy feel to it itd be nice to be able to explore a fantasy world the same way as i am able to in this world especially if it had a lot of the old european mythologies

sorry for the lengthy comment but this game really just hit that itch ive been trying to scratch so i wanted to leave my praise for the developers

#####

before you read this be informed that i am looking at this game from somebody who was expecting a survival game with complexity and city building mechanics and my whole review is based on this assumption 

this games concept is awesome combining survival aspects with a little bit of city building and city management sounds great but it isnt

the only survival aspect you have is that you need food which is so ridiculously easy to gather that it shouldnt even be an aspect of the game you have plenty of rabbits deer and whatever on the map and if you discover them you also get a marker on the map so you dont even have to look for meat water is even more ridiculous because you can just drink from whatever river cold and heat are part of the game but because you can get money so fast you can basically be fully equiped after 2 hours of gameplay wearing the best clothes there is no real survival aspect from the combat side there are some bandit camps here and there which give you way too good loot so its way better to just roam around and kill bandits than do anything else

the whole building aspect of the game is also kind of weird because you cant build freely every building has a fixed designed you can only change the type of walls from wood to stone which makes your workers happier and it seems like they get more productive which is irrelevant but i get to this in a minute so the whole building is kind of meh because you cant do individual stuff with the builds except for decorating them which also has 0 gameplay impact you also dont really need the buildings or workers to be there because they are so inefficient and slow that you are way better off just gathering stuff on your own the gathering and crafting from the players side is just way too effective so that the whole concept of automation in terms of having your workers do the stuff is just irrelevant

so the survival aspect is kind of weak and the building and automation too what exactly is this game well its basically a decoration game and thats it survival gets boring after a couple of hours same goes for city building because its a repetetive task with little to no impact on the gameplay but you can use the gathered and automated stuff to just make money spend it on new designs like vases fireplaces and whatever to then build them to decorate your city which doesnt do anything except for looking good this is why you see so many videos of people on youtube showing off their citys because there is nothing else this game offers i have seen crazy good looking stuff on youtube but for somebody who would like to have some action andor complexity this game is not for you if you are looking for a super chilled medieval styled decoration game then this one is great but its neither a survival game nor does it offer interesting building mechanics

its my own fault that i assumed too much from it and thats ok but from my point of view this game is being advertised as something it is not but i can recommend it to everybody who just want to have an immersive experience in a medieval setting chilling while exploring and doing day to day work

#####

this game is good in concept bad in practice ill start by saying this isnt a survival game there is no challenge to survive here outside of walking up to a wolf or a buffalo and giving it a kiss 

its basically a village building game where your purpose will be to take care of your villagers i wouldnt quite call it a colony sim because your villagers have no personalities you have no meaningful interactions with them they dont have any needs outside of food water and firewood they are basically zombies that you build houses for so you can build more houses and put more zombies to work 

if youre looking for combat this is not it combat in this game is straight up awful and will only happen if you stumble upon a couple bandits in the woods 

if youre looking for a role playing experience this is not it the skill tree is not a skill tree its a perk tree with a handful of uninteresting choices hammers last 10 longer 10 bump to health bar you can cook things 10 faster etc  

if youre looking for a story this aint it not only is there no voice acting so you have to read paragraph after paragraph while youre talking to an npc but the story quests amount to fetching mundane items and finding this guy at this village so you can read some more paragraphs about your uncles adventures that you dont care about 

if youre looking for hunting this isnt it shoot an arrow in any direction and youll probably hit an animal theyre everywhere all crammed together its only hunting in the sense that you can shoot them there is no other aspect of hunting involved at all 

some of the choices the developers made here are also baffling

 the houses have no furniture whatsoever and you cant put any furniture in them there are 3 sizes of house which you have to unlock and all of them have the same stock items a chest a fire and 2 or 3 cots thats it you can put decorations on the walls like shelves but absolutely nothing else can be placed in the house its pretty comical when you finally unlock the biggest house and get it built and then its just 4 walls and a roof and you cant have any furniture 

 there is a big lake in the middle of the map but im guessing swimming was a tough spot for the devs so the entire lake is like 5 feet deep and you can just walk across it instead of swimming i dont care about swimming but this epitomizes my point about baffling choices if you arent going to make swimming a thing why put a lake in the center of your map just make a map without a lake 

 you have to buy every craftable item blueprint with gold wanna build a table that you can only place outside 500 gold to unlock  wanna make some shoes 500 gold to unlock why does this cost money lol who am i paying maybe remove the borderline useless skill tree and let me unlock all this stuff with points gained from xp instead 

i had a good amount of fun building a village and managing the production and ill add that the game does look nice im a person who can build just for the sake of building i was driven by the need to expand and keep maintaining my production chains but they even hamstrung me there at a certain point my growth outpaced my dynasty reputation and then i was forced to participate in the fetch quests before i could recruit more villagers so now im grinding out boring quests all over the map make an axe for this guy get a hammer for this guy that was the nail in the coffin for me 

if you wanna build just to build i recommend it other than that no

#####

i was really on the fence about this game for a long time most of the negative reviews make it sound like theres either nothing to do or that youre gated by a tedious series of story quests im glad i gave this game a shot because nothing could be further from the truth other than the very first story mission that gives you permission to build your settlement you can pretty much ignore the quests i didnt finish the main story until roughly my 3rd in game year you can ignore pretty much every single quest if thats what you want to do the main storyline gives you something like 10 in game years before they expire so theres no rush to do things 

also some negative reviewer was whining that he couldnt assign people to hunt because he didnt have access to bows hunting requires stone knives not bows the in game menu even tells you what tools the building requires in order to operate

this game is actually really well balanced in terms of how quickly technology unlocks and what things are required to advance it may seem like everythings really expensive at first but youll quickly overcome that hump if you just keep playing this is a very laid back slow paced game so dont expect to build a massive village in your first season that said once you understand the mechanics and your village begins to grow youre never going to find yourself without something to do 

but none of it is forced on you if you decide you want to just explore the game world and live out of a shack by the river you can do that too theres a massive level of freedom thats honestly refreshing in a game like this 

im actually looking forward to watching my heir grow up and eventually have kids of his own i cant wait to see how my village evolves over multiple generations of time

#####

great game im really enjoying it as others have mentioned it feelsplays kind of like kingdom come but more of a sim game and less of a story game 

i have some notes for the developers to improve the game though

1 berries break the economy they are my biggest source of income i can go out and collect 1000 berries in a day and make 1000 gold easy from those nothing else currently makes that much gold for me i would say the harvest rate on berries should be lowered to 1 or 2 per bush instead of 45 

2 animals are needlessly expensive 5000 coins for a cow basically makes them unaffordable until really late game i can get geese for 1500 but i dont know if they are worth it so i have held off i feel like both of these costs should be halved to make them more obtainable 

3 crafting costs need to be evaluated i got a quest to make fur boots for one of my citizens it took 30 fur 30 fur means i have to kill 10 wolves or 30 rabbits in what world does it take the fur of 10 wolves to make one pair of boots it should be like 13 of that at most it took me forever to get 30 fur almost an entire season to craft those boots its the same with feathers to craft arrows 50 feathers is way too much also alternatively you could increase drop rates on furfeathers the leather crafting seem a bit more reasonable so far and leather is more easily obtained than fur 

4 the farming system needs work the merchants in town need wider variety of seed it feels like you have to travel all over the world to find the specific merchant who sells the seed you need for example i still cant find flax seed which is hindering my ability to craft linen the fertilizermanure system feels broken also as i mentioned in line 2 i cant afford animals  so i cant get manure to create fertilizer i can wait for stuff to rot and craft it that way but its very slow basically the only thing that actually works is buying fertilizer from the merchant it shouldnt be that way 

5 logs are a bit too heavy i get it you want to go for realism but it is very tedious to gather about 45 logs run back to town and hammer your building a few times and to have to repeat that 34 times especially when you are overweight and moving very slow

6 the town management system is confusing and needs better tutorial the shopkeeper doesnt seem to be a vendor and wont let me buysell me anything nor does she generate any income for me or anything like that

7 combat is a little boring due to the fact that every fight just boils down to do you have enough broadleaf plantains if so you are immortal the broadleaf plantains should not be usable when enemies are near or they should spawn much less 

again great game these are just suggestions for tuning certain things to make it better

#####

this game captured the feeling i had after i first installed mods on skyrim walking around in fields hunting deer hearing trees move in the breeze running from a storm into a fire lit hovel standing on top of a hill looking out over the forest in summer was the moment i knew i was going to be putting a lot of time into this game

there are so many positives to this game beyond the visuals but that is what hooks you to begin with the city builder elements are very enjoyable with the settler mechanics well implemented the wilderness survival and economy simulation aspects also do a good job of giving a lot of choice to your play style there is even the progenitor of a combat system you could dismiss the game as low budget  but you can see that every effort has been made to spend time and resources on areas that deliver something to the player

that being said the polish is missing in some areas the npcs can sometimes feel janky and robotic if you look at them too closely and the seasons mechanic is hard coded in by forcing periodic resetreload phases into the gameplay youre forced to sleep for a new seasons to be applied this can be immersion breaking as you can only imagine what it would be like to witness the landscape slowly transform as the first snows fall until the whole area is blanketed or to see the rivers well up as the snow begins to melt there is also a relationshipfamily feature but its a bit arbitrary and lacks an organic or engaging feeling within the setting

in the age of the ubiquitous early access release another important factor to consider when putting your cash into a gaming experience is support and ongoing development so far i have been pleased with how the devs have listened to the fans wishes and have provided good status updates  roadmaps with realistic timelines while they have had other projects they still consistently spend time improving this game and adding features

i cannot say this game does anything perfectly but it tries to do a lot  and much of it is done well

#####

if youve ever wondered what would it be like if the sims was actually a first person shooter but its the game banished then this is the game for you

#####

i pirated this game because it was so early access and i expected a buggy mess which was wholly lacking in content 
i was wrong 

this game is the best early access i have seen and ive seen a lot i am a pirate after all 
it runs smooth as butter on ultra and i was hooked as soon as i built my first warehouse i play mostly strategy simulation and management games this one smashes genres together into a sandbox this is the game weve been waiting for

this game was actually good enough to get a hardcore pirate to delete the free version of the game and buy it at full price on principle to support the devs its that good

#####

ive had this game on my wishlist for years before i purchased it  i love games like dawn of man kingdom come deliverance and city builders and this sounded like a mashup of all three so it seemed like a no brainer   after playing for about 80 hours i wish id listened to negative reviews  

i am sure some people will find this game fun  it looks good enough and the crafting trees are easy enough to follow once youve played for a few hours  the game has quests to give you reasons to move and theres an overall story that isnt bad

the problem with the game is it is very thin  i didnt know much going in but i did hear to play solo for a couple of years to level up your character and do quests  with the games focus on realism you find yourself doing a lot of running  i mean a lot  at times it felt like the next quest was meant to send you on a ten minute run to the other side of the map  i did a two years of meaningless questing before deciding to found a town out of frustration

town building is fun to a degree  you get a nice feeling of satisfaction building each part and seeing the final product  what sucks is the inability to easily do any city planning  alignment guides  i realize this is the middle ages and crooked lines should be expected but when your village starts getting large a lack of preplanning will cause problems

the bigger problem is once youve got your village going youve got two choices  you can run around doing boring quests or help your mostly useless villagers finish their tasks  your village faces no danger from outsiders or the environment  tech progression is unbelievably slow  cooking is useless  your villagers will be perfectly happy dining on a diet of nothing but dried meat  clothing is useless outside of a good backpack and fur boots for the winter     im only at midgame but its clear endgame is nonexistent

at this point i think ive given this game my best shot and am putting it away for a little bit  im sure ill play it again at some point as my ocd does enjoy the simplicity of picking up sticks and rocks and turning them into knives  dont laugh  anyone who buys the game will find its the best strategy until you get your farm going  then its time for berry picking so they can rot for fertilizer

if that process doesnt sound fun to you  you can skip this game  there really isnt much here

i like the game but i want to be coop

#####

built a house built a village married the neighbour and had a child a happy life all in all id say

#####

its an enjoyable and chill village builder where you can shoot bears in the butt with arrows

mornin 

nice day for fishin aint it huhah

this game really makes you feel like a medieval peasant

its always a breath of fresh air when a medieval game is just historical medieval and not filled with dragons and fireballs as i grow older im becoming more into lifestyle games like this

medieval dynasty is like skyrim and banished fusion but it lacks in both departments while those games have nearly unlimited replayability medieval dynasty gets quite boring after some 50100 hours its still fun but i wish it had more

i love survival games but often create and gather too much ive always wanted to be able to play with others and trade however in games like ark players just destroy your home often times i also play at a slow pace and enjoy exploration

this game has provided a lot of what i enjoy i can craft gather build get married have children trade hunt explore and quest any time i get bored with something i can go do another thing having villagers lets my production stay up so i can go gallivanting off in the countryside

the ability to customize my game play on the fly has been awesome too if i want to up the ante while hunting no problem if i want to take it easy and get my village together right quick i can do that too and i dont have to restart

i just like how relaxing it is and how you can actually see your work pay off its a grind fest yeah i usually read or listen to podcasts in the background with it i just have always wanted to play something like this low effort and chill plus i always wondered what it would be like to live back then even though this isnt even close to how it really was its still nice

it has excellent foundations the concept of building a dynasty is wonderful the fact that it is a town management sim played from a first person perspective is great as well

the biggest flaw is that after 1 generation or 2 depending on how quickly you progress you effectively cant advance further youve grown your village as much as you can which does kinda pull the rug from under the whole dynasty aspect to the game

id love to see your village be able to grow into a proper town to have the ability to grow your manor into a keep while further fortifying the surrounding area

i think i like this game because it just scratches so many itches for me craftingsurvivalrpg questlinescity builder and management is a ridiculously specific combination of genres but its all in medieval dynasty in one package 

the problem is that while the game has all those features theyre all still too basic and shallow the game is an excellent foundation as it is and thats what has carried it this far but a foundation alone isnt a complete game

that said render cube has been really good with communication and have so far delivered on every feature theyve promised in roadmaps and more which is a good track record to set md is far from a complete game right now but in time it will be

over all i love the game and do a new play through a few times a year if youre into town building games and enjoy the medival aesthetic then youll enjoy yourself however it is an indie game still in development so a bit of expectation management is in order this wont be the one and only game you play for the next 5 years but its definitely worth sinking a few weeks into as you watch your hut and field grow into a sprawling city

1010 would shoot bears in butt again

#####

initial review at 30 hours 
not going to lie this game had me at hello since it presented itself as an rpgstrategy hybrid and had a lineage mechanic unfortunately after spending over 30 hours trying to will myself to like it i regret to admit that this is basically a lot of good ideas with mediocre execution thrown in with little to no general cohesion

while the game has several issues the most glaring of all is the lack of motivation to push the player forward the survival mechanics are as basic as they go thirst hunger and temperature and theyre basically disconnected from the city building aspect to the extent that youve already maximized your survival capabilities by the time youve got your first hut as you can easily survive on hunting across every season

this really hamstrings the whole game as it makes most of it redundant each and every complex item elaborate meals metal tools alcohol etc requires a lot of infrastructure and preparation while offering no advantages over their simpler counterparts sure if you build a city you can make iron axes which have a metric ton of durability compared to a stone one but youd only need an iron axe if youre going to get into a city scale project to begin with you can apply the same logic to the food i can either get a single pie which requires a kitchen a vegetable garden a wheat field and a millor i can outrun four rabbits clock them on the head with a stick roast the meat and get the same result one takes 2 minutes the other one takes 10 hours 

if i were overly charitable i could say that this is set up this way so people can play at their own pace but if you have a city builder game in which the city building part is entirely optional someone has to go back to the drawing board however i was holding on writing this review until i was able to get a challenge from the herald as those are some pretty tall orders which definitely need a city to be able to fulfill themturns out these are optional as well

the time advancing mechanic while it is a very interesting idea is completely wasted here sure the villagers technically grow old and so do you but thats the only thing that changes the other towns are completely static in their size no outside or inside events significantly impact the region as time goes by so this mechanic may as well not exist even if you get a child right away the titular dynasty mechanic of being able to continue playing as your offspring comes so late in the game it might as well be a 100 completion bonus thing considering that 03 of the players were able to experience it according to the achievements

going back to the environment itself its kind of a disappointment after the initial great impression while the game starts somewhat strong with a somewhat interesting main story mission it can get resolved within a year if youre at least putting some effort into it the game also pulls a sneaky on you giving you several multistage unique missions at the very beginning like alwins story thus giving the impression that these are going to be the standard for the rest of the game wrong after those ones youre left with randomly generated fetch questtier missions that get refreshed every season and are absolutely unengaging with little in the way of reward

all the villagers have exactly the same dialogue options and you never see them go outside the area of the village either hunting exploring or trading with other villages they wake up go to work go to sleep rinse and repeat forever

the remaining mechanics are pretty lacking as well the only consequence for stealing items is a penalty on your dynasty points which only determine the maximum population of your village and you can easily recover with a fetch quest or two even if you steal a very valuable item dirtiness is a mechanic which i guess exists but it only impacts on whether npcs want to talk to you or not and you can get rid of it by walking into any of the many lakes or rivers you can get drunk but it does nothing save for screwing your interface plus youd have to be drunk irl to do it as a bottle of wine costs almost as much as an iron tool and so forth

now i dont want to be that guy and trash everything without providing some constructive criticism some of these issues could be solved relatively easy for example a comfort mechanic if you consume higher quality food and drink have nice clothing and so forth the character could get a  bonus in any xp he gets which would be welcome considering how grindy the game tends to be eventually the player can unlock higher comfort levels with a higher bonus and a higher requirement you could even add an xp penalty if it dips below a certain level so you have to keep the gravy train going same thing with the general environment a story mode could be implemented with missions that shape the region depending on their outcome the game has all the tools to make this happen all itd need is implementation

the game has good bones but as it stands today i cant recommend purchasing it


addendum at 130 hours

after wasting another 100 hours to complete every single achievement clearly i have masochistic tendencies i have to say that not only i stand by every appreciation made previously but that the enjoyment factor drops off a cliff as you play mainly due to the lack of content you have a strong first portion where you unlock things at a pretty steady pace build your village and play the main quest 12 years a mediocre mid portion where things get grindier and more boring since the buildings take much longer to unlock and only give a very marginal advantage 25 years and an a mindnumbingly boring late game with nothing new to do and the last buildings certainly are not worth the grind 6 years onwards

the city building management controls are incredibly clunky and frustrating requiring you to fiddle with them season by season if you want to optimize them such as the herbalist hut and you cant set production limits so they require constant babysitting

the much vaunted heirdynasty mechanics are incredibly threadbare your family may as well not exist except for giving you quests or items every once in a while and you can only have one child

and to top it off after seeing that the priorities seem to be with implementing coop player as a way to compensate for the lack of single player content per the developers roadmap makes me thing these issues will not get addressed

get dawn of man if you want a great city builder with tech progression or kingdom come deliverance if you want a great rpg set in the middle ages this game tries to be both and ends up being neither

#####

i can see some great relaxing game play here i feel like im burning through resources faster then the game spawns them in again
710
game play for me so far

but i was kind of annoyed about the process to use a water well
bucket is needed
cool how to make bucket
workshop is required
cool ill make that now make bucket
wooden plank is needed
well im at the workshop but i dont see it is this a skill
search online for how to make wood plank
woodshop is needed
to make and use a water well it takes no less then 2 other very large buildings to make a bucket
search online how to do things in the game so you can see what you need to work on first before you try to tackle the hidden art of bucket making

#####

it definitely shouldnt have been 10 release compared to early access almost nothing changed additional buildings are just meh  why even bother when the game doesnt really have a purpose

it is very repetitive and nothing exciting happens no real dangers no politics no nothing survival is extremely easy dialogues are boring i couldnt make myself care about any of the characters and their lives i usually just skipped the overlong dialogues which all felt kind of fake and forced also it doesnt really matter which dialogue choices are made ai doesnt really exist and there is very limited interaction with npcs it is almost nonexistent actually some voices were added but only to the vendors who are only capable to say hi and bye in 45 different ways all other npcs are just silent creepy my wife could be an incubator and nothing would be different all villages feel the same varying only in vendor types it is all about walking around walk walk and walk gathering sticks and stones and cutting down trees at first i felt excited about building my own village but then i started to realize there isnt really much to the gameplay itself it is all just bare bones with nice music 

there are still so many issues and illogicality a falling tree is like a softest of the pillows causes no damage at all huh the game is still very unbalanced it is more worth to sell basic items like stone knives than more advanced stuff so why even bother to level up you need to eat ridiculous amount of food like 15 steaks to fill up the food bar it doesnt really matter what villagers aka zombies eat or if they are happy as long as they are not very upset and dont want to leave so no point in cooking anything fancy really by the way if you want to cook any food for your village or say craft bigger number of tools  you wait like 5 minutes in real life looking at a guy stirring a soup or make mysterious hand gestures for 5 minutes feels like fun huh once i left to shower and when i came back  the guy was still stirring the soup 
also this game sometimes makes no sense at all  my lumberjack is working all day to in the end produce no logs probably because there is no resource storage what does the woodshed have the chest for then there is no message whatsoever that im doing something wrong or that there is no storage place available ridiculous 

it looks and feels like a mediocre game from 2000s definitely not worth the money it should cost max 10 judging by the lifeless content it provides very disappointing

#####

tldr a fantastic experience with one big caveat

the gameplay loop is fantastic a medieval survival crafting rpg is just what the doctor ordered its interesting its well balanced and i just cant get enough

sure graphics are a bit rough travel isnt engaging and some features arent intuitive but these are minor annoyances in a really really good game 

the big caveat while you shouldnt walk into this game expecting a major narrative such as kcds you might expect a wee bit more than this game offers after 30 hours of play i had finished all story quests the only quests left are repeatable side quests that lack interest still having finished the main story i think ive explored something like 1020 of what the game allows the player to craft the game doesnt need a strong narrative in order to be exciting but considering it does offer one i opine that it should accompany you through 100 of your playthrough not 20 i felt a bit of a letdown when i completed the main campaign and thought oh this is it

#####

my reviews are never seen just know that this game is positive from me and move along

8 out of 10

very relaxing and with difficulty easy to adjust without affecting your achievement 
and now when you can play it in coop it became 
9 out of 10 to my taste hope you will enjoy it too

#####

pros 
 good mechanics
 doors open easily
 option to have people move aside if they are blocking something
 seasons are amazing
 solid frame rate all around
 easy to start off and an easy to follow tutorial to match
 

cons atleast from what i have seen as of alpha 102
 no ability to build roads 
 no ability to level terrain
 low levels of storage in the early game
 weapons could be expanded
 animals keep running after taking a spear to the head or neck
 getting logs can be tedious and time consuming seeing as you get 2  4 depending on the tree species

please keep in mind these are just my experiences and i love the game dearly and will continue playing it

#####

what dynasty you dont really get to do that part because there is a dynasty i thought the world would be a lot bigger with a lot more in it to cover multiple life times
the start of this game is great but that seems to be it for me once ive built t1 than thats pretty much it theres nothing really to explore and i find the world quite empty
cant really think of anything more to say the game just ended up being meh

#####

im a buildingmanaging girlie at heart and this game really hit the spot it does get tedious sometimes because you do have to farm a lot and manage a lot of  things and after 10 hours of nonstop play i had to take my first genuine break it does feel like actual work sometimes but the vast amount of things to do really overshadows the work bit

#####

beautiful and fun just wish it had coop

#####

i rarely write reviews for games but i recently went through some reviews on this game and noticed a trend i love this game and have been playing since day one sure i am all caught up with the updates and added everything to my village including a palisade that encircles the entire thing a triple wall wooden spike wall in the center lateral wooden wall on the outside and rock wall on the inside to stand on and see over all the walls in case of future attacks up to and including all the new shops now to my point i saw a negative review from someone that had only played for 145 hours while most of the positive reviews were from people that actually put the time into it to find out how fun and relaxing it can be and the actual accomplishment you feel when you complete a project i love my little village and as you can see i have put a few hrs into the game this is not a twitch game it is not a fps or any kind of fast pace immediate satisfaction type of game play  you have to put a little work into it to obtain what you want but the end result is incredibly satisfying to me at least so if you like a game that takes a little time has some beautiful graphics relaxing content and plenty to do then i do recommend this game but if you feel you are an entitled gamer that needs a game that caters to your need of feeling superior with less effort and very little time put in than i would not recommend this game thanks for reading

#####

original review

had fun at first then it started get grindy and not the fun kind where you can turn your brain off due tools breaking down fairly quickly

it seems to have artificial difficulty due to the fact you literally need logs for everything need a spear yerp thatll cost you the entire trunk of a tree need a cup yerp thats two logs

it reminds me of the cartoons i watched as a child where they would take an entire tree and then carve the entire thing down into a tooth pick

this is what it reminds me off the spears are about as thick as a wrist the logs are about as thick as a mans thigh makes sense

revised review

eh its still grindy but theyve either added the options or i just didnt discover the options to remove some of the cumbersome elements i would still say its just a 710 though not amazing but not so bad that its not worth a few hours if you have the cash to splurge

#####

i actually like this game in a way i like building my village in a spot of my choosing and have villagers that work and produce stuff that i can then sell and make money for new stuff and technology that is i think the best part of this game the construction and management production recipes for each building exist but are well hidden in management screen i had to google it farming is also decent

some things are absolutely pathetic like npc interaction and quests animal ai economy balance etc but i dont really care about that stuff i want to build build build

why i dont recommend this game is the insane progression system i have played for 74 hours i restarted once but lets say i spent 65 hours on one dynasty i havent exactly been messing around i have worked hard and grinded and i am nowhere near not even close to unlock some of the good stuff like cows or horses the grind is mad play 65 hours and be like 10 on my way to get a horse or a bee hive orchads maybe another 300 hours grind this ruins the game its not fun you will never get the stuff you want before you are tired and bored and give up and move on to a new game so before this is fixed i will not recommend this game waste of your time as is


#####

a beginners tale

there are already plenty of reviews of varying eloquence its the internet so ill stick with the more personal heres my initial impressions thing and you may make of this what you will excited curious already left ah well for those that remain let us begin

if this be work

hoo boy its a chore lots o chores to be accurate 

now im a veteran of farmingresourcesocial games and most of them are about a nice relaxing time i mean who needs stress when you already have the carpal tunnel of all that chopping hoeing digging and whatnot right

wrong this game is stressful it is not a laid back farmingresourcesocial game it makes you work as hard as if you were in awell farmingresourcesocial game that attempts to be real so the chopping hoeing digging and whatnot is tough and you need a lot of it and your tools dont last forever or not long at all you can make them last longer later with skill pointsbwahahawell get to that

but realistic yeah feels much more that way and building the tools is not a big chore though it does use time and time is an oh so precious commodity in this game

who is the hunter and who is the hunted

oh my the hunting and the animals

okay so first of all gravity is a thing right so if you throw or shoot something dont expect it to go in a straight line the art of the arc

the first hunting is with wooden spears these things in simple terms suck like singularity suck black hole hunting now okay no biggie if youre hunting deer or rabbit they just run away and then you have to find your spearnope not going there

but say you throw at a boar which is the first animal i spotted on my hunt well the boar gets pissed at you throwing cheesy black hole sucky spears at him he decides he doesnt like your face and after a few red flashes on the screen he eats your face

oh oh digression time auto save what the heck so i reload last save after having my face eaten and the game flashes red and my face gets eaten again huh okay let me load an older auto save red flashes face eaten once more for college and all that come on sing it with me red flashes face eaten

i can only assume the auto save either starts when you do or when you endand then replaces previous auto saves in a never ending red flash face eaten loop so key safety tip dont rely on auto save make your own saves especially before hunting and especially if you actually kill something with those sucky wooden spears

oh oh another digression a word about that gravity its everywhere yes yes im not trying to do a captain obvious impression bear with me so when youre chopping trees to get logs the gravity takes over and the logs start rolling away from you never in all my farming game playing have i had to run after trees after i cut them down until now so thanks for that

no flying solo

i tried to go this alone i like my solitude give me a break

nope its just too much to do alone and you cant really ignore the npcs because theyre the only way to raise your dynasty score so you can build more cool buildings so no lone wolf mcquade here of course then the pressure builds to get married i mean darn i just started building a house and they flash me the wife in big letters yes info box chill out dudes let me use some more sucky spears first

i get it its in the name medieval dynasty sure sure ill give you an heir someday man i didnt know my mom developed this game

stats stats whos got the stats

not me hoo boy it takes a while to scale up your character and the skill trees yes plural are very specialized you cant just earn xp and place it anywhere you want doing x tasks gets you x skill points y tasks y skill points etc thats totally fair and i really like it i just mention it here so you know what to expect and to show ive played the game

reading glasses recommended

exposition is the big winner in this game everyone has something to say but i suggest bringing snacks along when you talk to quest characters some of them have lengthy tales to tell me im a reader so i think its great those of you itching to get on with your tasks maybe learn enough to get a bow or stone spear may get a little impatient eye drops are not required but having some handy couldnt hurt

and now for something completely different

a short paragraph overall i like the game but as i say im a fan of this genre this is however an amped up version and not a lighthearted game as well there are a number of game improvements that others do a detailed job of pointing out that makes the game have a slightly undercooked feel nevertheless i feel its worth playing for some chore oriented fun

just man those sucky wooden spears

#####

     i love playing this game it is strategic  has detailed menus which is great stimulation for those who like a bit more complicated game play the environment is absolutely beautiful and very realistic the water is amazing the wildlife and bandits too are very exciting to interact with and gets my blood pumping lol  i enjoy hearing the npcs random comments and watching them go to work i also enjoy seeing them use the furniture that i build 
      i do have a few suggestions for the devs  i am a female and would appreciate some clothing that doesnt make me look like a guy  please also it would be nice to have a bit more complicated interactionsconversations with my workers something other than the generic references to the time of year that it is  like when i ask how is your day going something like im so tired i didnt sleep well last night or it is a beautiful day  i am  happy to be here  or  i am looking forward to a good beer after work today  something very easy for the player me to follow up on  
     thank you devs and all of you who have done a fantastic job with this game

#####

the short version is that if you enjoy buildingcrafting games then this is worth a look  if you are also attracted to the historical aspect then its definitely worth playing

i would rate it at 355

the game has 3 issues in my opinion

1 once the main storyline ends you are essentially creating your own goals eg making the settlement self manage researching x or y   minor quests continue but soon become very repetitive and towards the end of the game the rewards arent worth the effort

2  early on in the game you are using the full day to cram in as much as possible  towards the end you are waiting on the next day to arrive without a speed up time option as far as im aware  there never seemed to be a happy  medium

3  i say end game because thats how it felt  however i stopped playing with plenty of unlocked knowledge  the issue was that there is no incentive to unlock them and as mentioned above its a pain to have to wait for the day to end

a good game and fun while it lasted but i get the feeling that it could have been so much better

#####

this game cured my depression 

this is the game i keep coming back to when nothing else feels satisfying even if you dont feel like doing much its nice to walk around the beautiful world just collecting mushrooms while time passes when i bought it a year ago in early access it was a pretty bare bones experience and theres still room for improvement but the devs have been putting out updates at record speed and show no sign of slowing down 

the only complaint is that id like to be able to play as a daughter at some point but with the mechanics of pregnancy and needing to hold the baby until it can walk around on its own i definitely see the challenge with it

#####

i recommend with a caveat this is an alpha game so it is still unfinished 

in my experience you can have fun and play for 1520h before the mechanics start breaking and you feel its currently unfinished state lets see some positives and negatives

 realistic visuals im glad theyre going for realism unlike 90 of the indie games out there this is a seriousthemed game which needs realistic mechanics and visuals
 ambient sounds and music is top notch for a game with these budgetsstages
 well implemented survival mechanics you get hungry thirsty and cold you still do not get sleepy but i bet theyre working on it
 basic but intuitive gathering building and crafting systems the basics are all there to make a great town managementsurvival game

now for the negatives i am sure most of these will be fixed in time as development progresses
 clunky fighthunting mechanics as of now the ai of the animals is hyper basic and npcs dont respond to attacks as they should both friendlies and enemies 
 building limit tied to main quest progression feels hyper restrictive let us do whatever we want and make the management maintenance and taxation the real burdens to scaling up without a plan instead of hardcapping the number of buildings we can build
 relationship reputation and trade mechanics are still undeveloped finding a wife and meeting new people for your town right now is a pain in the ass in the end you do it because you want people in your homestead but they are so basic randomized and boring youll quickly brush through them
 no combat bandits soldier guards or anything to do with defending your town against threats a random event here or there can make you repair a bit or restock slightly or a couple of boarswolves might attack you as you travel but you never feel any real threat at all
 no traders or automatization of trade which means as soon as you establish a semiautonomous farm your job will become lugging your binneal excedent of cabbages for coins in neighbouring villages no traders or by that same logic any travellers or visitors will visit you ever 
 unfinished skills technologies and mechanics but that is to be expected

so should you buy this game if you love strategy survival citytown building and medieval times this should be on your shortlist buying it now in this state warrants you a dozen hours of fun before you encounter the development ceiling but youll also be helping this game become better by providing early money to development

#####

on my way to hunt foxes
got chased by wolves
ran like a chicken and ended up at a village
met a pretty lady
got married with her
had a baby
built a house near a river
villagers are settling in
now i have a family and my own village 

1010 would get chased by wolves again

#####

ive been looking for a game like this forever and ive finally found it i wish that one day this game will be developed to the point that you can become king that would be awesome

#####

i began playing this game and almost put it away within the first 20 minutes but  i thought what if i was missing the point
the truth is i was missing the point of the game 
the game has gotten a lot of negative reviews and as i read them i realized people were trying to compare this to different games theyve grown used to yes animations can be a bit simple but other city builders are just the same this is first person city builder with some rpg elements which function more like progress milestones you need to help other npcs in order to build your reputation so that you can make your settlement larger its not really about being an rpg and yes the devs native language is obviously not english but im not going to knock hard on someone because their native language isnt the same as mine like so many other reviewers seem locked and loaded to do i have found the dialouge to be comical odd sub par and hilarious 
after a couple hours into the game i couldnt put it down and here i am 120 hours later with more hours logged offline this game reminds me a lot of satisfactory which i am a big fan of its an ever expanding project of management strategy and you progress by carefully building and planning as you learn how the game works that is what the point of the game is its not about hunting you give that job to your villagers its not about mining you do the same here as well eventually and its tough its a tough road to carve and when you see the progress you made its rewarding much like satisfacory 
the game doesnt feel polished no im surprised they took off the ea label but whatever the devs seem to be actively caring for the game which sets is apart from a lot of other ea titles there are frequent updates and additions 
for those looking into getting started i have 2 recommendations set the number of days in the year from the default 3 and give yourself 4 or 5 there are pros and cons to 3 or more days but overall i wish i had just one extra day in my year to get stuff done as at the moment im running around trying to manage my new large farming situation as well as the typical lack of tools and lack of people as i try to expand secondly build your first houses out of stone not sticks build all of them this way at least the walls youll thank yourself later 
i do recommend this game to anyone who likes city strategy satisfactory and a medieval farmlife setting  and a challenge if you are a game quality snob just stick with the giants of game publishing

#####

what the out of early access batman  ive been a fan hoping for more but this game is not done  so much potential but calling this released at this point makes me want to not recommend the game  i know some people myself included prefer slightly runny eggs but this is a raw egg instead of an omelette im still waiting for it to cook in anticipation of the final product but now im thinking a breakfast burrito sounds pretty tasty

#####

tldr in this case out of early access is just an empty statement to sell more copies the game does not have the content it needs to match the time requires you to play it wait another year roadmap is planned until q4 2022 at this moment	

some spoilers pass this point beware

bought the game after seeing 10 just got released after a year or so in early access was disappointed the game although visually pleasing and able to offer some serenity survivalcrafting games tend to do at its core is a mess all the systems in medieval dynasty are just thrown in there without any balance and barely any corelation between them 
here is an example for some reason cooking food follows under the same technology as smithing tailoring making tools weaponcrafting and pottery ok sure to cook scrambled eggs you need crafting technology of 25 you can get that pretty early much earlier that a henhouse to produce eggs now to cook scrambled eggs with mushrooms you need 1500 crafting by that time youll unlock second tier of workshop tailoring and smithing it takes about 4 ingame years of constant crafting to get to 1500 crafting tech until then the mushrooms you can pickup from the start of the game are basically useless except for turning into rot cause there is no other recipe with them and they poison when eaten raw
i know that was quite an edge case but this design is prominent throughout the whole game 
     you build a kitchen unlocks at 25 crafting tech it has an oven you cant bake anything in it for years cause the earliest baking recipe can be unlocked at 1500 crafting tech coincidentally 1500 also unlocks kitchen tier ii 
     wooden crossbow bolts the weakest require 50 crafting tech to craft a crossbow you need 5000  crafting technology never got this far not even half way there completed main plot  and dynasty building questline btw to add insult to injury you unlock 2 more types of bolts before reaching 5000 tech
     you just unlocked hunting lodge sweet now its time to craft a bow to hunt for that you need to be able to craft linen thread to make bows and better spears you can do that at 100 crafting tech  completely unrelated to survival tech you need to craft bows now you have to grind that tech by making shit you dont need luckily everything can be sold for hours and i mean hours real time
     you want a horse who doesnt there are special perks for it you can unlock so i guess its quite important nope first you have to get 2000 tech in farming that will take years even if you spend all your money on fertiliser create fields and plough them just to delete them just to repeat the process 
     you want better tools so they wont break so frequently you have just built a smithy 50 crafting tech it has an anvil forge everything you need to craft lets an say iron axe but no cause fuck you you need 500 crafting tech first even though the forge you have is capable of smelting iron and crafting the bars you need for said axe	
so either you go and grind that tech by making shit you dont need or buying stuff you need more on money in a bit somehow both choices feel like cheating every time i wanted to unlock new production building i had to amass a shitload of cheap resources and craft the same item hundreds or thousands of times then split it to stacks small enough my character can walk with make a lot of trips to vendors sell it get money i dont need anymore cause i still got a lot from previous grinds this is boring and takes a lot of time when trying to get first sewing tier 100 tech i gathered few thousand sticks and crafted few thousand spoons each takes 1 stick and gives 01 crafting tech crafting alone took over 30 real life minutes not including reloading cause i died of hunger in the process of watching the same animation during which i watched some yt video cause your input is not needed after crafting has started	
my mass spoon crafting all of which a nearest village barmaid bought without hesitation yielded me a few thousand coin 15 coin for each spoon that was enough to easily get me through next 2 ingame years i bought everything i needed had enough for future taxes and recipes 
yes you have to buy recipes of items you have painfully accumulated enough tech points for before you can craft them its really immersion breaking for me cause you dont you dont need to that for buildings both simple and complex stuff needs purchasing recipe and you can do it from anywhere the building you craft items youre buying recipe for doesnt even needs to be built id get if youll need to pay someone to teach you how to tailor or something like that but the way its done now seems like a lazy way to make you spend your spoon money

later in the game although nothing stops you from recruiting people from day one youll have some workers in your hamlet sadly technology wise you get punished for having them your villager doing work means you wont get as much technology points for it moreover you dont need them you are perfectly fine on your own there is nothing you cant do without them except employing them in a quarry or a woodshed to get resources quicker since orelogs are quite heavy making long trips for it annoying maybe later in game you can craft a cart or something but i never got this far
it seems that in order to keep your immersion and play i dont want to say as intended cause to me a year in early access is enough time to change harmful design as i think would be more adequate for medieval survival and village manager you have to actively hinder yourself some examples 
	you can employ your people at different buildings producing food have a wide variety of foods in your storage to keep the villages well fed or you can make a few trips to nearby berry bushes stock up about 2k of them easily done in less than a day and be good for a year
	you can makebuy clothes to prevent freezing outside in winters or you can run around naked and equip a torch from time to time
	you can shoot dear with an arrow and track your pray following its blood on the ground this will take a really long time or you can sprint behind an animal for some reason im faster and poke it with a spear

exploring feels fine but empty its worth doing cause you can get really good items iron tools seeds expensive stuff but theres some wasted potential in worldbuilding and player story id love to find something and get an opportunity to return it or keep it maybe uncover some secret and have a choice to be nosy maybe just find a cool looking rock and give it to my kid

the plot itself isnt great by any means almost all quests are fetch quests and the dialogs have a noticeable amount of spelling and grammar errors in english out of early access but my main issue with it lies in its detachment and separation from player progression its baffling almost as if it was made before devs had an idea how the gameplay will look you can complete it almost immediately compared to how your settlement is doing especially cause youll have enough money again spoons to just buy needed items skipping years of development and the game almost encourages you to do so because the storyline are timegated granted the time in with you have to complete the quests are quite generous something like 20 years  way more i ever played but once i legitimately was worried i wouldnt reach craft level high enough to craft needed item in time	
im aware quests arent the most important thing in survival crafting games and im glad the devs are trying to add something for people who like storylines but in its current state its just confusing especially when the story youre hearing sounds like a better game than youre playing

i know this was quite a long rant thank you for reading it 

#####

this couldve been great but it was never really finished it has great ideas theyre just not executed well

its disappointing because i enjoy the game but the reality of early access titles just rears its ugly head whenever i start enjoying it 

bprosb
lots of automation and a very enjoyable progression
perkbased character building
extensive decorations and customizables in homesbuildings
some basic questsstorylines

bconsb
zero voice acting for dialogue anyone looking for a story or immersion of any kind dont even bother npcs greet when spoken to and thats it villagers never talk or interact with each other they just wander like robots waiting for the player to do something with them
animation such as skinning are difficult to cancel if you skin an animal and something else pops up to attack you half way through animation rip combat is clunky you can just dodge bandits and take zero hits all game
very dry character development with no opportunity for divergent character creation the main quest will always require you to be a farmer in the beginning and work your way through the same setup
minimalist building diversity every building looks virtually the same
survival mechanics deliver nothing novel its just the same pick these items up to make tool x and watch your foodwater timers  i mean status bars oh and of course everything fits in your pockets as long as its less than xx kg
no meaningful interactions with npcs buildingsworkers just fabricate resources out of thin air and require no strategy on placement minefishing hut are few exceptions
npc ai is terrible i built my town intentionally next to a canal for water but they still need it in a bucket or they riot
quests are kind of repetitive and without real consequence
the game economy is nonexistent theres no dynamic pricing no supply and demand everything just has a fixed price and you can sell anything to any vendor also you need to have a vendor near your settlement otherwise you will be walking all game ive made my fortune selling everything from cabbage soup to weapons all to the same seamstress near my town where she fabricates 1000 coins every day is beyond me i dont question i just keep making soup
there is no way you can convince anyone this is a simulator game so just add fasttraveling seriously

id give it a solid 6510 i wish theyd make it a complete game

#####

so here is the deal i have followed this game quite some time now and it has a lot of potential  i have 80 hours on record at the time of this review so i feel i have give more than enough time to have a solid opinion of this game  when you pick up a game called medieval dynasty under a genre that is about crafting and survival it kind of also implies expansion and the building of an empire and with the game in its current state it just doesnt deliver that  instead it delivers super accurate details in graphics and historical accuracy dealing with the arts and crafts and even clothes that people commonly wore in the middle ages then it delivers super nonrealistic and gamebogging things like dealing with mothers who stop their profession in the middle ages to care for children  in the actual middle ages if it could walk it could work and another issue i have is things like villagers that are to inept to cook so they need someone assigned to cook for them or they starve to death even if you have a shed full of hundreds upon hundreds of stacks of meat and all the poor villager needs to do is slap it in a fire for a couple of mins but they just cant because nobody taught them to adult apparentlyalso it delivers the gamebogging management mechanic of high level villagers in certain professions that somehow despite being an expert in their craft in the middle ages have no way or competency to craft the tools they need to do their job  all of these micromanaging mechanics take away from other super fun elements of the game like being able to go out and hunt or explore the map or focus on dynasty building and expansion like making buildings going on quest recruiting more villagers mining and you know dynasty buildinga lot of this could be solved by the custom game creation option that is already included in the new game creation area and is absolutely possible because the game did not have these things that bogged it down in prior versions  the villagers simply did their jobs and that was that  no tools needed it was assumed they have some level of competence in what they were doing or that they figured it out like a pro  so with all of these things that are currently bogging down the more fun elements of the game i cant say give it a shot at this time if some changes are made to make these things more optional or to just get rid of these management mechanics i will change my vote on this but in the state its in now and with the price about to go up i am going to say no unless you like really slow boring management mechanics that massively stifle expansion then it may be your thing  however this is not about building a dynasty imo its about having three houses for twenty years because you have to manage every minute detail  its more medieval cant dynastyupdate 1122021 they went live without changing any of the unrealistic things they should have not even the villagers being able to cook for themselves  my review stands

great survival game that doesnt make you eat 12000 calories per day and drink 80 liters of liquid

 post release review 

the short story mar 30 2022
the biggest issue that holds this title back and keeps me from giving it a recommended thumbs up review is its managed data by that i mean the data of recipes resources gathered time management ai gathering etc
the quests are super basic that is fine for a title like this
the combat is basic but that is just fine for a title like this its actually a good thing
the art is good enough to really enjoy the game
the environments are fun to be in

the resource management is awful
the tech tree is awful
the recipe costs are awful

sadly i cant really recommend this title i really wish i could i do love the idea so much

mar 30 2022

the good
the concept the ability to build anywhere the art are all great there is not another game that i can find that allows you the player to manage a village sim from the vantage point of a single character or in first person the experience is great and the idea is very sound the time period is a great setting for this concept as well

the bad
i have never wanted to edit the game data more than i do with medieval dynasty resources gathered by you villagers are far from adequate the player can gather critical resources or create products hundreds of times faster than your villagers

the tech tree is a mess there are a dozen chokepoint components that will stop your village cold at almost every turn early level tech requires late level components constantly quickly consumed resources will be gathered far too slowly or are far to o complex for how much they are needed

the biggest downfall of medieval dynasty is that you cannot fix these issues yourself  there is no editor there is no access to cheats that allow the player to adjust this data what a shame

the meh
quests and task are overly simplified and without context 
exploration is vast but empty
villagers and engagement with npcs are barley par
hunting and combat is poor to really bad
npccreature ai is bad

none of the meh list is critical because this title is about small scale village management it is not an rpg nor is it a hunting sim the level of sophistication in these mechanics are just fine and work well for this type of title just dont expect skyrim 

old reviews below

oct 4 2021
 prereview notes 
i really love the basic idea of this game a lot it very much feels like it wants to be a colonycity management game form a base builders point of view the medieval times are a great period to choose for this kind of game i really love small scale city management games as well as basebuilders and i am hungry for a game that can combine the two 

 short story 
it feels as if the devs simply didnt want to work on this project any longer so they released it the final release is sadly disappointing the game feels very unfinished i have always really wanted to build an entire functioning village in almost all my basebuider games this game promises that and doesnt really deliver it really does feel as if the devs just gave up at the 80 mark the polish and care is just not there i have never wanted to have access to the game editor more than medieval dynasty just so i could finish it up to a midlevel bar of quality and standards 

to use an analogy if this title was a house it feels like the contractors got to the point of getting the home to functional but stopped construction at the final paint the walls pick out the carpet and install the curtains stage with just a little more work it could polish up very well and be quite remarkable

 i cannot really recommend people drop cash on this title its just not done what a shame

 notes on the original review 
i still stand by my original review but i was able to adjust the hps npcs to 30 this helped my enjoyment of the game quite a bit but i was really hoping for more depth and balance form the devs i wish i could do this for a lot of the other data as well like hunger thirst etc again reducing the hit points of the critters wont be for everyone but i felt it was better than leaving it as intended it may seem too easy for some but for me this game isnt about the hunting its about building and managing a small village to me the hunting is another resource and should be obtainable

 the review 
the good
i love the art the environment and the entire concept of how you as the player go about building a small town and recruit npcs to work it the npcs all have strengths and weaknesses which i love its not overly complex but i find that to be a good thing the ui panels are decent and quickly provides relevant information to the player
the building is fun and meaningful homes have a small amount of customization which is fun
i love the seasons and the preparation for the seasons to come

the bad
first is the data points it truly feels like the devs really didnt put a lot of thought into the basic data let alone tune it the data hunger rate buysell economy eatingdrinking the tech tree etc still feels like it is at the testing stage

 the tech tree is a mess example build a bow at a hunterlodge requires linen string you get that form a clothier much further down the line
 the ui navigation is bad very bad i have no idea why the devs set up the ui to function the way it does but it is bad as an example it is a 6 step process to add an item to the hotbar 
the tech tree seems basic 5 xp to x each skill does have 1 unique and fun skill to obtain but the rest just seems like placeholder stats
 quests are very basic get 10 wood kill 2 wolves etc

this title had all the ingredients to be a successful rewarding and satisfying game sadly its lack of competence and caring for the details shows through i would really like to hope that the devs intend to truly finish up this title and make it the game i know it can be its not far off all the hard work seems to be done with a little push and a rework on the details and this game could really be something

 

oh well what a bummer

 original pre release review below 
not recommending it right now 

if you like base building village crafting slow paced and challenging games this is a great title to put on your wishlist just dont put money down quiet yet simply put its not ready
the building part of the game is great the entire idea of building a settlement is really well done the art and environments are par and very worthy
the issues come in with any sort of fighting and that includes the hunting its awful and it has gotten worse over the last few patches the only real way to defend yourself from a wolf or bear is to throw a spear and hope it hits the animal in the head if you use an ax knife or even jab with the spear you are as good as dead even the spear throwing is exceptionally bad
this area of the game needs a lot of attention by the devs
next is the interactions with the npcs this is where you will get quests from and even find people to become part of your village as it is its not bad but it very much lacks in depth this is another area i honestly hope the devs flesh out and polish up with some more depth this could really take this title up to a whole new level

like i said dont buy this game quite yet but definitely add it to your wishlist and keep an eye on it with a few tweaks and some polish in some key areas this game could be amazing at the moment it lacks

#####

buckle up and grab a drink this will be long

medieval dynasty md bills itself as a survival villagebuilder sim like a lot of this game the response is yeah sort of

you start out as a male looking for his uncle no character customization there is however gameplay customization and i suggest you make liberal use of those in your first playthrough and you will play as male you have an obligatory discussion with the castellan and then youre off to make your way

the visuals in this game are a  with the exception of npc models lots of reuse and the soundtrack is another a  

do the usual rock  stick  axe  more tools paradigm build a house maybe start hunting

1 hunting be forewarned anything from wolves on up bears bisent buffalo  bison hybrid have anqrs3637 counterfire radar you can be hunting at night max sneak theres an ingame skill tree and shooting at max range with a bow not exactly a noisy weapon

they will know where you are and in the immortal words of jimbo from south park  its coming right for us

oh btw with any hostile npc animals bandits more on these clowns in a bit expect unusual movement patterns you thought the zombies in seven days to die had janky movement 

you aint seen nothing yet

2 ok so you decide to take a wife to produce an heir not so fast partner these are the middle ages and women like to be wooed for years god forbid you miss a season because then you lose affection with her meanwhile when you finally reach 100 affection not happiness more on this in a moment she says you had me at hello 

take her back to your hut and put her to work more on this in a moment together while she gathers  creates you build like a maniac please note the default carry weight is 15kg or 33 pounds dont know about you but i can move miles with 60 pounds on my back no problem like i said make exhaustive use of the customization settings

youve now got a couple of houses built and decide to recruit more folks be forewarned they are going to very low skillwise luckily a couple of seasons and theyre at 10 

being the smart community organizer you put a man and woman in each house not just because you have to forced game mechanic but youre going to need kids to work the fields

sure enough the women get pregnant  and work until the day they give birth heres where the game enacts a very punishing mechanic

see in spite of the fact this game is set in the middle ages and labor is at a premium mothers get two years yes you read that right two years of postpregnancy leave so instead of two healthy workers essentially feeding themselves and contributing towards the community you have  a  healthy worker feeding three people

my record low labor participation rate was something around 36 i had 58 people in my community and 23 including me actual laborers 

when questioned on this the devs responded well thats the price you pay for free labor in the future

one theyre not free i have to house feed provide water and firewood second in what universe does 24 months make sense third that free labor doesnt start for another 14 years and then its at 50 productivity

oh yeah kids

3 kids are essentially useless in afghanistan we called those people eaters and p00pers for the first 14 years of their life now whether its 1000 ad or 2022 kids can work they can pick up sticks pick up rocks collect berries or they go to school at a young age learn to read write simple math

nope 14 years 56 seasons of eating food drinking water burning firewood and converting oxygen to carbon dioxide 

mechanics 2 and 3 contribute to why i think some of the achievements 50 people 65 people have been reached by such a small number of players less than 5 and 3 respectively

final analysis not a bad game certainly the studio have advanced the ip by light years since 12 months ago just realize what youre getting into if you decide to buy

final grade b



#####

epic as it is the only first person colony builder i have found with realism and the ability to truly feel as if you are the lord and designer of your own villagecityeasy to learn hard to master and new and varying content developed at a reasonable pace where else can you build a house enter and live in it farm your own land or have a villager do it for you all in a world that isnt blocks truly immersive

#####

pros gorgeous visuals exceptional complexity and depth tons of promise for future content
cons can be super grindy somewhat janky ai and limited content at this stage of development but thats expected and forgiven

as medieval dynasty is an early access title i wont touch upon the plot  but one exists decent and believable more than sufficient to motivate the player  in case the dev team decide to make any changes prior to shipping the finished product 

the gameplay is intuitive for the most part progression is smooth and straightforward with some study and overtime familiarity the complexities of the ui and management window fade into second nature given the number of big budget titles that continue to fail in this regard i cant praise medieval dynastys developers enough for the nodoubt truckloads of effort theyve put into making this one easy to pickup along the way just as a matter of course

the graphics are beautiful and the assets appear to be wellenough optimized smooth and richly textured even on my somewhat midrange graphics card gtx 1660 and the games everchanging seasons never fail to visually impress animations are smooth hitboxes reliable all the unseen autonomic functions youd expect from a bigbudget release are handled well and readily apparent  but quickly taken for granted as they should be allowing for one of the most immersive titles ive had the pleasure of playing in quite some time

in terms of gameplay simply imagine the basics of medieval village life and you will find them ingame hunting farming cooking crafting  tools clothing weapons  and structure building are all present and correct resources inventory and research are all spoton relying on the continued use of any skill for further level upperk acquisitionbased progression toward making them all easier to accomplish once your villagers are settled in and begin contributing as anything from field hands to hunters to storekeepers their efforts also add to your tech research progress as well 

as your settlement grows and prospers your yearly taxes can quickly outpace anything the ai is able to contribute however so the grind remains a major part of any current gameplay experience ive jokingly called medieval dynasty a potage tycoon game in the past as its been necessary every summer  with the stores packed with cabbages from the fields and fresh meat from my designated hunters  to dedicate a season or two 36 game days to nothing but constant cooking pausing only to eat drink and splash my face in the washtub to ward off the dirtiness debuffs

during any form of crafting you are locked in  visually and otherwise  to only that activity for example each of the 4 merchants in the next town over from mine has the coin onhand to purchase 5060 potage 1 cabbage  1 meat  5 sec cook time per assuming a 2 minute travel time each trip give or take its entirely common to spend a full halfhour locked into one repetitive activity staring at your characters hands stirring in an empty cooking pot unable to look around much less checkmake adjustments your villages management tab you can also freeze be attacked by critters starve to death and die of thirst while crafting so its not a wise option to simply fire and forget a major potage etc session and alttab to something else

sadly even a maxedskill villager will never reach more than a small fraction of player productivity literally the best villager will produce around 1 insertitemhere per ingame hour given its crafting complexity as noted above the player will likely be able to create hundreds provided their needs are met and no interruptions occur so when it comes to paying taxes especially or just ensuring enough materials for repairs remain on hand at the change of each season expect to be doing the vast majority yourself  at least for now

the devs are working hard on streamlining and perfecting the ai and its role in your village with productivity in mind so im looking forward to future updates in that regard with no small level of excitement to see how this talented and dedicated team is able to fully implement their goals for the project

overall medieval dynasty is just a stunning piece of work even so very earlyon as it is i would readily recommend it to anyone interested in the genres therein give it a few months itll likely be the sort of game youd recommend to anyone regardless of prior genre interest as well

cant wait for co op

#####

medieval dynasty is a pretty great game for a game in early access its gameplay consist of mostly gathering resources such as sticks straws and rocks heres what i think about this game
pros
 survival games i tend to have more of an affinity to it
 an open world game thats neat
 you can build your own town
 it is very enjoyable for the first few hours
 skills that are trainable to receive perks 
 grinds i like grinds
 it has seasons
cons 
 a few bugs here and there
 technology leveling is hard 
 you cant run your first town without food storage which you need 5 farming tech but you need to be able to get manure where you get that is beyond me 
 you need reputation to build your town
 you need to do quests to build up your reputation
 walking simulator
 lack of difficulty setting and length of the seasons
 you cant kill npcs rip
conclusion its a decent game for a game that is in early access i like it but it needs to have a better tutorial and more easily accessible how to page in the game i know it exists somewhere overall i think this game has potential and i hope it becomes a better game for everyone to play  it still needs more content added to the game 710

#####

tldr  a pretty game with huge potiential that is badly thought out and poorly coded in places  lots of places will take a fair bit of effort to make sense will take a lot of effort to make great will take a huge amount of effort and a lot of rethinking to make legendary 

well well well a good looking game that has bags of atmosphere cool ideas and is fun to lose yourself in but  but it has so many flaws 

the first is that the interface to me seems designed for console to move a stack you press f e and then f again no control click no right click move all the whole interface is like this 

the second is balance pretend youre a dev and you are testing the game you see that it takes a whole field of rye 300 grain to make 30 flour it takes 10 flour to make a pie so a whole field of rye for three pies in the process of planting and harvesting this rye you have used manure hoes seed leather bags and scythes which cost hundreds of coins and are now all broken  thanks to ridonkulous durability values  you have to pay rent on the field each pie takes additional ingredients to finish and sells for around 14 coins each so 3 pies is 42 coins you tick the box  looks good

similarly you buy 7 sheep and a ram totaling 24500 coins you collect the wool from these all year while feeding them you get 300 wool 10 wool per fabric 10 fabric per fur hood each hood sells for about 80 coins so a 240 coin return per year and 100 years to break even you tick the box  looks good

it takes around 4 or 5 minutes to pick 500 berries each berry sells for 1 coin 500 coins for 5 minutes work tick the box  looks good 

this goes on and on what kind of dev lets this through what kind of dev thinks for one second that this is ok well the kind that seems to have come up with this great idea and game a game that if worked on to its logical conclusion is a mouth watering prospect for fans of the genre 

its a beautiful game this has massive potential thats why it has a positive review score thats why we all want to help it succeed

#####

my spouse refused to talk to me before i wash myself just like irl 1010

#####

im trying to figure out what this game is trying to be so lets go down the tags

1	survival yes you have to eat and drink water and not freeze to death there was never a moment where this wasnt exceptionally easy sure you get eaten by a wolf when you run blindly though the forest in the middle of the night cause some idiot wants you to pick up 3 onion seeds ok great

2	building no you place a building then spend 5 minutes hitting it with a hammer as you place every single stick log and piece of straw to build the predefined shape of a building this isnt valheim where you can build custom buildings using the parts each building is predefined and the only thing you can do is swap the panels you cant carry enough to build a structure by default so the predefined hammering is broken up by running to find materials why bother cant i just put the materials in a box and summon the building if the design doesnt matter

3	open world no you can do what you want but there is nothing to do or reason to do it youre in a world full of people who are identical the quests are random and every merchant has the same  goods for the same price there is no reason to go to the farmer in x vs the farmer in y a white room that goes in all directions is an open world i guess

4	medieval yes it medieval ok but that not a feature thats a theme

5	rpg no there are no decisions to be made that have any impact there is no antagonist there is no power dynamic between the towns there is no interpersonal conflict between the inhabitants you cant murder people you cant help people by hurting others there isnt anything remarkable about any single thing in the valley  except the dead uncle i guess

so this is a medieval survival game that has difficulty lasting as long as it takes to remember the key bindings

lets talk about why i dropped this game on my third playthrough before the first year ended forgoing all the above i figured this was a chill aesthetic casual game where i can build a nice little town and watch the goats wander round maybe thats the idea

nope  because the balance is completely broken 

1	the economy is nonexistent and can be bypassed within a few days pro tip build wooden vials at the level 1 crafting station 1 log  2 planks  20 vials at 75 each you can buy a log for 3 and sell result for 150 and every vendor will buy it plus each vendor gets reset each season why bother doing anything else you might say yup thats an exploit but guess what  there is no economy since this good follows the same formula as every other one  npcs sell at 15x the base price and you sell at 05x the base price there is no supply or demand or reason to do anything besides find the best linear return before i left the tutorial phase i bought every piece of fancy clothing and the best weapon what is this whos play testing this

2	the technology tree is a giant fuck you your technology point requirements are exponential but your technology point gains are linear i wanted to get to bronze tools at 500xp after accessing copper tools at 200xp i figured crafting a copper axe would yield 20x the xp as a stone axe nope maybe 1something x so doing more advanced activities doesnt improve xp at a meaningful rate then you look down the tree and you have items behind 5000 xp the fuck

3	the technologies are a giant fuck you did you know that stone axes first thing you craft are better than every other axe in the game thats because the cost to make other axes is always worse than just building multiples of the stone axe i mean a bronze axe should be better than a stone axe right well no because you need 8 copper ore and 8 tin ore to make a axe thats only 4 times more durable than stone except you probably need 8 stone axes worth of stone to build the pick axes to mine the ore never mind that you need to a find the mine b build a resource depot since you can only carry 20 ore at a time c mine the ore d build the smithy e craft the bronze tool or you can just smash your hand at a twig and a rock to make a stone axe the fuck

so screw it make a town with a few inhabitants to make a wooden vial empire and buy everything you need let the game run while youre at work to let the tech tree upgrade you can get a horse to ride around while watching your goats

or dont bother

#####

this game has potential but i feel like the release was pushed for some reason other than the game being finished

there is simply too much polish missing from this game but not only that the core gameplay is kind of flawed this game is a village manager simulator but instead of feeling like a leader or a mayor youre the errand boy you cant set up any automation for building houses so youre stuck running back and forth between the storageforest with logs alone to build everything which is not only tedious but boring then you have to run to town to sell items so you can unlock new things to make then you have to run to town to buy fertilizer then you have to run to town to do quests you spend barely any real time in your village because theres very little to do there until youve maybe managed to set up a lot of resource income but then all youre doing is looking at a pair of empty hands crafting 30 items over 300 seconds

youre also forced to be the mineral slave there is no way to automate copper and tin income until you can build a mine which is a very late game technology so you have to be the one to again run and do the mining unless youre satisfied with everyone being stuck on stone tools

there is a severe lack of seasonal settings for your farms on a side note i have issues with how the crops seem to grow from what i understand they grow a step every season so you cant really do anything about the odd 3 day seasons in the settings because it will wreck the balance of the game too much but your farms cant be set up per season so you either have to have a farm plot set up for each season or you have to manually go in and change it to another plant over and over every time theres a season change

a lot of the crafting has similar issues as well with how you set up what to craft you basically have 100 points of production to distribute amongst products so if you spend 20 points making soup you get maybe 1 soup a day 100 points you get 4 soups a day but this only works if you have very specific income so if youre out of cabbages for one second production simply stops because there is no prioritizing system or craft order or conditional crafts such as if there are below 5 pickaxes craft pickaxe

the soundtrack is not bad exactly but most of it feels extremely out of place half the time its playing some track that sounds like a stressful sneaking situation but youre just out cutting trees

all in all the game could be nice with more polish and with some overhauls to make you feel less like an errand boy and breathing some life into the world because right now it is rather bland with near copy pasted npcs horrible interactions to woo a wife and generic drops from animals and such

buy on a sale otherwise wait for a major patch

#####

if only this game would have a baby with kingdom come deliverance

so far this is exactly what i have been looking for and finally found the controls are great the graphics are polished the game has been bug free so far the building and crafting is fantastic there are even quests and actual things to do i have waited for this game for a long time and it has not disappointed  before many start complainingthis is still and early access game if you dont know or understand what that means dont buy itthere is no voice acting and the mouths dont move when talking there is no 3rd personthat all being said this game is straight up polished and really well donei cant wait to see what it evolves to currently it is fun and enjoyable and i will waste several hours with this fantastic game

quick edit after 1 week of this game my review has not changed yet improved sure there are a few issues and bugs with the game however our first week of this has seen 5 hot fix patches from what seems to be an active development team this is a welcome change to the garbage we are all to used to now with most ea releases of release  get paid  ignore community  game dies  hopefully we will continue to see active development from the team and the game will develop into a really great piece

#####

hasnt even finished one game and you split the dev team in half to focus on another this is what the 3rd time theyve done this

#####

barely 13 hours into this game and im already in love with it the graphics look amazing the gameplay is nice and smooth and the npcs are actually diversified in most games npcs only come as adults or maybe with one age range of kids but in md i have seen late teens mid teens and preteens all running around which makes the villages so much more believable because im not left wondering where everyone is granted i do believe the current towns need to be expanded a little they are awfully small

making money early on is easy peasy just grab as many herbs and berries as you can and youre instantly rich whenever any tool is about to break make a new one then sell the old one 

combat could use some work spear #1 goes through the neck and the animal either runs like mad or turns to maul you spear #2 goes through both flanks same thing but spear #3 goes right through the left eye the animal sometimes will just flop over but will sometimes slowly start to lumber away or at you neck and head shots should be instant kill but id like to see more significant trauma when damage occurs to the legs or torso if the back legs are taken out then the animal should not be able to sprint away at full speed and if the organs are hit then the animal should run a short to medium distance before bleeding out not reappear 3 seasons later with that spear still hanging out of its side

the base building is amaze balls but i do have a few issues rocks should be added to the craft recipes for the buildings since they do have rock foundations id like to see the various workshops snap to the sides of houses for ease of placement crop fields currently sit angled differently than houses and workshops which drives my ocd nuts because my fields are all crooked and id also like to see the crop fields terraform the terrain so that the fields are smooth maybe add a rock retaining wall for crop fields on more angled terrain 

my biggest concern though is the 3 day seasons any side quest not completed by the end of the season is failed even when im on my way back to talk to the quest giver after finishing the task given the incredibly short window thats quite annoying id like to see seasons increased to 7 to 14 days with all side quests spawning by day 3 so there is enough time to complete them before the season change fade to black

lastly i love character creation its my favorite aspect of gaming so id like to see a small bit come to md nothing too crazy like bethesdas many sliders just a few faces hairs and facial hairs and the option to play as a female

first ever game review
this is a very tentative yes i hovered over no for some time i am 60 hrs of game play in and there are aspects of the game i love the concept is great and hopefully it will mature but as it is i dont find it have the longevity that you would hope why well for me it just gets dull nothing unexpected happens you go to a settlement everyone is there you go for a walk through the woods there is that same hog wolf or bear you met fifteen other time you walked that way you go somewhere new on the map funny enough nothing different here either

this sounds overly negative i did enjoy the 60 hours i put in the game kept me very engaged for that 60 hours but i have hit a wall

i wont list pros and cons enough people have done that all in all its a surprisingly stable game for an early release has alot of potential and is gripping for a time i hope enough people keep paying the at the time of writing 22 price tag in the hope development continues but i wont be returning until it has developed that bit further to make the game less predictable

#####

revised official release review
i have played the game for 10 hours since it has been officially released and they have fixed almost none of the issues with the game however now many basic things are locked behind technology trees and pointless buildings want to build a fishing rod you have to grind your technology level for hours before you can build the fishing hut which is the only place you can make a fishing rod in but once youve built your fishing hut the fishing rod blueprint still needs to be purchased for like 3 months of ingame wages the entire game feels like its been designed to keep you grinding for resources even if its not realistic ive played the game for 14 hours as of writing this and i still havent gotten to the dynasty part of the game ive built a small farm that feels empty because i need 6 large buildings just to craft basic things that could all be done on a small workbench in my house but i still am not growing enough food to support myself because basic things are locked behind more technology trees and blueprints the world does feel more alive now so they have improved that part of the game also the idea of building your own town from scratch is satisfying and kept me playing for a few more hours but the game keeps getting in its own way with annoying grind and unrealistic mechanics 


initial early access review
i have never bought an early access game before but i made an exception for this because i couldnt wait to play it medieval dynasty has a lot of promise and its scope is impressive but the basic mechanics are just not fun in their current state of development im willing to play some more and change my review once the game is finished im not asking for a refund only because i want this game to continue to be developed and i know render cube is a small studio who will need funding 

cons
hunting is ridiculous and immersion breaking this is unfortunate because it is your primary way of getting food for the first few hours of the game even when i perfectly throw a spear through both lungs of a deer it sprints away and needs to be stabbed like 10 more times before dying the most efficient hunting method is just chasing animals and stabbing them in the butt until they die because it doesnt even matter where you hit them and they are pretty dumb 

hunger is tedious i need to eat 4 deer a day to keep hunger away in real life 1 deer will feed a family for months it would be much better if 3 pieces of meat was enough to completely fill you up in the game 

the building mechanics arent fun somehow i can fit logs in my pockets but only 8 before becoming overburdened there should be log sleds or some way to collect logs that makes more sense also there is no way to place blueprints before constructing i had to obtain all of the resources to build my house twice because when i placed it the first time it wasnt quite where i wanted it also chopping trees is awkward they fall randomly not in the direction of the cut 

the world is lifeless npcs are stiff and awkward people do nothing besides stand around and work the fields animals let you get way too close and dont seem to do anything besides stand and then run aimlessly this might be one of the worst things about the game actually if im going to spend hours grinding collecting resources then the world needs to be at least pleasant to be in 

pros
the concept of the game is really cool its neat that you can start from nothing and build an entire village and your own dynasty 

the historical accuracy is great its clear that the developers are fans of history and are making a game theyd want to play with more development this game could become a better alternative to the guild games

h1casual colony sim onlyh1

bwhat to not expect from this gameb
1 this is not a survival game lets make that perfectly clear from the start if that is what you are looking for then you are in the wrong place put on 1 piece of fur clothing and the weather no longer matters have one villager hunt and food is irrelevant villagers are invincible btw unless you are stupid enough to faceplant a wolf while unarmed there is nothing threatening your survival
2 this is not an rpg it has a super short and shallow story where your actions dont really matter and you can completely ignore it
3 there is zero challenge the closest you will get to a challenge in this game is a nonsensical tech tree that cckblocks progress unless you do things like till and delete the same field over and over aka busy work

this is nothing but a super casual and simplistic colony sim if thats all you want then this game is right for you however if you are interested in any depth or challenge youre in the wrong place nothing will ever threaten your village in any way there is also no real objective you can collect gold and build up favor with the king but to what end once you are self sufficient gold is useless you never meet the king and his feelings about you have zero game impact there are some bandits but they do nothing but chill at their camp and you are faster than them they will never leave their camp and you can ignore them

bnow on to what you can expect from this gameb
1 gathering resources until you have villagers assigned to do something you will have to do it yourself such as filling buckets with water to put into the food storage chopping trees picking up rocks plowing a field etc
2 resource management villagers need food drink and firewood these can be provided by assigning them jobs once you have constructed the building for it ex hunters lodge for hunters the more villagers you have the more of each of these things will be needed the longer they do a job the more efficient at it they get slowly
3 an arbitrary tech tree more like a series of tech lists as they dont branch out by doing a bunch of menial tasks you gradually unlock the ability to purchase the tech to construct something be that a bow fishing spear barn chicken coop etc it all has to be unlocked by doing activities related to said category and then purchased with gold the only reason you need to make money in the game other than a yearly tax villagers work contributes to these unlocks
4 population limited by reputation you need a good number of villagers to help unlock tech faster but your population is limited based on your reputation you increase reputation by doing randomly generated tasks for randomly assigned npcs these are usually either a fetch quest or a kill x number of y animal some rep can also be gained by doing the main quest line but its just predetermined busy work instead of random

i deeply wanted to like this game but its not as advertised no challenge and no real risk without any risk or challenge there is no reward imagine a medieval version of the sims except without any social aspect and the only bars are hunger and thirst that makes it essentially a sandbox medieval village builder where you can go hunting if you want if thats your bag then youll enjoy it otherwise stay away

#####

has to be the best game ive played so relaxing and enjoyable hats off to the devs

#####

my husband bought me this game for christmas because i love animal crossing but have also played games like skyrim and ark medieval dynasty has beautiful graphics and appropriate music crafting was easy to figure out i played for like an hour and built my house before realizing after a vicious boar attack that there was no autosave however autosave appears to be working now also i have to keep equipping the wooden spears after i throw them other than that i plan to play this game for many more hours which is nice cuz i dont play a lot of pc game would like a horse and cant wait to get a wife is swimming going to be added cuz right now you just walk around the water dont try to kill deer with a wooden spear you might impale the deer with roughly 6 of them including one right up his butt and he will still walk away a fox however may approach you and allow a direct kill some of the mechanics made me laugh i hope i get a better hunting spear soon really excited to play this game

#####

if kingdom come deliverance and banished had a sweet beautiful baby this would be it this game is fantastic so far and the developers continue to impress with loads of bug fixes and patches right away i packed nearly 40 hours of this game into 1 weekend and cant put it down as i type this i am literally at work about to take the rest of the day off to go home and play more this might just be the game i have been waiting years for yes there are bugs yes some game balancing issues exist but for just releasing into ea it is completely playable and fantastic

farming simulator 1003

#####

it starts out as a fairly basic survival game set in a peaceful environment in early game and evolves into a villagethemed city simulator by the end this game gives the player a unique sense of accomplishment as they slowly grow from being a lone hermit to the leader of their very own village this game is great for players who love to immerse themselves with a lot of freedom theres no single way to thrive with the plethora of method to sustain your settlements economy 400hrs later im still enjoying the management of my economy and the various ways to spend my time in the game

#####

should make a multiplayer mode would be so much fun to play with friends love the game

also would be nice to be able to name animals

#####

this game offers exactly what i was looking for and im so glad to have found it medieval dynasty represents the most chilling survival game where you can build your own village and manage your settlers it has the room for improvement but lets begin with pros

h1what i love about the gameh1

first of all i would like to praise the devs theyre listening the community and updating the game accordingly and they will add so much awaited coop mode

the other thing i absolutely love is ability to change ingame settings such as building limit xp gain rate number of days in each season etc you can even turn on unlimited healthstaminaweight if you just want to focus on expanding your village and forget about surviving in the wild nature

therere many activities to keep you entertained for long hours building hunting exploring blacksmithing cooking etc this list is long also the game has a story and side quests

the world is gorgeous at any time of day and year i can just contemplate the beauty of the nature while exploring the map every season

the music is nice and keeps up the peaceful environment

h1what should be improvedh1

side quests yes its good to have them but therere few problems first of all theyre not numerous and you will find yourself accepting the same missions every now and then most of them are similar and they demand you to bring some item to a person but its getting boring to craft the same bow for 20th time when the amount of craftable items in game is overwhelming another problem is that you almost never see exactly what youre agreeing to do for example they would ask you to bring some materials and only after accepting the task you can see which things exactly do you need to gather early in the game its important because you may not have enough resources to complete the quest and the last problem is missions being not logic sometimes a man is asking for berries when therere a lot in the bushes just outside of his hut a woman is asking for a bow when you can just buy it from her

this is more a wish than complaint but i think the game needs an event log oh i loved to see whats going on in my village when i played banished especially the birth in medieval dynasty the woman leaves her workplace when her child is born but you dont receive any notification 2 ingame years later she can return to work and youre not notified about that neither you can only notice that by scrolling management menu every season which becomes tedious

late in the game there is nothing new to do all quests are repetitive building limit was hit so you cant expand anymore id love to see some other missions or activities for long runs

random events dont occur every season and theyre also repetitive just like side quests id love to see more events with moral choices to make

h1conclusionh1

overall medieval dynasty is a great management game and i will definitely replay it

#####

so i am 37 hours in 
i love the game it has amazing amounts of potential i hope that the development studio is up to the task 
i recommend the game for those looking for a offline relaxing yet challenging experiance 
pros
building freedom  building anywhere on the map is great there are plenty of amazing locations that you can build a pretty cool town of our own 
lots to do  you have a lot of stuff to do to make sure you people are taken care of its complex in some areas of crafting which is great 
early access content  as far as early access games go there is a lot of content available with minimal amounts of bugs nothing ive run into is game breaking yet 
patching  the development studio seems to be pushing patches out for breakfix pretty often only hope they keep this up and release new content every so often in these patches 

cons 
npcs are a little buggy not game breaking but they can be touchy at times 
npc dialog  sometimes the dialog is repeated with the same options 
no voice over for dialog it would be nice if they got some voice actors to actually talk to you 

would like to see added onto the game 
i would like to see more wildlife 
i would like to see tameable wildlife wild cows sheep pigs that you can tame and breed instead of only buying animals from other villages 
 added resources the resource list can be expanded including copper granit marble gravel and much more
 building wells wells were very common in this time era it would help with building in more remote areas 
 roads please for the love of god please give us the ability to expand the road structures to make cooler town layouts 
 roaming merchants adding npcs that walk the main roads that sell goods that might be more rare 
 carts adding the ability to craft carts that the user can pull around for extra storage would be great for mining 
 horses  looks like this is already planned to be added 
 mountain lions
 expand the settings capability to allow the user to set the day longer or shorter have the ability to modify respawn times of resources if wanted 
 more weapons right now the wooden spear is really the only weapon you need in the game with a single headshot killing most everything 
 expand skill set for combat type activities 
 boats  small water craft that you can use to quickly sail up and down the larger water areas 
 bigger map it would be nice to have the map expanded a bit with some different biomes 
 trainers  have npcs that can teach schems that cant be learned through the technology tree 
 god  add religon to the the game 
 buildings church water well guard post towers wooden palasade guard tower wood cutter mill windmill for processing some crops public baths parks halls gardens market square bridges bakeries carpenters hut mason hut watermill wall gates wooden palasade gates theatres grammar schools university 
 ability to collect taxes from your villagers 

just some ideas

#####

i dont recommend the game anymore 1 out of 10 

what a bad update the oxbow has completely ruined the game and my way of playing 
 in the first season of oxbow no matter which way i go bandits and wild animals always come at me to kill me 
 i cant weaken wild animals and bandits in the settings or eliminate bandits altogether so i can continue to play a peaceful mindfulness game 
 stone knives and stone axes are worth almost nothing anymore my whole way of making a startup capital is screwed up 
 instead i should go hunting wild animals that attack and kill me or harmless animals that run away from me totally unsuccessful and i dont even want to hunt 
 how do i get startup capital without being able or willing to hunt let alone die to build a peaceful farming village like i played every game before this stupid update 

i dont recommend the game anymore 1 out of 10

#####

it is far from perfect there is no real character customization the ui is overly complex and confusing the tutorials are inadequate the villager interactions are shallow and get boring fast the main quest sequence ends abruptly and a bit anticlimactically

but if you can get past all that there is a surprisingly rich and satisfying game here i really like the realistic gritty medieval world where there is no magic and you arent some kind of chosen one youre just a man not a woman see no character customization trying to make his way in the world there is a large rich world to explore and building your village to be larger and more selfsufficient is quite satisfying 

the game is slowpaced dont rush to complete everything at once you have plenty of time just take one thing at a time and it can be quite a satisfying experience

#####

the development team render cube did  a very good job the game itself is fun although lacking on content

the publisher toplitz has ruined the vision of the game and slowed progress to milk the game for money i will never buy another game published by toplitz company has become greedy powetripping and cant handle the truth about their games

 to the developer that responded  this is my review for medieval dynasty not wild west dynasty where the posts you are talking about came from are you stalking me now thanks for proving my point about toplitz

#####

help i need to be able to fish with a fish pole and a hook you dont know how important this is for me fishing with line hooks was mainstream in medieval times its been mainstreaming since at least bronze age make it a dlc i dont care just put it there a lot of people will thank you

#####

for this recommendation ive got to start out by saying this is not a great game  it doesnt really excel in anything  the graphics engine is some 20 years old the game mechanics are decent but nothing to write home about the story is drab and without any real emotion or choices  for pretty much every thing i like about it i probably have 3 other games in my library that does it better

so why am i recommending it  somehow all of these mediocre pieces come together to make something more  something about this game draws you in an keeps your attention and motivation and presses lots of different buttons

its half the enjoyment of base building in factorio its half the enjoyment of resource management in rimworld its half the relaxation of playing stardew valley  its half of most everything i like all at once

i can tell that someday the makers of this game are going to come up with something truly spectacular and i encourage everyone to see what they are offering now

#####

clearly i enjoy the game my suggestions
more variety of animals to trap and hunt more fish frogs snakes birds wild goats sheep and horses maybe if we could see birds that would be cool like flying or something maybe nests also the people ignore the roads they should use the roads i have in my village their pathfinding is pretty sad also the cost of technology and goods way too high i gain 1 point for hunting an animal so that means i need to hunt 5000 animals which there arent many of and not often enough takes way too long to get basic technology i mean realistically everyone should know how to build a shovel without having to buy the recipe for 800 bucks i just think theres a lot of balancing to be done the people use the wood and eat but i never see them eating or burning wood in their homes they just stand there they dont do any activities like the kids dont chase each other the adults dont have any leisure activities in the morning when they just stand therecoughing maybe if someone had a mug and like actually drank out of it or if someone sat in the tavern and actually ate id be convinced they need 500 food a day because no one is using the resources but theyre disappearing i get it butlet me see it ill be glad to see where the game goes though its taken me this many hours because everything in the game costs so much and takes so long

#####

good game but devs please listen to our suggestions this game is worth developing more put more depth in end game optimize the performance so as to be able to handle more than the max 140 buildings capacity have more interactions with bandits or bandits attacking settlements let us name our towns more quests and quest lines expand the map territory so much more improvements to go

#####

this game combines survivalbase building with village construction mechanics and does a good job at accomplishing its tasks theres ok amount of content atm and the fact that you have to go miles away just on foot just to reach other villages to trade and gather villagers into your town is cumbersome you can get horses in the game but its way long into the game till you get one they either have to make horses more accessible or invent a better way of traveling it gets boring quickly once you travel a few times on foot

a word of advice dont go into forums and tell that the game needs better optimization or better that better this because the player base and moderators get defensive of the game and they think its a flawless game instead of getting feedback and acknowledging bugs so they can actually fix it ignoring issues wont lead them being successful in the end

other than that graphics are great and gameplay is good id recommend it in this phase if you want more action wait for them to add bandits

#####

this has some serious potential i am hoping that the devs come through with the clutch

some pros

graphics

over all look of the environment in terms of the time

i like how the quests keep you driven to progress

length of seasons a lot of people complain about this but if they were any longer they would be complaining much more there are a multitude of different events that take place mostly environment wise that you would be waiting for excessively if the seasons were longer 

some cons

the ai is not very intelligent at all that goes for all ai 

the conversations are repetitive and nothing short of boring i loathe any interaction with the npcs which really takes away from this games ability to suck you in you really feel alone i realize you are playing a single player game the fact that its all written dialogue does not help with this 

the routines of the npcs is essentially nonexistent

there appears to be nothing you cant take down with just a few spears  this is highly discouraging i spent a fair amount of time preparing for my first bear encounter only to take down two effortlessly where is the incentive to make more advanced weaponry 

i feel like some of the stuff that should be easy is hard and the some of the stuff that should be hard is easy for instance i can take two bears down with no effort at all but if i want to make some basic leather gloves i need to spend 2030 mins collecting the supplies 

i realize that this review may be misinterpreted as a negative one but honestly its not this game has some serious potential to be great and i feel like it wouldnt take too much to get it there if they can find a way to make it more engaging and really make the environment come alive this would be a must have 

in conclusion with the ultimatum being do you recommend this game i cant in its current state if it were for a lesser amount  maybe however if you want to help put up the funding to potentially make a great game happen i highly encourage you to do so

 i cant stress it enough that this has some great potential with that being said and why i cant recommend how many other games have you seen this same statement please dont be a statistic render cube

#####

if you like banished and kcdbuy this

#####

i love this game so much i bought it on xbox and on steam when i finally decided to leave consoles behind my wife and i cant wait for the co op she is the builder in  co op games and i am the hunter

#####

so far this game is matching my expectations spot on exceeding them in some areas coming up short in others for an early access title it is extremely polished and well optimized for a pc i consider middling at best the atmosphere is beautiful and a walk through the woods captures some of the same thrill i got while first playing kingdom come deliverance a steady stream of updates from the developer has shown their commitment to this title and making sure bugs and other gameplay mechanics are implemented in a timely and coherent manner  all in all i am enjoying this title time will tell how fleshed out this game becomes but their roadmap is promising

#####

the mechanism is good and i like it but accessibility is very bad i cant even know the story because the font size is small and not readable i hope the developer see my review and add option for font size thanks

well damn this hurts
there are so many parts of this game that are wonderfully designed with solid implementation and great content if you want to play a sandbox creativemode medieval village maker game this is fantastic you get to layout all these different buildings and props if you build a bench the villagers will use it for a rest if you build a fireplace they will gather there in the evening after doing their jobs the folks you recruit will interact with your village in a really satisfying way living their virtual lives in the place you created
but
the game is broken because the economy doesnt work doesnt make sense has so many elements that are pointless completely out of balance and destroy any sense that this is a real place with real problems to solve it is heartbreaking how a game with so much love and good work can be utterly ruined by thoughtless systems design i get it putting out wellfunctioning features and making major bugfixes gets a lot more attention than we have gone through the entire game and tweaked all of the values so that you are rewarded for actually running the village in a sensible manner rather than making stone arrows and fur boots all day long and then selling them to the absurdly rich merchants who live in stick huts 300 yards away
maybe this should be a thumbsup i got 30 hours worth of really nice gameplay surviving and earning and deciding how to lay out my village and trying to figure out what people i needed and where they should live that was great the problem is the next 100 hours where i slowly learned that none of that actually mattered that i was going to become tremendously rich no matter how stupidly my village was set up and run that none of the economy numbers made any sense whatsoever
heartbreaking

tried to flirt with a girl sitting by the campfire she told me i needed to take a bath 

1010
thumbs up

#####

not for this price 
tldr its soso if i could go back and refund i would it takes way more than 2 hours to figure out if you like it or not
it was fun at first until i finally got to the building which was well beyond refund 
it might be fine for you but its not for me 

the quests are more annoying than fun 
the dialogue is too modern 
theres a lot of back and forth between points or waiting seasons out 
quests pay less than selling a ton of meat 
if you steal items you can only sell them to other villages
some sleeping people magically see you steal their stuff and you lose reputation 
if you kill a farm animal and no one is around you lose reputation
there are no guards or consequences for stealing
you cant attack people other than bandits
you can wait out seasons by sleeping you wake up perfectly healthy and all the vendors are restocked camps are refilled with people 
lootable buildings do not respawn but thats fine 
once youve explored all the major pois and looted them theres no reason to revisit 
mines respawn ore and you can find copper tin iron and salt in the same mine 
you mine an entire cliffside for a couple limestone and a few stone

the survival eat and drink 
the only real true danger seems to be bears when theres more than one 
tree cutting is a pain chop fall chop pick up dig the stump 3 logs for birch 4 for pine and 5 for maple no matter the size of the tree
over abundance of animals food and drinking water with absolutely no consequence to drinking from a swamp
in coop the bandits dont seem to respawn at their locations there dont seem to be any random bandits
a lot of the items are for decoration many of those cannot be sold only placed in world 
most items are useless 

building is slow until you get some people set up to gather materials it starts getting faster
you have to start off micromanaging all your people and their assets until you get everything set up 
people that tell you that theyre good at something dont tell you exactly what it is you cant see their status until youve made them a member of your town 
you need to buy every schematic instead of learning it its all super expensive compared to your reward for questing
you have to wait for your tech experience to level up for each different thing to unlock the ability to even buy schematics
you can sell whatever you want to whoever you want until theyre out of money then you have to wait until the next season to get more money 
you only need 500 reputation to ask people to move in 
keeping them happy is easy even when youre micromanaging them

it became a grind and i lost interest i was just running back and forth and waiting out seasons just trying to earn money for more town abilities so far i only found one special item as a quest reward from a dishonest hunter

#####

okay pros and cons

its highly addicting and will give you hours upon hours of gameplay and the goal alone to own cows have cost me over 200 hours into this game i loved the halloween update where you can roam around looking for scarecrows with valuable loot same with broken down carts they have a lot of neat stuff i love when foxes run past you they go ehehehe

however there are some cons
 bugs causes animals to sail across the landscape in a hunched over mannerwhen the animals die they wrap up into a pretzelthe wolves get a massive underbite
 the horror music at night just chill i came here to have a good time and i am feeling attacked
 i wish there also was a possibility to hunt birds
 instead of rattraps you could have cats owning cats could give a boost that makes food perish slower because it keeps away vermin can also produce feathers because it hunts birds over night 
 dogs as a companion to help you hunt and take down prey if the animal runs off and dies the dog could alert you to where the animal dropped so you dont miss out on valueable resources and could also alert you to treasure nearby 
 the horse riding mechanic is all over the place and makes it extremely difficult to ride a horse 
 there are only two major story driven quests
 i wish you were able to have more than one child if you have twins let them fight for the birthright to rule the settlement gimme some drama or hell become buddies with the king just to overthrow him
 possibility for implementing a good deedbad deed counter good deed help as many people as possible bad deed steal be married and have a mistress and bastard children in every settlement ect will give boost or penalties for future generations 
 having to go by each work station to refill tools when there are plenty tools in storage this is very tiresome and time consuming

pretty good early access game if you are into rpgs and world  city building  reminds me a lot like kingdoms but with higher production value    you can ignore the top reviewer who is talking about day and night cycles being so short  is he wrong possibly  but one thing i can say for sure is with his 8 hours playtime he didnt even get out of a season i have played over 2 hours and havent seen winter yet  

so how is he complaining about getting ready for winter when he hasnt even played enough to see winter

is the game perfect definitely notyet  but its still in early access  so that means there is more to be added and balance changes will happen   the dev even has a roadmap out

i recommend giving it a go if you are into medieval rpg sandbox  crafting  world building games

#####

a first person survival medieval life sim citybuilder it shouldnt work together but it all does beautifully my biggest pleasant surprise in gaming this year

#####

the game gives you a bit of skyrim with survival elements but without a great story dragons lots of fights
it is basically one big grind of materials
your own town npcs are not a big help at all the npc management mechanics are not easy to follow and even when you give your npcs the best tools  weapons their work output is sad 
in the end you are running around killing animals chopping trees and mining materials in order for you to pay tax each year
it almost feels like real life but then many 100s of years ago  if you like to get that feeling and can take the game design flaws in you can spend 100s of hours to build up your civilization

#####

b i summary  i b

b pros b 
 incredibly beautiful world with many cute aspects eg baby animals being born in your animal husbandry facilities
 very satisfying gathering and building experience you can create real wonders with some patience and creativity
 quite complex technology tree and production chains with npcs observably engaging in their assigned work tasks
 every setting is customizable to your wish without cheating or mods eg how fast time passes xp gathering rate building limit too but only up to 200 of normal strength of enemies building time crafting time and many other things
 developers keep coming up with new updates a few times per year multiplayer option is coming soon
 you can manage and experience the life events daily routines of your npc inhabitants who all have a name and to some extent a distinct personality type thus the village really feels alive kids are cute and you can gift them toys which they will happily play with 

b cons b 
 npc pathfinding is still awful causing both you and npcs to get stuck frequently luckily there is an im stuck function because without that the game would be unplayable
 story is brief and not too immersive dynasty aspect is practically missing no reason or motivation to experience several generations
 side quests are very simple and repetitive same goes for random events that have little to no effect to your experience eg an npc who is a tailor can give you a quest to bring them 5 units of wool you can literally buy 5 wool from the same person then hand it in immediately to finish the quest
 very limited interaction options with npcs
 combat is not interesting very repetitive and there isnt any level of craftable armor despite having access to advanced leatherwork and iron smithing so youre basically restricted to using a bow or crossbow since using melee weapons is risky against 4 enemies  as it should be also mounted combat is not possible
 economy feels not too well thoughtout couldve used some polishing eg even though you can produce a decent variety of tailored items your inhabitants will not use any of them so the only possible use for those is to sell them however they have a very high value per item so you cannot sell as many as you are producing even with multiple lvl10 traders same goes for the massive amount of cheese lol available food quality and variety doesnt seem to affect npcs mood or health at all so you could just keep them solely on a cheese  water diet and youre all good overall its nice to produce so many different things but there isnt any reward at all for operating a very complex production system vs producing only the most basic things 
 xp gathering rates are unbalanced for different activities which is a minor annoyance

i b in detail b i 

this game is for those players who enjoy a sandboxlike experience in a beautiful peaceful world and setting up their own goals because the story can be finished rather quickly and it isnt too interesting or immersive after that the only quests youll have are always the same repetitive ones of which there are like 10 different variations and thats all but youll probably still be farfar away from having an old enough heir to experience the dynasty aspect 99 of players never get that far 
also its good to know that it is not a survival game if thats what youre looking for no one and nothing will hinder your progress or directly attack you unless you cross their path and choose not to run away the nature is full with food and supplies so there isnt much challenge in surviving here even if you have a village with 200 inhabitants its really easy to feed them all and taking care of their needs 

but if you like building and beautifying a village from literally nothing where even the smallest detail was planned built and customized by yourself and the bigger it grows the more challenging it becomes to manage then youll probably enjoy playing this game pretty much a big part of gameplay is calculating exact amounts of materials and resources and balancing the output values of extraction production and consumption because thats the only way which enables your village to run automatically without too much intervention and when you managed to reach that point youve maxed your skills and hoarded a uselessly great amount of wealth your son is still probably only 14 years old so you must play at least another 4 years to be able to pass on leadership of your dynasty and then your game is practically over there are zero new missions or even a meaningful cutscene dialogue etc when your son takes over so the dynasty aspect  in contrast to the games title  is entirely missing from the game unless you want to continue playing another 20 years with nothing new happening and without the ability to buildexpand anymore because youve reached the max building limit 

id give a 6510 or 710 currently because of the many issues that could be improved but the developers are busy creating coop i wouldve been happier if they fixed the game and added more contentlore to it first but lets hope theyll get to that too eventually

#####

we hope u to  add online coplay


#####

simply cannot stop playing

#####

i absolutely love this game but its still very poor on immersion and endgame content 

the game is like 5050 on role playing and managementbuilding its a part banished the game but in first person and looks like kingdom come deliverance but minus the details and immersion

the mechanics isnt bad for me i like the pacing of new skills and unlocking new technologies it doesnt feel too grindy for me but sometimes youd be so busy running around with endless chores or be really bored and got nothing to do but wait for the next season
things id like to have 
 voice actingcutscenes for immersion
 more dialogues for certain npcs
 more weight allowance for starters or reduced some necessities weight
 trading with other out of world npcs wandering caravans etc
 more politics and possibility to ascent to nobilities
 character customization looks names
 make npcs react to danger and ability to set watchmen
 variation in animals buildings add more aesthethic purposes stuff

#####

looks promising but in its current its unnplayable
 with current hunger rates it feels like eating simulator youll need to eat several boars a day to survive
 hunting is unbalanced same amounts of meat from boar and a fox
 combat is a joke bows are useless and spear has a reach of a dagger
 prices of  goods are completely unrealistic with basic ingredients costing more than the final product

ill check back in a year but in the games current state i cant recommend it

#####

the game play is honestly great but could use a little extra in the way of tutorials it took me awhile to catch onto the game and the first winter really was difficult not knowing i would need torches heading into it i feel the building limitations could be lifted a bit as i find i have need for certain buildings but cant obtain them without complete destruction of others there are certain quests i can not finish until these buildings are built and honestly it gets a bit annoying at those times sometimes figuring out where to store certain items for use can also be a tad annoying or finding out where your villagers are putting items it took me forever to figure out why they were not doing their jobs either fishing spawns could be a bit more practical seasons could also be longer then 4 days otherwise it is a very well thought out game and i have found myself all around happy with the game play i find myself sucked into the game and working hard at completing quests to further advance my village i would rate it a 910 incredible game play but some things could use a tad bit of work in the name of furthering the game along especially in the start

#####

tldr should you buy this game probably yes if you like rpgs and the historical medieval world

if a quasirealistic lifestyle simulator set in a medieval eastern european setting sounds like something up your alley then this game is for you gameplay focuses on achieving skillset milestones that allow for progression of the overall story the game is not as much as a survival simulator as it is an rpg making play more casual than stressful resource management does play a central role in the game which can become tedious at times but again  its a quasirealistic lifestyle simulator set in a medieval eastern european serfs didnt spend all day laying siege to castles no they spent it making sure they put in enough crops before the growing season ended and winter came 

youll find that you will indeed need to put in work to get useful and more convenient tools your ability to build and make things is dependent on just how much effort you put into acquiring the skills to do so is it grindy yes but the grinding does pay off when you are able to assign tasks to your eventual villagers suddenly you wont be worried about food hindering your time because youll have loads of it and of increasing quantity coin wont be a problem as you will eventually have more valuable things to sell produced in less time and not through single effort your villagers will be your engine to success 

some cons if you can call them that currently at this time its a quest taker if you really want to get ahead soandso wants you to do some menial tasks so you get a bonus theres no real threat to your wellbeing as food in the wilderness is plentiful and deadly animals are relatively rare the hunger and health dial are reset at the beginning of each season so there isnt much incentive to store food unless youre going into winter where only game can be hunted the game leaves out that real ant  the grasshopper fable fear which i would like personally maybe this is an option but not the default its a bit of a walking simulator not unlike what life would be in this type of setting  ie the sticks wont collect themselves

the pros the natural world is impacted by your resource gathering trees take many seasons to grow back you can theoretically create a barren landscape that will impact your ability to progress in the game the game rewards hard work and planning the tech tree is intricate and demands some finesse when managing your fields and village the game looks amazing and feels alive the seasonal progression is unique and well thought out i love the idea of needing to have an heir to continue your line hence the name medieval dynasty yes if you die you take over as your male adult son if hes old enough if not game over this is not a game for the quickly bored and yes the gameplay spans literal years of ingame time the multigenerational aspect makes this a challenge the game is stable i have great frame rates hovering above 60fps ive not had a crash once 

some things id like to see more life given to the npcs the dialogue is sparse and the people are mere pawns waiting for you to recruit them buy from them or to satisfy their quest needs id like more rpg aspects added with character backstories and motivations as already stated id like more survival aspects added should i really be able to chop down trees or till fields in the dead of winter the trees and ground are frozen etc why dont i collect all those deer antlers if the villagers love venison then why is all the animal meat just deemed meat would coop be great in this heck yeah would it be cool if villagers ventured out from their villages to run errands and say hello to their good buddy yes do these people have a culture beyond staying alive holidays this one really gets me can i pick my sweetie some nice flowers in the hopes she will be my wife and continue my dynastic line let me pick the pretty flowers please 

buy the game

edit eat me haslador i like the game

#####

4 and a half hours in and what can i say it has so much potential it is truly a beautiful game player movement is fluid and basic action like chopping a tree feel as it should it surprisingly has more content than i had originally expected for a brand new early access game it is far from being perfect however the devs are certainly on the right track this game i believe will one day be an amazing single player survival game it does have bugs however more polished than i originally had expectedbugsas for bugs i have encountered a few that may break a few peoples immersion such as glitched twig snap sounds that repeat constantly until u restart your game npcs that sit on the same stool forcing them to float mid air on top of each other as well as wonky movement from animals specifically wolves whos animations dont quite match the speed they are running atif you can get past simple nongame breaking bugs like the ones above pick this game up and enjoy what i believe will be one day be one of the top survival games available on steam cheers

#####

unfortunately i have to give this game a no 
it is made with love and alot of details but the lack of actual late game content is very sad

first of all the game consists of a lot of grinding 
most things cannot be done until you have collected ridiculous amounts of research points
this includes most recipes which leads to strange situations where you cannot fry an egg or bake bread until you played like 30 hours through when you reach this point then it does not really feel like the effort of creating a town just to make bronze tools and fry eggs going iron takes even longer and less interesting

what certainly bothers me most is that making the village gets old very quickly
i expected at least a hundred hours from a game that wants 30 bucks from you
however creating the village gets boring so fast because there is nothing fun to do or to see after most basic buidlings stand

of course you can build a lot of realistic buidlings however the depth here is missing
your villagers just pretend to work no one really chops wood there is an animation but the trees stay
they roam the woods and pretend to collect stuff most idiotic looking are hunters that shoot one shot at a boar and than just walk away while the boar is chasing your villager through the town

this leads to the effect that you dont feel like you are creating something worth all that grinding
its just a ghost town of robots that just pretend to work the only industry actually doing something are farmers
at least they sow and bury the fields but nobody else actually does something 
then you also have these weird animations and sounds when crafting items which completely destroys the atmosphere
you just feel silly playing this for longer than 25 hours

what adds to this is that the story does not make up for anything the lines are not voiced and the script is extremely boring to read at some point you begin to skip through the dialog because its so annoying this story you get is also very unbalanced you achieve the possibility to build a ton of buildings long before being able to craft something interesting

all in all this feels like an atmospheric medieval chillout game that you can put in about 25 hours
so its not worth 30 bucks but rather about 15 or less on sale maybe they include some more enganging late game mechanics in the future but for now i cannot recommend it even though it is not straight out bad



#####

i am really enjoying this game i have one suggestion and that is horses and carts to stay true to the medieval village theme i would put in riding and packing horses not warhorses

#####

very grindy if you are into that type of game for being in alpha still runs very well

#####

wife cheated on me with underpaid hunter 
1010

#####

play at your own pace by your own rules run your farm yourself or have npcs do it for you and spend your days hunting instead have 1 day seasons or 30 doesnt matter use health points stamina and carry weight limits or be an immortal demigod who doesnt even need food
spend the day making money or just decorating your village the freedom in this game is wonderful
just dont even think about rotating your fields its the law

#####

its an interesting spin on the survival grind similar activity to others gather resources build a decent story line and narrative

theres some work required before betarelease if it gets there 

 the economics need balancing right now theres no point having villagers invest time in making premium items like iron tools or clothing its quicker to sell raw materials and in many cases more profitable gathering berries shouldnt be more profitable than making winter clothing 

 production particularly the farming and food calculations you should be able to run x amount of farm fields independently for every season cycle the speed in which workers work and items are created eg fertilizer from manure means you can only farm a single 16 square field every 23 seasons independently others need you to buy supplies

 workers are very slow comparatively to the main character in some tasks hunting and logging seem relatively balanced but cooking sewing and tool making are painfully slow the work the main character does in 3 minutes will take a worker about 5 years in game time 

the above renders the main concept of the game a bit redundant as you run around doing everything yourself anyway 



#####

my only qualm with this game is that its still an alpha i want more

at the time of writing this the project is ridiculously promising you could buy it in alpha and easily get 2050 hours out of it depending on what kind of content draws you in if you simply like the idea of building your town and amassing wealth as much as the game will let you or watching your village age with neighbors marrying each other and children being born then you can already get 50 hours out of this if you want quest or story content its still limited so youll be on the low end

in my opinion this game offers three main things exploration rpg elements where you level your character and a simulated city builder in medieval poland the rpg elements directly affect what youre allowed to build and craft so the start of the game is mostly about becoming selfsufficient and unlocking such things the world is surprisingly large for a genre that doesnt need a huge world but its nonetheless a welcome surprise to zoom out on the map menu and realize how much there is 

and finally building your town is perhaps the biggest draw at the moment and the most promising you can build your town anywhere in the world and you get to place every individual building or piece of decor each one will need to be handcrafted by you you recruit people to move into your town who then help with oddjobs like hunting and chopping wood this frees up your time to do things you wanted to do beforehand but couldnt for example id say the beginning of the game largely demands you hunt because otherwise you dont eat and you die once you get a good hunter on staff though youre free to concentrate on other things like expanding your farmland or starting a craft such as sewing or smithing these too can eventually be automated

the npcs are pretty basic atm and have short interactions that either raise or decrease their relationship with you however to me the interesting part is that both yourself and your townies can get married and have kids meaning new generations of each town will come while i didnt get too far into this trying to stop playing so i have more content to come back to for the next big update i can say ive seen npc models for toddlers children and teens so i get the vibe they plan for npcs to slowly grow with time this means you can slowly build your own sprawling village with citizens who each have their own job and their own life you get to watch your town grow with you

npc jobs are also fairly responsive and let you know what they need whilst letting you choose what they produce only the shopkeepers seem currently inactive and serve no purpose yet whilst innkeepers cook waaaaaay too slow and need some tweaking

theres a building and upgrade system to improve both the look and the villager satisfaction of certain buildings your farm animals can reproduce and up your animal count eventually you go from needing to buy fertilizer to being selfsufficient with half your farmers gathering fertilizer from animals whilst the others use it to sow fields i could go on and on

understand this game is an alpha of course theres potential for the devs to screw up and make this game a nonfunctional dud however for the moment i will be watching its progress with great interest my only complaint being i wish there was already more


some minor suggestions for the devs should they happen to read

villager wood consumption is lolwtf are they all pyromaniacs please tone it down a bit it feels like i need multiple woodsheds just to feed their demand for firewood

while the weight of logs is realistic it also makes building new buildings the slowest most annoying job in the game some form of solution would be fantastic here whether it be buffing the gather rate of lumberjack villagers letting you place a blueprint without having all 10 logs the building first needs for the foundation or letting you automatically use logs in the resource storage when building without them needing to be directly in your inventory

give each vil a personality type thats apparent to the player to add a little more skilldepth to social interactions where the player can memorize which responses are favored and unfavored by personality type as it stands the system is serviceable but pretty barebones

give each village a different specialty in terms of products sold or quests added as it stands i struggle to justify making the journey out to villages on the edge of the map if they each had a unique specialty though where i can find a large supply of a given type of product in that village for example one village having every crop type then suddenly i have justification to do so i see elements of this already with certain tools being available only in certain towns but more of this would be welcome

#####

this game should be medieval farmers village theres no dynasty here thats basically what you are a lone farmer that builds up to a village that has mills market etc because everyone in your family are dead and all crooks the weird part about this game is that you can basically build a farm anywhere no permission from anyone once the farm is set up you get taxed by some random dude that lives on a smaller farm village than yours you technically have more power than him because the people in your village works under you you can easily have over 100 people working in your village hunting crafting smithing etc etc what is weird is that you cant build a fortress or a castle to help protect the people inside your village you basically have to fight the bandits and robbers yourself while the villagers just stand around and do nothing theres not a real government system you just basically paid taxes you really dont get punish except when you lose reputation for stealing its a bit lame on that part also theres no religion and you know if you took history in hs and college religion plays a huge role in the medieval times so theres no churchesor anything holy imo kingdom come deliverance still is the best medieval real timefree world game

#####

finally i found a proper and beautiful game that have a gameplay à la fallout 4 settlements but with more detailed gameplay on management survival and crafting part and the setting of this game in medieval era à la kingdom come deliverance i found this game after researching digging buy and try another similar games genre here and there and most of them always have zombiesetc and this game is free from that and this one almost tick all the boxes that i want 
bbut this game really need steam workshopmod support to keep its longevity tbh also some coop element like stardew valley maybeb
if you still actively searching and want to play something that similar to those types of games and genre that i stated above definitely recommend this game

not gonna lie im drafting this review for so long like after i bought and played this game in early access like years ago or something straight after this game released i literally have several bullet points in pros and tons of bullet point in cons ready to post but i try to keep playing it until stable version released like now at the time this review posted and those cons of this game that i want to post in the past gone one by one in short it keeps getting better and better keep up your good works dev 

h1prosh1
 beautiful scenery and graphics
 open world  survival  crafting  base building games without zombies etc
 set in medieval era à la kingdom come deliverance and you play as henry strikeof skalitzstrike
 gameplay à la fallout 4 settlements you basically can build your own town recruit npcs to your town working with you etc
 finally this game has customize game menu and you can change any parameter after you start your save game starting new save game is not needed anymore if you want to change some parameters like how long day per season cycle xp multiplier etc
 finally this game has 3rd person mode you can change between 1st person mode to 3rd person mode anytime you want

h1consh1
 story is not this game strong suit
 lack of steam workshopmod support at the time this review posted because this type of game especially this game need this things so bad to add any content that players want or things thats lacking from their gameplay and to keep its longevity

overall recommend this game
8  10

#####

such an amazing game unlike some other survival games ive played this one gives you that sense of community as you progress and grow your settlement i played one playthrough where i worked hard over several years to build up a thriving village with dozens of villagers children growing up and farm animals roaming the streets i played another playthrough where i spent several years alone with just myself to run the work stations and care for the animals before finally settling down when racimir is in his 30s both ways provided hundreds of hours of entertainment you can play however you want to which was so refreshing 
the settings for your game can be completely customized if you dont want bandits turn them off anytime or add them in whenever youd like change the xp experience amount you and your villagers receive or turn off your stamina so you can run forever its all up to you to play how you want and i love that since sometimes its nice to just relax and build after a long day the versatility is really amazing and shows how much love was put into this game the only thing i would have liked was more to the main story since i really enjoyed the interactions with others outside my settlement or for it to have picked up after a certain amount of time maybe old friends show up and come with a new quest line the game is still in early access so who knows
overall highly recommend this game its fun for everyone but still a survival challenge

#####

i have mixed feelings about this game
overall it is a relaxing game it is relaxing to build a settlement to go out hunting then sit back and read a book while you craft 

my problem is that access to a lot of content takes forever to get to in a sandbox game if i dont have access to the majority the content within 20 hours i start to lose interest the grind becames a substitute for fun or enjoyment 45 hours in and i still dont have mines i understand you can change some settings to make it easier but that is an out for a lack of fun elements 

overall i have enjoyed my time playing the game but grinding should not be a substitution for fun or content i had enough of grinding in eve online to never want to do it in a game again

#####

i really cant work out how i feel about this game i like it i have 258 hours played over a few years at different stages of alpha and full release i dont often review games but i really want this game to be great mainly because of its main draw for me its incredibly relaxing

the grind is great almost constantly changing in what you need to be getting sneaky addicting stuff

if the roadmap for the game already mentions a seperate sandbox mode then awesome if it doesnt then it should i know you can basically ignore the story quests but theres just a few times it absolutely makes things rubbish and kills the vibeive normally had a kid by the time i bother going out to hunt the big game sectionjust let me build my town

#####

this is one of the easiest games to sink time into plays phenomenally on the steam deck

#####

feeds the adhd gremlins this game does much progression very calming addicting

#####

i started as a character who had escaped from a life of slavery when bandits attacked the caravan

five years in i sit back and look at the town that i have built entirely on my own  every house that my villagers complain isnt fancy enough every farm field the i plowed myself where my villagers complain that they have to sit in a chair and watch over every piece of furniture that my villagers complain isnt good enough every gravel path the my villagers ignore and half the food in the storehouse that i went out and hunted myself so that they can complain that there isnt enough variety and whine that i havent cooked it all for them myself

i look upon all that i have accomplished  my applause is yet more villagers complaining about how none of it is good enough and why havent i solved this problem the same way i solved all their previous problems after literally chopping down an entire forest of trees and building the very homes that they live in

it is only then do i realize i never truly escaped from slavery

i then spent the rest my avatars life just hunting down bandits  they had to pay for what they did  i was better off before when i only had boneb ungrateful master to torment me

#####

hooo boy where do i start i bought this game way back when it was released into early access played it for a decent amount of time before putting it down and wanting to wait until everything was fleshed out and complete with all major bugs squashed etc the game was fun back then but was lacking some things to really make it special now here we are on the 10 full release and after seeing the announcement in my news feed i was excited to finally play a completed product and this is where the problem lies

the fun wears out after you realise this game is not finished despite having been recently fully released and the bugs missing content missing sounds placeholder item descriptions countless spelling and grammatical errors flying villagers bare bones survival elements all you need is water and food how does that constitute survival poorly implemented hunting mechanics minimalist building features you can place premade structures you cant actually build them wall by wall and place things how you want to make custom buildings nor can you actually sit on any chairs you make wow nonsensical technology tree you can unlock a fishing hut early on but the fishing spear you need to allow any villagers to fish is locked due to the later tech linen thread needed to craft said spear face palm pointless crafting items such as several different types of clothing the problem being the game is first person and you cant see your character apparently they are adding a thirdperson mode later to this already finished product the complete lack of indepth tutorials explaining any of the more intricate and obscure features of the game i could go on

then theres the false advertising i already mentioned the survival aspect of the game but apart from the other incorrect statements made on the store page there is one huge glaring issue with the games visual advertisement there is a windmill in the art yet you cant build a windmill in the game they say they will add it later but i thought this game was fully released shrug

anyway if you want an uneventful simplified first person version of stardew valley and thats being very mean to stardew valley im sorry that game was far better in every way shape and form go ahead and give it a try but i would advise you to spend your money elsewhere 50 aud is highway robbery in my books for this unfinished game actually now that i think about it thats the reason they went full release so they could jack up the price it all makes sense now

#####

its an extremely promising game that ive enjoyed very much and that i think many people who like the medieval theme would love to play this game however i just cant recommend it because there just isnt enough content

update 
i am going to have to recommend this even less if thats even a thing it looked promising i say looked because it is no longer in early access with not much being added or changed the game still feels really empty for a full release the fact that its now out of early access doesnt give me much hope either if they think the game is in an complete state then why would the devs make any more major updates it just doesnt seem that promising

come back in a year or two and see how it is

#####

live out your fantasy of freezing to death in the winter your wife and child slowly fading away into the black then  you can harvest your wheat and pay taxes a


#####

this is a very very plesant game i highly recommend it two things it is missing though
1 when you reach midgame there is a lack of incentive to keep pushing to motivate one into building house number 15 and so on you kinda have seen most things by now except for the windmill
2 a practical purpose for the kitchen if cooking would increase the nutritional value of food to more than the sum of its parts it would be the absolute drive for getting all sorts of various farms animals and so on right now 1 potato  1 meat give the same nutritional value to you and your villagers whether you cook them or not please correct me if i am wrong

but despite those things which may very well be added in in the future this si a brilliant game

#####

this game is great for its price it actually delivers on its promise of medieval era survival rpg and building an eventual city i will only talk about points of improvements here read the good stuff from the other reviews they are mostly true

why the thumbs down then 
because i want this game to have community mods so badly to achieve its true potential

you start out loving the game its beautiful and immersive then as you progress you want more of each aspect of the game but i know unless the devs go full no man sky on this with a bigger team to boot i will never get that

 hunting is across 8 animals and only 3 kinds of drops fur leather meat killing a big bad bear gives you 3x more leather and meat than a simple deer you kill with day 1 stone spear why bother hunting big prey or dangerous predators

 farming is meaningless just grow 1 crop to make 1 product for money why grow difference crops to make tier 3 food when all it gives is 5x more food than a basic roast meat giving different food to your village gives no benefits just feed them roast meat forever

 crafting is kinda nice lots of products to enable different jobs but the aesthetic items are so limited just clay pottery and some straw baskets cant even light up the village nicely only 2 lighting furniture stay in eternal darkness till midgame too standing torch is pretty high end stuff apparently

 parenthood and eventually passing your dynasty to your child great concept zero purpose the child has little to no interaction parts just grows up into another villager to work for you you play as your heir when you eventually die of old age so you are just growing an extra life

 npc management of your village is great the npc moves to the assigned work locations and start planting seeds on each tile hitting the trees for wood wow but i really want more interaction with them more npc needs or quests or events and add some benefits to helping them too increase their stats or happiness or something special happening

 and so much more mining woodcutting scenic features quest types this game has everything you want in a survival rpg but only 34 pieces of it in each category

devs if you are busy improving qol aspects of the game and debugging please create a mod platform for the community to breathe life into this amazing world you have created turning this into another skyrim or ark is not impossible if you give your community the tools

#####

i would love to shrink the entire world down make everything 75 smaller so the world is bigger i would love to give the ai sims 3 abilities because currently they are meaningless you could care less if any of them die because you have no attachment to them they are mindless automatons the game lacks personality to want to play it other than that its ok

#####

dont start playing unless youre cool with staying up til 5am and destroying your sleep schedule

#####

yes it is a fun game but the end game is pretty dull

i was excited along the way to start crafting my own clothing and make my buildings out of stone and build palisades but then once i had this it was kind of like  now what there really isnt much of an end game i guess i dont know what i was expecting  what could the end game even be like but it still felt empty 

i guess it is sort of like the sims you start off and are excited to build a house and get money and a family but then what i guess just survive its not hard once youre established youd have to really try to fail once youre in the late game so it feels kind of boring once you hit the end

#####

great game and keeps getting better and better the technology needs a tuning to cause 5000 points for horses little outrageous  point system i been playing for over 300 hrs and still no where close to getting the horses only just about to get cows so tech points need a little fix but other then that its a great game either boost up the farming points or reduce the cost of farming tech


#####

this game is unfinished and should be early access and if you look at the companys other offerings its clear this is their modus operandi they release a new dynasty game every 12 years and its the exact same thing with a new skin

all of the following game elements serve absolutely no purpose
 upgraded food
 taverns
 alcohol
 most potionspoisons
 villager mood

design wise there are two critical problems with the progression in the game that severely hamper playability
 villager cooks are agonizingly slow meaning you need to cook most of the food by hand its absolutely insane how slow they are
 it is not possible to automate copper and tin despite them being used by the smithy very early in the production chain which means you need to mine completely by hand when you do unlock the mine you can immediately transition to iron defeating the entire point of having copper and tin limited to the mine

#####

if you will enjoy this game and how many hours you will spend playing it depends on what you want from a game what kind of player you are and what type of gameplay you enjoy it is aside from the occasional dangerous animal and bandit encounters planned for the future no action packed hack and slash adventure in a medieval setting there is no magic and there are no dragons you are no king and lead no armies instead you have escaped from war and found refuge in a more peaceful valley still you are no complete nobody with a hammer in your hand the local populations watchful eyes at your back and the will to survive in your heart you venture forth to build your home your village your community from a small hut in the forest to a thriving community this is your adventure the adventure of your family this is your dynasty not noble but earned

are there bugs sure are there still features missing yes however in many aspects the game is already very playable runs smoothly for most and certainly looks good that aside the devs so far have released regular fixes and are as enthusiastic as the welcoming and helpful community they are keeping an eye on said community suggestions and complaints

in general early access always comes with a certain risk you can have hopes and fears but you just do not know what exactly a game is going to become and how long down the road the devs andor publisher are going to support it when i bought this game i not only enjoyed what i had seen of it at that point i first and foremost considered this a project worth supporting i am part of this project now and i have not once regretted it not only do i see a lot of potential i have already gotten something out of it that makes it worth the risk

i have to add that personally in my own current playthrough i have not run into any truly game breaking bugs i enjoy what writing and characters there are few as they are so far and im looking forward to seeing more of that

if you enjoy survival building crafting farming and hunting the occasional quest and banter with npcs a more laidback experience a medieval setting focussed more on the aspects of daily life than the fate of kingdoms then this might be the game for you

ps wasnt on the dev team when this was written and am so now plus a lot has changed since then many bugs fixed story updated a lot of content and features added so take this review with a grain of salt regardless and check other reviews gameplay videos etc as well 

#####

with full release here its time to say that this game is very fun and worth consideration if youre looking for a cozy medieval survival craftemup simulator i wont say that its the greatest title in an oversaturated genre because firstperson management buildathons are a dime a dozen but this game is a quality contribution and if you can get into its medieval european vibe then you can easily sink many comfy hours into building your village and growing your family

ive played since early access first released on steam and the developers have proven their commitment to engaging with community feedback to refine its many interlocking systems and keep adding more detail and content the game has grown to incorporate a lot of systems involving your crafting building eating surviving etc some of the mechanics such as the villager occupations can be arcane at first but the full release so far has detailed tutorials and quests to guide you through learning the systems it seems much more accessible than before in one of my earliest files i played at least a dozen hours before realizing none of my villagers had been working then stumbled upon a submenu devoted entirely to that function there are lots of things to discover and figure out in this game and im optimistic about what theyll continue to add

im at a loss to detail any criticisms because the fundamental gameplay is solid the visuals are excellent the game is smooth and not buggy the only thing i find myself wanting is more



#####

you can throw rocks at your friends 1010

#####

this game shows great promise reminding me of the atmosphere of banished on a smaller scale or kingdom come deliverance from a graphical standpoint unfortunately some glaring flaws shine through that remind the player that its early access causing me to not recommend the game in its current state

 logs you need so so many logs and have no current way to transport large amounts when im building structures i find myself having to go further and further from my village to acquire logs as the forest around my territory is thinned out i emptied my inventory to accommodate the massive amount of weight but it still a huge grind and lots of boring walking back and forth to build even a small structure more than half the time i put into this game so far is just cutting down and transporting logs

 no way to recover building materials if you need to remove a structure i accidentally built two food storage buildings instead of a food storage and a resource storage a simple but very costly mistake removing the building netted me zero materials so i basically just wasted precious logs for nothing

 it feels ridiculous to need food and resource storage buildings to satisfy your villagers needs why cant i place the materials in the chest in their house while i understand that in the late game this can be quite convenient when you only have a few villagers it feels like a needless requirement

 as other reviewers have said you need to eat so much food to survive the equivalent of a large animal daily while hunting isnt hard it can be time consuming if you have a whole village to feed as well as the many other needs

one day this game will be great and i will be revisiting and updating this review in the future but as it stands it is too grindy and frustrating to earn my recommendation

#####

starts off as a survival game that seamlessly morphs into a colony management sim

#####

totally addicted first of all this isnt a quick game where you progress fast its a slog to get enough tech to build what you want ive played 160 hours and im nowhere near being able to build a mine to get iron but thats the beauty of this game  just keep going  who wants to run around like a headless chicken in games like satisfactory when you can just chill doing a bit of farming hunting building even sewing or how about a bit of fishing  once you are at town level you can set up your markets innkeepers miners fishers craftspeople wood cutters and hunters and go for a walk doing as you please then come back to another load of money to spend watch out though because they breed like rabbits and before you know it they are all on paternity leave for two years progressive social justice and equality in medieval times
all that said i think my wife is cheating on me always in the tavern sat next to this dodgy looking bloke now how do i kill him

so version 1  so much easier in many ways yet some new challenges im enjoying it still with a few caveats i appreciate the speed we can now progress not so much of a grind to get tech people are now animated and dont just stand around  much easier for anyone new to the game to get a decent village going 
im disappointed by the story though lots more words but essentially the same and can be completed very early i thought the story would be much longer and be more complex but i completed it in a couple of game years 
im playing the beta so i can get more people in my town really need to get rid of the need for rep to recruit on  version 1  
an excellent game i see players put thousands of hours into a game on steam but 397 hours is massive for me which says everything ive loved almost every minute of it well done to the people who made the game big thumbs up from me

#####

devs are working on it 100 of the time very promising 


#####

i love the game its enticing my only downfall is that i have to manually restock all axes picks bows and the sort for my npcs to do their jobs
could definintly use a tool shed where npc will restock by themselves while im away doing quests or just lounging around building new things to expand my village

#####

i want to give this game a big thumbs up i really do graphically it is good the quests are a bit samey so far but feel like a gopher go for this go for that no real challenge to them so far but when i get bored of questing what should be good is building up my dynasty more medieval mothering than medieval dynasty why

the management of a settlement at least as far as i can figure out is just like being a den mother wood is magically chopped and moved to a resource centre work seems to get done yet all the villagers just end up chatting if you dont be a maid and move food from one place to another for your dynasty they complain and leave so the guy in the hunting lodge making a ton of food complains that there is no food to eat because there is no food in his chest in his house and that seems to fall to you medieval mother

its the managment mechanics that let what could be a really accomplished game down some of the missions are just well tedious 

oh and food i am pretty sure my character has holes in his feet i killed a boar gave me 12 pieces of meat and cooked them all and my guy was only half full devs the food things has to be remedied i feel like all my guy is doing is eating and hunting all the time

now i am only 11 hours in and i will persevere at it but a lot of the common sensical actions should be changed make the settlement management more fluid less micro managing make the food stats more accurate 

the game has really great potential graphically gameplay wise but please please devs iron out the settlement management and the food consumption issue

ty

#####

in summary its a peasant simulator if you have an interest in the aspects of medieval history that dont involve knights or battles and youve been itching to build a village in a sandboxtype environment i think youll either love the idea outright or not see the point in it at all 

i wanted to play something like this game from the moment i finished kingdom come a game that scratched the surface of village management but focused more on combat and story this game is much more about the mundane aspects of medieval life and much more focused on planning and managing your village youll be delivering shipments of carved spoons and collected feathers to trade for manure to haul back to your village and fertilize your crops so you can feed your handful of villagers and hopefully have a slightly better time next year and not have to hustle so much 

if you like games like farming sim and ostriv this game is probably for you a game like this was not just a good idea i think its necessary to cover a really fun and interesting aspect of history the lives of the masses the rest of the review is more for the devs 

id like to see more house styles added to the game notably the loading screens have a couple of pictures of long hallstyle homes with short walls and tall wide thatched roofs that would have been common on the fringes of the village where more space was available

in general the endgame could use more progression better housing and production buildings would be good to have the toptier production buildings be two story buildings with housing on top as was common in developing medieval towns that had to maximize use of space 

the tavern and market should be unlocked much sooner as it stands your village will develop a lot before your people have a place to sit down and drink and the market is unlocked around when a player will stop playing the game so you miss out on the functionality of what should be an essential building having to make trade runs for 100 hours yourself is tedious 

small random strangers along the roadside and onetime minievents sprinkled throughout the game would help build incentive to keep playing as would more complex luxury production lines such as glassware candles masonry goldsmithsilversmith 

hosting fairs market days and holiday festivals would help break lategame monotony 

hosting a church and priest could add demand for candles and silverwork having some interaction with the clergy and nobility would be nice right now there isnt any religious or upperclass presence on the map the local count or baron should have a modest keep on one of the hills where you can trade more luxurious items that normal villages wouldnt have the money for like fine wines and velvet clothes

overall i hope to see this game keep getting steady work i dont think it needs to go as far as letting you become a noble and have a keep yourself but at least develop the village into a regional center that has a church and proper town hall

#####

its a very annoying game listen i dont have that many hours in but heres what i found out so far
i ate a entire boar and 4 rabbit and i was lowkey still hungry
a fox can survive two javelins in the face and go about its day like nothing happened oblivion style
talking about javelins you craft a single one from a log a log a tree produce like 23 of them this game tries to be realistic  no magic or anything fun  but your dude compress a log into a javelin with its bare hands they break after 4 throws so picture the amount of trees that youre about to chop down which brings me to my next point 
i woke up i was thirsty my camp is in a nice spot but away from any water source and a bit far from another village so i got myself a well near my house so its all good right the thing is you cannot drink from a well without a cup because your character is a precious delicate thing so i proceeded to chop a dozen trees to build that workshop and you may think its a workbench so whats the harm no you need to build a workshop with walls and a roof to have that workbench where you can make that wooden cup turns out to build a cup it requires a certain level and god charges 100gold for the crafting recipe but its all good i had the money i had the level so i walk in the workshop and it tells me that i need planks not logs to make a cup and to make planks i need a woodworking station which you guessed it requires a dozen more trees by the end of all this i capped my building limit because theres one and i had to figure out a way to be allowed to build more things for my village but guys i can make wooden cups now
you cannot make bows in that workshop it requires the hunting lodge i ended up building it and bows requires linen thread which required another station so f it no bows for now
you can make javelins by hand but if you want a rock tips it requires drumroll another workshop not the one where you make cups not the one that makes bows you need the smithy i couldnt build an additional build so you know nevermind who needs cool fun things ill stick with my wooden lance that kills rabbit 
i decided to get myself some villagers to help me hunt since i have a hunting lodge now so might as well i came back after a long day noticing that my dudes  for whom i built a house and gave my last bit of food  did nothing all day because i did not check the hidden sub menu that requires me to give them the task to go hunting you know in the hunting lodge now its dark and they are upset because theres nothing to eat and im almost dying of starvation myself but also half dead because boars will wreck you up so i just went straight to bed knowing that my two new buddies hate me but not as much as i hate them
you may be asking at this point but why arent you buying stuff because meat pies are 250 and you start with 50 of course there are quests that gives gold but god expect money for you to learn how to make spoons  not even kidding its 50 gold or something  so if youre like me and you thought that getting some crafting recipe is a good idea youll end up poor and most likely unable to craft them anyway and youll have to choose between using your money to buy food or commit daily rabbit genocide just to stay alive and you may tell yourself that im bad at this game which clearly i am but holy hell its not a fun game at all


#####

i have 150 plus hours on md but now have run out of things to do now ill give it a couple weeks and hopefully the devs put in more content this game is one of the best games iv played and has so much potential

#####

add dogs as pet please

need more quest to build more house and stuff

#####

playable female character when

update its now possible to play as a female character

#####

what an absolute gem of a game i bought this game way back in early access cant quite remember exactly when but i gave it a few hours decided it needed more tlc boy did the devs give it so much to combat the negative reviews about the grind there are customization settings that allow you to increase or decrease level progression game length crafting time all of that to set the grind where you want it oh did you make it too fast and want to slow it down just go into settings and do it no need to start a new save or anything you can adjust any playthrough without restarting it the game is gorgeous the sound design is absolutely incredible and the developers are still extremely active in bug fixing and content two years after the official release and they have new armors and coop confirmed for development the community is incredible at answering questions and overall interacting with the community is enjoyable i reported a bug that was responded to within 20 minutes by moderators who then fowarded the bug report to the devs and i see devs in the forum regularly responding to issues concerns and even content ideas the survival isnt necessarily the challenge the only real dangerous mob for me is bandits holding a crossbow as long as you can avoid getting shot by a crossbow the mobs are pretty easy to dispatch of the challenge is creating and managing your village early game you will be making tons of tools for your workers but as you progress build and learn the game creating tools becomes a thing of the past harvesting basic resources does become automated its a relaxing first person colony survival that contains so many fun mechanics and exploration this game contains one of my favorite stealth and hunting mechanics tons of quests tons of things to learn throughout playing the game it is far from perfect but it introduces something new and incredibly fun to the colony survival genre i have put a hundred hours into my first real playthrough have still have so far to go so much more to do the amount of content you get out of one play is insane yes it gets grindy but you can adjust that however you like the replayability is strong as there are so many beautiful areas on the map the try and make an aesthetically pleasing city at it isnt perfect but it is definitely a hidden gem of steam

#####

for someone searching to fill the sims sized hole in their life left by greedy and uninspiring ea  medieval dynasty has been amazing

i have been binge playing this on and off for like a year now and every time i come back the developers have added to the game so i can play from a different angle 

to top it off the support i have received from the team has been awesome  saved my game file from certain death and me from having to start the grind all over again  which was far too daunting

#####

love the game literally the only thing that i think would make this game a million times better multiplayer im begging you

#####

medieval dynasty checks many of my favorite gaming boxes sandbox crafting survival management town sim checkcheckitycheck the more of these boxes you would check the more you are going to love this game firstperson banished is the most concise description of what you are in for i strongly recommend discovering how the game works yourself figuring out how to go from crafting stone tools to build your first wattle shack to obsessing over making sure your thriving town is 100 insulated and has chests stuffed with every conceivable amenity is the sheer joy of this game 

it is a micromanagement fantasy but you can also give your villagers a quick rudimentary plan and they will quite easily keep the town functioning while you traipse off to do whatever nonmicromanagers do with their day you will get your 30 or equivalent out of this game as long as this is the type of game you are looking for if you want twitch combat if you want to be king or gods chosen hero instead of village headman this isnt for you

but there is a hard limit on what you are going to get for your money even if all the boxes are checked i personally feel i got from it exactly what i paid for it and not a cent more the problem is late game grind without purpose through the early and midgame the pacing is rewarding you unlock skills buildings equipment recipes and even mounts at a sensible pace that keeps you engaged and putting in just one more hour for hours on end but the points needed to unlock grow exponentially and you realize that the payoff for unlocking the 2nd tier of a building that you dont even bother using the 1st tier of is no longer an incentive where you were once just unlocking by playing now you are unlocking by grinding i knew i had reached the end of the game when i started setting my character to craft huge stacks of goods while i texted on my phone or browsed the web not good it was time to move on

and now for the outright awful parts of the game that would make me not recommend it since they are avoidable i still recommend the game but there is some dark messed up stuff that requires a warning label on what could otherwise be a pg rated experience

the story quests may be there to give purpose to those tired of the sandbox however i found the storycharacters in this valley to be thoroughly unlikable and i resented the way my otherwise silent character childishly interacted with these degenerates and played into their sad world it is disturbing that the only people with personalities of their own in this valley are ruined shells of human beings i predicted the end of the story during my first interaction with the character who starts the main quest and it was just as unpleasant as i thought it would be when i reached it

half of the steam achievements are problematic making pursuing achievements itself a problematic endeavor get the character 100 drunk alcohol poisoning sure is an achievement have the character run around naked all winter puerile get caught stealing 50 times stealing from desperately poor peasants  another amazing achievement and the sickest  impale an animal with 4 spears while its still alive seriously  what is wrong with the developers that they thought that was an achievement

#####

this game has great potential  it does not work properly right now  i like the genre and its dev team seem energised to fix things

pros
 very pretty even serene at times though one friend wasnt able to play on her laptop
 music
 basic mechanics seem to work  villagers form families have children etc
 enjoyable

cons
now this may seem a long list but note this is ea and they are fixing stuff
 villager ai is terrible if youre more than 100m away they consume but dont produce and the field worker one of the more important workers completely stops without saveload refreshes shackling you to the village despite all the rest huntingminingtradingquests demanding you be somewhere else
 economy is broken you start by making 100s of stone knives and eventually 100s of arrowscabbage stew
costs of producing are out of whack with end products with narrow windows to make money which you need to do because
 taxes high taxes which you have to waste half a day to go pay  leading me to
 3 day seasons trying to get everything done in three days is a pain   im 6 years in and if the travel horses pending and villager ai see above were fixed i can see 3 day seasons  but with these things broken and you having to do all this yourself not so much
 questscontent there is currently a hole where the main quest pauses and the side quests need you to gather 300 dynasty points at 1 to 2 per quest when some of the quests are still buggy  look its ea and some are being fixed quite quickly but there is still a hole which you are either meant to leave it alone for a number of years or grind through hundreds of side quests at 34 a season
 and finally minor stuff adding up lack of tutorial ability to check stuff name things single save game interface designed like a console action actioncancel rather than dragdrop  

hopefully most of this is cleared up in ea and soon because this is a fun game

 update 
this has progressed though sometimes its two steps forward one step back its still moving forward  
if you were sitting on the fence its probably advanced enough to jump off

#####

let this serves as a warning to all that sometimes a game studio can end development of an early access game prematurely and take the money and run away and unfortunately this game is one of them 

this game is obviously unfinished bare in mind this game was v0503 on april and made it to 0604 on midjune and somehow in the middle of july they just say fuck it and announce a full release here it probably wouldnt be hard to imagine what this full release is going to be like and here we are a v10 version full release which in reality is probably just a v07 alpha with a lot of features still broken or yet to be balanced if not just straight out missing

they didnt even finish their roadmap for this quarter bandits and herbalist are supposed to be done yesterday but i guess they cant make the ai work so they have to delay it and promise these in the future to avoid unnecessary lawsuit meanwhile all the postdevelopment polishing stuff such as qa bug fixes balancing or rewriting the brain dead ai ha ha ha ha 

does this game worth the 20 price tag its hard to say on the developers standpoint the game does worth the 20 from the amount of time and energy theyve invested into but on the consumer standpoint i just dont get 20 worth of entertainment if any entertainment at all from this game i would say i dont regret giving these dev 20 for all the work theyve done but if they just kick a halfbaked game out the door and move onto the next early access project so bluntly than its one of the easiest not recommended from me read other reviews for the gameplay buy if you must aint going to stop you but keep in mind a lot of these game mechanics youre seeing in the marketing materials are just bare bone features of early access quality the truth is i was disappointed with the state of the game during early access but i had hope that these developers will put enough work to turn it into a good game and now theyve shown their true color ill just avoid any render cube games in the future

wild west dynasty early access guess ill pass

#####

i cant believe they thought this was ready to leave betaea

i also cant believe the comparisons some reviewers draw such as if kingdom come and banished had a lovechild

i mean maybe if that lovechild was subsequently dropped on the head repeatedly and with gusto

its an endless craftingbuilding loop in a medieval setting with absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever the animations are somewhere between absent and wooden with excursions to the absurd especially where gestures are concerned they never once fit also check your shadow while chopping a tree or something if you want a laugh

the dialogues meanwhile all text which isnt a bad thing per se depending on production feel more like youre talking to the tik tok generation than to a medieval farmer theyre also just not well written even apart from the style choice and range from boring to vicariously embarrassing

its not uncommon to find a group of villagers standing completely still in a house like deactivated robots in a warehouse when they do move its usually just from one stillstanding position to the next with the exception of executing their assigned jobs in the latter case you get to watch them do things like fire an arrow at a boar then stand there perfectly still while the boar attacks them for a few seconds before it runs away again after which the villager will fire the next arrow and so forth

if theyre not playing mannequin in a house or on the street or working theyll usually be sitting around a fire or at the tavern staring blankly into space unmoving and in complete silence until its time to sleep

the game feels completely lifeless and i dont think its technically possible to immerse yourself in the world when the npcs including wildlife are animated this badly there is also no voiceover or a good range of atmospheric music the graphics are also sub par especially for how hardware hungry the game is regardless of the lacking polish

edit because more and more things come to mind the main quests are extremely boring and take up a lot of time due to having to run back and forth across the map to read what seems like awkward fanfic while the side quests are what youd expect from the reject pile of a year 2000 mmorpg quest designers brainstorm session

so much for the kingdom come comparison on to banished

i dont know about you but i prefer plopping down a building in top down view to standing in front of it and hammering at it for minutes on end with breaks to go get more woodresources until walls and roofs appear not to mention the awkward placing in first person having to roughly guess whether it will be parallel to the road and other buildings until you see it from further away but by then its already plopped down and youll waste resources by trying again

i guess the comparison was drawn to the survival aspect but i dont see how its possible to not survive in this game as long as you make any effort whatsoever at worst you get attacked by a bear because you werent paying attention to where you were walking and then you reload an autosave if villagers are unhappy with you they just leave but you can recruit them again once you fixed the problem you apparently neglected theres no chance of complete system failure and catastrophe based on faulty planning 10 hours earlier

im not saying the game has to be harder but i dont see what makes it like banished

i bought the game in ea because i liked the concept and wanted to support it as always i waited for the release version before starting to actually play it now i will probably continue playing it because it does scratch an itch for me at the moment but i would not recommend the game to anyone in its current state or that anyone should start playing now if you have faith that the game will be polished in the future then by all means get it on sale sometime but i wouldnt start playing it yet

because i prefer not getting burnt out on games like these while still playing the inferior version so id rather wait until there are no more improvements coming before i even start

ill change my review to yes as soon as they fix the animation dialogue and day cycles of the npcs so the world feels alive with medieval atmosphere or disbelief can be suspended far enough for something akin to immersion to emerge

update it is year 5 my heir is about 200 hours away from reaching maturity im officially out of even slightly interesting things to do while i wait for my building technology to reach the arbitrary levels necessary for building the mine and tavern im guessing it will take about 40 hours of running the game passively in the background or i could spend 10 hours felling trees and building a palisade around my village which would be pointless because there arent any threats to get to the mine then id have another 2 hours or so of something interesting to domanage and 100 hours to go to finally build the center piece of my village the tavern 

maybe by that time my guy will have figured out the technology to add blueberries to his porridge or to bake bread or to make soup without meat i will probably never find out though

#####

i love everything about this game it can be challenging or relaxing depending on how you customize the game play the updates are frequent and keep me excited about playing

#####

very good game
please make it multiplayer

#####

i would like to recommend this game but i really cant theres not a lot going on in this thing and thats a real shame because theres a good basis for a game here its basically a functional alpha however and not much more i havent beaten every questline im going to admit that now but i dont really feel like theres much more to the game than what ive already done 

the draw of this game is building up a medieval town and managing it but the process and systems behind it are entirely stale you can also gain a wife and have kids i guess but that too is also as stale as the rest of the game theres no reason to pick one wife over another no real reason to do quests except that youve maybe run out of things to do to your town for the season and no real reason to actually build up the town except to make numbers go up

which could be fun if there was any life to the games characters or the world itself animals move around yes but the people never really do much more than stare into the forest at night holding a torch they dont talk to one another in even a rudimentary way theres no way to really interact with them theres really just nothing there you own them they work you make houses for them they give you everything they have theres some dialogue and you can flirt with women but yeah none of it really means much or presents anything interesting

you wont find big quests here but thats not the issue im having with their questing system the issue with the quests is that they require you to walk for 20 minutes or more at a time to reach a place walking in games is basic and not terribly interesting what would be interesting is if you could ride a paid carriage by going to one of the many towns and paying someone to take you there apparently theres a way to make your own carriage system but what about in the early game if i have the money to pay for a carriage should i not be able to just ride said carriage and enjoy the scenery why do i have to walk until i can purchase a trade route to one town then i have to build another and another and that gets expensive horses and carriages are expensive as owning  these tools should be the problem lies in the fact that there are no ways to get anywhere that dont require being absolute bored out of your gourd for 20 minutes at a time every time you want to do a quest for the local communities which isnt great

even if you can forgive this theres no where to sleep if you get to a town and its sundown yes you can sleep on the ground around a dinky little campfire but theres no tent no sleeping bag no way to really be safe or create a spot on open ground without building an entire thatch hut this annoyed me greatly throughout my play time because i was often stuck wandering in the woods in the dark with a crappy little torch instead of buying food drink and sleeping in a bed at a local inn sure its not necessary i guess but if i want to sleep outside i have to go way beyond the town limits and create a tiny fire and its just not very immersive consumes more time and is just quite frankly annoying let me either put a campfire down so i can sleep in the town and pretend im at an inn or put a dang inn in the towns or along the roads

couple this all with the fact that you cant even run into anyone besides bandits on the road and youve just got a lifeless world everyones a shutin apparently and thats it even the bandits were halfassed lackluster and not a challenge for my unarmored butt just back up and throw spears when you get outside their strictly bound travel radius theyll attempt to go back home let them then throw more spears repeat you should get out of it with no trouble

another problem is a total lack of trade economy here youll always get the same price for all goods no matter where you send it or take it to sell it which further drives home the purposelessness of travel trade and product diversification except for the purpose of developement and completing the overlylong poorly programmed tutorial

a side note if you happen across wild west dynasties they are not developed by the same developer but published by the same publisher this still worries me as a publisher can move people around depending on the contract statements but as far as i am aware they are not the same and are not being moved around so at least theres that the devs have also promise coop and armor along with an addition to the heir system the latter the heir system was advertised as a feature of the game already though so your guess is as good as mine on that one

might change this review in a year or two if that heir update the armor and coop actually turn out to be functional fleshed out and add something to the gameplay that breaks up the sheer monotony of this thing a lot of my issues would be solved if they just added in nonowned transport camping and inns or any kind of alife along the roads 

dont attack the foxes trust me theyre tougher than bandits they also dont yield resources worth having in quantities worth the fight

tldr 
walking simulator
no early transport options
no character interaction for the most part
no life on the roads between towns
no active trade economy
rudimentary camping but no tents or other items besides a fire
no inns
no real interaction with townies like dancing drinking or minigames or any traditional medieval pastimes
foxes are tougher than bandits for some reason deer can take six spears to the butt
no sleeping options in nonowned towns
bad overly long tutorial that doesnt really need to be there beyond the first few quests
honestly just terribly uninteresting even for a survival crafter game due to a lack of soul and flavor

do not recommend wait until after the promised updates then consider

#####

a relaxed and enjoyable introduction to the world of medieval dynasty looking forward to see how the game evolves as it has lots of potential 

#####

this game badly needs some quality of life improvements ostensibly it is about managing your village but the tools to manage your workerscolonists and such are just so incredibly clunky and ineffective this game invented a whole new method of worker management that utterly collapses under the weight of its own complicated crafting system your workers are almost fantastically inept at doing much of anything effectively and you have to micromanage both every worker and every building to an obscene degree

by the way the game tries to have an impressive tutorial system but still fails to address even half the complexity of the craftingworker management system ive been able to figure out a lot from online tutorials at least

i wanted to play a worker placement game and instead it gave me a game where im just constantly running back and forth between my storages doing almost everything myself because it is just so bad

unlike almost every other crafter system it doesnt rely on any kind of work order system for your workers like make 20 logs or craft until i have 10 firewood which gives you the ability to set priorities in this game its entirely feedforward spend 31 of every workers time at this workshop making wicker baskets 17 of their time making buckets  it is such a monumentally unsatisfying way to manage a game

it also relies far too much on longpressing certain keys to perform certain actions literally dozens of times in a row like lets say you kill a bandit hes got 5 different things in his item list there is no takeall command nor is there any way to filter the vast inventory lists you build up in this game you cant even separate your inventories into some sensible groupings once you build a resource storage everything your workers produce ends back at the storage mixed into everything else

also the game is just plain buggy a big part of the game is hunting and its not uncommon for animals in the world to just begin running around at 500 turbo speed when you wound them they start bleeding and you are supposed to track them but its quite common to occasionally run across an animal that simply wont bleed

i have some minor gripes with the story which is at times interesting and funny but all the dialogue about your family and his friends is beyond wordy i had to fast forward through whatever the latest zany tale that one of these story npcs tells which are all full of tall tales and lies and contradictions that might be funny if it would just get to the point

i would play this game again if they had quality of life improvements to address the absurdly clunky production  crafting system and let workers do things like build buildings instead of making your little lordling pound every goddamn stick into place with his hammer but just building buildings once you have the materials is at least a 10 minute investment of your time theres absolutely no way to get your workers whove joined your settlement to help out even a little bit

the crafting system is based on everquest or wow as near as i can tell by the by if you want to cook up all the meat your people have been farming get ready to set your game to start crafting the recipe 70 times and go get a cup of coffee you have to just wait for potentially hundreds of items to process or you could assign a colonist to do it which would take them at least two seasons to finish

#####

i love this game  i love the look and feel of it how accurate some things are how you manage your village all of it  i could sit here and nitpick everything but im not going to and i already posted a list of suggestions in the discussion forum  this is a slow paced survival game where you get to choose how difficult life is for you  its really as simple as that  people will complain about lack of questing and content but i dont see it that way  its a genuine life simulator for a medieval village and im fond of it  while i am usually left wanting when it comes to the dynasty series games i still always enjoy them  this one is no exception and there are a lot of amazing things they could add and do to this as future dlc or expansions  theyre working on a coop and new map right now which will be awesome  

i play on easy mode because thats how i like it  you could very easily make life very hard for yourself to give yourself a challenge  the best part is you can change all of these options at any time during your game though some require a season to go by  

as someone who does medieval reenactment irl i find this to be thoroughly enjoyable and well worth the money  i hope they continue to add to it

#####

it breaks my heart to write negative review because its this rare game where devs actually care about what theyre doing unfortunately it doesnt make it a good game
game is only interesting until you finish only 2 story questlines in game after that you may wander around for a while and make an achievement run but otherwise you loose all the interest in the game keep growing my village but like for what when you establish production lines theres no interest for you your npcs will play the game by themselves random quests are so typical and boring you stop paying them attention after first dozen 
i feel like thats why technology tree progression made so slow just to keep players who out of curiosity wants to build highend buildings on having 40 villagers i found myself setting season length to 1 day technology points to x10 leaving the game running in background just to skip time in game and i still havent even unlocked all the buildings
so again game is very difficult grindy and challenging at the beginning but at some point game starts playing itself and there are just no activities to keep your attention span
game is being patched updated and all but honestly its like a bandaid over an open fracture id really wish for the developers to move on note all mistakes and change publisher and make their next game gotc

#####

you can roleplay being free

there arent too many games like this combining rpg elements with city builder elements roam a medieval valley as a freeholder building a village and dynasty while following a decent story line performing tasks and enjoying the occasional run in with bandits or wild creatures

ive been playing this game since ea and have gotten loads of enjoyment from it the constant updates and fixes have been excellent this was a bold step for a game developer thank goodness there are still some devs out there willing to pursue their imagination

#####

so first off
its a great game i never encounterd a noticeable bug
the game play is ok but extremely slow
a tutorial should be a must the help texts are not really helpful they have to be expanded i had to google a lot of mechanics and important stuff like the composter

but the game fails in his core mechanic the village building in my point of view at least
a lot of quality of life functions are missing which i expected as someone who has a lot of survival city builders

for example the game has seasons great love it with a lot of different challenges also great
but fails to give you the opportunity to change settings for buildings accordingly
like stop wasting time searching for berries in the winter or produce more firewood in the winter and less in the summer thats a problem for nearly every producinggathering building you have to change that by hand and thats more annoying because there are no sliders you have to click for every  point you want it to change

then there are several balancing issues like production speed of kitchens gatheringproduction speeds of different itemsresources
the game is extremely slow because you have to advance your technology with in game money and the mentioned production speed of npcswhy not use the skill tree or the experience gained from village building
the stealing mechanic is a joke if there is nearly nothing to steal even in the town storage s
to voice the main quest would be a delight it is really unfulfilling just reading the long story

but the game is really great if you can live with slow game progress and missing quality of live features
i have the feeling the developers dont play the game

if the game get more love it will be a really great game with not many competitors but until then i cant recommend it maybe open it to the steamworkshop so modders can fix most of the stuff

#####

if you like stardew valley youll love this game while its definitely lacking in a few areas namely building opportunities it makes up for the satisfaction you feel when you progress in skills and organisation i enjoy all the niche management of villagers and their jobs and watching their little families grow the maternity leave is seriously outrageous lol you feel like an overworked dad running around frantically trying to get things moving a little faster id say production jobs are a bit slow food often goes bad before it gets cooked and storage gets overfull as the materials dont get used fast enough

however i was also pleasantly surprised to enjoy the main story the questing itself is pretty basic with you just running between different villages or people with items or news but the story itself was interesting and exciting and i found myself actually wanting to learn what happens next the protagonist of the game is also actually pretty funny he has a great personality and his dialogue with npcs feels very real

i also love the interactions you get to have with your son theyre heartwarming and fun and its nice to feel like youre actually shaping his young life 

overall this game definitely has its drawbacks it would be nice to see more updates to building so you can spend more time doing so im at a point where ive basically finished the game so im just going through the motions of each season until i can play as an heir and finish off any other achievements but i highly recommend giving it go and just enjoying it for what it is you can easily lose a whole weekend to just ok one more day ok let me just do this and then while i do that ill do this ok when i finish this chapter ill log off which is honestly kind of nice if you just want to switch off for a while

#####

dont get me wrong this game is awesome and feels unique for the first few hours but then it gets boring really boring and pointless
it needs steam workshop and mod support it needs more fancreated content so we can have different experiences when playing it again

510 no steam workshop
1010 if it had a steam workshop

#####

although all in all i do recommend this game the game is missing the two following features which would have made it the perfect game for me at least
1 crafting is basically click and wait while watching an animation devs could have made it more interactive
2 very boring once you set up your village although there are bandits around the map i feel this game could be better if our villages would be under some kind of threat or raid now i know this game was designed as a peaceful experience but still some random events happening in our village are missing if not combat then it could be some kind of a crisis a plague sanctions etc 
in the central village there are high fences why dont we get to build them in our own village as well

in my opinion this game is for you if you are looking for a 100 hours experience of game time
i really hope the upcoming shields and crests update will revive this game

#####

built a village
invited people to come and live there
they all hated me
1010 will build again

#####

i bought this game about 15 year ago and i have to be honest with you it was terrible even the first quest did not work for me so i returned it immediately 

few days ago i bought it back again after seeing a lot of things being added and i am just shocked todays the game is just beautiful everything works and is really well thought through i also love the quests which even though are very simple made me smile many times

so as a fellow programmer i would like to give my kudos to the whole team who did astonishing job keep it up

#####

the biggest problem of this title is that it tries to be 3 games at once but it fails to deliver its not a good survival game its not a good city builder game and certainly is not a good rpg if you want a good experience go and play the long dark banished or kingdom come

the survival elements are reduced to merely having a food and drink there is some heat and cold mechanics but ultimately its a joke as in winter swimming in cold water does nothing to you theres no swim animation btw and to protect from cold you only need to wear one or two warm garments while the rest can be your summer clothes 
theres some hunting which is okish but for some reason firing arrows feels like firing rubber projectiles they bounce off dealing some damage to an animal 

there is one or two questlines that is interesting the first time you do it the rest of quests are repetitive generic tasks you do for some coin excluding the first two quests theres no point in talking to npcs otherwise than just a get a generic quest from them b recruit them to your village the game would be almost the same without npcs

building is so far the best part of this game but quickly enough you will discover that it also has some irritating sides one of them is not being able to plan your settlement as you want it due to poor building planner you will quickly understand it if you would like to put some trees in the middle of your settlement surrounded by a fence and road on each side to make a sort of a green square if you started by building a road surrounding the square good luck with putting that tree down and fencing it some zoom out planner would be a savior maybe it also is irritating that if a building wall requires 15 sticks you have to hit that wall 15 times with your hammer just allow me to place those sticks without this tedious work slap some progress wheel or something if you want but dont make me hit 80 times to build a house

managing your settlement is also a drag job assignment is not intuitive and the ui is poorly done requiring from you far too many clicks just to assign someone multiply this with the number of buildings you will end up with 
you get an icon that your village has run out of food but you had a lot in stores and your hunters were assigned to work oh the stores were not replenished because hunting knives broke down and poor hunters had no tools to use thanks game for informing me about this on time 
speaking of which if crafting a knife according to the game is as simple as getting some twigs and two stones from your backyard why no one from the village seems capable of doing it on his own until you have the full supply and demand chain prepare to be doing some tedious work to just keep the lights on 

this game was in early access but it feels like it was in closed beta no one had a chance to properly ux it and it was just released into the market where its the pioneer of the genre it would need at least additional half a year of development to become something close to what it is aiming to be 


#####

medieval dynasty is a very pretty game that at first blush seems like it should tick all the right boxes for an open world crafty buildy housey survival game it should be precisely the sort of game that im looking for right now but unfortunately falls short due to some highly irritating mechanics

the structure building works well enough and it is relatively easy to figure out the gatheringcraftingfarming loop especially with the simple main quest guidance that the game throws at you npcs are plain all similar looking but do the job the irritation comes in the form of the seasons mechanic which while on paper looks reasonable breaks much of the rest of the game

every three days on the dot the seasons advance and not in a ooh look the leaves are changing color subtle way but in an everything stop fadetoblack that breaks any side quests even if you picked them up that day half spoils any meat you are carrying no matter when you hunted it and throws you back to your bed even if you were exploring across the map this mechanic is such an unpleasant jarring departure from the flow of the rest of the game that i have to wonder how it ever made it in

the game has a lot of potential and im hoping the flow is improved so i can change this review right now its annoying because i want to like it so much more than i do

amazing game
devs are adding new content all the time cant wait for coop mode

review by urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator34633003gamingmasterpieceslists gaming masterpieces url   the greatest games of all time on steam 
thtable

is this game a masterpiece yes it is quite unique and a joy to play its one of those popular survival sims but not far away on an alien planet or in a fantasy world full of monsters it is taking place in europe during the middle ages

fleeing from your wartorn home you reach a peacful valley far away hoping to meet your rich uncle unfortunately your uncle is long dead so you are completely alone when you start a new life gathering ressources you can build a new house for you or maybe even some more and fill them with new settlers arriving in the valley

you can collect a lot of ressources craft many new things while combat is not that important you are not alone like in many other survival games the world is full of other people who talk to you and often have little quests for you to earn a bit of money looks a bit like a mmo sometimes as long as you enjoy finding herbs hunting defenseless animals and constructing houses more than fighting deadly monsters or aliens this is the game for you find a wife to help you in your tasks and become the mother of your kids buy a chicken to have eggs for breakfast breed animals cultivate the land buy stuff from traders it is more a medieval life sim than a survival game sometimes if you enjoy it you can even construct a little medieval village

ub conclusionbu
mostly peaceful relaxing survival and building game in the middle ages

#####

make this coop fun game but can get pretty boring just singleplayer

#####

i really try to love this game but i failed

there are promising features and the first hours of discovering and exploring the pretty map building the pretty structures and crafting the numerous items are really fun but after that the crude truth appears  survival rpg economy and management are ultra simplistic ultra childish and in my humble opinion more or less broken and i dont know if the devs are planning to improve these features

first there is no survival the game is full of respawning easytoexploit ressources everywhere either by yourself or by your workers you are overwhelmed by food water and all basic necessary ressources like log plank sticks stone etc even in winter animals are everywhere plus i can walk in snow storm with only fur boots thick gloves and summer clothes  so why should i ever craft other clothes 

hunting is childish  animals dont detect you until very close and so are super easy target for your bow bandit are childish  they stay on their spawning spot their ai is ridiculous you could kill them one by one they chase you for 100 meters and return to their spot like nothing happened so there is absolutly no difficulties to give the player a sense of survival

second the management is weird you recruit villagers you assign workers and choose what to produce in an ultra obvious way and there is nothing to manage  the only thing i must manage is to calm down workers we can set a 0100 slide for each item because otherwise my warehouses are so quickly full  but the worst of the worst is production is totally disconnected from the environment  your lumberjack produce tons of logs and planks but all the trees around are still there  your hunter produce tons of dried meat and your fisher tons of dried fish but all the animals are still there  i really dont understand why the management is so childish

third rpg is simplsitic quests are just listening a story kill an animal or two craft an item for a guy etc perks could be interesting but the game is so ultra super easy i generally dont feel the need dialogues are far more basics than other rpg

finally the economy is in my humble opinion totally broken you could make absurd amount of money by simply craft and sell tons of stone knifes or whatever other item you choose there is no environment limitations remember  plus all merchant will buy all you sell them in their respawning money limit selling hundreds of pickaxe to a cow breeder  no problem  why so childish 


#####

very beautiful game looks and feels like kingdom come deliverance  i hope it doesnt stay too long in ea because i want to play it and waiting for release version will be torcher   thank you dev team you have created a great game for under 30 and i wish you all good luck in its development

#####

i had high expectations but after a complete playthrough the game was admittedly a disappointment in professional terms the scope was too large to be implemented with the resources at hand this results in a very generic experience

i could just list several pages of really good or bad things but this time im going to be very blunt the game is trying to combine really hot genres and elements like crafting supply chain management role playing and survival in an open world medieval setting 

some of these are implemented better than the others like the survival part combined with nice graphics and beautiful seasons on the other hand the role playing elements are really basic with unbalanced skills and repetitive quests worst of all though is the terrible management system that is supposed to help automate the latter part of the game everything is managed with flat lists and sliders so you dont get a clear overall picture any change be it a workers level or maternity leave causes micro chaos in the late game 

know that there are no enemies such as lords or squires with their armies other than random brigands on the road walls and gates are purely decorative so dont expect epic sword fights moreover the kings presence is limited to strenuous also repetitive quests delivered by his messenger so there are no really typical medieval things

apparently content is being added to the game all the time for example when i was playing there was no quick travel this led to hours of walking back and forth it is certainly good that the game is being developed but simply adding content does not change the games worst problems this also gives the impression that the game was released too early

however the game has some entertaining moments as long as you dont expect too much from it and are looking for something to tinker with

summary  rating 

 looks pretty enough
 seasons
 lots of details animals flowers buildings etc

 very generic experience none of the elements really flourish
 primitive  tedious management system
 no fear of danger or death nothing threatens your village walls and gates are purely decorative
 not that medieval in typical sense no lords no armies no castles etc



#####

recommended with heavy warnings and on sale 

this is a management game that doesnt give you the tools and information to properly manage your village most of the data is fairly raw and not categorized well so to find out how much of x you are making vs using isnt always easy 

there are no queues when a villager finishes their tasks you cant say now do this you need to go in and manually alter their tasks each time you can tell them to spend x of their time on task a but if its a bad season for task a too bad they cant understand they shouldnt look for berries in winter every season you need to redo many of your tasks which doesnt sound bad but a season in this game is 3 days you can make it longer but then youll never get to the dynasty part of the game

theres just a huge list of things like this that make the game frustrating especially as its a great base game it just needs some love 

oh and the story is pretty absurd and childish but i did start skipping it by the 15th hour also i hope you like running around 34 of your time will be spent either running or hammering on walls 

but somehow its still an interesting game ill probably come back to every now and again especially as they release patches not sure why out of early access no longer means finished but alright

#####

i absolutely love this game it feels as if i have been waiting for it since forever and my only regret is not finding it sooner for a gamer girl like myself this game is the perfect combination of sims gameplay mixed with survival mixed with city building genre go on adventures and hunt animals check garden and farm to your hearts content while relaxing with a glass of wine  check survive the harsh conditions of weather and animals or bandits check build and decorate each and every house check build a village of people and look after them and make sure you manage them so they thrive check it really just ticks all the boxes for me 3

#####

truly fantastic game well worth the price of admission

if there is one thing that i feel this game does incredibly well its immersion you do feel like youre living as a medieval peasant surviving and striving to create and grow an environment thatll benefit you and your townsfolk it feels like kingdom come  deliverance but for farmers builders and people that like some sense of colony management

the game seems to have a nice emphasis on family finding a wife having children securing your dynasty  legacy and i like that as a parent myself i think this is awesome

youll grow your characters skills and learn new technologies to build new things as you progress completing quests for people in other villages will also net you important xp spikes in tech areas allowing you to build more things more often quests will also help you increase your building limit

as you grow youll consider taking new people on with various skills to run the buildings you create in your village think automation youll be responsible for their happiness nourishment work routines and giving them a sense of purpose basically

my one major critique so far would be the price of things and the lack of money you can earn the big issue for me is that the things you unlock in the technology trees cost sizeable sums of money on top of needing to spend money elsewhere as well as ensuring that your taxes are paid at the end of each year 

my minor critique would be the inability to pick up a building and alter its placement within a fair radius of its original location

winter was harsh as although i could find ways to keep warm a seamstress was well out of my way in another village in the biting cold and the expense to buy extra clothing to keep warm was rather high especially that early in the game where crafted furnishings and things seem to sell for a pittance

the game is absolutely stunning and its very easy to want to take pictures of the scenery improvements made to your setup expansion of your setup and the general wilderness game runs really well for me on a mix of high  ultra settings i only noticed some harsher dips during winter and when holding a torch for light and warmth but nothing major or worth worrying about

all in all tldr

yes yes and yes i recommend this awesome game

#####

this game is extremely relaxing and engaging i love the aesthetic and the atmosphere especially it does wonders for the mind to see the sun set over the rolling green hills and hit the walls of your humble village just right there is also added fun in the freedom of decoration since you can float stack and rotate items as you see fit you can get creative and make tiny bridges over rivers a proper shooting range decorate tables around a tavern

however
it doesnt stay engaging for long and its clear the endgame is lacking playing at the default season speed you reach the peak of your empire very quickly and my son isnt even out of toddler stage and im already wondering what else
i make a lot of coin my buildings are capped i have way too many villagers that do everything and the settlement runs itself basically my wife is a non factor really her affection barely drops and if it does you can just throw money gifts at it high end weapons are obtained super early on so you go around hunting and it feels the same as it felt since like 10 hours in

this game desperately needs more money sinks more threats more customization it also feels rather empty so if merchants npcs etc could travel the roads thatd be great more events would be cool people betraying you leaving you turning on you bandit raids warring factions making enemies of another village thievery atm feels very inconsequential ive read the roadmap and can only hope the upcoming features will come quickly 

most of all i wish this game had coop itd be amazing

still i recommend it because youll have your fun with it regardless

#####

solid  game has great mechanics and feels good to progress through it  variables for nearly every aspect of the game can be set by the player so you can fit the game to your desired play style  the graphics are excellent and you have the freedom to build and expand your home and later an entire bustling village nearly anywhere on the map  for an early access game the game has a ton of content and gets regular updates from the developers

if i had one criticism it would be that while you can decorate homes you cannot decorate productionharveststorage buildings  so if i want to hop on the spinning wheel and make a few bolts of cloth after dark i have to do so in total darkness  i cant add torches or other lighting fixtures

that aside it does what it says on the tin  start your dynasty up from a single homeless bachelor to a sprawling hub of trade and agriculture today



#####

i enjoy this game greatly it is a fun relaxing game though it makes me laugh with some of the dialogue and some of the mechanics i play as a female in the oxbow and my husband is the one pregnant i laughed so hard i cried its a great game

#####

i like this game so much at first it was a bit challenging for me because there is a lot to manage but after getting the hang of it its all good 
its one of those games that i would and will keep playing and starting all over again because its so nice and its a chill game you can do things at your own pace except for some quests of course

#####

this game is absolutely beautiful and im truly enjoying the story from graphics to the way you need to think in order to do things right its a joyful learning process
it can be challenging and frustrating at times but if you take your time and try to enjoy the game you can really have a good experience the feeling you have when you slowly witness how your village grows and how your hard work pays off its simply great 
to see your character mature and become husband and father is lovely a reason why you cannot help but to feel attached to it
i truly recommend this game to anyone to me it has become one of my favorite games

ps sorry for my english

#####

great game so far i only suggest that it needs to offer multiplayer i would love to play this game with friends

#####

a great game with a great story and hours of game playif you dont adjust time settingstechnology gain medieval dynasty is a type of game that a lot of people have been wishingwaiting for whether youre into role playing and immersing yourself in a medieval world becoming a 1000 something ad tycoon or just wanting a slow and easy going game to play after work youll enjoy medieval dynasty

as of right now the story is kind of short but still worth its short while far as game play goes dont buy this if youre looking for a combat dense medieval rpg the most you deal with is occasional banditslater game and the occasional wolf boar or bear however the combat mechanics in the game arent terrible and i think they plan to add more combat as toplitz and render cube released future plans including more weapons craftable armorsshields and family crests aside from combat medieval dynasty is a flora and fauna dense valley with tons of npcs sidequests and tons of open land for you to build your farm village or city with that being said im sure youre aware medieval dynasty is still  a work in progress and toplitzrender cube are very active in their community in which they go to a great extent keeping us updated and listening to player wishesbugs reports

this will be my first game review

this is literally  god game  i bought this game i guess 2 weeks ago and i couldnt get out of the computer for 2 weeks
because of this game  medieval dynasty  i can see i played this game for 156 hours 
there are hidden jewelries in steam i was enjoyed addicted and happy for a couple weeks

but i would like to say few advice to developers 
before this game i played same kind of medieval game called  kingdom come  
kingdom come was really well made game background was based on real places in czech story was nice and fighting was realistic horse riding was awesome historic based armors were nice 

but only one thing made me left kingdom come 

that was  there are no kids in the streets but there are only adults  

this made me woke up like leo woke up in the human farm of the matrix like  ah right this was game 
 i felt same thing in this game 
because when i get back home my wife was standing on the bed and looking at the empty wall
i felt is this horror game  
not only my wife and other my peasants are sitting on my ground in the house light is turned off
i hope game makers add some gestures when they are staying in their house like talking together or making foods 
or talking with her son please i am so scared every time when my wife dont talk to me but watching a empty wall 

second 
i can only have one kid
in the past  in medieval age  
it was common to have many kids  obviously there was no electricity so when they finished day work and get back home one of things that married couples can do was making love 

but in this game i can have only one kid 

not only for this reason in the medieval age there were many epidemics like a past
so peoples had to make a lots of kids as many as they can if they dont most of kids will be gone 

furthermore for a feudal lord 
they needed many kids to inherit their village for sure

third 
i can breed donkey
i can breed lamb
i can breed cattles
i can breed chickens
i can breed ducks

but i cant breed dog

i need dogs for hunting wolfs
but no one help me i can only believe myself my body my weapons
i mean i am not scared of wolves or bear 
i mean i feel lonely when i go out my son finds me when he want and i am i only one who hunt deers
i hope developers add some function that this hero teach his son how to use the bow and his friendly dog

there is birds with the trab
even there are rats and rabbits but no dogs please make dogs and other animals which likely to be in middle age europe

fourth
and  the wheels  
yeah wheel was invented in ancient iraq mesopotamia 
and in this game  even there are wheel item  

but i cant build wagons
i cant use wagon but i only can see broken wagon on the road 
this is ridiculous

if i could connect useful wagon on my donkey
this game will be god game  yeah for sure

and i hope i could use cow for plowing the field too 
i hope developers add many reasonable functions and items in this game 

lastly 
 this game medieval dynasty is playing for building my own kingdom
so i hope developers add war systems
i would like to build my own amors  i would like to build my own army
there are hunting system but there are no armors and weapons for war

and there are 11 villages including my own town
this is personal hope but
i hope developers expand the map its small i think
i would like to say medieval dynasty expand to another place like other european geography or arabic kingdoms
and i hope developers sell it as dlc than i will happily buy them 

so with those reasons i found some details problems i found them i couldnt  get into this game 
this game was just released month ago so developer will update steadily 
game makers made this god game so i believe they will do their best like minecraft developers  

this game was released just month ago    i hope there will be many updates on this game 

i recommend this game  thanks 

#####

great game in my opinion a fresh take on the city builder genre going first person and adding rpg and survival elements as well 68 hours in and i feel like ill be playing it for at least another 100 probably more 

pros
fresh take on the city builder genre as i said
stuff to do outside of just waiting for your village to grow you can hunt farm manually gather materials do some randomly generated quests or story quests if you havent finished those yet etc
pretty decent performance considering the graphics
a customize game menu allowing you to cheat in case you dont like certain default settings like exp gain tax amount healthfoodwatercarry weightstamina on or off etc

cons mostly minor ones
stone deposits above ground areuseless pretty much hopefully they balance them a little better
youre going to be running around the map a lot and wont unlock mounts until much later my number 1 complaint i get why but its still annoying
there are bandits but in my 68 hours ive only encountered them once in a group of 4 and they were all unarmed they should be a bit more of a threat imo
you cant build bridges which would have been nice since there are rivers you can build around instead villagers just walk through the water

overall definitely a recommended game if you like building your own town

#####

banished meets valheim 1st and 3rd person view as you build your town and recruit villagers to work for you produce an heir and if you die they assume control your new player if you have no heir the game is over

#####

another unfinished game released out of early access im really getting tired of it

while the game has a lot of potential is playable and i actually enjoy the base gameplay and story there are several problems with it
 in my very first session within the first 10 minutes i already got stuck in the ground and even the free me option or saving  loading didnt help i had to start a new game
 weird grafic errorsextreme shadow flickering in the distance that can only be fixed by forcing the game into dx12 which is not an option in the game you have to change starting parameters manually
 steam shows 7 hours of playtime and in those 7 hours i had 4 or 5 ctds and one complete system freeze
 theres no swimming animation the character is literally walking in water and honestly when you have a game in early access for such a long time and something so obvious like that makes it in the full release it tells a lot
 very few unique characters most of the people you meet look exactly the same
 there are several other issues that are easily forgettable and overseeable so i wont mention them indivdually but allinall it stacks up

so while i actually like the game itself i cant really recommend it in its current state

#####

not ready for 10 ill change this if they keep developing postlaunch but despite a stellar concept and satisfying loop theres just no way this should be out of ea some glaring issues after binging it today

if you hit a deer or moose with an arrow or spear anywhere it will turn into a tron lightcycle and zoom off at mach 17 literally moving faster than its animation and basically tposing into space there doesnt appear to be a damage model and they dont slow down so unless you get lucky and the animal becomes stuck on terrain youre sol

the quests while very wellwritten are just exercises in running across the map back and forth and back andforth like good lord i love relaxing chill games like this but give me a break

i hope you enjoy being deaf because if you roll a rainy day upon waking up youll be greeted by a looping effect blasting at four hundred decibels ive had half a dozen rainy days in five hours and it never subsides so thats itand you cant skip time by just going to bed early better start learning sign language

yeah i use a controller because i play this genre in maximum comfy modebut its wonky at best holding rb to sprint is awkward and selecting things from the radial menu makes your view careen off in the direction of your choice left and right arrow are unused and should obviously be bound to nextlast tool but nah

the head bob toggle doesnt work i dont suffer from motion sickness but i do have chronic migraines and bunnyhopping everywhere is a oneway ticket to my breakthrough pill bottle

35kg carry capacity sounds great but you basically get half that after clothes tools food and medicine are taken into account lugging logs sticks and stones is a pain at best i see there might be mounts or something later not sure i didnt want to spoil myself but there needs to be a cart like valheim except maybe one that behaves better

as an edit because i forgot i have a pretty decent pc but my 3060 sounds like a jet engine while playing this and runs about 20c hotter than any other game performance is finei mean my vision is terrible so anything above 30fps looks the same to meand besides lots of popin while sprinting theres no reason this should tax my system three times more than something like 2077

tldr just let it cook and see what the postlaunch support is like if they all go work on their other dynasty games and leave this one alone just dont bother

#####

yesss would love to have at least a lan or steam multiplayer option as well

#####

the weird and addictive hybrid child of the forest and kingdom come deliverence

#####

best stone knife crafting simulator also lots of incest going on in my village bunch of sick bastards tbh i like it

edit going to try and eject my wife from the village remarry then try and bring my wife back to the village to marry our son

#####

the game is very promising i love it so far


only thing i dislike is weight omg weight i spend so much time shuffling stuff its so annoying hopefully there is a mod or hack for this soon

seasons are to short they should be 23x longer 

we could use a horse lol 

overall the game is super promising i hope the devs dont give up on it

#####

i cannot stop with this game
ive been playing since before the animals had audio to signify their footsteps since the days where you wouldnt know the wolves were attacking you until the snarling and biting blasted through your headphones
since the days were cattle would do whacky dances with their glitched out legs
ive been playing through all the bugs and through all the updates
ive never once had a complaint not with the time taken to improve the mechanics nor the bugs that made for amazing captures to show my friends
it seems like every time i open steam the devs have thrown something new and exciting into the game i love it
i love that i can place objects now instead of strategically dropping them seriously thank you
i love that i can gift not just my heir but other children as well
i love that uneven terrain is no longer such a god awful building obstacle
and i love that i can basically fast travel between towns all that walking was brutal
im excited for coop i will gift the game to my friends if they dont listen to me and buy it themselves

absolutely the top of my list for games im as diehard for medieval dynasty as i am for skyrim
cant wait to see what the devs throw in next

#####

this game is really amazing for medieval games lovers but also game needs more new contents
in game there is no real danger first of all game needs more survival options like fighting
more military updates will be good like building watchtowers barracks train some villagers as a warrior or archer etc

#####

i dont often leave reviews but i thought this game deserved a review  first off it is an early release and comes with several items that will hopefully be overcome in future releases  that being said i have been able to find ways to get around the small problems and it has yet to actually crash  to the developers way to wait long enough

the graphics are great and the movement of the character is smooth and simple including targeting  the story was pretty good but much more story content is needed if a player is expected to keep playing  after you have 30 buildings and an established economy it can get kind of boring

the most frustrating issues are keeping your field workers working and being unable to interact with a quest person of salesperson who is stuck on a roof or in an attic  additionally for me the font size on the quest items could be a bit bigger  since i am playing on the television and i have old man eyes i had to get up to make sure i could read what it said

overall the developers did a great job and i am looking forward to seeing what they bring in the future

just a note now that the game has been out for a while  the developers have remained engaged adding new content and seeking things that need a tweak  impressed

#####

please send help i cannot stop playing this game and no longer have interest in real life
what even is real my dynasty thats what as the hours pass and my body begin to slowly die i know in the end that even when my body is gone my medieval dynasty will continue

#####

the game itself is fun and i love the gameplay and concept personally i think i would just love it more if i could be a female protagonist

#####

i cant recommend this game in its current state 

the world is visually pleasant albeit generic and somewhat empty you get a chance to explore it right away because the quest givers will send you to fetch items or have a conversation with other npc located on the opposite side of the map all the time so you will run errands a lot and when i say run i mean you will be constantly walking from one corner of the map to another corner of the map and back you will most probably enjoy the view and the ambient music later on you can acquire horses and donkeys to travel 

the writing in this game is frankly atrocious and ruins the otherwise positive impression it has always been subpar but the devs added a lot of text in 10 which i cant help but call verbal diarrhea the stories told by various npc are utterly ridiculous like a bad fanfic written by a teen who can barely speak proper english but wants to sound edgy and are full of lowbrow jokes involving various um states of the male genitalia there is a quest involving the delivery of a knuckle sandwich followed by the delivery of a warm package full of human feces there is also a quest about a potion of potency applied the wrong way
if you are planning to play this game with your child be aware of that 

the npc use worlds like utilize and generally sound more like forum trolls than medieval peasants which is hilarious but not in the way the developers envisioned the explanation given is that players would not understand if more appropriate language was eh utilized the fact that a huge number of games handled this just fine comparatively speaking is ignored 

the building strategy can be a bit overwhelming at first but after a while you would know what to do and the best way to do it its just poorly explained in game and the glorified manual is behind a paywall you will need to learn by trial and error or by reading the forums or both 
the houses you build for your villagers look the same  rectangular boxes you can customize the walls by making them wicker wood or stone  but the general layout remains the same 

grinding for resources farming cooking etc are the essential parts of the game and if you hate repetitive tasks stay away 
hunting is also a vital part there are many different animals in the game and you can try to hunt all of them but the final release made hunting much harder than it was in ea and less fun 

there are also bandits in the game now but i cant say much about them because i turned them off in the settings i only know that they can be randomly found in the forest sitting around a campfire they are hostile but will never attack your village only you if you come close
yes you can modify your settings which is a good thing you can make things harder or easier depending on your preferences

there is no religious building anywhere in the game religion or god or pagan deities are not even mentioned  kind of immersion breaking in a medieval setting but a lot of things are unrealistic in this game so yeah
there is also no graveyard grandma just evaporates apparently maybe one day they will add cemetery but its not in the released game yet 

on the other hand there is a 2 year maternity leave your women wont work for 2 years after their baby is born children dont work until 18  and the work day is from 8am to 5pm
you get the idea

the citizens expect you to provide them with a house firewood regular meals and water pretty standard in this kind of game at some point you can organize the work so the village would become selfsustainable but it will take a lot of time and effort to get to that point you will probably get bored way before that happens because the game really feels like chores sometimes mass production is sloooow and boring however if you are patient you will enjoy the fruits of your labor 

economy needs serious balancing there is no incentive to grow or produce fancier goods except for the roleplaying purpose you can make more money with simple stuff 

there are some bugs that need to be fixed in the main menu there is a button called unstuck you will use this button frequently because your character will become glued to the terrain at least once per gaming session 
just having this button in 10 speaks volumes about the state of the game doesnt it

#####

tl dr  great game addictive does the job of several games all at once   

i play a lot of life simulations as well as farming sims  i also occasionally enjoy colony building sims including banished and foundation  of course i have played a few medieval type sims including saelig and of course the life is feudal series  and the ultimate medievaltype game skyrim  ive even played toplitzs farmers dynasty  somehow this game medieval dynasty md has taken the good points of all of these and merged them into a seamless mixture that feels very natural and compelling

i cant emphasize this enough  usually when you see a mashup game it manages to satisfy some but not all aspects of the experience and has something or things wrong with it  bad graphics buggy gameplay grindiness or just plain incompletethese are words that come to mind  or in the case of life is feudal because its an online multiplayer game you risk hundreds of hours of work disappearing when the server owner just deletes it which has happened to me  i can describe each of the games in the previous paragraph this way theres something wrong or off with each of them  but somehow the devs and producers managed to minimize these issues in md and maximize the good

gameplay unfolds naturally following an rpg type storyline where the protagonist grows in knowledge skills and community stature along with you the player learning the ropes in this worlds deep crafting and management systems  the world looks and feels beautiful and natural nothing is glaringly wrong and provides a good backdrop to all your activities  it does not require a toptier brand new pc to run  the quests and stories are interesting the use of the english language translations are extremely good  npcs and animals look and feel natural for the most part  random encounters out in the woods seem novel and exciting no spoilers  combat with axe spears and bow works quite well  human interactions also seem calibrated just rightyou neednt listen to a vendors long rambling intro every time you visit them its just a hi then when done a have a nice day in neutral tone  at last a game where everything is great good or ok and thus far nothing is bad or annoying  that is saying a lot

generally you might describe the gameplay as first person banished in that your main aim is to manage the growth of a community building buildings gathering resources and recruiting  feeding  housing villagers  you are there alongside of them doing adventure  quest type activities and ferrying stuff to and from town to make coin  you also step in to do tasks your villagers are not yet able to do but eventually you can automate everything once you and your villagers are capable  thus the developers have managed to merge rpg and life sim elements with a town building and management game

and that long list of games i mentioned  i can get the best they have to offer all at once just by playing md  i think i will be playing this one for a long time  helpfully the devs have even more up their sleeves with some even more advanced stuff coming soon  already this is in my topten list of games that i have ever played in my 50 year life  kudos to the dev team

#####

people who like survival sims like banished or life is feudal forest village will absolutely dig this if you want to lay siege to castles battle klingorcs or somesuch youre spoiled for choice but so far there has been little in the way of entertainment for those of us who like it a bit more relaxed and dont fancy themselves the battle of verdun on a weekly basis

this being an early access game not even in beta stage yet a lot of things have a bit of an unfinished feel to it but thats what youd expect when testing what is effectively an early prototype of the finished product  whats in there already is quite simply fantastic even at this early stage the landscape is immersive and has a very natural feel to it the interface feels well thought through and people familiar with games based on the unreal engine will know how to configure the controls it has a somewhat bizzare fun to it steering a character through a medieval landscape using a flight simulator yoke and rudder pedals but thats just me being weird i guess 

a lot of this games future will hinge on the developers now the massively positive response to the game could propel them to even greater heights with the finished product or cause an incentive to abandon it halfway through in favour of a completely new project lets hope the pendulum swings in the right direction and this games will actually become a finished product if the current quality is used as a base to build upon this game could set a standard that is hard to match 

as for the criticism there is a lot to criticise actually but most of it is down to the fact that the game isnt finished yet but there are some things that i think shouldnt be overlooked when finishing the product 

1 eye candy

people who like this sort of mundane game are also often sticklers for looks and details maybe its because im german or maybe im just weird but one of the main gripes i have is that it is so difficult to place objects and buildings accurately and  correctly aligned ive abandoned games because some houses didnt properly align with the road maybe a simplified overhead view for building placement would do the ui some good 

also and i guess thats more a case of things that come last in the development cycle id like the buildings to have some more life in it why i need to put the water tub outside is a bit of a mystery especially as it could make washing your hair a somewhat painful experience in winter also storages like the food storage would benefit from actually showing some of the stuff stored in them its a bit of a bummer to build a huge honking building for effectively housing an empty chest but again thats probably somewhat further down the prorities list 

all in all the game is definitely on a way to success and is just what people like me needed who fancy themselves a few hours of sedate fun it wont make the cut for those who look for a four hour adrenaline trip of endless warfare against klingorcs elves or ze germans and i hope the developers wont overdo the planned bandits feature 

a well deserved thumbs up from me for medieval dynasty

#####

an enjoyable buildingsurvival game with a relatively realistic setting i played this for about 120 hours after it released and although it was a positive experience i eventually lost interest for a couple of reasons these may or may not be problems for other players  my wife for example is not bothered by them

first the game is played in seasonal turns this is a good system that has an impact on what can be gathered and what resources are required etc however the transition from season to season is abrupt and artificial you might write this off as simply an episodic approach but for me it was jarring and annoying each time  as the player character location resets each time and sends you back to your home base

outside the initial story thread missions the side questsmissions that you receive are very repetitive and become tedious after a short time the games economic base is also rudimentary and a lot more could be done to make trading interesting

however the biggest issue i had was that the game lacks tension i appreciate that the makers did not want it to be a heroic quest game where the player is a noble or knight however there is very little challenge apart from routine settlement management an occasional serious problem would add a lot there are random bands of brigands for example but they never raid the settlements just waylay you on the trails if you happen to encounter them  roving individuals traders tinkers priests etc would all a lot of life to the otherwise rather static feel

as i said other players may not have a problem with any of these things but keep in mind this is not a fastpaced first person shooter or adventure game it is a very chilled and relaxed game and if that is what you are looking for you will probably love it

yes i would recommend this game but not to every gamer

#####

man so here i am never been much on posting a review before but medieval dynasty has me posting my very first game review im pretty sure this is my first lol and i am no noob to purchasing games on steam

i see so many game reviews that virtually say the same thing over and over i want to bring something different to my review

so my review will be geared towards the average citizen working a stressful life living a stressful life every day in my opinion medieval dynasty is in the same genre as games like stardew valley and little inferno it has as many customizable options as 7 days to die believe me that is saying a lot this game can be as laid back or as difficult as you like

want to be invincible max profits max xp gains max skill levels in no time look no further
want to understand what life was like back hundreds of years ago going through every painstaking motion that villagers had to go through in those times the food for the village the water for the village the every day dangers that they had to go through just to contribute their share disease food poisoning etc again look no further than medieval dynasty

i absolutely appreciate the game developers and what they have brought to one single game every last detail has been taken into account



a lot has been argued everywhere you look on what affects a villagers mood
spoiler alert spoiler alert please do not read any further if you like solving and learning situations on your own

spoiler here read at your own peril i have found the following not through hearsay but through my own personal handson experience this is all about the mood of your villagers a hot topic to say the least



the material that the house is made of is a huge mood affector rock walls upgraded with limestone ftw the size of the home does not matter 

how happy is your villager with the job that they have been assigned to i will always assign a villager to a specific job only if they have a minimum of a skill of 3 in that particular field their skill increases as long as they stay busy their skill increases their mood increases

pregnancy once a couple has a child their moods increase

food the biggest debate and the most argued clear your minds and read carefully the kind of food they eat does not affect their moods i usually go with dried meat andor dried fish just keep them fed

i have been experimenting with decorations in a persons home decorations seem to have no effect on a persons mood

i am very selective when it comes to inviting people to live in my village now a city i always try to keep the womenmen ratio at exactly 5050 always a simple small home like any other home allows exactly one man and one woman to livehis is maximum efficiency at its maximum dont be afraid to be selective about who you invite to live in your village imo you should always look for a person that has a skill level of three in an at least one area hunting fishing extraction diplomacy production animalsbarn working

if you are having trouble making money to pay the kings taxes ill let you in a little secret it takes money to make money what am i talking about again spoilers read on at own risk

flax seeds being planted in spring harvested in summer mix that with owning sheep folds filled to the brim with wool producing sheep or rams lambs are cute but of no real use except to sell them and put more money towards buying actual sheep and rams unless you are more patient than i which eventually your lambs will grow into sheeprams

now let us throw in a barn turn your flax stalks into an insane amount of flax seeds like 10x what you planted which is worth money and flax 

now let us throw in a sewing hut where you can turn your flax into linen thread well what do your know this is also the same place you can turn wool into wool thread who woulda thunk it

now you have every machine you need in the sewing hut to turn all that wool thread and linen thread into all kinds of clothing given you paid for the recipes to be unlocked which can be sold at a nice price

if you are thinking fruit trees for profit again more spoilers
cherry trees ftw have a tavern built so they can turn cherries into cherry juice and cherry juice into cherry wine you also need at least one or two experienced extractors collecting clay so you can hand it off to your people with the ability to make clay wine bottles

there are a lot of variables to take into consideration when trying to figure out the best bang for your buck when it comes to planting the various fruit trees i analyzed this rather extensively and found that cherry trees do the job better than the rest selling cherry wine is a great income


#####

i dont know what it is ive played a bunch of survival games crafting and building games simulations this game doesnt have much in the way of antagonists at this time some animals are dangerous starvation is a thing but easily mitigated yet 100 hours in with little in the way of additional direction im eager to keep playing the graphics looks great the animations are awesome it just feels so immersive and i get to build a town the way i want to where i want to invite people and give them jobs and then frantically run around in my limited time closing all of the gaps ive created for myself until i organize people and jobs better all the while im slowly unlocking new buildingstech and waiting for my son to eventually grow up and take over im really not sure whats special about this formula but for some reason this game has gotten me fully hooked

#####

the only downside i have found to this is its not multiplayer i absolutely love this would love to play with friends

#####

this game is a black hole its the type of game you sit down to mess around on for 20 minutes and then 5 hours have passed youve pissed yourself and your mouth is drier than a pharohs sock 

the phyiscs can be very clunky and at its base settings the villagers needs were laughably easy to fulfil these are fairly minor complaints as the base mechanics and the feeling of constantly working towards the next thing carry this game into the limelight 

however 
following what is for the most part the main quest in the form of uniegosts story is a trial of tedium i can best liken it to racimer being a camera for an ongoing drama with some very slight choices by the player that really dont amount to much for example there is a quest near the conclusion of the line which ill keep as vague as possible you have to travel to the very far east corner of the map to speak to someone who has critical information the game hypes this moment up you get there for me at the time it was getting dark and raining quite heavily which really helped the atmosphere and the guy first dallies for no particularly good reason directly calling out that you need this information in a time critical manner before the guy asks you to collect his groceries yep 20 beetroot 20 onions 20 cabbage 20 carrots for the most part the rest of the quests are running back and forth across the map occasionally getting items talking to various npcs spout exposition about your uncle

why why did you feel the need to utterly destroy any tension and energy that these quests were building i was invested right up until this point as far as i can tell from looking into this quest there is no way around this 

the gameplay progression from resource management to town building to people management to trade and bartering to build specific types of villages and areas is amazing 1010 ign but god damn is it let down by its main quest
the other main quest is the chapters line but these are more tutorial checklists that guide you into what you should probably focus on next while doing these is mandatory for unlocking new buildings its all things you would probably be doing anyway completing the radiant quests building a farm hunting animals etc so i dont really count that as a story quest so to speak 

but yeah a solid 910 game that is fantastic for just losing time and enjoying the good ol days of feudalism that is very heavily and disappointingly let down hard by its story

#####

really fun game only real thing it needs now is some kind of coop or multiplayer thatd be the cherry on top

#####

overall rating 910
this game is truly amazing i have played for over 80 hours and still have more i want to do i cannot stop playing it if you like medieval games and want to live in and make a medieval village buy this game there is so much to do and so much to enjoy and my only negative point is that i want more i want to give even more money for expansion packs and stuff because the 20 i spent on this game was not enough this game has me addicted the fact that its medieval 1010 the amount of things to do 1010 the rag doll physics when i crash into something on my horse and go flying off 1010 in all honesty though i wish there were more buildings i could make more bandits to kill and other such stuff and also i think a coop mode would be great

#####

the game is addicting  its a fun builder and ive spent a fair amount of time on it  i feel like its missing a couple of key elements though

first i would enjoy this game much more as a survival with some sort of offensivedefensive  wild animals occasional ambush from war thieves anything

second the game being mostly economic based needs a lot of tweaking to make it somewhat realistic for any time period  far too often the values of goods are higher and better as unfinished products than they are as finished goods once you consider the amount of work put in  id recommend severely reducing the value of unfinished goods to make it worth more to have developers in your towns

its still in dev so hopefully these things get worked out  even if it doesnt ever add a fighting element the game could be saved by getting the commerce system right  looking forward to the western one slated to come out next year

#####

the game is pretty good and have a good concept but need a coop mode or multiplayer mode this game would be so much nice to play with friend

#####

this game has to be some of the most atrotious ux ive ever seen theres zero explanation on the things that actually mater and an overwhelming amount of help pages on things you dont even need just trying to figure out how to make an axe to start the game took about 30 minutes and scouring the keybinds this is the first thing you need to even start playing and it couldnt be fucked to explain this or make it easy to identify then about another hour in and building a house was an even bigger disaster what is straw why cant i find it is it the hay in a field since thats what straw is no straw is reeds from a river in this game how would anyone ever figure that out i had to go to a wiki to even begin to understand this game because its so horrendously designed and explained

after the crashes that locked my computer so badly that i had to hard reset the entire computer i returned this mess maybe it gets amazing later maybe this is actually a masterpiece covered in garbage ill never know and i have zero interest in even giving them another chance

#####

its a good world building gamei hope the developers will develop more things to do though because it get monotonous once youve unlocked the whole tech treemaybe some raids from bandits would be nice that is scaling or developing a militia

#####

do you like to start with nothing and work your way up  if so you will love this game

you start the game with nothing  finding rocks and sticks you build simple tools  then you build your house and various supporting buildings like hunters lodge blacksmith cooking storage etc    you can romance and marry a wife and have one male child  you can recruit people to live and work in your village  they can get married and have up to two children depending on how big a house  you build them

there are some simple quests that can reward items or progress towards unlocking buildings  hunting is very important

you can build farm plots and either work them yourself or have your farmers work them for you  there are farm animals to buy and breed

if you set up your village optimally it will run without your involvement  but it takes some work to get everything balanced

you can earn money and have to pay taxes each year  eventually you can unlock market stalls and assign a villager to automatically sell some of your items

i had a great time with the game and liked it enough that i worked to earn 100 of the achievements  highly recommended

#####

lemme tell ya the story of fishpuncher once upon a time a peasant man with nothing to his name decidedi need money but i aint got no skills to get itso fishpunch as per his namesake decided to waddle out into the local lake and start punching fish just bop bop bop bop punching all the fish he could and taking there meatsometime even the occasional duck when it got too close and curious fishpuncher didnt discriminate his fist where an equal opportunity employer fishpuncher took all that meat his lil arms could carry and sold it using that money from his hard work he started a village a few buildings here nothing fancy but he was respected people wanted to live around this legend one day fishpuncher was getting some ore from a mine and wandered out late at night to a bear fishpuncher was like oh shit bear you dont know who your messing with theres a reason my knuckles smell like fishand not for the reason you think and he bop bop bop bopped that bear barely living after drinking a potion he had been saving that day fish puncher upgraded to fishbearpuncher things went well for ole fishbearpuncher his village prospered he was respected and feared by all fish and bears alikeand ducks to a lesser degree because thos bastards could flybut they still feared a donkey punch when he creeper walked up to a distracted one but then one day taking all that hard earned coin fishbearpuncher wanted to leave a legacy for his heir deciding he was all about that pear life now running thru the woods and not being careful he had no clue on his way to buy thos sweet sweet pear saplings he had pissed off 5 wolves on his way that he so rudely had ignored and didnt know they where messing with a legend surrounded once they caught up to him fishbearpuncher commited the highest sin to his character possiblehe pulled out a iron cudgel and bopped all 5 of the wolfbecause fuck you cant punch that many wolves at once and i aint dieing without planting thos damned treesashamed of himself fishbearpunchertheliar hung up his title after planting thos trees for his sonso ended the story of fishbearpunchertheliarpearman and so began the story of fishpuncher the 2nd esquire

i like pears were a pear village around these partswant something else go away we got pear wine pear tarts pear juice and evenregular pears we got so many pears here were practically giving them awayexcept were not you gotta pay for them

#####

its a weird game or rare not that this genre is rare but the way it presented is not common this could be like one of those common village building resource gathering and managing games which are usually presented in top down view rts mode but this is in fps mode know that survival fps games usually like to put player in a dire situation everything is dangerous and you are alone more combat focused like the forest or green hell 

but medieval dynasty is like banished in fps and rpg mode instead of ruling your villagers in god view you become one of them do all kind of work yourself too its immersive but not like many other fps survival there isnt immediate danger there isnt medieval warfare or aristocracy power play just a peaceful village life if you want medieval battle or something this is not the one the point is the protagonist ran away from war and seek peace in far away land so dont expect epic battle and heroism there is minor combat like animal hunting and bandit fighting if you encounter them on the road

your village can run on its own mostly but still player have to intervene to do a lot of chores and crafting to keep things going they can be very tedious also the game pace is very slow though i enjoy the game its definitely not for everyone 


#####

very solid game at first glance after a first addiction however it becomes super repetetive and grindy along with many many balancing problems and a lack of long term motivation and reward the so called full release felt very much unfinished and basically like open beta 20 the so called dynasty aspect means nothing to me as of now because why would i keep playing for 200h doing the same stuff all over every day just to finally see my child reach adulthood and no real benifits of having an heir in the first place because continue playing with him would just mean keep doing the exactly same stuff for another 200h
what this game needs the most is workshop support so the community could add content like additional buildings or alternative skins more crafting recipies addiitonal crops more weaponsarmor and fighting rebalanace mods or even total conversions sadly the developers seem to be pigheaded about that question despite how much that would profit their game
until then this gets a thumbs down from me when you love the grind aspects of survivalcrafts you might still want to grab this on sale

#####

game looks great but it is incredibly shallow lacking content and a huge grind the unrealistic mechanics of the game have already been described in detail in other reviews so i wont bore you with a repeat here there is so little content for a survivaldynasty simulator that i wouldnt call this game either of them

#####

i wanted to do a quick rereview on medieval dynasty  i have played the game for going on 40 hours over the past two weeks  these days i rarely play games more than a few hours a week but md has me hooked   i enjoy good survival games and this is a great one  i enjoy citysim management games and this has it you can create a small settlement or make a sprawling city   as of the moment i have around 70 villagers 3 kids on the way by them my own heir four fully staffed mines five hunting loges 3 woodsheds and so on   one game day i may have to spend the entire day tending to the villagers and making sure they are making what we need and have the tools they want   the next i may spend my entire day away doing quest   the game is so varied   honestly it is unlike any other survival game i can think of

even though i have such a thriving township i almost rarely have any issues with lagging or other issues  the game runs great on my aging machine     i cant recommend it enough   this is one of those games that at least for me i go to sleep thinking about how i am going to maximize my towns output and so on    at least for my as i said i usually spend one day in the city building some new homes and taking care of the villagers needs then i go the next day questing and seeing about recruiting new villagers and then the last day of the season i kind of see where i am at

below is my prior review but i wanted to update it now that i am closing in on 40 hours and wanted to praise the game even more

i now have back 30 hours invested into the game and still have a ton of stuff to unlock i am about to end season 2 however the game is a blast i am up just over 40 villagers and its almost a full time job keeping them all happy and in the correct job for their skill sets this game is a blast i cant remember the last time i played a game this long when i have a ton of other new games to also try out it has been fun watching my villa grow to now it is larger than any of the other villas on the map

prior update
just wanted to add that i am nearing the 18 hour mark or so and i am loving the game a ton one of my favorite survival games bar none i did three restarts before i finally got things going like i liked them its not a hard game but it takes some getting used to more reviewing to come

original review below
i played medieval dynasty for about an hour today it is a pretty nice survival game i havent made it further than building my first house so i cant really speak to the building a whole village part by any means at this point the game was a little jerky at places but i will just blame that on my aging i57400 with 16gb ram and 1060 gtx running on an ssd which isnt a trail blazer anymore over all if you like survival games you will feel right at home with that part its the typical gather resources build a very low level batch of tools to build your first flimsy house then you unlock more and more recipes as you go along the game is nice to look at other than the frame rate issues i had i didnt run into any bugs or crashes there were a few moments of stupid me when i was looking for a particular resource and just wasnt looking in the right spot because of where i settled all in all though i give it a strong 758 at this point i will have to update this once i get further along and start doing more nontraditional survival stuff in the game i have so many games to play between survival and city management games its hard for to me to stick to any particular game for any length of time as i tend to bounce between games pretty often but i think md is one that i will be coming back to in short order after i try out my other games from the steam sale

this game is perfect

a positive force for change and development in my life

beneath the surface of survival grind is the promise of life and culture in a vibrant world

some tasks seem repetitive or superfluous but in my humble opinion really add to the charm 

i decided to grow 30 chunks of oats my first spring as well as 5 apple trees and 8 cherry trees i planted all kinds of survival crops and had the fortune of settling on top of 3 berry bush patches

the thrill of watching my first crops rise and ripen that first summer morning a whole morning of picking freshly ripened berries

my oats are still growing and i have the recipe for porridge

i had to clear so many f trees near that bridge the one near the one maple inside the road fork with the signage due west of gostovia i turned building limit up to 200 i have a decent chunk of village built

laying new road on land that was overgrown building houses out of the freshly cut maples

cleaning up the forests of sticks and stones nearby during the day cutting trees at night

im hoping my five villagers dont eat all the berries i want to mix them with my first autumn porridge

ive said all of this to say yes it is a survival grind but it is a beacon of light in an entire industry saturated in darkness

it gives the promise of life building life the nurturance of life 

i whittled 500 wooden ladles to pay for 8 cherry tree seedlings my first spring watching them grow fills me with hope and joy

the visible and substantial impact you have on the world around you makes it feel like a world that you are living in it not just passing through

are there bandits are there wolves yes the world is not a perfect place settings lets you turn bandits off i wont judge but it adds so much vibrancy to the landscape of this games setting

someday ill be brewing oat ale in a tavern with seeds from my first crop those many years ago a giant city spanning the river full of living wonder

this game may reflect our world and its horrors at times but it also reflects our hopes in our struggles our striving for a better life and world

this game offers one other thing a chance at an honest funfilled yet calm life but the freedom for more in fact if i can proffer one word to sum up thoughts freedom build where you want work when you want 

a wonderful addition to my collection im certain i will be playing this game for literal years

#####

awesome game immersive depending on how you choose to play it the story is interesting if not a bit predictable building a town inviting people to come and be a part of it thats where it shines ive enjoyed the hunting the quests the environment in this game you build skills by doing you want to be a better farmer you have to grab a hoe and farm want to be a hunter grab a spear or bow and get to work the town building economy planning immersive feel to me were the best parts oh and some of the interactions with npc are pretty good as well having a family and building a dynasty was a nice way to give the game some different flavor if i had a wish list more story and fully voiced npcs would be nice to the team nice work

h1 live your own medieval life without pressure and lack of time h1

bso what can i say what other people have said before toob

i love this game i played this game since the early acess over 100 hours on another platform until my game was suddenly unplayable ive also played this game on steam for about 100 hours now and i think there will be many more hours to come its my favorite game since the publication its your decision how to play this game sometimes i spend one year in this game only to walk around and make some quests in another year i build my village and looking for other villager or spend my time to decorate my little village this is why i love this game
you can notice that the developer also love their game great is that they show the progress and new content on the roadmap i think there will come so much more content for this game and i will be pleased for this

i played this game for about 2030 hours on xbox gamepass and had such a good time with it i had to get it on steam this game is a 910 for me and could easily be 1010 if they would just add multiplayer and some more combat because right now you just do quests and build a town which dont get me wrong is still really fun and ill still be putting many more hours into the game but theres no threat to your civilization like if they added a war function where other towns would declare war on you or you even declare war on them and have to go take over their town or even random bandits that would try to come and vandalize and rob your town itd make the game have so much more replayability but sadly currently it has nothing similar to this which just feels like a missed opportunity to me however if you just want a relatively peaceful other than the very rare bandit camps that are really easy pretty much lifecivilization building simulator id say this the game for you

#####

it is an peaceful game if you want it to be yes there are wolves and other dangerous things but you move at your pace and never feel pressured to step out of your zone  whether playing the story or just having fun with the hunting system the game provides for many types of players  customize houses to make homes how you want to recruit citizens for your village serve the king and raise your family very relaxing game that i enjoy playing alot  with the new multiplayer map coming ill enjoy it even more

#####

absolutely incredible gameplay different herbs and fruits are available only during certain seasons just like in real life the game doesnt hold your hand so it is challenging enough to keep you interested but not so difficult that you get frustrated and give up plenty of hunting scavenging foraging farming building managing the economy etc honestly ive been looking for a game like this for years cant wait for coop my boyfriend loves it too we tend to like very different games hes a tarkov guy and im a minecraft girl we finally found something that we both enjoy massively

#####

new update made everything worthless nerfed stamina gathering speed severely nerfed durability of tools had a completely self sufficient town that now needs alot of work for no reason on top of that almost everything that it produced is now worth a handful of coins even things like health potions sell for a measley 6 gold their excuse because now with coop it would be too easy for 4 people if they didnt make everything harder even if you play single player on the old map then i realized i cant even go back to a previous version or turn off auto updates for this game

#####

way too early to be pushed out of ea  game has been unpolished for a while  this is concerning that they are releasing it as a full game so soon

#####

this game is really beautiful and immersive 
then my villagers burned 150 logs and all planks because i didnt know i had to untick this and i wasnt aware of this absurd and unrealistic demand for firewood even with insulated houses 
then meat turns out to have less or equal value than cabbage  a whole boar lasts what two days for one person so at first i played it joyfully then realized i ended uo as a serf grinding all day long increasingly being annoyed
example  employing a fisher means you have to provide him with fishing spears crafted in a smithy which you have to research and build the fishing spear uses linen thread which i dont have  made out of flax which i cant grow because i have no fertilizer which i cant make cause i got no manure cause i have no pigs cause i have no money to buy them and no technology to buy a pigsty and so on 
thats the game in a nutshell 
i will continue to play it though in a kind of sandbox mode as a hunter as a farmer not get married make the villagers leave and eventually initiate a rebellion against the king and his stupid taxes
