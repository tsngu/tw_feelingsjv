this review will be updated as things are either implemented or fixed for an accurate 
                                                                             depiction of improvements or lack there of

i think this is my first ever review and honestly im so disappointed in this game that i actually needed to leave my input
do not buy unless it is over 80 off or do not buy at all

the pc version is vastly different from the console versions i dont even think its the same game honestly
mycareer story nope
explore the locker room nope
select what jerseys you want to play in nope yes this has been patched oct 21 2023
accessories for away games nope this has been fixed
graphics are identical to 2k22 maybe even 2k20 officially dubbing it last gen graphics since its embarrassing to still have nothing from the now current generation of consoles ps5 xbox series x
 the rec is actually unplayable i have waited more than 30min to find a match with no way to leave the matchmaking screen once you have teammates aka maybe one or 2 real players and then autofilled ai teammates literally a useless game mode added on dec 1 2023 this has not changed since the launch of the game


i held off to buy this years game because i didnt see anything i wanted in 2k23
i didnt think i would get duped into buying a game through false advertisements
youre going to have all these things  ooh youre on pc though so heres a reskinned 2k22 but thanks for your hard earned money for this new instalment of the franchise

this version should be 12 the listed price since pc players got less than half of the sick features that consoles received
this game is highway robbery at full price

final verdict feb 2 2024
do not purchase this game
some of the glitches and bugs were fixed up however nothing else of importance has changed
the only focus is on pushing out more purchasable cards in myteam and not improving the game itself

again do not purchase this game
i will continue to play this game until next gen graphics finally catch up to pc which will probably then be current gen by then lets be honest and only because i already own it obviously

quick addition

its f i n a l l y on sale for 1279 cad 84 off until march 7th 2024 today is feb 22
if youre desperate for a roster update after owning an older 2k for my player then its worth the sale price
exact same sale came around for the steam spring sale ends mar 21 2024

other than being on a deep sale of 80 off or more i still can not recommend buying this game
the company seems to have abandoned development for this version since november bug fixes but they still have the time to update exclusive items that you can buy with your hard earned vc or real money

#####

waste of money dont waste your money get 2k23 and use a created 24 roster save 60 bucks literally nothing new besides mamba moments even the rookie animations arent new theyre old animations from prior 2k games that they had taken away previously this is one of the worst releases ive ever seen this is actually my 1 and only review of a game ever and i wouldnt do this unless it was truly that bad

#####

should be illegal to release 2 way different games under the same name

#####

how to refund

go to this link v
helpsteampoweredcom

find nba2k24 and click on it
click its not what i expected then id like to request a refund they will ask you why and you can choose whichever but i chose its not fun hopefully you get your money back

#####

somehow the pc edition of this game has less content than the console versions i hate whoever makes decisions for this game i hate you

#####













2k

#####

pc still being last gen is the funniest joke 2k has ever put out

#####

trash ass dev cant even bring next gen to pc

#####

no next gen do not buy on pc 

#####

im someone who buys nba2k every couple of years when im looking for that sports game itch only when it drops to 15 or less never brand new i usually enjoy playing the story mode with my created player so to find out that there is zero story in this game was really disappointing having to jump into the starting lineup of an nba team as a 60 overall player is just cruel i dont usually play online even though i would like to because it takes a ridiculous amount of time to level up your player unless you spend a lot of money in previous years it took a while to level up but it was doable in this game it is actually insane how slow progression is if youre a casual player like me do not buy this game this game literally made me pull out my xbox 360 wipe off the dust and play nba 2k13 for the first time in a decade and i had a blast microtransactions have ruined sports games

#####

i will only buy this game when its next gen here on pc until then they are not getting another cent from me

#####

give pc next gen

#####

this isnt a good game im just playing it because im autistic and my special interest is basketball and this is basically the only basketball game

#####

cant even play duos or trios without crashing please dont buy this game dont be dumb like us

#####

one of the worst 2ks ive experienced my last 2k purchase was nba 2k19 as the years went on i didnt bother buying the latest 2k releases playing the same version as well as the newer versions at friends houses i realized how much the game has changed in a negative way i am deeply certain that most 2k developers have never played on hardwood nor blacktops to understand the physics and dynamics of basketball since when 2k and cs2 share the same mechanics when a defender barely grazes me or is within 2 feet my player slows down since when did players start slowing down once they broke their defender like who does that especially on fast breaks too my player is capped out as well and it doesnt make sense to get slowed down by any player that just simply sticks an arm out 2k developers need to go to a ymca and play some pickup games with randoms to understand how basketball works it doesnt get better either after posting my last review the game actually became a lot worse why am i playing scripted games i could drop 50 points and my team would still have a scripted deficit in the 4th quarter like why since when did the worse team inherit the skills of the 96 bulls and the 18 warriors  2ksports i ask what made you think this game was worth publishing as if the state of gaming couldnt get any worse you ruined a favorite sports title i also think yall will not recover from this as a hooper this company does not know ball and as a hooper this product is a disgrace to basketball and shame on you for putting the late great kobe bryant on this rubbish of a product mamba out

#####

this is one of the worst releases in the history of video games 
i wanted to start off by mentioning that 2k is worth billions of us dollars by the 2800 reviews already not a person is happy with their nba 2k24 steam gaming experience the 2k developers clearly dont listen to the community and they think this is fair charging full price for 2017 technology this game is current gen on a single platform server no cross platform 
my ultimate question is why my 4000 pc with a 4070ti graphics card cannot run the current generation nba 2k24 or at least why it isnt an option to buy the real game 

if i could get a refund i would but unfortunately was gifted the game via amazon giftcard as a birthday present sadly the worst thing i got for my birthday which is what lead me here to this review after a couple hours on the game not a thing feels optimized the graphics are so underpar even on max settings it crazy to think the 2k creator teams think this is worthy i just want the 2k17 experience back where there was a wide range of skill builds as well as creativity

the last thing to mention is that in the first week of release somehow half the player base is 99 overall with ridiculous myplayer clothing that is practically priceless if youre not cheating with 99 overall youre simply not winning
do not waste your money on this

#####

alright i will leave an actual review instead of just calling 2k racist towards pc which they are i personally am enjoying the game but that is because i play with my brother and i took 2k23 off so i have been waiting over a year to play 2k

in this game 2k really did less then the bare minimum literally the only thing new in this game is the park design everything else is the same or has been completely removed

this game is not next gen which is a huge slap in the face to the pc community since pc hardware is so much better than that of the ps5 or xbox they say nobody plays the game on pc but clearly that is a flat out lie based on all of these reviews

aside from not being next gen here are the other issues i have with the game

1 no voice chat  this has been an issue on pc for forever and makes the game feel kind of lonely why is voice chat not enabled i cant talk to the people i play with or attempt to make new friends over the game not having voice chat in 2024 is just unacceptable

2 no mycareer story  they removed the story entirely so there is basically no reason to play single player mycareer if i want to play single player games i will just use player lock on myleague 

3 mycareer is too hard  i usually play mycareer on hof difficulty but this year it is impossible to do so my teammates cannot make a single open shot and always take contested layups or midranges on the other hand the cpu makes everything they take even if they are contested i even dropped the difficulty down to allstar and it is still not enjoyable

4 no myteam  never really got into myteam but they basically took it out entirely i feel bad for anyone who actually bought 2k for myteam

5 season progression is way too fast with no rewards  i have played 16 rec games in 17 hours on the game and i am already lvl 40 on the season pass with 39 days until the season ends what am i supposed to play for now there are no good rewards in this game that warrant me to put the time in i feel bad for anybody that bought the season pass because the rewards are awful you unlock mascots but not really you unlock the opportunity to spend 100 worth of vc to buy one

6 too many hackers  there has got to be an anticheatthere just has to be park is loaded with hackers like literally one on every court rec isnt as bad as park but i have played with one on my team and it just made the game not enjoyable this is only day 5 i am sure they will get worse as time goes on

7 everything is too expensive  2k forces you to spend money on vc if you want the game to be at least somewhat enjoyable the 100k vc i got from the league pass edition only put my character to a 72 ovr that is just not fun now i can only get 1000 vc per game which means i have to play like 300 games just to get my player to a 99ill pass on that

in conclusion these are the main complaints i have but i am sure as i keep playing i will find more the fact that they took away more features than they added  and charged full price  should be illegal this game can be fun and i am sure i will enjoy myleague i hope but it should be 10 max i hope 2k listens to these reviews since it is now top 2 in all time negative reviews on steam

2k please forget about money and just make a game people can enjoy in the long run everyone will benefit from it for now i hope everyone continues to beat you down until you listen you greedy son of a guns

#####

getting more expensive every year with no content or much worse content than before
feels like 2k doesnt care anymore and just wants to get as much money as they can while there are still a few players left

#####

2k is racist against pc

#####

ronnie 2k is the worst thing to happen to the human race

#####

i have given this game a chance but it just brings me more frustration than fun

here are my list of reasons

1  nba 2k24 pc version is not nextgen and is missing content that is provided in the ps5 version  

they couldnt even put in the new scoreboard  modders have made a version of the new scoreboard for pc before 2k  how lazy can you be  

heres another example
in myteam you can equip a home  away and alternate jerseyeverytime 2k releases new season jerseys they only release 2 home  away with no alternate jerseylmao
they dont even know their own gamesmh 



2  nba 2k24 pc costs the same price as the ps5 nextgen version meaning im paying more for less #greed  #fraud



3  the game has sooo many bugs and even if you open a ticket with 2k support i have opened over 10 tickets they eventually close your ticket without resolving the issue

here are some examples
a  playing an opponent that has the same color or identical jersey as you and getting a loss and potentially banned if you quit the game    
b  cannot save the camera view in triple threat even though there is a save option
c  intermittent game freezes for 30 seconds sometimes resulting in a midgame crash
d  getting stuck in a loop in mycareer when trying to play games with other online players
e  season 4 jerseys # font is too big and doesnt display properly in game or edit screen on pc
f  matchmaking is terribleyou can have a team of emeralds and be forced to play against pink diamonds
g  cannot change the camera view for mycourt in mycareer
h random game crashes to desktop for no apparent reason
i  the badges and playbooks are different on pc vs ps5
j  some menu navigation options dont work on myteam pc it says press lt or rt but nothing happens
and so much more



4  too many microtransactions
the player market controlled by 2k  that has replaced the auction house is too expensive  if you want to try out a new cardyou will instantly lose 60 of the original value  if you choose to sell the card because you dont like it or want to get a better player card  a 60 money grab by 2k for what #bigpimpin



5  too much gambling 
game pack odds are questionable 
every reward you receive after winning a game that has value is attached to a gambling component spin the wheel drop the ball open the door that is manipulated by 2k sports to encourage you to spend money

this is achieved by making you buy crappy player packs with odds that are not in your favor after you dont get the reward you actually wanted for winning the game or completing the challenge  

when you purchase player packs you have less than 2 odds to get a top tier card at a minimum cost of 4000 mt per pack you buy  your best chance to get a top tier card at 13 odds costs 21000 mt per deluxe player packoryou can buy a top tier card for over 200000 mt instant 60 loss in value if it isnt locked behind a paywall of 800000 mtlmao

do not buy base packsthey are worthless  2k nerfed the odds so they are even worse

ohhhhhhhi forgot
this is how much you earn per game approximately
the grind is real crazy
so your option is spend real money or no life the game
1 triple threat game  400 to 800 mt 
1 clutch time game  800 to 1200 mt
1 domination game 2500 to 4000 mt



6  gameplay is clunky and choppy with animationsit sometimes feels like there is a wall in front of you or that you got cement in your shoes



7  if you want to play myteam or my career expect to pay a minimum of 500 over the 9 seasons or have no life trying to grind out the game for free and still always be at a disadvantage vs opponents who spend money on the game



8  the game ai artificial intelligence can be overpowered making some challenges impossible or extremely frustrating requiring the use of metas which make the game irritating boring and monotonous  

all star difficulty is brokenthe cpu fouls you pushes you out of bounds inair collisions clothesline you in midair  no foul call 
how is a 6 ft 200 lb guard able to bully 7ft 280lbs centers   gtfoh

your players feel like they should be playing in the fleague  they can no longer defend dribble move pass layup dunk or shoot  once again all rewards worth getting are usually achieved on allstar difficulty  in the meantime the cpu cant miss a shot and does everything faster and more efficiently than you

it is so noticeable and it becomes clear 2k has done this on purpose  2k plays with the animations and obviously the settings in any challenge pro and allstar when the reward is good  the difficulty feels so differentthe game plays choppy especially when the ai is trying to cheat or manipulate the gameplay

2ks goal is to frustrate you sooo muchthat you spend money on shortcuts buying packs which is the most scummiest form of manipulation  #psychology

it feels like 2k is teasing you with a free deluxe pack that is extremely hard to get if at all   it just makes me hate the game more and more each time i play itit has to be the most unsatisfying experience i have ever had playing a gamecompared to forza 4 that rewards you constantly just for driving your car

remember this is on pro or allstar difficulty
i dare you to try hof dominationyou will probably break your controller or monitorsmh

it makes me wonder if 2k really wants us to play their game or complete challenges
of course notthere is no money for them in that  



9  multiplayer modes can be very choppy making it difficult to time your shots 
shooting is more harder in nba2k24 than in previous versions and some of the best rewards are provided in multiplayer modelmao  

i dont even waste my time doing multiplayer challenges any more because it gets me so irritated  the variable shot timing and shot contest system is horriblei miss perfect green shots free throws and layups   anyone who tells you shooting is easy is lying or cheatinglol

think about it2k get numerous complaints about their servers but they still make the best rewards available only through multiplayerhow tone deaf can 2k be



10  the players you really want in myteam or give you the best chance of success are locked behind a paywall

sellable and unsellable player cards
let me make it simple
cards you buy are usually sellablemost cards you win or are rewarded are unsellable  

unsellable cards have more limitations in regards to value applying additional badges and in some cases cannot be used in exhibitions or the exchange  cards that you purchase do not have these limitations

every other game i play manages to find a balance between challenge  monetization  player enjoyment  2k has lost touch with the player base and thinks that its ok to spend thousands of dollars a year to play a broken video game that is copy and paste  of last year the same bugs in the game for years 



spending thousands of dollars on a basketball video game that is released annually with no carryover of your achievements your vc or your mt   in the toilet and tons of wasted time
yes 
people have even posted receipts online of spending over 5k on an nba 2k gamethat is insane

i can go on forever but its not worth my timei wasted enough already


2k has taken the fun out of this gameall they care about is making money and not the quality of product they sellthat is more than obvious  

if there is a mistake in pricing or a reward that they feel we dont deserve 2k will fix it in minutes gamebreaking bugs that affect gameplay and qol quality of life are fixed whenever 

if you buy or own nba 2k24play no money spent or the other offline modes
save your money and buy a car or a houselmao

do not drink the nba2k koolaid

please stop get some help

#####

the worst nba 2k release for pc so far every year they somehow manage to downgrade 2k24 is full of bugs in every single game mode mycareer has issues and they completely dropped the storyline myleague is the same as the past 5 years and crashes the game every once in a while the playnow online feature is basically unplayable at this point as people continue exploiting a glitch that causes you to lose the game automatically and dont even get me started on the neighborhood and how full of hackers the servers are so even on the offchance that the game doesnt crash and you are allowed to play you will most likely face hackers ive been playing this franchise for 12 years now and i sincerely recommend that you dont spend any money on an nba 2k game for pc its barely even worth it to buy it on console anyways

#####

nba 2k24 just like its predecessors is a classic example of how a franchise can become stagnant offering very little innovation year after year as a pc and steam player my experience with this game has been nothing short of disappointing plagued by inequality mistreatment bugs and server issues i think if me and my friends attempted to learn computer programming for two weeks we can come up with something better than this garbage my park is completely unplayable and pay to win

the biggest gripe i have with nba 2k24 is the lack of innovation it feels like im playing the same game as the previous versions with a fresh coat of paint the gameplay mechanics graphics and animations hardly seem to have evolved since the last installment its disheartening to see a franchise with such potential stuck in a neverending cycle of repetition

on top of that pc and steam players are often treated as secondclass citizens in the nba 2k community console players receive updates and content much earlier leaving pc players in the dust its frustrating to see this level of inequality especially when were expected to pay the same price for the game

bugs and glitches have been a longstanding issue in the nba 2k series and nba 2k24 is no exception the game is riddled with numerous bugs that can significantly impact the gameplay experience from ai issues to gamebreaking glitches its clear that quality assurance is not a priority for the developers

the servers in nba 2k24 are yet another source of frustration frequent server outages and lag spikes make online play an exercise in patience its incredibly frustrating to invest time and money into a game only to be constantly reminded of its technical shortcomings

in summary nba 2k24 continues the unfortunate trend of offering little innovation while perpetuating inequality and mistreatment towards pc and steam players the prevalence of bugs and server issues only adds insult to injury its high time the developers take a long hard look at their franchise and start delivering a truly fresh and engaging basketball experience rather than repackaging the same game year after year

#####

no next gen old builder no eras dont buy

#####

theres no next gen features no story mode for my career and the game constantly crashes on pc steam wouldnt refund do yourself a favour and dont buy

#####

i should have known that this game is worthless when it didnt have any gameplay trailer same game only minor adjustment they should change the price to only 5

#####

its not current gen quality pc gamers are missing a lot of in game perks with this game not being next gen

#####

this game does not have a quarter of the features on pc that consoles have including storymode and so much more do not buy this bundle of trash

#####

ronnie 2k more like dumb stupid idiot

#####

fvck you ronnie2k this garbage is not worth even 9 

#####

#####

#####

#####

i spent 100 euros on this garbage what a fool i am

#####

a disgrace

an insult

a crime against humanity

an act of terrorism

the worst videogame of all time


#####

fuqing trash game kobe does not deserve this if youre gonna put kobe as a selling point update the game to next gen


#####

dont buy this just continue playing 23

#####

i stopped playing the game with the release of 2k22 i wanted to give 2k another chance after 2 years and once again i was disappointed the gameplay and animations are the same as in the previous versions once again theres only the currentgen version available for pc which i dont understand the main menu and the textures of the park still look very cheap as always what annoys me the most is the abundance of cheaters in the park since day one

purchase recommendation definitely no

#####

same game as 2k23 which is the same as 2k22 which is the same as 2k21 4 straight year since next gen has been out and pc still hasnt been given it absolutely pathetic

chat gpt said it best fr

nba 2k24 the latest installment in the popular basketball video game franchise has generated significant discontent within the gaming community despite the franchises history of delivering immersive and engaging basketball simulations 2k24 has faced substantial criticism from players who feel that the game falls short of expectations this essay aims to explore the reasons behind the communitys dissatisfaction drawing upon factual evidence and feedback from players

microtransactions and virtual currency vc exploitation
one of the primary grievances within the nba 2k24 community revolves around the pervasive presence of microtransactions and the exploitation of virtual currency players argue that the game heavily favors those willing to spend real money on vc creating an uneven playing field this financial model not only impacts the overall gaming experience but also raises ethical concerns about the fairness of competition

unresponsive gameplay and glitches
complaints about the gameplay mechanics in nba 2k24 are abundant with players expressing frustration over unresponsive controls inconsistent player animations and a plethora of glitches these issues undermine the realism and fluidity that the franchise is known for contributing to a sense of dissatisfaction among the player base

unbalanced player ratings and attributes
the community has raised concerns about the imbalanced player ratings and attributes in nba 2k24 many players argue that certain characters are either overpowered or underpowered disrupting the games balance and making it difficult for users to enjoy a fair and competitive experience

lack of meaningful innovation
while players expect each new installment to bring innovative features and improvements nba 2k24 has been criticized for its lack of meaningful innovation the game appears to recycle many elements from its predecessors leaving players yearning for fresh and exciting additions that would enhance the overall gaming experience

disconnect between developers and community
some members of the nba 2k24 community argue that there is a notable disconnect between the game developers and the player base they feel that the developers are not adequately addressing the communitys concerns or implementing feedback leading to a sense of frustration and alienation

conclusion

in conclusion nba 2k24 has faced substantial criticism from its community and the reasons behind this discontent are rooted in tangible issues such as microtransactions gameplay glitches unbalanced player attributes a lack of innovation and a perceived disconnect between developers and players while the franchise has a history of delivering highquality basketball simulations the shortcomings of 2k24 have left many fans disappointed and eager for improvements in future releases as the gaming industry evolves it is essential for developers to actively engage with their communities listen to feedback and strive for continuous improvement to ensure the longevity and success of their franchises

#####

look i like the 2k games i grew up playing them and at the end of the day fundamentally are fine but tell me why pc is shafted to current gen when we can run games like starfield elden ring probably millions more that we can run at 4k and 60fps

i think its absolutely disgraceful that you are charging consumers 100 for a game that had no effort put into and was a copy and paste from last year with the amount of changes they have been adding between games they could release a new 2k every week

heed my warning and do not buy this version if you have a next gen version then youre better off buying it on there this is disgraceful and embarrassing on behalf of the team who thought releasing this on pc was good

#####

terrible i was really hoping that all the reviews i saw for the game were overexaggerating but no theyre completely valid the goatsystem that you see on youtube is only for the console version since next gen hasnt yet been added to the pc version the city that you see on youtube wasnt in my game so i assume its also exclusive to the console version

i literally bought the game on a big sale when it was only 27 euros thinking itd be worth it but it didnt even come close its a joke that the difference between the pc version and the console version is so large 

dont buy this game not even when theres a 50 sale on it at minimum it needs to be 80

#####

stay away from this game mycareer doesnt have a storyline and pc still have no next gen

#####

no story for mycareer
2k23 next gen builder transferred to 2k24 old gen
limitless takeoff still in the game

bruh

#####

when you thought this money grubbing company wouldnt get any worse it just does after spending 60 on the game 45 on my build and almost 80 hours of my life grinding away to compete with the plethora of cheaters that plague this game the best i can to then only be wrongfully banned and receive no assistance from the support team last 2k im every buying company is a joke game is a carbon copy of the same thing every year not worth what it takes to enjoy the game

#####

still reported

#####

ass

#####

no era mode


#####

this game is trash why cant pc support next gen doesnt make any since  do better

#####

lifeless soulless garbage 

last years release was at least somewhat enjoyable especially in terms of gameplay but 2k24 legitimately feels like a downgrade on every aspect 
less features plays like trash looks like trash endless poorly planned and unnavigable menus inundated with marketing content whether it is proper ads or trash 2ktv content 
its almost like youre not supposed to play the game and just stay in the menus or the broken neighbourhood 

and thats without even mentioning that nextgen versions of the game exist for consoles with more features and better presentations 2k sports could release the laziest shoddiest port of that version and it would be a better experience 

just an irredeemable ad and microtransaction infected slideshow disguised as an almost unenjoyable 150gb  basketball game 

thank goodness i didnt pay full price for this absolute dumpster fire

#####

this game is horrible and will always be horrible because they will always give us old gen due to laziness and lack of giving a sht would love a refund

#####

dont buy just refunded mine

#####

stop the laziness bring next gen to pc

#####

complete garbage do not buy if i knew i had to be under these stupid rules to get a refund i wouldnt try to spend 3 hours trying to find something good in the game now im stuck with this piece of trash in my library

#####

my first review ever and just because i cant describe how disappointed i am in this game do not buy 

why do you even see stuff in game on 2ktv that you dont have in pc version of the game false advertisment and selling product that is different from what they are showing and message to mike wang and all others from 2k please have the ba and say in every episode available only on next gen consoles and you pc fools give us your money yes i admit i am a fool that i bought this s but this is the last time

this game is just robbery at full price

#####

they dont care about their community whatsoever besides taking all your money to even play the game you have to spend an arm and a leg if you want to play online cosmetics are way overpriced and your actual myplayer build costs about another 60 to even use him to enjoy the game then when you get online you have to deal with cheaters everyday literally the game has no anti cheat system then you also have to deal with the game constantly crashing as well the list of issues with this game are unlimited worst game in history ever made

game crashing simulator

#####

everyone knows 2k puts forth the tiniest bit of effort in making these games because thats all they got to do

#####

if you still have nba 2k23 do not purchase this not worth it

#####

why tf can i not sim to next appearance bruh i cant even play my career the games gotten worse hackers every court you go to

#####

this game crashes more than my blind grandma tryin to drive to the grocery store

#####

yet again 2k neglects pc version any pc nowadays can run what next gen consoles have and more

#####

did you want to play myeras mode  too bad for you not on pc

#####

this game is full of cheaters people download full on hacks and change every stat to 99 and make is virtually impossible to beat them this has been an issue for years and 2k refuses to add an anti cheat on steam 2k this is also the current gen experince and not the next gen experince why is pc not next gen when most peoples pcs are just as powerful as a next gen console if not more powerful overall id give the game maybe a 310 was really looking forward to playing 2k but the cheaters ruined it

#####

myteam devs are out of touch and it feels like they hate the community  the game crashes more than any other triple a game ive ever played  for some reason this is the old gen version of the game instead of the next gen version when there is no reason for it to be old gen  servers suck but thats the norm for 2k  nobody plays this awful game so it takes a while to find an online game  theres nothing to good grind in offline or online unless you want to play 40 hrswk  this is the worst 2k and it isnt even close  this game is far worse than even 2k18

#####

literally copy paste of 2k23 i dont understand why pc cant get the next gen version of the game dont buy it

#####

started reading all the things missing from the pc version and now feel like an idiot for buying this thank you 2k

#####

please like my review because i have a small pen1s

#####

this game is the worst nba 2k game ever created for the pc its not working and have a lot of bugs and crashes and more problems
2k company this is the second time you disrespect your customers that pays you a good money for your products
and you give a them in return a defective product wwe2k20 nba 2k24

#####

this is the worst game i have ever played on pc

#####

this game is pretty some fucking shit they still dont give pc player the new gen game shi they wont even give them voice chat and yet the pc 2k communtiy still buy this weak ass game i genuinely hope this gaming company burns to the fucking ground and its trash ass devs along with it fuck you ronald fuck you mike wang and fuck you to any nigga who took part in creating this piece of shit ass game

#####

this game is garbage

#####

i knew it was bad and i was still disappointed

#####

this game is not cross play in the modes most people play i purchased the game then soon after i noticed that i couldnt play with my xbox friends i asked steam to refund my money as the game is no use to me steam refused to give me my refund because i played six hours when i didnt my pc does not download games when its shut off so during the download while i was asleep the game played in demo mode all around bad experience from 2k and steam

#####

as a 2k player who love the game of basketball this game is trash in pc community
one simple reason the game is full of hackers litarily full of them
i would say that 70 of pc community are hackersplayers who use outside tools who gives huge advantage
this year hackers are overpower than ever before
for the legit players who are between us i would say and recommand  keep stick to your legit way and do your best in order to w the hackers

in additiion 2k support are kind of funny they are never support and give solutions for bugs in their own game

this might actually be one of the worst nba 2k games ive played 

pros
  kobe is on the cover 

cons
  didnt get the 100k vc mamba edition a fix online says to restart the game and if that dont work uninstall the game and reinstall exactly what i wanna do reinstall a 120 gb game

update after deleting and reinstalling all mamba edition items showed up including the 100k vc but still an inconvenience
 
  the park what the hell happened here who thought it would be a good idea to make a directory and have more loading times it really defeats the purpose and takes away from buying a bike andor skateboard 2k should have really stuck with a more open world concept   
  no story line for mycareer
  the amount of forced shots teammates do in the 3v3 vr is ridiculous along with the amount of shots taken with players back to the basket
  there is also one shot i have yet to see miss but what happens is when a player is driving to the basket and another player goes underneath in front the player with the ball brings the ball down below their waist and then brings is back up for a little layin i see it happen a lot in the vr 3v3 simulation games at my court and it hasnt missed yet
  created a 67sf with a 66 wingspan and because mp is a 60 overall i get out rebounded by steve nash somethings just dont make sense because your overall is so low no matter how many good shot contests you have you wont ever stop the offense
  movement is clunky i play better defense walking around than i do in a defensive stance 
  passing delays happen from time to time with teammates and mp i passed the ball when the player was open but mp didnt pass the ball until after my teammate took 5 more steps which then my pass got stolen mp called for a pass cutting wide open to the basket but the teammate didnt pass the ball until the defender caught up to me which then forced me to take a bad shot near the hoop 
  pg was dribbling down court ball on outside hand mp was running along side of him and i hit the steal button mp stopped and swatted at where the ball was as the pg continued dribbling down court it shouldnt take an 80 overall in stealing to know a player is not going to stop and swat at the ball when they would simply try to poke or hit it away 

conclusion
  it feels like 2k put all their resources in one basket when they took a year off to fix their wwe game and that ended up compromising their nba 2k game the game itself just does not play feel and look like an nba 2k game
 
  do yourself a favor and dont waste your money on this game

#####

i mean its 2k so every year you buy it just make sure you have your clown paint handy to paint your face with when nothing improves from last year

#####

sad story on pc this game
