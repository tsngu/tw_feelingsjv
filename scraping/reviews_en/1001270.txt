kebab

u can make yourself fat and balding with a bushy beard but sadly there are no socks and sandals option 710

#####

in turkeys land where kebabs reign
a culinary circus a savory campaign
skewers spin a culinary act
kebab laughter thats a fact

on the grill meat takes the stage
marinated heroes in flavor engage
pita twirls like a turkish dance
in this kebab fiesta give taste a chance

tomatoes roll onions jest
a veggie party a tasty fest
garlic sauce a comedians quip
yogurt cools with a creamy flip

in istanbuls streets a kebab parade
laughter echoes in the spice cascade
so grab a skewer join the fun
in turkeys kebab land humors never done

#####

nothing better than cooking with the boys all night long

#####

iwelcome to kebabylon  a high pressure blackjack simulator disguised as a relaxing restaurant simulatori

h1 main pros cons and suggestionsh1 
 
 pros 

 4 player coop
 staff to help out in single player
 furnish your home and restaurant
 assman license plate reference to seinfeld
 drawers fridges and other storage options are interactable and not just for show

 cons

 esc doesnt pause the game
 inverted mouse setting is on by default and turns back on each boot

 suggestions 

 option for grid snap in build mode
 autosave when you place a bet in blackjack to avoid unlimited gold
 update unit windows at night time one was letting through sunlight and three others showed nothing but stars inc on the ground

h1i called my restaurant kebabylonh1

i woke up in an empty house spoke to my supposed father and became a restaurant owner at no cost  something smelt fishy regardless i cleaned the restaurant bought some stock and begin business with only had 8 customers barely making a profit i pondered  why i was given this free real estate

it must be a front i thought and how right i was after work i noticed the bar nothing more than a few drinks a dart board and finally a blackjack table this is what it was all about  the restaurant was a sham serving as a money laundering outlet for the real money maker  the blackjack table

the cooking was engaging with plenty of recipes to keep me busy managing the restaurant was as fun as it was fast paced and overall the game was enjoyable realising i could save my game before betting my life savings i quickly became a millionaire overnight  the blackjack table was the real game i highly recommend this especially for a group  i had fun solo and i can only imagine how much more id have with my friends and i all yelling at each other

#####

hello kebab lovers

then you are here very right on place this is your own restaurant where you manage your beloved kebab

i really enjoy playing this game with my lovely friend urlhttpssteamcommunitycomidflexus711 obu url she is da best chefchen 

so if you like and enjoy playing simulators you should definitely get this game

i really hope that it will get more content 

but so far i am loving this game

i give this game a 9510






get goo goo alu


#####

the best game for kebab lovers

#####

great game good content and actually fun to play

#####

as it stands im unable to endorse this game its riddled with bugs desynchronization problems and incomplete content nearly every aspect of the game suffers from synchronization issues when playing multiplayer while im intrigued by the concept of the game its crucial for the developers to prioritize fixing these issues before introducing new content

im hopeful that the developers will dedicate the necessary time to rectify these issues and i would be more than willing to revise my review once the game reaches a more stable and enjoyable state

#####

this gets a thumb up for the innovation and idea of the game right now there are 
alot of bugs unfortunately i hope the developers continue to work on it

#####

playing on 4k with the newest hardware but the gpu runs very hot for such a small game hotter than rdr2 or even alan wake 2

#####

it is really fun havent had a chance to play coop yet but the single player experience so far was really smooth it actually surprised me cause im used to seeing all these simulation ea games having terrible bugs especially at release
game loop is designed well it allows you to customize your menu which sort of acts like a dynamic difficultyreward system that is under your control food prep flow is definitely improved and is much more user friendly compared to the demo ive played a couple months ago they kept the fun parts without making it too easy having an option for the restaurant to be a selfservice one is also a great idea especially for singleplayer
there are still a lot of things to improve upon though such as having to carry even the empty plates one by one was a litlle annoying and i can see it becoming a problem when the restaurant gets largeit can be easily fixed though with having employees for example
apart from some very small bugslocalization and some funny physics stuff i havent encountered any bugs
i can see this becoming a very fun coop game similar to overcooked but much more in depth

#####

kebab 1010

#####

even though there is a few bugs here and there but the developers seem to be working on it everyday the game is very enjoyable especially coop i highly recommend if you like cooking games and just chilling also very addicting which just says a lot about the game itself

#####

was banned from their discord for stating the bugs i had encountered do not give this thieves money

#####

at the current state i cannot recommend the game it is filled with bugs desyncs and unfinished content almost all features in this game have synchronization issues in multiplayer i really enjoy the idea of the game but i really hope the devs take their time to fix the game before adding new content

ill gladly update the review once it is in a more playable state

#####

1 for example when i put the roast chicken on the dish counter i always get 100 96 100 never otherwise that is logically not possible so fix the  and the same goes with the strawberry cake and other meals that i always get the same numbers even when i cook it longer or shorter
2 firstly when people take their meal they start walking in 1 place and then they teleport to the table secondly they get blocked by the waiters and nothing happens they wont move or anything which is weird bc they could just go around them yk
4 random mistakes in the meals for example spicy flour butter or other how can that be spicy and especially when its a dessert or missing ingredients when you literally put everything just as it said
5  the price  when there is something on sale and it says 0 you still pay for it or even if it is over 0 you still pay different amount of money 
6 when people come to the restaurant and the fod that they want isnt ready and you put it on the dish counter afterwards they dont take it their patience runs out and they leave even when you already put the meal there
7 when you put the tablet away the yellow arrow stays in the middle of your screen no you cannot fix it by opening the tablet again 
8 sometimes when you put a mixture in the fridge you cannot use it again the next day even tho it was in the fridge 
overall i really love the game bc i love cooking games but these bugs are annoying 

#####

purchased this as a cooking simulator fan and love the fact its online coop after 5 hours of game play i can honestly say this is a fantastic early access coop cooking game love the customization and recipes very stable and didnt get kickedlost connection like other early access games ive played there are a few bugs such as daynight cycles and displaying different information for different players such as  cooked etc however thats to be expected but overall it has a very good foundation and has massive potential
i hope to see a freshness mechanic in the future along with more cooking equipment  very enjoyable play with friends online 


#####

i love the black jack simulator nice to have they added a cooking part too

#####

the right way to remove kebabs

#####

kebab 1010

#####

for singleplayer it might be a bit slow paced boredom at some points and clearly not designed for
but if you play coop with friends this is definitely a game to play oone do the cooking one do the waiter and bully that guy who is assigned to do the dishes 
there has definitely some minor issues but nothing gamebreaking so far

#####

there are a lot of bugs but nothing that changes the games  hope that someone fix everything someday
i like and i recommend it

#####

very fun although there are bugs but it is expected since this is on early access 

notable bugs
sometimes plates gets stuck and floats midair and you cant get them again
desynchronization issues sometimes what i see is different from what the other players see
ai staff are stupid theyd sometimes block stations you need they also get stuck with each other they also go through walls tables and chairs
sometimes plates also gets stuck on the sink im not sure if its just visual bug and the only way to get rid of them is by storing the sink into your inventory or by selling and replacing it outright

despite the mentioned bugs above the game is playable still and id recommend it brilliant game

#####

very good game concept and gameplay having lots of fun playing with my friends however there are too many bugs not recommend until the devs team solves them real soon

#####

this is a very fun restaurant simulator

some features i like about the game

the butcher market and grocery are open 247

you can go to the beer pub to get drunk and play mini games currently the mini games are black jack and darts

there is no time limit to open your restaurant you can take all the time you need to prep and organize


#####

there is still a lot of bugs but overall its a good game and it allows people to know the dangers of gambling we lost 10k within a night 

#####

i love kebab

#####

very fun great for couples 

#####

my score 810

0bad

fun 22 designing your own restaurant preparing suitable menus for customers and doing all this work with your friends is really fun
content 22 the food menu is very rich additionally there are many material options for decoration as your level increases you can own different restaurants you can also show your skills against expert chefs
story 12 the story depends entirely on your imagination you can pretend to be a chef in your own restaurant and manage things the way you want
graphic 12 it has vibrant colors and sweet graphics there are a few details that need to be fixed but they can be completed over time
gameplay 22 this game has a really detailed preview it has also fluent and easy gameplay recipes day flows character movements and food preparation are very easy and fast

#####

 too much bugs

#####

wife had a secret bakery in the bathroom

#####

i got severly gambling addicted

#####

this game is literally what i was hoping for not too much weird detail like cooking simulator and a way more fun approach than chefs life and coop

already put so many hours into this game even though its still in ea but already so worth it and i cant wait for more updates and the full release

#####

this game is in early access and is already pretty good ofc there are some annoying or weird bugs and glitches but its good and fun i can recommend that one if u want to have a funny and half way realistic resturant experience its rlly fun with friends but also fun without friends for the ppl without any friends

pros
many recipes 
good cooking mechanics
many customizable things in the restaurant
black jack
graphic

cons
you earn a bit to fast and easy money i was at day 20 at 130k
bit buggy and glitchy some times
no real kebab u know like the döner that is served in bread 
no kebab razor or cutter idk what this shi is called

ovr all 7510 would recommend its really worth its money

#####

  910

a ridiculously fun game especially with friends the game continues to keep us hooked with different gourmet chefs to cook for a levelling system and dishes that unlock over time the only minor flaw is that it has some little bugs but nothing gamebreaking and definitely to be expected with it being in early access buy it

#####

kebab

#####

shittons of bugs but even more fun ːsteamhappyː

#####

too lag

#####

surprisingly good game one of the best restaurant simulators with seamless multiplayer  coop support

#####

the best game for kebab lovers

#####

its sooo fun with friends regard less to the bugs

#####

this game is the definition of a kitchen nightmare its the best game for those who have a partner and probably one of the best games to test your limits on not getting mad at your partner

#####

kebab

#####

great and fun game with lot of potential hope developers keep working on it for a long time and make it even better game luv it 3

#####

sadly this is another unfinished early access simulator game that barely has any content to offer the game has potential but at the moment it is definitely not offering enough content for its price tag to be justified

#####

blackjack skem 

#####

there are quite a few noticeable bugs that need to be fixed but the game is very fun especially with friends

#####

1000000000000000000000000010

#####

what a great leisure game

#####

1st person plate up on steroids great fun with friends super worth the price tag

#####

my greek friend unfriended me when he saw me playing this game however this game is sooooo fun i had a lot of fun playing it with my partner 

#####

best game ever

#####

fun

#####

i aint got no friends to it with me so its boring after some time         

#####

superb and fun game including coop i would definitely recommend this game the road map looks good on what they are adding too

the only downsides are you dont actually serve customers food but take it to a central station and 1 plate of food serves 4 people its not even like you make a platter of food its 1 steak 2 pieces of parsley and 1 chopped tomato if they allow table serving and 1 meal  1 customer this would be the game of the year

in the realm of digital gastronomy a new titan has emerged captivating the hearts minds and taste buds of an eager audience kebab chefs  restaurant simulator has sliced its way through the mundane and established itself as the heart and soul of culinary creativity and communal joy this game is not merely a simulator its a vibrant journey into the heart of culinary passion wrapped in the warm inviting aroma of kebabs

but kebab chefs is more than just cooking its about building a legacy the game cleverly incorporates elements of strategy and teamwork encouraging players to think critically about their culinary choices and how they affect their burgeoning empire the feedback system which critiques dishes based on seasoning timing and more adds a layer of realism thats both challenging and rewarding

the games developers deserve a standing ovation their commitment to the community is evident in the constant stream of updates and new content keeping the game fresh and the players perpetually engaged its a testament to their dedication and a big reason why the game has already amassed a loyal following in germany poised on the cusp of international acclaim

lost all my money gambling and selling the store wasnt enough please add a way to sell body parts if broke if i had just a bit more money im sure i would have won a fortune i was just 32 hands away from being the next elon musk 

when gambling you can win 2000 of your money but you can lose 100 do the math

#####

bockt

#####

really fun and good concept gameplay is really fun
looking forward to updates and more content
worth the price and very fun with friends

#####

game would be nice but multiplayer has lot of bugs for me the main problem is that contents of bowls are not synced correctly every player see different ingredients in bowl for one player bowl can be empty for other there might be somethng in it popup when you place food in food servin table interrupts work for others

#####

kebab chefs the restaurant simulator is a rollercoaster of emotions lets address the elephant in the room its buggy like hotfixes every day kind of buggy the games rough edges can test your patience no doubt but heres the kicker its ridiculously fun im talking about the kind of fun that keeps you glued to your seat laughing hysterically with your friends

ive sunk a solid 42 hours into this game and not once have i played solo thats because the real magic happens when youre in the kitchen chaos with your buddies sure weve encountered glitches but theyve become part of the experiencea shared frustration that somehow adds to the charm

one of the games highlights is the gourmet chefs feature it gives you something to strive for eagerly anticipating the arrival of each new culinary master and let me tell you its not just about kebabs the variety of dishes you can whip up is staggering from savory to sweet personally ive become a baking aficionado churning out pastries like theres no tomorrow and guess what my customers eat it up literally

in the heat of the kitchen my friends and i argue like true chefs gordon ramsay would be proud of us whether its debating the perfect seasoning or strategizing the most efficient cooking methods were constantly immersed in culinary chaosand loving every minute of it these arguments may add to the chaos but they also enhance the camaraderie making every play session feel like a highstakes culinary showdown

so is kebab chefs a pain in the ass absolutely but is it worth pushing through the glitches without a doubt behind its rough exterior lies a brilliantly executed ideaa testament to the developers vision and the sheer fun factor of the game if youre willing to embrace the chaos and persevere youll find a gaming experience thats as satisfying as it is entertaining

one side note this developer cares about their game constantly pushing updates answering people on the bug forums in their discord this developer really has a bright future

#####

its like being able to to play that cooking simulator game but with friends 1010 much more indepth than i thought it would be

#####

reasons to play
 fun with friends
 cooking like cooking simulator at time but without that pricey tag
 getting wasted in the pub after work with friends
 darts while drunk is a whole new game
 visit the pub before work and drink while you work

things that need attention
 moving to bigger restaurant breaks a lot of things
 hired help seem hopeless and lost at times
 character creation items dont fit the body well
 ai walking around have no random patterns they just do a loop
 minor issues most are in the discord already waiting to be resolved

#####

yep id recommend this game 100 already having a lot of fun and i just started d



#####

the screen when i started the game was satisfying well designed and with a simple interface the tutorial at the beginning is more than enough the gameplay has quality graphics and optimized animation you have more fun playing the game with your friends dont forget to play with your friends and become a real chef 

#####

the game is very promising theres a lot to do gourmet challenges seem to add a lot of color to the gameplay the skills section was something i didnt expect and i like it so much good work 

#####

needs sex but still good game

#####

brrrrrrr skibidi dop dop dop yes yes yes yes i think this is a good game

#####

1110 almost sell my restaurant for blackjack

#####

cooking

#####

great game but theres a few bugs in the game 
sometimes my food gets rated 00 even tho its almost perfectly cooked
i once got stuck in the blackjack seats and couldnt get out and wasnt able to move
and it took out a 5000 loan out of the bank and i didnt press anything
and could you please fix the blackjack whenever theres a tie you loose you should get your money back if its a tie

tho the game is very fun especially with friends i do recommend the game
you always have something to do so it doesnt get boring and theres alot of diffenrent recipes and the cooking is fun as well as the building mode

my friend with a high end computer has a few fps drops once in a while but me in the other hand with a pretty average gaming laptop can play the game smoothly

#####

too many game breaking bugs even for early access for me to recommend at this price  it is a fun game has great potential and im excited to see where it goes and may update this in the future but its still a beta version game with an early access price  lol the tutorial is even broken ffs

#####

funny game  i like it  there are some minor bugs but thats okay for a ea  buy if you want to be a kebap champion d


#####

gute kebab

#####

naked man with shoes making food

#####

#####

#####

very good game i like it and its so fun that its multiplayer

#####

yes kebab yes

#####

bugs everywhere after the update

#####

i love this game and it saddens me to write this review its one of the best restaurant games ive played 
but do not buy this game right now i bought it and wasnt able to play it on start i waited for days and was finally able to get it to work by trying different things recommended by people in the same boat and then the next day after the newest patchupdates im now again not able to play due to game breaking bugs cant delete objects cant buy ingredients from store i would love to change this review back to positive but i cannot in good faith recommend anyone to spend their money on an at least for me unplayable game

#####

best co op game ive played yet find the right friends and youve got yourself a banger


#####

ich habe mein ganzes geld beim blackjack verloren ich dachte ich wäre hier um zu kochen

müsst ihr wissen

#####

this is by far the funniest game i have been playing recently we have been roleplaying two  kebab chefs with gambling issues and spent a lot of time at the pub at night 

i would just like to draw your attention on one slight detail that could be improved the dealer at the blackjack table is cheating af

she is stealing all of our money so badly that we cant buy chicken breast for our clients we even have been forced to fire our employees to keep up with her nasty cheating habits please help us

#####

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay kwosaunt pls

#####

fun game especially with friends

#####

fun coop game at a good price for the amount of content partner and i had no issues with the multiplayer definitely recommend

#####

ive been playing the game since the beta version and it has improved significantly definitely worth your time the addition of the coop mode enhances the experience even more lets team up and make kebabs great again together

#####

does this game has food warmer or is it possible you can add one in the future updates thanks

#####

very good content features
multiplayer has a few syncing issues
game is 100 early access treat it as such there will be bugs placeholders etc

other than that a very fun and enjoyable game for managing cooking and running a shop in town the progression system is also really nice and doesnt feel like a major grind

#####

döner kebab beste preis beste preis 1000 eoro


#####

i go to the pub to drink my sorrows away while my friend became addicted to gambling and almost lost all of our money after a hard days work at the restaurant 1010 game

#####

multiplayer not working my friends have refunded i understand its early access but it crashes on loading screen you literally cant play this game multiplayer atm and has been the case for weeks no clarity from devs on this matter despite multiple posts in forum

#####

game is absolutely fun and has lots of potential but multiplayer doesnt really work we played as three and ruined the experience for us so for now we will wait till its out of early access

#####

#####

i dont know why but after playing for an hour i feel like i wanna get hung like a kebab

#####

when doner box 

#####



#####

best with friend d
but unfortunately too many bugs 

#####

veri kebab

#####

great game for the first hours because bugs dont matter too much at a certain point tho they take away the fun because theres too much of them in micromanaging the restaurant
hoping to continue the game in the near future

sidenote the dealer is rigged 

#####

i really wanted to give this game a positive review because it is so much fun but as it is now is too buggy and unplayable i unlocked the second gourmet chef went to place the oven down and my game froze i had to ctrl alt delete and force close so i lost all my days progress there is no save option and no autosave so if anything happens during your game you will lose all your progress for a day its happened a few times and it makes me lose motivation to continue playing

#####

this game is terrible not just because of the bugs

 it is an idle game and the trailer is completely deceiving you make a dish and put it out the npc take the same dish over and over again until the dish is just a dirty plate had it been a buffet game this would have made sense even then youd need a buffet table with different textures to show the certain items slowly going down not sure how the devs thought this was acceptable even one arm chef is better and it is a f2p game 

blackjack table is a joke i am talking about the camera that it puts you in the betting slider when it wouldnt be to hard to add chips to select amount also the dev doesnt even know the rules of blackjack

drinking is just a meter that goes down while holding your drink you dont even bring it up to your mouth people tagged this with physics this game doesnt use physics at all it is more of a grid 

character customisation is god awful make certain parts of your body too big and it just clips through the clothes it even does this with your beard 

and the final nail in the coffin is how fast the days go by what a slog of prepping one of each meal to sit there while the game idles for 10 minutes all you do is collect money off the table no till grab the plate one at a time put them in the sink do a an animation to wash put each plat back one at a time go to sleep wake up and prep one of each dish collect dishes clean them clean floors maybe if i hire employees i wont be doing nothing at all 

this game is made by corner cutters for people with no standards its a cash grab low effort game that will never be good what a slog

#####

if you want to be irritated ash at ur co chef this is the game for you

#####

when in debt

 play blackjack 
 bet a small amount
 win a round
 obtain confidence 
 bet your entire balance 
 lose 
 cry yourself to sleep 
 alt f4 

pretty good game ngl

#####

it didnt seem very fun

#####

so overrated tf

#####

this game is a little rough around the edges but is genuinely fun it feels like the developers genuinely put some love and care into being able to make some kabobs with the boys there are a few translation errors here and there but most of them are just kind of funny
i am writing the morning after release the devs have released 5 hotfixes since if you are concerned that this is an asset flip that wont be supported i think you will be surprised

#####

played blackjack had a 14 vs dealer 6 i stayed dealer got to 26 game said i lost my 13k bet idk why cooking is fun but this game breaking glitch needs to be fixed lost me all my money including the 5k loan i took from the bank 

that all being said buy this game

#####

not that its a bad game its just not my type of game

#####

dirty shite game keeeps crashing 

#####

i recommend this game as its really thought out and fun especially with friends

however the glitches bugs and problems make it literally unplayable currently a huge amount of work is required to get this playworthy so unless you want to restart the whole game every few minutes to even have a chance at a normal playthrough then id hold off buying

i will be changing my thumb down to a thumb up when these problems are resolved and i look forward to it

#####

nice game but still have some bug or lag i cant host back the game if i dont verify game i dont know why

#####

i really want to give a positive review but i just cant
besides the little bugs in game the biggest issue ive experienced is it crashed with amd adrenaline if a game just crash so easily no matter how funny it is it still an awful experience

#####

multiplayer doesnt work both my friend and i tried for hours  when asking for help in their discord they ignored the topic for over 24 hours  thankfully i got a refund  will never buy from them again

#####

this game made me and my boyfriend almost break up he is useless and he doesnt wanna wash dishes bcs he calls me the dishwasher neither will he do anything else only grill meat

game overall good my bf not

#####

i cant even get past the tutorial this game is unplayable things go missing stuff doesnt work this is a scam

#####

i like the buy tomato

#####

has bugs all over the place in its current state there are multiple games on roblox that has a better feature set and more interesting progression

however it can be fun with friends and the mechanic for making dishes is good but in its current state its more of a tech demo blackjack simulator with broken rules than a game

cant playing save on other pc just playing local pc this game   what a waste my money 

#####

oyunda kumar bozuk sunu duzeltin surekli para kaybediyoprum

#####

upsetting says online coop and even shows the multi player in the game but does not allow anyone to join bought two copies to play with my wife and cant so the multiplayer does not work at all they should just say that

#####

the plaque of early access strikes again the game feels very bare at the moment and playing feels lackluster i might change the review after some content additions

the problem here is as always its limiting gameplay loop including but not limited to amount of dishes variety of clients kitchen utensils recipe assortment and preparation steps 

its a fun concept but like many other simulators  this one severely lacks the diversification of products and services offered to both the customers npc and players alike the fine threat to dangle upon is to make it easy and fast for challenging gameplay but with a usp or to make it just complex and diverse enough for authentic gameplay while still being fun this game tries to be challenging and fastpaced and bring complex recipes to the table but both do not mix well it feels so incredibly slowpaced for a cooking arcade game and on the other side absolutely barren for an authentic cooking sim

hard pass atm

#####

loading and then freeze please fix it

#####

after the new update this game was filled with so many bugs some gamebreaking same just visual bug i dont think they have a tester or qa yet

#####

i believe this game has high potential but im giving it thumbs down as of now since im unable to play at all unless im windowed to a small resolution

cons
no 329 widescreen support making game unplayable
many bugs with placement and interaction wise
lack of quality of life features in some parts

pros
very entertaining gameplay especially if you play with friends
detailed cooking and ingredients

#####

the amnout of fucking bugs in this game is unbelievable and they are not the funny kind of bugs no they are the game breaking type of bugs i experienced at least 20 bugs in the first 3 hours of playing this game i payed 271 for this shit i convinced my friends to pay for the rest of it dont buy this game at full price its not worth it

#####

its bad game best thing is blackjack

#####

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkz7wkzr9xjm

#####

i love this casino simulator the disadvantage is there are not plenty of gambling games at the moment however you can do some cooking stuff nearby when you are tired i do belive we need to give some patience to developers and the casino will be filled with more and more fun stuffs

#####

bet all my hard earned money on blackjack then tied with the dealer she counted that as a lose mf robed me aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

#####

this game feels so unique and fun to play in the feature i want to see more different dishes from all over the world and more customisable restaurant features great game

#####

does not support ultra wide screen resolutions the bottom part of the menuscreen doesnt appear so couldnt even save my character refunded

#####

fire your blackjack employee she doesnt know shit about blackjack rules she gets an 18 while i have 18 too and she wins wtf gimme my money back i cant feed my cat

#####

while i found your game satisfactory with its cooking simulator like game play and the option for 4 player coop could really add some additional enjoyment the attitudes your company takes to people like me in its developer discord chat including moderators makes it difficult for me to put my name or channel behind any sort of publicity for kebab chefs

#####

utter shit actually unfun boring and just plain bad
dont purchase dont even play this if you got it for free

#####

ye

#####

awesome just a little glitchy

#####

best cooking game for multiplayer out on the market endless content and movementplacement of items is very smooth and satisfying

#####

awesome game

#####

the game has a lot of potential but it tends to glitchfreeze in multiplayer as of right now cant wait for updates

#####

poor positioning for some objects the old tv cant be placed on anywhere without colliding with nearly every single object in the game that also goes for most objects that seem normal on the inside that just stick out of the building 

within the 5 minutes of the game weve seen few game breaking bugs that made us restart the whole game turning off the tutorial entirely when youre in the tutorial and placing a building if your buddy happens to move the tutorial the object you are holding disappears for you and you cant interact with it thus making the whole tutorial get stuck in my part where the father doesnt leave the restaurant 

now these are the tip of the things that ive mentioned this game is still in early access so i guess id love to see it improve other than that id say just wait

#####

very fun restaurant simulator i love the feeling of unlocking recipes from experience and bosses and the style of cooking is very engaging and fun

#####

exceptional game that was a lot of fun cant wait to see what the future holds for it 3

#####

its a little buggy especially with the waiters some recipes tend to get a little glitchy too but definitely recommend the game overall super fun coop game where you can cook together and design your restaurant and apartment looking forward to seeing what will be added in the future

#####

good

blackjack 247 1010

#####

too many bugs at the moment when play in coop mode i came back to the saved game everything in the kitchen went crazy and i lost stuffs

#####

loving this game i can def see the potential for more to come and finally an indepth kitchen game with friends that isnt just overcook chaos

#####

fun game to play with friends

#####

played for 4 hours straight now i am sat sad and depressed at 3am with a grumbling stomach

#####

great game

#####

please fix the crashes
i love this game so much it has so much fun playing with friends even playing by myself however it crashes frequently
i am using rtx4090i919200kfz690h with win 11 system it crashes pretty frequently ingame and i had to start over from that day

#####

fun

#####

its good devs update consistently just buy it

#####

still a bit buggy but for early release i truly enjoy it

#####

fajna gra polecam

#####

while it still has its fair share of bugs and rough edges kebab chefs already proves to be much fun especially in a group of up to four players which is an awesome feature to ship so early in development btw

a few words of advice especially for multiplayer april 2024
 only the host should skip to the next day otherwise you might softlock yourself and lose one or two days of progress
 you can move the fridges with their contents inside them same cant be said for the shelves and kitchenettes
 some items and foods cant get heavily out of sync when more than one player work on them at the same time to many cooks quite literally spoil the broth

#####

never let bro cook again

#####

good game to play with friends 

#####

great game single player or with friends you can customise your restaurant and serve a large variety of meals hire staff and become a millionaire there is also a pub you can gamble all your money at too if you should choose still a couple bugs but over all a great game

#####

great game

#####

yes

#####

gamba  running a restaurant  bunnies 1010

#####

stuck in gamba table game sucks

#####

a fun game

#####



#####

at first i thought playing this game would be hard but i got the hang of it once i know what to do such a fun game playing with my hubby and we enjoyed gambling our earnings away and unable to pay our staff

#####

very fun in coop

#####



#####

hahahahahahaahahaha im going crazyyyyyyy ahhahahahahah

#####

i played this game for 8 hours straight and 6 hours were gambling now i have 3m coins yippie

#####

really enjoy this game hope more update for this game

#####

here we have a game that is super fun i enjoyed it we laughed with my friend a lot 
but be aware  there is lack of polish and few bugs that need to be fixed its early access 
i hope developers will work on that and they will release a full game without bugs and they will add some content and achievements 

#####

multiplayer is funny we are waiting the new update

#####

fun game if you need one that is relaxing still in early access so there are a ton of bugs the biggest one being that when i go to a save i played on i cant grab or access anything i can buy products but as soon as i sit the box down i cant interact with it and all my plates are gone

#####

as a german i can say that the ingame doner is not a döner but a dönerteller other than that great game

#####

the game is fun and creative but its broken with crashes sound queue overlaps and just other things that make this game a bit annoying overall its an early alpha so 45 give it a go with friends

#####

fun game

#####

ya

#####

this game is so fucking glitchy my character is fucking retarded
my character is glitched and its a combination of 10 avatars thats not even mine

#####

the game is great when playing i forgot that this is supposed to be early access
the developers are very active and engage with their community on discord daily in a great manner

as for the game itself it does scratch multiple itches
1 its a cooking game my guilty pleasure of gaming genres
2 you got light financial management with cute shops  enough to keep you active but also easy enough to let you chill out
3 decoration  so many great things to decorate with already much more than a lot of full games that have this aspect as main focus you can not only decorate your shop but you also have a home
4 unlocks and progression  as you level up you unlock a  load of new recipes with diverse ingredients and actually get ingame decorative items for getting achievements
5 character design  also like decoration there are much more things already possible than in most other games which have a character generator
6 handling and gameplay it feels ohsosatisfying to cook the sound design from the sizzling of food to the cracking off eggs is great and never gets old as well as the looks of food changing from their raw state to the delicous looking finished one
7 storage management  get all the ingredients then stack them put them in drawers put them in real good i know there are more out there who enjoy a well stocked storage in games like this get fancy stock an open fridge and use it as decoration i spent far too much time placing cookies to look nice d

so do yourself a favor if you are even remotely interested in the game get it
its for a reason i played to all the achievements and i cant wait for more content to come chefskiss

#####

amazing game cant wait for updates

#####

bugs are high but the game is okay

#####

good game but still quite a bit glitchy

#####

love the game its very buggy though when you upgrade to bigger restaurant tablet gets stuck on screen

#####

it is really fun

#####

cannot explain how satisfyingly addicting this game is if youve played and enjoyed overcooked even marginally you will minmax the shit out of this game and open up the most booming kebab empire that those little small town npcs have ever seen

#####

wowowowowowowow

#####

my game is broken im stuck in the tutorial trying to make my father a meal i complete the meal and put where is suppose to be it gives me a rating for the dish and then does nothing the father doesnt interact with the dish ive watched videos and im not doing it wrong the game is bugged ive tried 3 separate times and nothing works i want to play this game so devs can you please fix this so i can

i found a way around this problem by opting out of the tutorial

#####

ridiculously fun hard solo but so enjoyable with friends if you like cooking sims and some hectic shenanigans then youll love this

#####

let me cook

#####

very good game for being in early acccess

#####

good game to play with friends

#####

cooking with friends is fun the game gets challenging the further you get into it cause there is more and more mouths to feed

#####

the game is riddled with bugs in single player and unplayable in multiplayer
if you are planning to play with a friend and you are buying the game for this dont 
multiplayer does not worki tried multiple times the game just freezes my friend tried as well and its the same we are both asking for a refund and might comeback when the advertised features work i get its in early access and there might be bugs but multiplayer is a huge part of this games offering and not be able to start a coop game is beyond an early access bug


#####

fun and easy game

#####

you can place dining tables inside the bathroom

#####





#####

i am now unemployed irl

#####

great game

#####



#####

the game has a 110 chance of booting up without crashing

#####

game is completely unplayable in single player created a character and spawned in but the menu immediately opened and could not be closed couldnt do anything at all refunded which is very unfortunate because i was looking forward to this game

#####

i love love love this game so much fun im looking forward to more recipes and decor in the future i do wish for a much more efficient way to carry items like grab food from the fridge while holding a tray or being able to put a box on top of each other while i am out shopping looking forward to the future updates

#####

adorable game a little glitchy but so much promise

#####

kebab

#####

between shouting at customers for getting stuck water spraying up from the sink tap and going mental trying to cook up what is eaten this game is a good investment so far

however cooking everything thats not a kebab in a game called kebab chefs it is outright outrageous that theres no achievement to cook only kebab recipes for a whole day please add thank you

#####

very adicting but kept being kicked out of the game

#####

geilo matiko

#####

this game is amazing and truly a work of art ive never had more fun in a multiplayer game than this one its so silly and lighthearted and fun with friends i enjoy cooking in it and then at the end of the day wasting all our money gambling at blackjack

#####

do you like cooking doner at 11pm with all of your friends then buy this game and you can do just that

#####

fun

#####

i make a kebab i bring a to you

#####

very addictong kebab

#####

its very funny to customise the character

#####

as many others have said to buggy for now maybe ill buy again at a later date and try again one day for now the settings for the game dont even work i capped framerate limit and it just didnt lol drops frames constantly on a 2770 super also every time you log back into the game your settings get reset for whatever reason

#####

add the function of being able to put a youtube link on the wall tv please this can be goatesque

#####

relaxing

#####

its fun game but can u update steam cloud

#####

playing this with a couple friends is some of the most fun ive had in a long time gameplay loop is super fun

#####

its fun and addictive i really enjoy this game

#####

رهيبه

#####

black jack is the best were now only using the casino to make money and gave up the restaurant
spending the whole day in the casino instead of the restaurant also has the added benefit of not having to deal with all the bugs introduced with the latest patch
1010 can recommend

#####

fun with friends


#####

bugs and bugs i understand its an early access but theres too many bugs unplayable and the blackjack table is 100 scam not even fair

#####

i really like this kind of game it is a good game to bring fun with friends online i see the developers focus on this game recommended to buy 

i also hope the developers can keep pace with the update of this game look forward to her 10 release

#####

extermely interactive

#####

very underrated game great fun and as difficult as you want it to be has more content than i was expecting but its taking a while to work through the gourmets

#####

im not going to lie i didnt have the highest expectations of this game but its so fun 
its a lot more fun playing with friends i highly recommend it the customization and detail is great and decent game content the issue is it can be very buggy but i played so much i know some tricks and tips on how to get out of certain buggy situations i put more hours than i thought i would the food and cooking is pretty detailed which i like 
i hope they continue with updates and add more content because in time it gets slightly repetitive 
the art style is funny yet comforting it reminds me of those old wii cooking games  

i love this game it also have similar mechanics to cooking simulator 

#####

i am now a world class chef

#####

game is good but i cant gamble more than 30k and thats sad 

#####

surprisingly fun

#####

awesome game d

#####

makin kebobs with the boys maximum comfy

#####

i only wish it was vr compatible but otherwise very fun 

#####

this game is kind of fun and addictive lol

#####

spit in their food and they still love it

#####

fun for all the family

#####

great game some bugs but all minor would recommend playing with at least one person together 
abuse the plates from the oven they are busted   and prep your meals when you want to serve 120 plus a day 3 

devs making right decisions you can server 10 different meals now

#####

good kebap

#####

buy if you enjoy loud moaning in your ear and cooking with friends

#####

epah alot fun

#####

it#s a realy funny multiplayerexperience

#####

i love this game
me and my sister always play this game together and we never get bored of it 

#####

really enjoyable game and its getting regular patches and hotfixes to keep up with the truckload of bugs its got but none of them are too annoying really  quite comical actually 1010 for playing with friends 

loads of customisation options and the daily grind feels satisfying and worth the effort still have a long way to go on my progress but seems like plenty of content to keep anyone entertained for many many hours

#####

i really like this game especially together with friends looking forward to see more content its already good but has still lots of potential however there are some bugs due to alpha keep that in mind when buying

#####

this game is actually surprisingly fun and addictive with friends they seem to be committed to updating the game semi regularly too as off this review just the right amount of jank

#####

this game is fantastic to play together with your friends as you progress further in the game it becomes a greater challenge to manage the kitchen we laughed and worked together for our guests

#####

i played 30hrs of this game in 5 days i just love the game and the support it is getting as well as all the new updates that are regularly improving the game 1010

#####

goty 2024 ez

#####

if youre a sweat dont buy this
if youre a sweat with funny friends buy this
if youre a casual guy with funny friends absolutely buy this

#####

 fire

#####

i personally really like this game despite even the bugs i find it amusing immersive and relaxing the only thing that bothers me a lot thus far is my sink for some reason when in use the water flows up in the air instead of down i assume it is a bug that needs patchingif anyone knows how to fix it let me know

#####

this game is good

#####

kebab

#####

noice

#####

very fun fun game to play alone and with friends lots to progress through and complete

#####

good game i love the improvements

#####

avada kebabra

#####

cute 

#####

very nice game

#####

ahmud i need 3 kebabs on the grill right fing now

#####

i dont write reviews very often but i definitely have to say that this game it has so much potential and i am extremely excited to see if it can blast off as high as i know it can however i havent experienced it too much at the time of writing this review but so far i am loving every minute of it i have encountered a hand full of bugs but that is to be expected with a game this new it hasnt stopped me from progressing or etc so i dont mind it since i know it will be patched sooner or later i just hope the devs continue to pave the road in the right direction for this game 

i have been searching for a game that allows me to do this exact thing ive played plate up and etc and as much fun as those are i feel like this really took it for me being able to create your own menus and customize freely both living quarters and restaurant while having chances to expand later on are everything i couldve asked for 

b if youre thinking of getting it just get it b at the time of writing it theres a sale and its definitely worth it in my opinion and if not you can always refund it if its not your cup of tea win win scenario

#####

awesome game cant wait to see what updates are next d

#####

good to become a kook


#####

goods very new
