the game is good however i work in the oilfield and spend a lot of time in places with little to no internet the game even in offline mode will not play because ea wont connect to the internet absolutley pathetic

#####

its fun but not worth full price

ea play is 399mo on steam buy one month play this game until you get bored then unsub from ea play its way cheaper than spending full or even sale price

#####

there are 2 clear takeaways from this game 

1 the people designing the legends body kits have never even seen a car in their life
2 the people writing the dialogue have never had a human interaction in their life

#####

i know ea gets a lot of hate but personally i dont think it gets enough

h1need for speed unboundh1

here we go another nfs has come out and now its the trivial matter of whether or not the game is decent or another year waiting for a potential dumpster fire i think its decent if anything improves a bit from heat

need for speed unbound improves quite a bit from heat however some things arent very great with this game this review is going to be based on my own experience and what i think is good and bad i will say this nfs is decent if not one of the better racing titles out there in the arcade genre

btldr good graphics actual progression ear numbing soundtrack cringe dialogue cringe zoomie humor improved gameplay but still needs improvement good on sale questionable at full priceb

lets start with the good things

 progression thank god for actual progression something that has been severely lacking for racing titles you have to grind to get what you want its a nice balance of having to start with a slow beater and having to race day after day to build up your cash there is a risk to this too

 playing on the hardest difficulty i can say its been an actual challenge to win races the beginning stages have a learning curve to them it isnt something youre expected to win every race so if you have this mindset sorry to disappoint you are going to come in second or third even based on your skill im very experienced with racing titles and adapt to them unbound gives you a bit of a rough time at the start but trust me everything gets better

 car selection good very good its a big improvement from heat i will say its one of my favorites for a modern nfs title sorry no toyota there are 143 cars to pick from and good customization 

 cops i can say i enjoy but also dislike this is a neutral stance i have with it ill come back to this in the bad section they keep up which i enjoy however they do swarm the streets a bit too much if it were in the city understandable however driving more in the rural areas theyre swarming everywhere

 handing okay controversial at first it was a learning curve but after you fall in love with your build and adapt to your car its not all as bad as people say oh but the steering is unrealistic yeah did you know need for speed is also an arcade racer excluding the shift series this is an irrelevant take i can say at most drifting does need a bit of tweaking

 art style is another controversial take i like it but i also dont like it i appreciate this game for its art direction its cool colorful and unique in an art style approach especially in the racing genre but some parts the art style doesnt fit either

 gameplay the thing i value about all this has indeed excelled higher than heat in my opinion cops have been indeed a challenge maybe a bit too much at times

the bad

 the soundtrack oh my god need for speed youre becoming out of touch with your soundtrack selections heat may have been bad but its a lot more tolerable compared to unbound personally stop selecting music from soundcloud mumble jumbo rappers that record in their bathrooms fortunately spotify does fix this but i feel like it shouldnt be needed in the first place

 back to the art style although i do like the attempt at something new from the nfs team i can say that there are problems when it comes to it the shading of your characters does seem out of place especially with the lighting during the night your character might have some odd glowing effect at times this can lead to weird animations as well i can respect the attempt however it needs more polishing effects are pretty cool to me however there should be an option to disable them entirely

 the direction of dialogue and zoomer lingo okay as a late zoomer myself growing up with the original most wanted and beforei can say that this game indeed tries to fit in with zoomies which i do not certainly associate myself with the dialogue is cringe at times terrible even i can agree with those who argue about this topic

 the cops i dont get it nfs is a wildcard when it comes to the police in one game theyll do a bad job then do a good job a better job even but take steps back to ruin the experience however i will say unbound has a good mixture of good and bad its an improvement but there are steps back that could make it better so for starters why do the cops not chase you when you know they should especially when a dialogue shows suspect found at heat level 1 and they dont chase you i dont understand especially with the original most wantedor carbon had this nailed perfectly i am a bit disappointed by the radio chatter as well however i dont think its entirely bad the cop chases though god its intense on the highest difficulty i will say these cops do not mess around at the highest level my final complaint about the police is the fact that theyre swarming everywhere its essentially a consistent stealth mission and theres a cop in every corner the density is too much back to a positive note i do dig the chase music to be honest

 multiplayer is bare bones only 16 people and half the lobbies dont even race resulting you to have empty lobbies its a shame there needs to be a lobby system for people who just want to race with a full lobby and specific classes all you get are spamming of popups of races you cant either participate or not a class you dont want terrible system disappointed in criterion when hot pursuit has a good example for matchmaking hell you could even do a high stakes mode with this whenever police ai do get added wishful thinking i know but multiplayer needs a lot of work more people in races benefit for less of a grind theres a whole grind its actually a bit dreadful and i thought i usually stick to single player but when i want to play multiplayer its a bit of a chore to have a casual experience

edit multiplayer has improved with more pvp focused events than just relying on the old freeroam its progress and is definitely better than launch

final verdict

im enjoying the game despite the problems the core aspect of the game nails the true need for speed experience and has been better than other modern nfs titles this feels like an actual smooth arcade racer controversial as this might be especially how divided people are with this game because of muh realism sorry but need for speed was always except for the shift series an arcade racer with unrealistic approaches and physics complaining about this game because its not realistic is irrelevant about the anime stuff too i dont see it matters that much but can agree it looks out of place at times pretty meh for me i can appreciate its something different people seem to hate new things nfs is full of remasterwishing doomers though it is what it is

the hard attempt with the zoomer lingo is definite pressed too hard here i barely touch single player and focus on the multiplayer aspect racing game stories are mid anyways and always have been for most titles

can say a good 710 or a hard 8 at most if generous its decent and has problems but not the worst thing ea released the support of this game has came some ways and quite fortunate about it

#####

one of the characters was trying to make the case that the cops are too hard on street racers while i a street racer plowed headon into an suv with a family of 5 on board

910

#####

is it worth 90 dollars hell no

its not even worth 50

maybe 30

i just have smooth brain that likes pretty colours and grinding

#####

figured i would just send what i sent to the support person when i requested my refund lol

i dont even know where to start with this pathetic excuse for a game nfs heat had some frustrating aspects to it but overall it was an enjoyable experience this sequel gets rid of everything that was good about heat and amplifies everything that was bad

lets start with tethering what a joke of a system i play games to relax have fun and enjoy the story the whole purpose of being able to choose your difficulty in a game is to be able to play how you want to play not in nfs unbound no sir it doesnt matter if you choose the lowest difficulty setting because the game tethers you to the ai at all times it doesnt matter how big your lead is one mistake and youre done

this conveniently leads to my next point restart limitations are you kidding me so the game is made to be as punishing as possible and we dont even have the option to restart as much as we want anymore no thank you

point #3 your car is tissue paper in every sense of the word hit a cop nothing happens to him hit a racer nothing happens to him get hit by a cop or a racer you go flying off the road or spin out of control

speaking of control driving at high speed in this game is an absolute joke the slightest corner makes you lose all control of your car and one of three things usually happens you hit a wall you go off the road you hit a car

what is enjoyable about this game really i am struggling to find a single thing you get punished for wanting to play casually you get punished for driving too fast you get punished for battling with other racers and cops you get punished for being unlucky and landing on top of a car off of a jump and other random events then you get punished for restarting i dont play games to be punished i play games to have fun and this is the most unfun experience i have ever had playing a game so much so that this is my first time ever returning a game on here

keep up the great work ea youre doing a fantastic job

h1nfs unbound reviewh1strikeno one will prob see thisstrike

last updated oct 12 2023


h1pros  consh1

the highs
graphics wow
customizations hold my bumper
racing ai are more engaging with the addition of class tiers
cars bugatti urus countach c8 etc what more could you want
physics  handling kinda similar to heat in some ways but even better with grip and drift tuning
rsr nerfed not that broken anymore
spoilerhellcat yeehawspoiler
cops just better and makes more sense than heat in heat the three cop cars are okay and weak fast and tough faster and tougher in unbound you can actually play with them by ramming going offroad or tricking them but theyre weak against minor collisions

the lows
audi and toyota what happened to them
the absence of offroad racing
some cool small features removed im not gonna get to details here

the mids
soundtrack at least an improvement to heat
story longer than heat but it doesnt have the thrill of actually being a movie character and the dialogues are quite cringe
economy earning money in story is more strict events are only available to its time in the day for example an aclass drift race is only available in tuesday at daytime you wont be able to see that event at other times of the week maybe theyre are preventing people doing the same race over and over
driving effects you cant completely turn them off but it wont interfere with you when cruising at 50mph
crown vic not being a part of lpd but instead of a drivable player car

h1what and when to buyh1
you should just get the standard edition because the palace cars still require ingame money to buy theyre not in your garage when you jump in the ea app version is better because you still need the app to play the game and if youre considering buying it its best to buy it when its on sale


conclusion
nfs unbound is a great base game as a whole since volume 2 the games online finally got some attention its an okay game in terms of story but if youre looking for an online experience definitely give this a try

volume 5 update im glad they still care about the game and community this is the longest postlaunch support weve had in nfs ever


h1some cop tips if you even get this farh1

freeroam  avoid them by smashing sideswiping speeding past them keep in mind at higher heat they spot you faster taking a different route or by hiding with your engine off there is also an auxiliary item called undercover racer which doubles the time the cops take to spot you


heat 1  patrol dodge chargers slow and fragile by that i mean really with 470hp theyre probably using 30 of their throttle you can get rid of them by ramming driving fast or confusing them with alleyways uturns and jumps

heat 2  awd ford explorers slightly faster than the chargers tougher and does better offroad you can get rid of them by again driving fast confusing or ramming them but it takes longer to disable it

heat 3  interceptor corvettes  fast agile and very focused onroad they also like to drive in front of you giving you burst nos and brake checking you can get rid of them by ramming driving them into traffic cars walls or going offroad
roadblocks  blocks the road with chargers with gaps and sometimes with spike strips they will often crash into their own roadblocks and spikes causing them to crash

heat 4  undercover camaros  hidden from scanner in freeroam only when its in pursuit and slightly slower than the corvettes you can get rid of them by ramming though theyre tougher to takedown pit maneuvering them or by using the undercover racer auxiliary part to avoid them in freeroam
roadblocks  same as heat 3 but chargers are replaced with heavy raptors
helicopters  sees you from the sky takes much longer than the ground units to spot you you can lose them from them by hiding under tunnels obstacles and turning off your engine or just keep running until they run out of fuel

heat 5  swat ford raptors toughest of the bunch deals a lot of damage faster than it looks has poor handling you can get rid of them by taking sharp turns uturning swerving through traffic until they crash or ramming it from the back
roadblocks heavy raptors fully blocking the road with small gaps between
a second helicopter will sometimes be called in to assist


thats it for the review peace

#####

this game needs to be called run from the cops all fckin day simulator i think its about 70 of the game is just running from the police

#####

when im in a be cringe competition but my opponent is nfs dialog writer

#####

got this with the ea pass for 10 hours i had my fun and got the car i wanted and upgraded all the way but i would not pay 70 for this game it should be like 30

#####

fast car make sad voice in head go away

#####

i hope you like police chases because we added them after every race 

 aap rocky

#####

you gd dmn better not spend 70 on this game

30 tops

#####

basically heat 2

things that are better than heat
 singleplayer storyline

 car customization and selection

 cartoon art style is honestly badass really great visuals

 the soundtrack goes hard as hell thank you aap rocky

 the handling this is the only reason i can recommend this game after 7 long years of frostbite nfs games that felt janky as hell they finally figured out how to make the car steer and drift in a way that doesnt make it feel like your controller is broken this is the reason im going to play this game 100x more than heat despite heat having done many many things better it feels great to play and considering how few racing games even exist anymore ill take it as a massive win

things that are worse than heat
 sense of speed i dont know if its the fov or the motion blur but it feels like youre driving much slower

 the map sucks heats map was a beautiful miami lookalike with beaches a shuttle launchpad a mall parking garages and other clever inclusions why the hell did they make a bad knockoff of chicago its ugly and has no character

 lack of offroad racing ive never liked the offroad racing in nfs but if its going to be an option with car selection and tuning options just give us some damn races for it at least

 amount of races in general after 2 hours youve basically played every single race they really need to add more routes

 cop chases are more annoying than thrilling and the rewards for them are terrible really incentivizes you to just drive slow and hide from the cops on your radar

 daynight as a gameplay variation ie heats nights were thrilling and dangerous while the daytime had a more casual vibe plus the legal races were a neat switchup

 multiplayersingleplayer progression is separated so you have to play twice as much to buy the same cars and holy hell is this game grindy barely any reward money is given so it takes a very long time to unlock many of the vehicles it doesnt need to be free cars every 4 minutes like forza but damn give us some more spending cash

 no fast travel damn guys i have a real life job i cant spend all day driving around

#####

save your money for when the game goes on sale

it is a fun game as in nfs games are simply fun in general this game though isnt worth 70 bucks let alone 100 for the palace edition so where to begin

 cops  cops in unbound are fairly easy to run from but when you reach heat lvl 5 they are just simply annoying more than anything now you may think well if you just avoid them which would work if it wasnt for the fact that at lvl 5 they are just about everywhere you can avoid them to an extend but drive around long enough at lvl 5 and youll inevitably find yourself in a situation where you cant avoid detection and that situation will be sooner rather than later then youre in another police chase and all you want to do is get to the next race which is on the other side of the map

 races  the minimap makes the map seem large and while youre driving around the world may seem large in truth though after youve spent some time driving and racing youll realize just how small the world is there are just a few locations where you can start races and after the first week a lot of the races you do will be repeat courses youve already done youre going to be racing every course over and over again even through different locations you would think that each location has access to races in their area especially when it comes to the circuit races but youd be wrong each event location can have a race set up for any area around the map there was little effort put into the diversity of racing locations and possible tracktrack layout and thats partly due to the world actually being fairly small

 handlingdriving  while some cars are pretty good other cars arent if you like trying to beat these games with 1 car from start to finish then dont build a car for grip while yes you can beat the game with a grip build there are some races that could be next to impossible to get first with a grip build drift build on the other hand works fantastically in every single race there isnt a race where you can go wrong with a drift build now while unbound doesnt do the stupid shit of forcing you into drifts the game is very clearly built to encourage you to drift though drifting in this game can be rewarding and fun with all that said handling in this game isnt the best some cars feel like they just want to understeer if youre not drifting grip racing also feels a lot slower through turns than drifting

 modifications  very lacking when it comes to body modifications you have a lot of choices by a lot i mean you can mixmatch from the 34 maybe 5 body kits depending on the car the only stuff that isnt part of a body kit are lights mirrors window tint exhaust canards on some cars and wheels speaking of wheels this game has probably the smallest selection of wheels ive seen in a game in a long time id almost say the selection of wheels in the very first nfs underground was bigger than here how ever there is a good selection of spoilerswings but depending on your preference only a couple may suite your fancy so far most of the cars i have either left it stock or it had 1 spoilerwing that i thought looked good performance isnt much better either depending on what youre building you really only have 1 selection for each part granted there are tiers of all the parts but each part you dont really get much of a choice which can be said for many racing games but somehow in unbound upgrading the performance doesnt really feel like anything special doesnt feel like you have to put much thought into what youre buying it feels mundane as if the only reason youre doing it is simply to go faster which i know is really why you buy the upgrades but this game manages to make the whole process of upgrading your performance feel meh

 story  this is easily the worst part about the game the story is so lazy that im surprised they even bothered to put it in its so stupidly simple that you can figure out the entire story just from the prologue then when you get to the actual game most of the story is given to you through the phone calls your character has with a few other characters hell one of the characters feels like they were just an after thought created after they had written out the story and then shoehorned in and they are one of the main characters that helps you get through the game

is this a fun game yes to an extent after the hype dies off dont be surprised to start seeing articles starting to shine light on all the problems the game has that make it not nearly as great of a game as many people are saying right now this was a very lazily done nfs and for me is way down at the bottom of the list for what a good nfs game is its not worth the price or even half find it on a 75 off sale sure go ahead and pick it up

as a last addition out of all the nfs games ive played since the first underground this is the first one ive played that i havent finished not because its hard but because by the 4th week my interest in finishing it had dropped to 0 it got to a point that every time i got on it felt more like i was doing a chore just to try and finish the game all because ive beaten all the others i did have fun when i wasnt trying to work to finish the game and was just running around collecting the collectibles trying to finish it running around back and forth across the city because there is no fast travel dealing with the cops struggling with ai that seemingly get massive boosts in speed at times i just got to a point where i didnt want to bother anymore

#####

completed this game on a free weekend youre not gonna get my money ea

#####

the game is good however i work in the oilfield and spend a lot of time in places with little to no internet the game even in offline mode will not play because ea wont connect to the internet absolutely pathetic

#####

although the game isnt very popular the money is hard to get and the crashes are super over the top the game overall including the story that has corny ass dialogue is worth buying on sale do not buy this for 60 dollars it goes on sale for 10

#####

no matter how far i drive i cant out drive my loneliness

#####

it as its flaws but there is definitely something new for nfs fans im gonna do this review the same way i did with heat so 

h2 pros h2

 again there are many cars from different classes and brands to choose from this time there is also a bugatti chiron i think its the first time they added one in a nfs game with customization 
 just like in real life there is a fee in order to participate in most of the illegal street racing events which means that you can also lose money after completing a race i know that nfs games arent supposed to be realistic in general but i think it is a nice detail which makes the game feel more like a real street racing game
 racing rivals are not generic anymore and i dont mean the protagonists but all of the opponents you can actually see the drivers before starting an event and there is a little description about each driver too
 new customization options that can keep you busy for hours also bodykits are back on the menu and some of them look pretty wild like some cars cant be easily recognized with certain bodykits which is cool you can now edit them too  finally  for those who played the older games underground and most wanted you probably remember having a bodykit but didnt really like the rear or front bumper and you couldnt change it now you can there are also new neons vinyls and more as for the anime effects i was also skeptical about this but honestly they add a nice touch to your ride i feel like they actually compliment my cars wrap and appearance in general you just gotta pick the right ones you can also access hundreds of community made wraps by just pressing a button which is a really cool feature sure there are mods too but sometimes you dont feel like browsing the interwebz and manually modifying files so it makes things easier
 new event types and playlists just like in heat you arent forced to participate in all of them i also like how there are events for all classes even when you are near the end of the story remember there arent only 1500hp cars that participate in street racing
 graphics have been improved and optimized further i dont know how but this game has as good lighting shadows and reflections as ray tracing without chopping your fps in half the world textures and models look much better too speaking of the world there are now pedestrians too which kinda brings the city to life its funny how they can dodge your car no matter how fast you drive yes i did try to kill some of them to see if itll actually happen

h2 things i dislikedh2

 some of the mechanics and upgrades in the game encourage toxic  in my opinion  gameplay joining an online race to get smashed to pieces aint fun i love customizing my ride and racing with fellow gamers online but the combat mechanics kinda ruin all that i mean whats the point of spending time and money not real money ingame money to make your dream car only for it to get rammed of course you can quit without getting a penalty but the option to play like that is still there the combat mechanics were great in nfshot pursuit but it just doesnt fit in this one here is an idea  make some sequels for hot pursuit and put all the combat stuff in there  and the police too  
 police in single player can be pretty frustrating if youre playing online your heat level disappears after the cops lose you regardless if its level 1 or 5 in single player however it stays keep in mind you cannot fast travel while playing single player but you can do so in an online lobby so that means if youre done for the day and just wanna go back to your garage then good luck reaching there first you have the mandatory postrace police chases even if you are sure that you drove fast enough to escape the police during the race and then helicopters and cop cars appearing next to your location even if you arent in a pursuit also i dont know if this is a bug or not but police cars can spot you behind buildings too because you are in their  spotting radious  even if they are looking to the opposite side so in other words its like playing a stealth game while driving a car 
 single player progress is not shared with online which may not sound too bad but here is the thing  cars in multiplayer are unlocked differently for example to unlock certain cars you must do 30 races of a specific category i dont wanna bash too much but this game came out last year and has only about 2000 players online on a sunday after going on a deep discount it may sound like a lot of players but not all of them are playing online and many of those who do dont join in all of the events
 there is a  speech focus mode  option which is always on even if you turn it off so the option doesnt really work as soon as a character is starting to talk you only hear himher even if you adjust the speech volume to be really low speaking of speech there is a lot of unnecessary nonsensial annoying and cringy dialogue that the players dont want to hear it made me completely mute the speech i mean its not like i missed any important detail 
 the music is good but there is no variety in genres im not a big fan of pop and rap music especially while being in a s race put some rock and metal

h3 other h3

i think releasing so much dlc for a game with  mixed  score and low player count isnt a good idea but hey at least it is only cosmetic stuff and you arent really missing anything if you dont buy them still it is wasted time and money for the developers i would rather work on improving the games mechanics first you can see many negative reviews that mention the problem with the police being too op gonna type the suggestion again  remove combat mechanics and police from nfs games that focus on customizing and racing and if you wanna add them then put them in a hot pursuit sequel no one will probably read this but whatever

#####

i cant wit this mfs they finaly make an update after half a year of doing nothing then i saw they are adding audi in the game and was genualy happy and wanted to get my hands on the new rs6 now imagine my face when i saw that to get the rs6 u need to pay 10 fluffin dollars his game already costs 70 why should i even consider paying for the second time just to get a car a one single car sure it comes with the bp but the only thing i would actully want is that rs6 ea lives up to their image as a game producing company deserving to be thrown in the trashcan beneath the ubisoft

#####

h1this is just regurgitated nfs heath1

ill start with pros since theres a few
theres a few new cars that i havent seen previously in the series nissan silvia ks mercedes 190e both of which have been heavily emphasized in the trailer videos as if it was ground breaking
the graffitistyle visuals while kind of goofy are a good mask for how terrible and arcadey the driving physics are
the graphics are pretty decent

thats all that comes to mind so far lets talk about the cons in detail great detail


h1the conartistssh1

this game at its absolute core is a reskinned nfs heat which in itself was a reskinned nfs2015 what do i mean by that we are still getting the exact same cars we got in the previous games albeit with a few new ones sprinkled in to keep things fresh the vehicle and parts models are all the same i mean i didnt even see so much as a new wheel choice since the 2015 game aside from the gaudy turbofan style wheels that only exist to accentuate the graffiti style seriously we cant get some new wheels volk te37s work equips vskfs weds cerberus advan rgiis come on everything at its core is 100 reminiscent of nfs heat but with a new map and fresh visuals i genuinely cannot recommend this game to anyone if you want to play it and havent played heat just go get that instead its much cheaper and will feel relatively the same sadly for me i tried so hard to like this game and i think im now passed my refund point but this will be the last need for speed title i purchase until they make some sort of massive game change like they did with pro street or either of the shift titles and i have been playing nfs since the 1997 release of need for speed ii i used to look forward to their releases now it just feels like that clapped ford taurus your parents gave you as a first car but with a different coat of paint still drives as terrible as ever but now its geriatric gold instead of the unimaginative grey it was before

secondary con ea went out of their way to add takeover events to the mix this was actually the point where i lost all interest in finishing the game the final straw before i closed out the game and decided i was going to request a refund for those who dont know what a takeover is its when a bunch of idiot kids block off the intersection or part of a highway and surround cars doing donuts if you want to see what this normally looks like just look up takeover meet fails on your favorite viral video site there have been endless injuries and even deaths because pedestrians are getting hit by cars falling out of cars cars hitting each other cars hitting poles fights shootings etc the fact that the devs went out of their way to add this into the game to their defense the takeover events ingame are essentially just drift events with smash and jump points added tells me that they are so wildly disconnected from car culture and dont actually know what is needed to appeal to car enthusiasts the kids that attend real world takeover events are constantly looked down upon for their reckless behavior and complete disregard to even the most basic of safety standards and are constantly putting the car community under massive scrutiny so i guess the only thing the devs got right was the plot line of the politician wanting to outlaw these modified cars 

in summary i dont write reviews like ever and im not sure that anyone will even see this review or read it this far if they do but i am so wildly disappointed with what this franchise has become its every bit as bad as the fast and furious franchise going from street racing to shuffles note cards rocket cars in space if youre new to the modern nfs series it might not seem that bad when playing it but seriously just go play heat of nfs 2015 its all the same content nfs 2015 was at least sort of connected to the culture one of the faces on the cover was akira nakai the owner and creator of rauhwelt begriff which is the top porsche tuner of japan and known worldwide the content at that time was fresh and felt reminiscent of nfs underground nfs heat had the addition of body kit designs from khyzyl saleem a well known graphic designer who designed some of the wildest cars and now owns an aero company called live to offend ea used to have a slight connection to the car scene through a few big names but this game felt absolutely disconnected and overall just another cash grab from a big franchise disappointed is an understatement

#####

this game does not deserve all the hate it gets

it deserves solid criticism sure but wanting it to be just like forza is plain ignorance every single damn racing game nowadays looks the same and im tired of it unbound flipped the bird to all that and made sure to have something that nfs always had above others  style the driving effects and the sound sample system are stunning and signal a breath of fresh air amidst all the games nowadays which have their art direction dictated by lifeless suits rather than passionate artists

the handling is the best we have in modern nfs you can grip very hard and completely disable brake 2 drift if you wish so or embrace drifting all together hell you can even find an inbetween if you are feeling adventurous the burst system is a great addition to the gameplay

the story is indeed confused about what it wants to say trying to paint the racers under a good light is just weird a few college kids complaining about how the cops are evil for going after them right after pulling 300 kmh on a public highway and ramming others into traffic is silly plus all the political discourse it tries to engage with despite being on the fence about all it wants to say many parts of the plot are not explained or given much substance like the games main villain to sum it up the revenge plot is a great idea but the execution is subpar

the dialogue tries to be cool and hip with its wording but it just ends up being alienating though i dont think its as bad as the stuff weve seen in the crew 2motorfest and forza horizon 45 as at least in here they try to be expressive to a degree instead of the 1dimensional puppets we got in those other titles that said rydell is by far the best and most relatable character

an issue i hope criterion improves with updates are the content updates im not a fan of liveservices and im happy with most of what we got in the base game for its singleplayer mode but the multiplayer needs some meatier content the porsche celebration update is interesting but we couldve received a few more cars im not asking for dozens of cars to be added with each update but more than 1 would be nice

all i wish for is that people would realize that despite its flaws unbound is trying to shake up a genre thats been left in the gutter for over a decade there are no other arcade racers in the aaa market right now and the other racing games we do have might as well be cast in the same mold

#####

how to actually enjoy this game 

mute in game music

play eurobeat or nfsmw 2005 soundtrack 

enjoy

#####

disable in game music audio and dialogue put your own music on and enjoy the game car makes loud turbo noises


#####

all the other need for speeds have been great this one is completely ridiculous in the worst way the fact that you have to really pick what cars you want and then do roughly 90 races sometimes in the same 3 shit playlists is horrid i understanding grinding to get what you want in a game but the fact that you have to work that hard for 1 car god help you if you want to really mix it up and have a handful of nice things in your garage its like beating your head into a keyboard youre better off to just go play their previous game of need for speed heat 
what an absolute let down normally im not one to write reviews on games but this one was so bad it needed the work dump

#####

u honest review from someone who actually beat the game u
first a few words to me and my experience with the nfs series
i lost interest in the series after most wanted 2005 because after that i felt like the series was pushed in wrong directions or simply didnt seemed as polished as it should be i know that i am not the only one feeling this way i was always looking into the newer games including heat but never got one
when i first saw the announcement trailer for unbound it woke my interest because it actually looked fresh and at the same time like its going back to its core strengths from the underground series and mw checking the comments section many other players had felt the same way so i got the game after its release

now after beating the game i can say that it is actually a decent nfs game its not perfect by any means but i can say that in general it is going in the right direction it has a lot of tuning and customisation options for a big range of cars something a really liked about the underground games it has the thrill of the cop chases from mw while also adding strengths from the burnout series i loved burnout paradise like the open and intertwined world compared to burnout paradise the open world doesnt feels as perfect but it is also not bad handling needs a little getting used to but it also depends on the car some prone more to breaking out while drifting than others i liked the handling of the lancer evo x and skyline gtr for example it was the right balance between grip and controlled drifting 
also i liked the difficulty of the game theres still some rubber banding or adapting difficulty happening in the background but its just the right amount in my opinion i liked the variaty of racing events and would appreciate the return of drag races

surprisingly i actually got into the story and the characters it starts out a bit cringe in the beginning but the dialogues show that the game is selfaware and doesnt takes itself too seriously it also has a political satirical note to it honestly it was even funny at times for example when rydell gets into social media and starts to annoy the player with some user comments that he has found it really feels like a boomer that just found out about social media
also i dont mind the mixed comic style since it is a arcade racer and the cars still look photorealistic

like some others players on here already mentioned i see one of the biggest flaws in the constant cop chases
yeah i get that its aiming for a high riskhigh reward kind of thing but on the highest heat level is nearly impossible to even get to the racing events without being permanently chased it can get really annoying to escape just to be chased by a cop again thats spawns right after the next corner it just feels tedious at times at least on the pc you can get a mod which prevents cops from detecting you while free roaming

another one of the biggest flaws in my subjective opinion is the onesided soundtrack need for speed burnout flatout and a famous skateboarding game series in the 2000s were true gold mines for really cool songs and when i think about the series it was always associated with those songs i get the hip hop and multicultural theme of the game but one of the narratives in the game is also about expressing yourself and to have an open mind so i dont get why we dont get some more options here besides hip hop electro and latin music i personally would appreciate at least some dnb rock metal and punk songs like in the older games something that makes you feel a rush of adrenaline i get that theres little to no representation of rock music in mainstream media but i think a little push is all that we need i am sure a lot of bands in the past wouldnt have gotten this famous if they werent part of soundtracks in games in the first place
i didnt mind most of the songs and i even got into some of the electro songs but there were some songs that i really just started hating for example this ukrainian rap song were alina poish goes skraa or this song called linda they were hurting my ears yes i could have just opened spotify and played my own music instead but like i said i think the soundtrack from the older games was also a core strength in the series and i always appreciate to find new cool music at least give me the option to deactivate songs that i dont like and dont force me to listen to them

i cannot say a word to the multiplayer mode since i havent played it but i think a few seamless multiplayer elements integrated into the single player mode would have been cool like seeing some other players from time to time on the streets or to be able to see scores they did on the various activities

u in summary u
if you liked the 2000s nfs games give it a try its not perfect but i think the devs made a good foundation here for future nfs games i really wish that they will listen to the player base and build on the games stengths like customisationtuning a unique style fun driving a good sense for speed an open world with tasks to do challenges and eliminate the flaws constant cop chases and a onesided soundtrack being the biggest of them

edit 170323
just wanted to note that with todays patch the devs added the function to skip songs in race events

#####

edited 31423 my original post still stands but i decided to retry the multiplayer and see if anything has improved and my god it is so much worse

players on the scene are now modifying files or cheating in some way to make playing multiplayer to earn money to build shit completely useless for example 3 races in mp earn you 2030k for a win with gradually less each spot down the most expensive car in the game is about 3 million this means you must consecutively win 100 events 3 races in a row at 30k to even think about buying said car other cars are locked behind unlocks winning __ class car events drift in __ class car drift in ___ make etc this is so absurd add to the fact people are now cheating to make x car appear as y car you now its stupid i just raced a golf gti rabbit and the game read it as a 88 countache now you might be asking what does that matter it matters because this little clapped out shit was banging through gears so fast that it was at over 200 mph by the time the countache i was in hit 120 on nos i mean this fucking thing was so fast it discovered time travel to go back to the time it was created if people can do that you know they are modifying money etc and already have everything in multiplayer this game is absolute dogshit i wanted to hope this would be the rebirth but with no updates from the devs the game seems abandoned at release to just die good riddance i am going back to underground underground 2 and carbon on my legacy consoles or playing forza rip nfs



original review below

the good
 customization got some additions bumper removals different body kits headlight and tailight colors etc while wheel options took a huge decrease the overall customization took an increase
 car options while there are tons of duplicates haters will say the 2007 lambo and 2010 lambo are different in some way shape and form there still are plenty of options from cars trucks or suvs
 wagering for races overall i think the buyin  wager system is amazing huge improvement and more representative to the underground scene this is going for
 race design new race types new head to head modes etc

the bad
 makes not being in the game while i understand toyota took themselves out of the game in an attempt to distance themselves from the illegal street racing theme there are some makes that dont even make an appearance and some that arguable shouldnt or most people dont knowdont care about cadillac toyota hyundai kia audi all makes that are just straight up not in the game you have like 13 bmws to choose from but got forbid we put in a cts stinger rs5 genesis coupe or veloster this is a massive oversight and is mainly going after the popular cars
 story i am not gonna lie there are some points i want to beat my head against a wall because the devs were so out of touch when making this story they are pandering to the if you are in your 30s you are old as fuck generation and its fucking showing zoomers galore
 physics fishtailing can get pretty intense even on a high grip car it just seems the overall physics seem off

the downright ugly
 the cops my god the cops they need a major overhaul on them level 1 and 2 are an absolute joke level 3 and level 4 are interceptors that will for some reason fly offroad with you and manage to keep pace in vettes and camaros and whats worse is you are redlining at 240 and they are catching you easily level 5 is a dont even bother they dont take any damage they are the fastest things on the planet and they are in offroad tank trucks the helicoptercop spawns are actually trash what a fucking joke
 rubberbanding catchup ai you can establish a firm lead on a race just to have it ruined because a clapped out civic hauls ass past you because of this rubberbanding catchup mechanic they gave the ai you can be capped out on speed and they are catching you at over 100 yds a second for those of you curious how fast that is its 205 mph on top of what you are doing it is actually game breaking they game does not give you the same courtesy by either slowing down ai or speeding you up for a catchup you are just fucked
 limited restarts i dont use them let me play the game my way fuck off

#####

buy heat instead

#####

not bad but in my opinion nfs heat is better

#####

uh1 only if its on sale h1u

i regret buying it for full price but i dont regret having it

h2 pros h2

 gameplay is addicting and pretty competitive online each car behaves uniquely and thus you have to adapt and use that to your advantage the new boostnos mechanic is also a huge w it adds an element of strategy when racing and is super satisfying when you get the hang of it

 need for speed customization pretty selfexplanatory

 i didnt like the colorful tag effects you can put on your car at first but theyve really grown on me being able to customize them individually for each car is also nice they also affect the color of your nos which is pretty cool

h2 cons h2

 as mentioned above although all cars have unique handling some are seemingly made for drifting no matter how much you try to tune them for gripracing pretty annoying when you want to turn and your car ends up 90 degrees into a wall

 along with toyota audi is also not present this time around soooo no r8 some rims from previous entries are also no longer present

 no reset button

 its baffling but your wrap library is limited to 100 wraps so in theory if you own every single car you can only have wraps on 100 of them

 no customsymbol creator want to save time and plaster some custommade decals gonna have to do it the old school way tediously

 cops are either useless or frustrating no inbetween you either evade them when you dont want to or you cant evade them and get 1tapped by swat trucks when they lightly brush up against your car

 the legendary cars that were free in heat eddies r34 rachels 350z etc are now paywalled this time around gotta love ea

#####

pros
car body kits 3
nice graphics and atmosphere
map is big enough
satisfying effects
sounds
traffic
full controller support

cons
physics
no first person cam
dont even think about drifting
requires ea client
same as nfs heat
photo mode is not enough to take nice shots
characters
dialogs
wheres my braaaaaaaap stutututu

not as good as old nfs games but still playable i think ill spend only 4050 hours on this game and delete it buy this on a sale it doesnt deserve 70 bucks

#####

soundtracks fire when muted

#####

i did a drift mustve been epic i could hear mum and dad clapping from the other room

#####

h1 it gradually became torment when you failed to get the champion and get captured by cops for that pathetic 1k bucks
it suppose to be a fun drift game right i feel like bounded not unbound  h1

#####

the game is good but i am still waiting for the nfs most wanted 2005 remake

#####

one of the characters was trying to make the case that the cops are too hard on street racers while i a street racer plowed headon into an suv with a family of 5 on board

if you havent played nfs heat do that before playing this this game is objectively worse and im going to go more in depth in this review while also drawing parallels to heat as its a fair comparison but for those who dont want to stick around for that long the general gist is that this game is not bad but disappointing and rushed but like i said if you want to know why i think this way keep on reading i also discovered that the reviews have a character limit so ill try to summarise 

and no its not because of the visuals youve had to realise by now that all the racing games look the same the cartoony visuals is a design choice to make the game have an unique feel to it if you go back to previous nfs titles you can see that all of them have a similar theme with heat it was the nightlife with an emphasis on neon lights while in comparison in unbound its about the underground racing scene with an emphasis on graffiti i actually quite like how they did it it gives you more ways to customise the car and racing becomes more animated but in the end it needs to be given a shot before judging as it is unique enough to not have anything to compare it to  

unbound features the burst nitrous basically on top of your normal nitrous that accumulates naturally as you drive on oncoming traffic and by drifting a second shorter bar is present you fill it up doing mostly the same things drifts airtime basically everything else besides oncoming traffic but the difference is that burst nitrous is way more powerful and it disappears on a timer so you either need to use it as soon as you get it or keep the current drift to make it more powerful so player has a choice to either use the lesser boost it gives or wait for a bigger positionaltering boost it never feels unfair either its just a mechanic i really like and makes the racing more snappy definitely something i wouldnt mind in the future titles although it doesnt fit any realistic settings but thats really about all the positives i can give the game  

of course any nfs title wouldnt be complete without its races along with cop chases thats been their pride and joy but they took a different approach here you see theyre i radiant i and is the major reason i think the game is rushed you can instigate races by driving to meetups which are some derelict parking lots in different places of the map all things aside this way of starting the races is a lot better than in heat where you just drove to a random place on the street its in these meetups where you get to see the different races available as well as your rivals with short descriptions of them but actually playing the races is never unique i feel like theres maybe 10 different races in the entire game that just gets recycled over and over which makes sense in a way the races are there to only net you money but man does it b suck b 

completing these races is your main source of income but its also the way you get heat a race could give you from anywhere of 05 to 2 heat just by completing it one of my main criticisms of heat was because it was so night focused it meant that the cops were dozing off on xanax during the days well that isnt the case in unbound because you get heat from races it means you could very easily get to level 5 heat during the day and instead of that disappearing when you get to a safehouse it gets transferred over to the night only after the night will it go away but unlike in heat theres no incentive to get to those higher heat levels because it no longer acts as a money multiplier but feels like a giant fuck you to the players heat level 5 becomes a giant slogfest if the conditions arent right because instead of the rhino from heat theres now a new enforcer type at level 5 it does massive damage even it it as much as scrapes you and it can reach impossible speeds and on top of that it also summons helicopters because why not at least the helicopters arent just floating flood lights from heat and can now also instigate chases the ways to avoid them are by going under something or by turning your car off if its night which of course is an improvement but because they also roam the map outside of chases you find yourself scurrying for cover or turning off your vehicle in the middle of a field all the time 

instead of being able to progress the game naturally like in heat unbound restricts you from getting a good car cars are scored like they were in heat but theres now a rank tied to said score the lowest being b the highest is s the races also have such restrictions you cant for instance roll up to a b tier race with an a tier car it makes sense but what it also does is shackle you because at the end of the week youre going to need an x tier car no less no more so effectively youre capped at that rank theres no use driving an s car when all the races are for worse so why would you want to upgrade your car at all past a certain point its because of this that the early game is slow both literally and metaphorically of course the heat system is unchanged so youre going to be escaping from the same ferocious cops at heat level 5 as you would in the later game because again you need money to progress and to do that you do the repetitive races 

the difficulty in heat came mostly if not only from the repair stations you only had three repairs per night or youre bust accompanied with the high heat multiplier it became a skillbased high risk high reward system so where does the intensivity come from in unbound ill tell you where it comes from the amount of restarts you get per a day and night combo on the easiest difficulty its 10 restarts then its 4 then 3 on the hardest it doesnt take a genius to see whats wrong with this the gap between 10 and 4 is huge and not only that you get 3 restarts on the hardest difficulty while the ai opponents are trying their hardest to beat you while on the easiest difficulty theyre just taking a leisurely stroll on the road and you get 10 attempts to pass them why on earth would anyone pick the hardest difficulty when it doesnt give you more money if anything it forces you to play more races which again are always recycled so it begs the question if this is a singleplayer game with a focus on entertainment why isnt there an option to make a custom difficulty setting and if youre curious you get free repairs in this game but only on 4 minute intervals 

those are my main gripes but the unpolishedness can be seen in other things in the game as well like bugs for example opening up the map while escaping from a helicopter under some cover makes it able to see you restarting the chase or the fact that the map doesnt recenter on the player or that the minimap doesnt know if its the last lap of the race theres just so many visible things wrong with the game it reinforces the idea that the game was pushed out to capitalise on those christmas sales which is a shame because heat was a good game and unbound had a lot of precedent to exceed it  

but if all you want is an enjoyable driving experience akin to need for speed and youve exhausted your options then unbound is not a bad option theres still the elements in this game that makes nfs games so fun which is why i even played it you still get to go 400kmh in a school zone and compete in drifting events in a lamborghini most of the guardrails are made of cardboard while some out of adamantium basic things that makes the series what it is and makes it stick out from the rest but im not going to pretend they didnt do a better job with heat even if this improved on some of the things wrong with it in the end you can only complete the same race so many times before it gets old when in the previous game that was a nonissue

after just a couple of hours i decided to write a negative review about this game but then i started realizing i am beginning to understand and enjoy this game more and more 

if youve read some of the negative reviews and then finish the game yourself you realize most of the hate is directed towards things that would be totally okay in 90s but not in 2022 true the game has some design flaws but its generally a good game with some oldschool elements

for starters if you are like me and most other players spoiled by forza series you probably did set difficulty to highest which i do not recommend for first time playthrough you will probably suffer and become frustrated as you will be earning just a small amount of money from ai that cheats have more powerful cars and most importantly from cops that are quite difficult to lose with b or a class cars on higher heat levels partially its because the game have a lousy tutorial and explains just a few things for example up until about halfway through the story mode i had no idea what are those green circles that keep popping up around the map i also had no idea that you can get money finding collectibles completing challenges or playing with cops the game just does not explain these mechanics which it should

the next suprising fact is that this game will not give you anything for free and will not make it easy for you especially in terms of money even at lowest difficulty dont expect to be able to buy even a single spare car the money is scarse at the beginning and first few hours you will be constantly racing against much more powerful opponents if you like challenges this game is for you if you dont go play forza horizon or some other openworld racing game

what else is oldschool about this game well the story the story is there but you can ignore it completely it doesnt matter as there is nothing interesting no real plot twists and to be honest all characters are just really dumb and have no sense of logic but all of this does not matter because its a racing game and what is most important in this genre driving gameplay

unbound gives you an option to choose from drift or grip unfortunately to make either of these to work properly you have to move the handling slider to at least 40 this creates a problem for beginners as pretty much all cars have handling set right between drift and grip so your car will not grip if you want it to grip and will not drift if you want it to drift this kind of handling really sucks and i wanted to throw away my gamepad multiple times because my car suddenly decided to turn on drifting mechanics for which i was not prepared and i ended up crashing simply put cars with neutral handling are very twitchy and unpredictable but once you choose to go fully grip or drift this kind of behaviour will mostly disappear but not always and you will be rewarded with a pretty fun gameplay i especially like the burst boosts  too bad the game will not explain to you how it works you have to figure it out yourself

what about the citymap well i like the presence of a few straight roads  something we have not seen for a long time in nfs series if ever other than that the map is not exactly large and does not really offer anything special or memorable even after finishing the story and starting my 2nd playthrough on hardest difficulty i constantly have no idea where i am and where to go i keep opening the map and using navigation all the time because i just have no idea this is kinda strange as there are only a few meetup locations and safehouses

graphics and soundmusic  graphics is okay i guess im not the kind of guy who bashes devs about lack of details or ugly graphics as long as it looks fine but i do kinda have a problem with popping road textures sometimes sounds are okay nothing special although for some reason the engine sounds have way lower volume than the rest of the game so make sure to bump it up to 100 and lower everything else to 50 music is trap i thing it kinda fits the overall comix theme but in my opinion this kind of music should only play in menus and garages just like in nfsu2 for racing i want something energetic and fast

story mode  yes you have to grind a lot there are high buyins sometimes up to 50 of the 1st place prizemoney and there are cops everywhere and pretty much after every 2nd race but the races are usually short and a lot of fun if only there would be more diversity between races as there are only 3 kinds of races  races takeovers and drifts two of them are not very viable if you go full grip tune so that kinda sucks i would like to see some knockouts hot pursuit events or milestones and some other possible variations at least the map is full of short events that kinda substitute this but you always do these alone 

tldr
pros
some good ideas cop spotting daynight cycles
fun gameplay once you understand it
two ways of driving grip  drift
challenging if you like those
collectibles and short events
runs pretty well and i have not seen any bugs or glitches apart from the road textures issue well one year after the game was released
dialogues are kinda fun

cons 
too many cops sometimes
trap music during races
difficult and frustrating driving physics for beginners
popping road textures
story mode is dull with very little diversity
grinding money can be a bit boring
no cutscenes not even intro

all in all i think this is a good game as i had a lot of fun playing even my stepdaughter played it and had so much fun unfortunately it suffers either from a lack of ideas or insufficient developing time and too much focus on zoomers

#####

buy need for speed heat
unbound aint it dawg

#####

story is cringe someone from the studio just went into tik tok and was oh this is what kids do these days and put all the sht  in there 
gameplay is the same as the last 50 nfs games 
kinda fun with friends should cost 5

year 2 of content got announced for unbound as of writing this review were currently fed the audi update a welcomed surprise by criterion i expected this game to die after year 1s meh updates features that shouldve been at launch have been slowly making a way to unbound whoever though is pulling the strings at criterion or ea in typical fashion the best content is locked behind paywalls any crazy illogical carsbodykits designs you want money baby underglow projections glowing rims  license plates  
their current trend has always been a few cars  cosmetics behind the paywall while the free stuff is stuff we dont want it would be fine if we could grind a seasonal pass once and use a currency but nope drop 10 dollars on every seasonal pass 

my biggest disappointment though paywalling hero cars like eddies skyline or the m3 gtr that were b free b in heat 
link to the year 2 roadmap httpswwweacomgamesneedforspeedneedforspeedunboundnewsy2roadmap

despite all the skeletoncrew like structure of updates unbound is my most played modern nfs game purely for the competitive racing tiers in the multiplayer previous games followed the player suping up a car to maximum parts to race wheres the fun in that the tiers s s a a b allow for a variety of meta  nonmeta cars to shine and smoke the competition keep in mind the multiplayer  singleplayer garage progress is separated there is a lack of bots in mp races also

lastly for any of the story enjoyers left in the arcade racing scene this is the only content i do not recommend its shallow and cringe like heat a reused betrayal and revenge story since payback shocker 

h3 elephant in the room h3

 the diverse soundtrack is good if you take your time with it  fits the atmosphere of lakeshore
 the map feels reused from heat and gets kinda boring after a few hours
 the art style is a breath of fresh air and makes the game feel unique
 car list is mostly recycled from heat but it doesnt really bother me
 im convinced we wont get handling like blackbox delivered back then but unbounds is manageable until it isnt
 car customization is still good but the wrap editor feels outdated with certain low resolution decals at max scaling
 the grind for money has been made plentiful  easy do not rage quit like those on crossplay
 i prefer unbound over heat

h1 warning  unbound is prone to corrupt save data h1
u save files are stored locally in usersdocumentsneed for speedtm unboundsavegame  always back it up u
b if you experience this click no on the error message when the ea app is launching the game wait 5 mins b
i if an error message pops up in game also say no close the game  wait 5 mins i

#####

seems unfinished coming from nfs heat and trying this out its embarrassing how lacking it is in content cartoon effects does not make the experience any better played it with my free 10 hour test from ea play and i want a refund for something free couldnt imagine paying the full price for this sh

#####

nfs heat is better than nfs unbound


























#####

how many years ive waited for this moment to play weeb for speed

#####

the good the bad  the mess

the good
 great graphics kept similar to heat
 upgrading system slightly improved upon
 good car pool
 vehicle durability increased at least youre no longer getting wrecked extremely fast like in heat
 gas stations for vehicle repair have a cooldown 4 minutes and are no longer limited to 3 uses per session amazing one

the bad
 the majority of body modifications feel like a stepdown from heat
 general cornering is a joke  cars either oversteer or understeer big time and there are few options of tweaking that because the handling settings that affect downforce  grip levels also affect your cars actual power  so if you upgrade your car to the maximum power allowed for that bracket and you wanna tweak it later on you might push your cars power over that bracket thus you gotta change a lot of pieces again
 drifting is a joke  its extremely hard to keep the speed through corners cars arent very slidy and lose control extremely fast and have a tendency to rotate on all gripdrift levels
 some power upgrades do nothing to vehicles check mclaren f1  default engine engine upgrades do not increase the powerspeedaccel etc  imagine buying a 12mil car and realizing that its bugged and stuck to stock
 there are fewer ramps long jumps and are harder to spot
 the new collectible bears are extremely hard to spot compared to heat flamingos which glowed a bright pink
 money is a general issue  races reward very little overall profit until you reach the s tier youre essentially forced to use one of the free cars you can obtain in previous tiers but its extremely hard to grind for a desired car


the mess
 handling options are locked to being changed only outside of a race  so if you accidentally forgot to turn off the tapbreak to drift or you want to do a last minute adjustement but you already got into a race well tough luck say goodbye to your buy in especially when its an event with a buy in upwards of 60k
 it still makes no sense that lesser engines have a higher potential treshold compared to higher engine see mclaren f1 where an i6 or a v8 have  a bigger treshold than a v12
 game progression and timegating is confusing af  it gives a certain vibe that youre being rushed but then it feels like its extremely slow
 80 of the game represents cop chases  cops do not reward anything when ramming them and you only get a little money when escaping a chase based on your heat level up to 5k  or so at level 5 heat which is a a joke considering you spend between 1 and 30 minutes in a chase
 ai rubberbanding is a joke  some cars can get you a distance upwards of 2km to the second place and the ai gets no rubberbanding help other times the ai somehow gets a 3000 accelspeed boost while its already 200m in front of you
 limited race restarts  this is some next level joke just let me restart my dn single player game however many times i want
 you cannot turn off the car effects  there used to be some news flying around before launch dont know if confirmed by ea or not that you could turn off the car vfx wings circles etc  you cannot
 palace edition cars aare unlockable but they are not free  the games page does not state they are free but considering that the heat ones were free it wouldve made sense to get them as such instead you get 5 vehicles that need to be unlocked through progression and cost money to buy money which is really hard to get so you pay extra 10 for some cars which youll probably never buy if youre not into that particular car

#####

i dont really know what to say here i played this game for a decent bit and i just wasnt feeling it at all i loved heat and this just feels like such a downgrade compared to that game the stakes arent as strong the music has gotten even worse and the story is just meh maybe its just a me issue but this game feels like its trying so hard to be hip and cool with da kidz that it completely misses the mark in making an actually good game a real shame as heat had built some great groundwork and just needed a better story well i guess until the next game then

#####

how do you do fellow kids the video game

#####

so ive completed this game and overall ill say i wouldnt recommend people to buy this game though it has some good points to it like
 art style
 some of the customization options like you can color the headlights and windows and darken your tail lights is a nice improvement over nfs heat
 music is also better than nfs heat however its still not great

now the bad parts which make the game barely playable
 at random moments your controller will just stop working for a couple seconds where you cant use your keyboard either so prepare to get busted by police if that happens
 the ai cheats in single player if youre ahead theyll sometimes be going 500 kmh and catch up instantly
 they removed the numbers in the color picker when customizing your car so you cant look up a color you did before and recreate the same color
 theres a lot less variation in the races than in nfs heat
 theres no offroad races anymore the only offroad is solo smashing things and get a score for doing so
 the cars you unlock by playing the single player campaign are also horrendous looking
 cars suddenly flying up in the air in multiplayer
 textures glitching out or go missing sometimes it glitches so hard that there needs to be a seizure warning when that happens
 other players cars driving upsidedown after they crashed in multiplayer
 no multiplayer clans anymore
 no multiplayer time trials either where you can compete against others in your clan
 you cant adjust the handling of your car anymore while in a race nor while driving like you could in nfs heat
 random frame drops after playing for a bit
 sometimes after you land from a jump youre put to a complete stop midrace
 at times your boost makes your car go in a 90degree turn and slams you straight into a wall
 multiplayer invites blocking nearly everything important when tuning cars not being able to click them away without having to exit out of nearly every menu
 sometimes in single player i just have 5 cop cars spawn around me making avoiding them nearly impossibleannoying in order to get anywhere it sometimes takes 15 mins to drive from one end to the other in order to get to a race
 you cant swap cars anymore once out of your garage only at the race events are you able to and only after completing said race
 cant sell parts anymore either so if you make a mistake or trying something out youre punished for doing so and you get  all back for selling your car
 you also get less cash for races so in combination with the previous point this makes the game more grindy than previous ones

all in all id say overall nfs heat is the better experience

and for anyone wondering these are my pc specs
cpu amd ryzen 7 5800x
ram corsair vengeance 16gb 3000mhz
gpu nvidia geforce rtx 3070
game drive samsung 960 evo nvme ssd 500gb
monitor 1440p 60hz
game settings high

if youre primarily interested in multiplayer save yourself the 70 dollars and pick up nfs heat instead its frequently 80 off and provides a much better multiplayer experience

unbound runs on the same engine as heat and 2015 allowing it to build upon the success of its predecessors car handling has been improved with options to meaningfully tune your car to drift or grip handling the old hybrid mode is still present where all cars default to grip physics and switch to drift physics when you brake in a turn but this can now be disabled to keep your car behaving like you tuned it

graphics look good but are nothing spectacular environments and cars are detailed and welltextured for what detail and texture youll see when driving past them at 100 miles per hour performance is somewhat lacking for the graphical fidelity on offer my system specs are slightly above the recommended specs and i struggled to maintain 60 fps on medium at 1440p

car selection performance customization and visual customization are inherited from its predecessors if youre familiar with what was available in heat and 2015 youll get the same thing here albeit with a few additional options such as a dozen different paint materials instead of just matte gloss and metallic

single player and multiplayer are entirely separate modes they do not share any progress and they do not have feature parity multiplayer is laughably barebones compared to single player and feels like an unfinished early access title

gripes with the multiplayer experience
list
missing advertised features cops ai opponents weekly event schedule race betting and the story itself are all absent in multiplayer
lack of polish the ui is serviceable but feels unfinished eg when in a party your party members are displayed in gray boxes across the top of the screen all the time in races in menus in photo mode iin loading screensi its not interactible its not dynamic it never shows anything but their name and platform its just there like a debug menu in an unfinished game
playlists are stupid multiplayer races are organized into playlists of 3 races each you cant start a specific race you have to start a playlist want to practice your favorite track too bad you have to race two other unrelated tracks with it every time
ranks are stupid cars and races are organized into ranks you can only use a car in races with the same rank installed a turbo that nudges your car from a rank to a rank too bad youve locked that car out of all a ranked races youll get a generic loaner if you enter a race with a different rank if theres a car you like better buy 5 of them and upgrade them all to different ranks so you can use it iin the playlists that have a different rank for each racei
lack of races multiplayer has a total of 30 playlists spread across the 5 ranks if you dont have 5 of the same car spread across these ranks or god forbid your car starts in the highest rank that means youre stuck with 6 playlists
lack of opponents theres 16 players in a lobby most have one or two cars and will stick to the 6 playlists matching their cars rank once theyre in a race they have to do three races in a row before they can join another theres no ai opponents all that combined means youll rarely get more than 2 opponents for a playlist
lack of progression cars and upgrades arent unlocked by winning races theyre unlocked by completing tedious challenges and having lots of money lowest rank playlists pay out 20k highest pay out 30k theres a payout multiplier that scales with the number of opponents but its useless see previous gripe starter cars are 35k upgrades can be 100k high end cars are 15m youre going to be doing those same 6 playlists over and over band overb
recycled assets if you played heat and 2015 youve already seen 90 of the cars and upgrades available in this game its actually impressive how lacking the multiplayer is considering how much of it feels copypasted from previous titles
needlessly wastes your time the playlists are not spread around the map theyre concentrated in 6 locations the races iarei spread around and you return to free roam where the last race in the playlist ends did i not mention free roam it exists solely to waste your time the only thing you can do in it is set speed trap records and drive to playlists theres no fast travel want to grind that branked playlist with your starter car the one that has the cool track you like you have to drive all the way across the map from where the race ended to where the playlist starts every time and also do the other two unrelated races in the playlist along with it
list

thats a lot of gripes for 4 hours of playtime those 4 hours werent very fun and in that time i could do all of the races the multiplayer has to offer and see that everything else was just grind if you like racing and want to race with other people nfs unbound makes it very difficult to enjoy stick with heat instead i hear project unite makes heat even better

#####

cops make it very very  hard to enjoy the game  i cant drive one block without cop cars spawning in everywhere and choppers flying all around me all i want to do is race and build cars  grind and make some cash  but with that my heat level goes up  which is fine  but the cops makes it impossible  even if you lose them  they just spawn a 100 more around you so you have to do it all over again god damn it pisses me off ill spend 10 min in a race and 2 hours trying to just get to a safehouse

#####

free weekend and i still feel robbed

#####

disclaimer recommend you buy on sale andor wait for unite mod
here are the basics

handling is objectively better than heat it actually works instead of the only method to taking the corner was to mash the ebrake and then nitro away
1st place is usually not always requirednecessary to proceed
nextgen port means the load times are really good sort of depends on your rig though
nitrous model is better than heat but not as good as black box
car customizing is marginally improved over previous titles
game is very pretty and ive not had any optimization issues or crashes
rivals actually feel like theyre part of the world think prostreet but to the next level the banter dialogue could use some additions though
car durability is no longer the equivalent of wet cardboard
the game world actually feels lived in
gas station repairs are infinitely better than heat
helicopters will frigg off after escaping once or twice

now for the negatives buckle up
story is passable dialogue is really cringey
sense of speed is anemic feels like a mobile game
drifting is nigh uncontrollable nor smooth
drift tuning is pointless as are drift races
money takes forever to accrue
nitrous does next to nothing for the player just feels like pushing ax generates camera effects
nitrous takes half an hour to recharge forcing the reliance on tap nitro from stunts is aggravating to no end
like 2025 car slots are once again wasted on convertibles
143 cars is cool wish i could actually use some of them
early game is really fun but passing week 2 turns the game into a slog its like an mmo were its fun at first but then it just becomes a chore after you get to the good stuff
multiplayer was a big fumble the model in payback was one of the few things they got right
police dialogue may as well be replaced with greta thunberg past heat 2 how dare you try and play an event game places 35 cops almost directly in front of you or your objective
police are much too populous as soon as you get into escape cooldown it will spawn like 4 more around you with godlevel omnipresence
police will still see you through cover when hiding even with your engine off and not in the escape stage
if you get into a chase at heat 3 or higher you might as well clear your schedule for the rest of the day
shimizu is literally just a forza npc the moment his name card says 1st he will rubber band away and your only chance of catching him is hoping that rng screws him with traffic 
the soundtrack has no variety
eas goal with the soundtrack was admirable but it seems like the game only plays about 10 of the tracks

i think unbound is a product of much care and effort from criterion its an objective improvement over the post2015 entries they certainly seem to have taken a lot of the criticisms from older titles and generally fixed them but it is just that and objective improvement all of the individual pieces are better than before but the puzzle still doesnt quite fit together only problem is that you were so enamored with the art on the box that it took you halfway through assembly before you realized something was up

i chose this over the callisto protocol i am wondering if maybe  bought the wrong game

#####

the game itself is ok it could be better but just dont buy it at full price 70 wait for a sale when its 50 or more

#####

50 hours in here is the good the bad  the ugly
the good
a true return to the old days of 2000s nfs fun and cars an incredible selection of cars sure to hit home for any generations nfs fan manual gears i cant believe this took so f#king long to readd into a racing game it never made sense to have it removed and turned 2010s hot pursuit into a depressing and waste of money for any classic nfs racer the fact ferrari the most notoriously difficult brand to agree to feature cars in arcade racers is here also speaks volumes

the bad
it has annoying unskippable dialog that overrides  lower normal game audio a lot i found the only way to fix it was to set speech to 0 however this means you will miss all dialog and you can find youself in a few circumstances without context this way but its still better than unskippable voice overs and random new  radio chatter 

some of the late game races have bugs that can be frustrating were you can win then by a tiny margin at high speed if you are online the game may register the 2nd place car as the winner instead of you even know you physically see you car cross the line first

the police can also be easily beat with simple mapworldbuilding geometry tricks 

the ugly
the crash physics game code stupidly engineered it forces upon you a bugger at best fake crash for almost any impact above 100kmph you can have the tiniest glancing blows yet your car will enter a 3rd person view and be forcefully flipped in a manor totally disconnected from the type of glancing blow you had this forces you back to 2nd gear speeds and often directly in the line of fire of your opponents who then smash into you causing a second or 3rd crashflip yet you can smash head on at 350kmph into a cop and their car gracefully looses all physical weight and lifts up out of your way allowing you to continue at the same full speed 



#####

to be honest this game is alright but its lacking its content 
only found 56 songs to be finedecent other songs are just cringe 
but its quite unfinished theres nothing much to do after completing story mode except for multiplayer ig
this game is definitely not worth 70  
i bought it for 25 but still i would rather spend my money on something else
if you wanna play this game then play with mods theyll make your game experience much better

#####

wtf have you done ea as an idiot who preordered this thing i would like to say something

1you really fked with preordered players can you believe that 40 off just after a month the game released who would dare to preorder ea games again after this and theres more just after 20 days the 40off ended you came up a 50 off sale you aholes are addicted in fking with players or something
2another thing about money did ea gone crazy about earning dirty cash from us you know the m3 gtr right the most famous car in nfs history you will not able to get it in single player mode and you have to have ea play membership to own it access the right to purchase it this aint over yet you know what they will repossess the damn car when you lost your membership including the ones you bought from dealership without refund
3 speaking of the ingame economy system as we all know its very hard to earn money in this game even you are late in the game walkthrough every s race will able to earn 100k with side bet but take the most expensive car in game for example how much the car cost 3 million and you know you might not easily win an s race dont you i believe everyone knows that that green ferrari is very disgusting aint it plus if you are a fan of those weak cars in game just like me who is a huge fan of crown vics its even difficult for you to win even you are in relaxed mode plus i dont know who the hell limited the times we restart is all this should be allowed in an arcade racing game
4driving physics issues i dont who designed this handing but whoever did this is an absolutely ahole for example i was turning on the interstate in a grip tuned rwd car crown vic when you reached 34 of the turn the car is losing control around this time if you pedal to the metal you might spin but if you stepped on the brakes and turn the steering to the opposite direction which is the right way to stop rwd car spinning in real life youll most likely unable to correct your position and ended up in woods at the side of the road a smart short man once said understeer works like you drive down the road you turned the wheel but the car goes straight on crashed into a tree and you died oversteer works like you drive down the same bit of road but the back of the car comes around and you go off the road crashed into a tree and you die so heres the problem who the hell of earth that deserved to crash into a real tree and die made this weird handling combined understeer and oversteer
5 game bugs and logic problem first when you start a race your car might stunk into the ground i have seen many times that when the race is loaded everyones car bounced up from the ground and i have heard that a friend of mine had lots of bugs during gameplay with his rtx20 series gpu tire smoke problem unloadable map mosaics plants and so on and the crash judgement is really weird a tiny scratch with a civilian vehicle will crash your car the game is making the same fault as they did in nfs 2015 its physics is not as exciting as burnout paradise and it will make you fell you had a high blood pressure issue the reset is also weird in previous games you will respawn at the spped you crash but in this game you will always respawn at the speed of 50mph how to win after this reset if you are in a highway race plus the lakeshore pd really should watch their mouth  its professional cops unlike nfs heat so the police scanner dialogues should be professional just like previous games the cop dialogues make me feel like these guys are street punks rather that professional officers it really ruined a cop fans game experience
6 car issues just like previous ghost nfs games the american cogs came out of dertoit michigan will never win a race but also those japanese imports also doesnt work in high level races its like straight telling you dont try zero to hero thing it wont work okay now you started to buy a hyper car for high level races and heres the game car level logic issue you used a trash trans on a hyper car and put it in low level races so the guys driving cars for low level races got their game experiences ruined moreover whats wrong with the significant of many cars something like  r826dett 49 liter ford modular v8  392 cui srt hellcat they are all wrong
7 world map issue the design inside the city of lakeshore is good but when you reached the countryside theres really not too much to play with only the quarry the skiing raceway and the old nascar circuit might be interesting for the rest lets compare with the map of watch dogs  which is also based on chicago illinois which is much more interesting to drive around the main reason is that the city map is too small chicago in watch dogs is much livelier
8vehicle modifications i cant tell which is more unable to be tolerated is auto zone ricer kits or parts that is in the game files but unavailable in game especially those body kits any problems with the supercharger for 67 camaro ks body kit for polestar 1 bakusoku body kit for datsun 240z  especially the kit for the datsun it even appeared in the trailer 
but it ended up as an ai domestic kit whats wrong with you ea
9original soundtrack i don t really wanna judge it the only thing i can say i like the soundtrack style from the old criterion games such as hot pursuit 2010 or most wanted 2012 maybe im too old for these type of music in game i prefer to listen to los santos rock radio from grand theft auto 5 ah by the way the ost in this game is probably the worst one according to youtube comments
10online multiplayer whats wrong with the anticheat system according to the fried of mine his single player game files broken because he wants to drive police car in single player yeah your system prevented him but for those who are still using infinite nitro and countless of online hacks they can even do head start before countdown what have you prevented some people said the multiplayer havent been done but in my opinion it not even 40 finished first its the way to start the race unlike heat all the races are pvp races if there isnt enough players you are even unable to start the god damn race and its good that the players who are not involved are unable to be seen but the civilian cars are the same as free roam so if there are boring players are using civilian cars to set up a roadblock or something you are as good as dead moreover to unlock some cars in game you have to crash other players hard am i playing burnout paradise plus the low performance level hyper cars i mentioned before in this terrible pvp environment its hard to earn money make the separate of online and single player even more annoying ps i am in great concern of the news of this game its heard that they will update a mode just for crashing i hope the gaming environment will be better
conclusion the god damn game worth only 10 bucks dont buy it until you get enough discount xd


#####

this game would have been fun police respawns to your disadvantage and way all over the place choppers knows exactly where you are ai opponents do perfect runs and impossible corners geeez let the player have some fun

#####

after putting in way too many hours into this game half of which was spent in dragged out slogs called cop chases and giving it more chances than it deserves ive come to the conclusion that any nfs fan should just stick with heat for now

characters arent even deserving of being called caricatures or even just stereotypes they and their drama is that bland

much like in heat the game is very very grind heavy only because of the buyin system you end up with even less money than what you got in heat making it even slower

separating cars into tiers seems like a good idea on paper but it ends up creating moments of frustration where youve invested hours into upgrading a car only to learn that not only are you still struggling to win but that you cant upgrade any further without going up a tier creating an annoying balancing act while also rendering some cars completely useless

cop chases while not as aggressive and tanky as they are in heat are still very frustrating to deal with due to just how many there are and how stupidly hard it is to outrun em i dont care what universe youre from an armoured truck shouldnt be able to effortlessly keep up with a 2019 bugatti chiron sport

meanwhile in the inverse of the above problem the ai is stupidly tough even on the games easy difficulty outpacing you effortlessly unless your care is tuned to perfection and you dont crash even once which is very hard to do when you can come out of a corner and have a semitruck kamikaze itself right into you even if you arent even going half your top speed  the smallest collision is enough to send you tumbling and knocked back several spaces even with a solid lead

all in all nfs unbound doesnt even feel like its two steps forward one step back kind of deal and more like a one step forward sidestep into a ditch kind of deal stick with heat if you want to actually enjoy yourself and skip out on unbound unless you want to some reason deal with the aforementioned frustrations

#####

somehow this manages to be the best and worst need for speed game play at your own risk

#####

bought it yesterday for 70 bucks
today its 35
fck my life

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on nfs and it gets 75 likes and 30 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 1 kilo of lemon  so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

ii am a long time need for speed fan long as in i actually started with the very first the need for speed you can tell why this series has a special place in my hearth ive stopped caring about it mainly because it lost its true identity throughout the years i get it forza horizon is a successful game but thats not what need for speed is supposed to be dont get me wrong unbound is still mostly off tracks but in an era where arcade racing games have become child material for how easy they are its surprisingly refreshing to see it going in a complete different direction sure you got retries in this game but they are limited within the day plus theyre not giving you 50 cars per minute like in forza horizon the burst nos mechanic adds a completely new gameplay layer and finally both drift and grip builds are viable i couldnt care less for the story or for the terrible soundtrack my recommendation is to mute dialogues and music just put some old need for speed ost in the background with spotify youll enjoy the game much more again unbound is not the need for speed i was hoping for but it certainly looks like a step in the right direction last but definitely not least the anime style is actually quite unique and good looking i had no idea i would like it but hey its nicei

#####

respect to the police men and women who lay their own lives and the lives of pedestrians on the line in order to catch some random straightpiped 2002 honda accord

#####

honestly do not recommend this game what so ever some of the points i dont like

 exremely short story line 
 no first person view
 stupid bear collection around the map
 bad physics
 annoying dialog
 no auction house or proper performance upgrades

i had purchased this game palace edition from steam to the hype it was getting at launch however its extremely overrated nor did i even get any of my palace edition perks if you want to play a good need for speed game go play carbon dont waste your time or heard earned money on any of these new need for speed games they do not do justice nor will need for speed ever be the same

h1bstockholm syndromebh1
quoteilakeshore is a city of young street racers who are not understood by society and the mayor of the city wants to stop them at all costs you are a talented driver with the potential to become a legend but your friend has betrayed you and you must start from scratch will you be able to rebuild your reputation and beat your rivaliquote

h2storyh2
i hoped there would be a better story than in nfs 2016 but there isnt its just a very average plot about betrayal revenge and reunion i can describe it in a few words someone is talking about something im disappointed because i expected more i know its funny to expect a story from need for speed but you know what i mean i would like to see more from the aaa game than what they served up if it was an indie game i would be fine with it maybe im not the target audience but i think ea and criterion games can do better

h2gameplayh2
the story is divided into four weeks during each week you must accumulate enough money and have the right car to qualify for a big race on the seventh day each day is divided into daytime and nighttime as soon as you leave a garage you can enter any race that is available to you you can choose from sprints circuits drifts or my favourite takeovers where you have to combine drifting jumping and smashing green objects fences cons after each race you will receive a heat level my advice dont get more than two heat levels during the day because the next night will be harder for you to enter a race you will need a few bucks for the buyout if you fail you will lose money but not all races are risky in many you can still win some cash if you finish second third or even fourth there are also side bets that can help you win more by betting on a driver you think you will overtake during the race

so money is not a problem in the game but the cops are they can be very annoying thanks to their stupid respawn and their hunger to catch you if your heat level is less than one you are fine but if it goes up you have a problem cops will chase you even if you park your car close to the road and turn off the engine when they see you police pursuits are not instantly aggressive but the more heat you get the less time you have to hide and more and stronger police cars will spawn around you and the path you set in the navigation so keep an eye on the minimap to avoid trouble if you are arrested you will lose any money you have won in day or night races cash is banked only when you return to one of your garages one more tip if you get annoyed by the cops and want to make a quick getaway just leave the game in the main menu your car will reset to the city and you can continue  

also there are only a few races after ten hours or so it starts to get repetitive the map is big so why dont devs use it to its full potential but i like systems of meetups where you have to go if you want to start an event it looks more natural than just a flag in the middle of the road you can preview your opponents and it has a good streetracing vibe

another issue is the handling of the cars i think its better than in nfs 2016 or heat but its still strange you dont feel the true weight of the car sometimes you get weird cornering or the car starts to drift when you dont want it to and vice versa you can tune the car to get more grip or to drift but it is still not good of course i dont expect a handling system from the forza horizon series but come on developers you can do better

h2audiovisualh2
like many other gamers i was very sceptical about the cartoongraffiti effects that a car produces instead of real tyre smoke or exhaust flames after a few hours of playing i can say that they fit the game perfectly and you will like them they give you visual information about how much nitrous you have left or if you destroy a police car you will be notified by emoticons popping up above the roof of your car tyre smoke also looks good during a drift you wont believe me but theres one thing i would like to see in forza horizon there is no annoying flashing effect when you pass a speed camera or zone just a popup on the hud showing how fast you passed the radar this is a better solution than a big white flash like a flashbang

overall the games visuals are good but inconsistent sometimes you find weird things like bush models and textures from the playstation 2 era or very simple object physics the car sounds are wellmade and you can adjust the exhaust in the garage timbre treble tone bass overrun pop and banks and forced induction turbo or compressor volume this would be nice in forza horizon too

to my surprise the game also has a good soundtrack i heard a lot of people complaining about it but i think it is wellmixed there are different artists from 25 countries like poland ukraine france germany and others i found a few tracks annoying but overall the soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game well and i have added a few songs to my spotify playlist

h2multiplayerh2
i also tried the multiplayer and i must say i enjoyed it pvp is rough but free roaming is fun you can fool around with cops or join linkup which is like forzathon in forza horizon in a designated area you have to complete missions such as driving as fast as possible jumping in circles drifting using nitrous destroying cop cars and so on if you and other players are successful you can obtain good money if you lose cops pursuits are much easier here than in singleplayer you can also change part of the day from morning to night which is nice each player can choose what they prefer one thing that would be nice to add is the ability to use cars from a multiplayer garage in the story because cars you buy in multiplayer are not available in single player and you have to buy them again for money that you only earn during the story or free roam after completing it

h2conclusionh2
bthis game is like stockholm syndrome i hate it during the prologue but later i start to enjoy it yes the story is average and the handling is still weird but the car list models customisations and sounds are very good the game also has its style thanks to the graffiti effects and cartoon characters despite all the cons i can still recommend the game to you i think it is a little better than nfs 2016 i hope that the next need for speed will be something more rumours say it will be a remake of most wanted so i keep my fingers crossedb

h1introh1
i got to say after pretty much disliking all of ghost games need for speeds this was a welcome surprised despite what people are saying this is definitely an improvement over previous games including nfs heat while this game is not worth the price its asking it is worth playing

h1prosh1
the map is much better sure its still a backdrop to the racing but the map is way more detailed and is much more fun to drive around it felt like thought and personality was put into it and the added pedestrians is a big factor in that
the day and night system is arguable better i dont understand why heats was praised so much because as much as night was good fun day sucks so fucking bad having legal street races was easily the most boring part about heat now in nfs unbound you have illegal street races in day and night much better because in a nfs game i want to do illegal street racing with cops which nfs unbound has at all times
cops are way better they feel more human and its actually a viable option to battle them because your car isnt some weak piece of shit like in nfs heat
the soundtrack is still better than nfs heat iand you cant change my mind on thati
the boost system is becoming one of my favorite in racing having a regular boost with a powershot type boost that has to be built up and used before it depletes adds a lot of needed depth in the mechanic
race courses having multiple routes is a much welcomed change instead of the strict one route races of other games

h1consh1
the story and characters are so awful like you can get better nfs fan fictions than this crap
while grip handling was improved drifting now suffers guys how hard is it to make two separate handling models like what blackbox stop this stupid slider system for handling that doesnt work
the artstyle mismatch between the anime effectscharacters to the realistic open worldvehicles is not great while the game graphically looks much better than previous entries they should have went fully with the anime style instead of this weird middle ground that feels unfinished
while many physics improvements were made the vehicles suspensions are now made out of jelly which can throw off your car really badly over bumpy surfaces
this game is still not worth 70 which honestly is an damn insult considering how garbage this series has been in recent times i dont care if this is next gen only no racing game is worth 70 especially nfs definitely get this on sale

h1final thoughtsh1
is this the next generation nfs we were hoping for sadly not really being this games development was hampered by the team being pulled to do battlefield 2024 however this is the most fun ive had with a nfs in a long time i hope nfs can pull itself out of the hole it dug itself into because this is a much needed step in the right direction

just remember to get this on sale and youll be in for an enjoyable ride

this game has good gameplay graphics car customization like you can do ford crown victoria unmarked
and police is easy even heat 5 because i have played this game 225 hours and i always run away from them
this game is has the best nfs map in my opinion better than heat and payback
bconsb
 no daynight cycle
 no cutscenes
 grinding money is boring like doing the same event to get some money

h2progressh2 ithe progress in this game is different from heat and payback qualifiersi
each event takes place at the end of weeks one two and three with the fourth week being the grand
 qualifier 1 tier a buyin 20000
rewards 40000 and land rover defender 110 legendary custom

 qualifier 2 tier a buyin 50000

 qualifier 3 tier s buyin 100000
rewards 200000 and nissan gtr premium legendary custom

 qualifier 4 tiers a a s s buyin 200000
rewards 1000000
the start of the game youll have to choose which car you prefer
 dodge charger rt
 lamborghini countach
 nissan silvia ks
after that you will win the car you chose in qualifier 4 and with legendary custom

bphoto modeb iin this game is bad unlike paybacki
 no filters
 no depth of field
 no focal distance
 no bodywork damage
 no dirt this makes the car clean in payback
and the effects always ruin the photo

not the worst game out there but certainly not good either 

the visuals are somewhat distracting but the visual style and design of the game arent all that bad 
the real reason i havent found the interest to finish it is because of the way the gameplay is designed it follows an extremely narrow linear scheduled race system where you have some number of races you can complete in a day and once its done thats it along with this whatever heat  you rack up during the day continues into the night which not to mention there is apparently a need for limited retries on a race all these factors make the game an absolute chore
to summarize think gta but you cant fight back and you always have cops on you  

i dont know if i will get around to finishing this or not but probably best to save yourself from this dilemma altogether

aap rocky said he was proud of me 

#####

i paid 60 bucks for this game i put in about 87 hours so far

nfs unbound has similar mechanics that older games used to have stuff like side bets etc and limited restarts which i find really keep you on your toes however with all these systems in place it means level design and traffic and cops are that much more infuriating when they get in your way but i was surprised how infrequent it was this game brings back some of the high stakes most wanted vibes it makes you sweat and when you make it back to the garage with lots of cash it feels great

customization is similar the same as heat and the devs listened to the communitys feedback about many shortcomings the game had at launch online is starting to feel more alive but it does have some more work ahead 

the story will make you laugh but honestly its enough of an excuse to keep running from the cops day in day out 
the weekly cycle is an interesting choice for the single player but it would be nice if it extended past endgame a little more

nfs unbound is not the greatest racing game ever but it took a lot of what made nfs heat good and built on it though i find it needs a script i found to run without crashing i can actually leave it here it really made my experience much better at launch httpsgithubcomoctanium91nfs_heat_cpu_load_fix

laughably i like this game because it offers everything that forza horizon does not money actually matters and i appreciate the grind 

i drive manual with the paddles on my controller but it would be nice if they allowed you to change the mapping without modding the game

for 26 bucks if you ever enjoyed any nfs game in your life its worth it 

edit the soundtrack is basically worse than nfs heat if thats even possible

#####

my favorite part was when aap rocky said its need for speeding time and proceeded to need for speed all over the place

#####

i am a long time need for speed fan long as in i actually started with the very first the need for speed its one of my favorite franchise ive played the game competitively for many years and thanks to carbon i even got the pleasure to go the united states for the world cyber games grand final you can tell why this series has a special place in my hearth ive stopped caring about it mainly because it lost its true identity throughout the years i get it forza horizon is a successful game but thats not what need for speed is supposed to be dont get me wrong unbound is still mostly off tracks but in an era where arcade racing games have become child material for how easy they are its surprisingly refreshing to see it going in a complete different direction sure you got retries in this game but they are limited within the day plus theyre not giving you 50 cars per minute like in forza horizon the burst nos mechanic adds a completely new gameplay layer and finally both drift and grip builds are viable i couldnt care less for the story or for the terrible soundtrack my recommendation is to mute dialogues and music just put some old need for speed ost in the background with spotify youll enjoy the game much more again unbound is not the need for speed i was hoping for but it certainly looks like a step in the right direction last but definitely not least the anime style is actually quite unique and good looking i had no idea i would like it but hey its nice

#####

nfs heat is better

#####

need 4 speed more like wait 4 sale 

70 overall you are paying 10 dollars for no increase in game play with a short overall storysingle player it only took 25 hours or less to beat the entire game did they not have the ability to create more races the pool of races is very short and youll be replaying races none stop with an anticlimactic final race the control of certain cars is also off as you can read through many reviews i had a 1000hp viper and it would constantly randomly just turn 45 degrees into a wall real fun last comment on the game they couldnt add some type of mode where you can play as the cops

personally i do not recommend this game at full price

#####

this game gives me 2005 mw vibes for some reason the animated effect is also cool dont know why it gets so much hate i find it unique and pretty fun its enjoyable so far

#####

last time i played nfs carbon and nfs shift and since then the nfs series seemed dead to me 
well after finishing story mode of nfs unbound i must say this was quite challenging and for real good game which  leaves good impressions 
75 of 10 
i
long story short if you liked nfs undeground series most wanted and etc  this is theirs successor but more challenging 

what i liked
cars tuning and upgrade system
cars behavior the sense of speed the game gives
sound
art and style graphics
it runs good on steam deck

what i didnt like
narrow amount of different tracks
no fast travel

neutral
difficulty
poor open world  
story 
music 


story
one more story in a row of stories how to lose it all and get it all back in a month but there are  story script characters whose traits and motivations are clear and revealed as the plot progresses the screenwriter had the main task of making the characters come alive and i think it worked out you will remember the characters and distinguish them which is already an achievement for a racing game but this game is mostly about gameplay so

gameplay
quite repetitive but it gives you good feeling of your progress and mastering the game youll have 4 chapters weeks each chapter consists of 5 episodes days each of wich is divided in two sessions daytime and nighttime at the end of each chapter theres chapter finale of 3 or 4 races with a car of requied class
main goals of each week are to earn money and prepare a car of requied class for weeks finale and win in it each session is a open world gameplay with limited amount of different races for cars of different classes there youll find simple circut races standart races and its variations like corner king 2 types of drift races and long endurance races 
and there the developers introduced a number of restrictions that make the game quite difficult and unfriendly from the very beginning of the game
 difficulty prepare to suffer the first quarter of the game youre just surviving  dont even think about exiting your garage on stock car great chance you wont be able to hit top 5 invest every penny you have in upgrading your car opponents are tough at first it is very difficult to take at least some top place with a tangible cash prize i even had to reduce the difficulty level to minimum and even so it was very difficult to reach prize place at the same time in previous nfs games i easily played on hard and did not have such a challenge
  money there will always be a shortage of money the situation changes a little towards the end of the game but you still have to live to see it you need money to pay for participation in races expensive spare parts garage upgrades and cars the further you are from first place the less you will earn and maybe you will not earn anything or go into the red there is also the betting system where you can bet that you will overtake a racer of your choice which helps you hedge your results but if you lose you lose that money too
 heat almost every race you take grants you heat level witch upgrades police agression and cars raising risks of being arrested at maximal 5th level police is almost everywhere and start chasing you in seconds they see you with upgrades you can reduce the time of being recognized but it costs money which is already so little 
 car class and upgrades you raise car class by upgrading it or buying new car of higher class in stock you can use car only of those class the race require 
you should upgrade wisely and keep track of the cars class during the upgrade so as not to jump into the next class and thus lose opportunity to take races
 limited amount of restarts yeah now you can restart limited times a day so save restarts for the most expensive races in some tracks you will have to go to the end even if you lose in order to get at least a penny since simply leaving the event will cost you the entry fee for participation 
so there you have it little money limited restarts  challenging opponents angry cops risk of losing all earned in session  and need to think what car and for whar purpose youre uprading right now once  i spent all my money to upgrade a car that as it turned out after was useless for me it didnt give me boost i was hoping for

as for arcade developers managed give  to player good and exiting driving experience conveying a sense of the cars weight speed and how it handles on the road 
over the course of the game you improve your own skills simultaneously purchasing and upgrading cars and the presence of tracks for different classes of cars in one session gives you diversity the game becomes more interesting and faster with much more higher speeds from the second half
remember you dont need to participate in all races if you have car of requied class youre confident in and enough money just skip  through garages to weeks finale 

graphics and style 
i find the combination of good graphics and cell shading of characters and effects to be very apt and memorable the effects do not interfere with the gameplay and on the contrary additionally give an understanding of the behavior of ones own car and the cars of opponents you will not confuse or forget the graphic design of this game

open world
the game could easily have been implemented without an open world but where would we be nowadays without open worlds 
the map of the city and surrounding area seems large but in reality it does not provide a really wide variety of routes and situations the number of tracks in the story mode is small despite the seemingly great possibilities which is a little boring on the other hand this allows you to learn these routes and fly them over at high speeds in the last stages of the game without knowing the routes you simply wont have time to react  that being said there are many bypasses and hidden passages that could be used for interesting track design solutions but for some reasons they werent 
 used by developers
 the city itself isnt particularly interesting either at the first stages of the game it generally seems to be extinct because there are few cars on the roads by the last stages there are many more cars and to add liveliness they added pedestrians who constantly jump out from under the wheels  but at the same time the entire open world is crammed with various events and collectibles that you can always entertain yourself with on the way from one race to another by the way there is no fast travel in the game which is sometimes frustrating

sound and music
my opinion sound is good and music well you just have to accept that this is todays modern music its not 2004 anymore  and this music suits games artistic design quiet well

#####

if girl bosses brain cancer and tiktok cringe was a video game then this is it

#####

after the october 2023 update the game is unplayable
crashes every 10  15 minutes or so usually at the end of a race 
and the online gameplay is very repetitive once the story is finished very very short story

#####

in new update game freezing every time you play why

#####

no car no bltches













#####

just another nfs arcade racing should name it nfs rubberband or slingshot instead
as always take some lesson from previous game add a bit  new stuffs that works and throw away a lot more old stuff that works
the game is more like annoying than difficult

 visual and performance feels better
 more type of events
 change on heat and cops feels more welcoming to players

 handling feels different again compared to previous game
 nfs cops always known to have very rubberband ai unbound up the game by applying the same level to the rival ai this makes things worse this just add a bit more difficulty by allowing less mess up but also add a lot more luck in the gameplay because the traffic and police spawn can be better in restart
 no ai racer in multiplayer multiplayer is literally unplayable if nobody join and it is not rare that nobody join your race ai racer help the multiplayer game a bit livelier in previous game 
 personally not liking the design forcing players to play in week to play in day and night no quick skip no free roam
 literally lock story behind buy in
 smaller map

#####

i would torture yaz and tess in a shipping container for up to 3 years

#####

to be honest im not going to recommend this to anyone  im not even going to talk about this version and act like it wasnt a need for speed series 

the ea developers start the game with great cut scene and then they force you to play a lot of side quests to continue the story

the whole story mode was only 2 hours and i was doing side quest for 10 hours 

the soundtracks and music of the game were chosen by a tenyearold girl from tik tok 

 the story was very ridiculous and pointless 

b
i saw some people trying to convince you to buy this game in the sale  dont do that and buy need for speed heat instead

a review you should read

lot of complaints about the cops the cops are fine theyre abundant they now come at you during the day as opposed to nfs heat if it was easier then there would just be complaints of how you just go off a ramp or go offroad to lose em all and its boring an earlier nfs game teleportingcheating cops well yeah youre smashing around at 200mph in the later part of the game something has to be done to keep it interesting 

slow money  as it should be at first it seems like youll never have any money to do anything cool but it feels more realisticcanon to what the game is about youre starting from scratch and dont have money for parts and paint youll have plenty of money in the game when you needwant it just learn the game first

game gives you 4 retrys a day on normal difficulty which spans for the day and night cycle i think its great forces you to move forward even if its a loss its a difficulty that again makes the game feel canon to street racing

4 weeks  i like that this games story mode is 4 weeks and each day has different events leading up to the qualifier on the weekend feels better

nfs heat 20  a lot of complaints about the cars being the same and whatnot but theres more and just feels like they expanded on something great even old decals are back with a plethora of new ones

my only gripe would be the repeating of levels sometimes its a night variant or youre now going up it instead of down it maybe now its a higher tier race meaning everyones faster and flying off the rails but its the same race sometimes the only thing i can maybe rebuttal with would be that it does help you get accustomed to the insane learning curve of how to drive the s 400 tier mclarens through the cities so is it annoying yes but its kind of like a forced learning where you just kind of have to hindsight the appreciation

im 57hrs in atm i have a few more days left before the grand race i have a lot of collectibles collected and blew out the whole map of speed trap events but didnt seem to exhaust myself of anything like nfs heat felt

lastly i picked the game up at 80 off i think so it was 15 im guessing i have another 1015hrs left meaning like 70ish hours of entertainment before maybe shelfing so i would say this game was absolutely worth it 70 nah but no game really feels like its worth that anymore anyway

#####

this game is hard brutal at times even but its also the first racing game that has really challenged me in years forza horizon has basically abandoned all sense of progression entirely and any of the other titles ive played in the racing genre dont have nearly the same arcadey feel as this game does

this is the first triple a title ive played in years that has had no technical issues whatsoever i havent crashed once and on the few times ive experienced performance issues it has actually been because of me doing something odd with recording software or losing game window focus

the handling takes some getting used to drifting in particular is a bit of a mixed bag and can be odd to learn at first but getting the hang of it makes it pretty approachable the car roster is a little lackluster but all of the vehicles have so much customization that make up for it im hopeful that dlc and other content additions will help bolster the list looking at you toyota

above all else though im just happy to have a racing game that actually has progression its the first racing game that has actually given me a challenge since i was playing most wanted and carbon as a kid its not perfect but for the first time in awhile i dont feel like ive  overpaid at a 6070 dollar price tag on a triple a title its just a great game

alright lets rewrite this review

pros

cars handle much more responsively than heat they actually move where and when you want them to

nitro is vastly improved giving you two ways to use it in tandem regular and a full on blast that can be charged up to 3 levels you can also combine both for extra effect this helps immensely on long straights and can even fire you directly forward if you feel youre gonna spin out from turning too hard

the checkpoint system is improved and honestly has become as forgiving as forza horizon 5s you can hit even the very edge of the orange tip of a checkpoint and it will register no problem

the police system has been majorly improved to where its actually possible to escape the cops with a high wanted level without being abused by the rhinos from heat your cars health is pretty good even on challenging


cons

with all games there are going to be some glitches here and there this game has some minor stuff that can and will be easily fixable in the near future

i honestly havent found any big red flags to post about


closing thoughts


people are way way too stuck in the past and demand way too much perfection in series thats quite frankly moved on from those times thanks to eas mishandling of black box and how theyre fat out just gone now

carbon most wanted those were absolutely stellar games but hating new generation shit isnt gonna help improve it you want better stuff you make yourself properly heard

unbound is not heat there are many improvements both in the story and the mechanics even though it uses the same engine

its not the perfect gem you guys want as they were in the past but something is clearly being done right considering things are being improved upon

give it a chance dont just refund it in like 20 minutes like some of the other morons on this client do because its a garbage excuse 

hell someone in the old comments for this outed themselves and basically admitted they barely even touched the game to get a good idea on how it is

actually play the game and learn the ropes before posting a cringe ass review on why its supposedly bad because you aint helping


game is a 810 its not perfect but its way up there



update just finished the game

worth it

#####

the zoomer jokes are cringe

#####

would i recommend playing this game yes
would i recommend buying this game absolutely not
its fun but unfinished game deaf dev team greedy publisher dead for updates dont pay more than 50 for this game

#####

great game but you must mute the in game music load up spotify with your own playlist and its 10 times better

#####

download mods to make game good

#####

edit 300hrs w online playing online has been lots more enjoyable than getting thru story mode hence my having over 300hrs now fun to collect and customize cars especially my beloved eclipse that destroys hypercars on the reg absolutely worth the sale price for some arcade racing fun i hardly care how unbalanced and broken it is anymore beware 76 gti users lol

cops still way too easy but whatevs

old review for story 38hrs in cop ai needs a massive overhaul for how much you get chased it almost never actually feels like a threat and more just really annoying so easy to get them to hit traffic or otherwise ram them i still havent even come close to getting busted and wont even notice heat level because its all so easy 

rubberbanding is also a huge issue both with the cops and in races the biggest problem overall is inconsistency as sometimes ai pulls wayyyyy ahead and other times it seems more fair or the racers crash out a lot letting you win

i found myself just wanting the story to be over with so i can play something else not taking my time and enjoying it like older games im already bored with it especially with the map and the cringey af dialogue who is this for lmao 

the cars look pretty cool and theres certainly a lot of them thats neat ig i also like some of the progressiveness with character creation with blurring of gender lines but thats how it should have always been 

i wanna be hyped on this nfs because it seems longawaited but it might be my least favorite in the series it just feels very repetitive and empty

#####

requires the install of the ea app

#####

there are licenses that have grown with their original audience

and then theres need for speed where with each iteration you have to regress to enjoy the game im definitely too old for this crap

#####

cop chase after cop chase after cop chase cant even get into the races that are worth doing because the cops are so onto you

#####

not bad but not goodrather empty clearly not worth his price 

#####

thoughts on game

the game feels like it is a heat 20 but in a good way the handling took some getting used to but grip racing is finally  viable and in almost all cases more overpowered in terms of being faster than drifting to take corners to address the random veering it usually occurs when you are using the new game mechanic burst nos in which it will give you an instantaneous acceleration in the direction you are facing this means that if you are in a drift or you are not straightened out before exiting the corner you will be launched into the direction your tirescar is facing other than that the car can lose rear traction if you apply too much power but easily manageable with good handling and throttle management probably the best handling nfs has made since 2010

game length postgame content multiplayer

the story took a decent amount of time around 25 hours on intense difficulty and i was trying to speed run through the day and night portions only finishing the races that gave big payouts and not focusing on the other races around 35 races  small events per daynight cycle i could have easily spent 10 or more hours taking it slow doing all the mini speeddrift challenges and collectables in which i will do in the future after the story finishes and you win the grand there is nothing to do except for doing the same races over and over again it gets bland in the end game multiplayer also suffers the same bland feeling so hopefully more updates will come and support will not be killed off like heat was

is it worth the price 

maybe it is only if there is postlaunch support and updates that will add more events game modes cars and a better endgame cycle in its current state the game is worth about 50 but with updates it could probably justify the price tag of 90 wait for a sale would be my recommendation

heat or unbound

unbound you will not find the weird physics jank from heat here unbound also has better graphics than heat  b2d is dead in this game you will not catch up to grip racers and your burst nos will not be as full as a grip racer per corner on average ai will also not catch up to you in corners where you use grip rubber banding is a thing so i do hope that gets tuned down through updates the cops are annoying so i always put the undercover racer auxiliary part and it made my life way easier but you can dish out damage and not take as much damage as heat making cop chases more exciting rather than having to outrun them while being scared of a small love tap taking you out the cops can be easily fooled and juked out with good driving and planning skills the ai racers and cops do spin out crash out and make mistakes which gives them a nonbot like behaviour they are crazy however

overall rating

810

missing a lot of content in postgame and multiplayer but the core gameplay is there and it is fun try it out yourself using ea play and decide for yourself hating or loving the game without playing it is quite stupid and is a major npc moment form your own opinion

the celshading effects is new and refreshing but overall it is ok i am more focused on driving and looking ahead rather than staring at the bottom of my screen where my tires are and worried about the cartoon smokes it isnt as intrusive as i thought it would be the visual cues are helpful but sometimes get in the way of looking ahead on the road which is quickly remedied by using cloaked tags mods can remove them completely as seen on the internet but hopefully ea will let us choose to remove it for those who wish to

#####

if you can get this game on a sale it is worth it it can be cringe with its dialogue sometimes but the racing is arcade fun also you will eventually get whatever ride you want just get good at racing fast with 5 stars

#####

remember the first mission in bf hardline where we were chasing a sports car i literally thought i was playing bf h when i started the first race whats wrong with the cars in this game theyre literally the same cars that were in bf4 hardline the first cars handle like those vehicles you would attach c4 to and turn into suicide cars and the cars you can buy later resemble those sluggish sedans from bf h i still dont understand who came up with the decision to make nfs on the frostbite engine the most important aspect of the game the car physics are done so poorly that you feel like youre driving a suicide car with a stretched texture of a lamborghini on top additionally the car destructibility is minimal i would even say its nonexistent which makes you wonder how much the developers cared about what they were creating even in flatout2 the car physics were so dynamic and groundbreaking that it blew your mind when the game was released nfs unbound will try its best to keep you engaged with beautiful graphics and a fairly interesting design and style but how can you enjoy all of that when the cars feel like four wheels and a concrete block spinning in all directions sliding from holding the a or d key for too long and the three braking modes which they dont even explain how to use properly just throw your car off the track in my opinion battlefield hardline i mean nfs unbound turned out to be a highly controversial game im sure there are people who will enjoy this game but personally i wasnt left with a great impression and rather felt disappointed that once again ea is killing off a cult game series
hr                                                                                                                                                                                            hr

this game eats assfirst someone steals my car next i cant change my button layout for manual gear shifting finally i feel like i live off of food stamps with how little money is rewarded in every race       drifting feels poopy

#####

cringey characters like the saints row reboot and character design looks like ass but the gameplay and cars are good maybe wait for a sale

#####

honestly refreshing from seeing the same billion games that try to aim for photorealism 100 of the time

#####

its fun but not worth full price

ea play is 399mo on steambuy one month play until you get bored then unsub from ea playits way cheaper than spending fullor even sale price

need for speed is probably the hardest series to write a review on playing most racing games if they even have a history its either directed at the same people over and over or its young and its probably going to be dead after this game anyways but nfs is different its persisted now into several decades and its caught momentum lost the plot and invented entirely new plots for everyone to copy in the span of its run but its picked up car culture fans borderline sim racers arcade racers parents kids you name it it says anyone can play so when youre reviewing it eveyone has a totally different bone to pick with it so up front i like sims and simcade best but i love arcade racing games a ton as well ive also played most of the 90s nfs most of the 00s nfs and i got back in after the reboot that was heat because man the teens were terrible so with all that being said credentials dropped biases left and difficulties explained lets get into this

graphics  im going to lead with the graphics here as people are really hit and miss on them theres flair and animated cell shaded effects and character models against realistic backdrops and cars i admit its odd but i dont actually find it distracting and you can turn some of the cell shaded effects off just not all of them if you want to honestly though i didnt something in me liked the spinny lines and the tinted cartoony smoke im not really sure what it is its an arcade game and im not playing it for realism and i just jumped over a golf to land in first after blowing over a jump and smashing through a billboard if im honest if i was looking for realism i might have just purchased poorly that being said whether cartoon or realistic the models look great from the character models to the environment lighting and the cars themselves game looks fantastic so save design choices i dont personally have too much issue with the game looks interesting and realistic enough for a weird blend of what some people play for graphically in the same picture right next to what others do if im honest this gives me hope capcom will finally make auto modellista 2 i know it wont but i can hope

sound  the sound design is a bit hit and miss for me theres a heavy focus on sound effects and sound presentation of the cars alongside being able to modify what the exhaust sounds like and how subdued your supercharger or turbo is it makes me giddy as a car guy each engine and upgrade can influence sound and exhaust notes can be adjusted just yes but the heavy focus includes a strong hip hop and modern rap focus for the sound track im just not a big fan of this type of music instead favoring soundtracks like intial d and tokyo xtreme racer style i know 90s kid sorry the inclusions not the problem the lack of variety is i have limited choice to either hope i like what randomly plays or listen to the engine by itself which im probably going to do really soon thankfully i like the sound effect design enough this isnt an issue but it sucks there isnt much metal rock pop or percussion or even electronic music like trance or eurobeat to listen to as well that or a customizable playlist like ea trax had if you dont remember god im old ea used to allow you to change the whole soundtrack turn off songs etc crazy right

gameplay  i played this on a controller im sure you can use a keyboard i just would rather get a tetanus shot so i can say the pad works wellsteering is responsive cars feel attached to the road doing burnouttm things this game is made by criterion gets you boost charge to boost a lot some things contribute to a boost bar which has a multiplier you can quick fire if you get it high enough to use boost you didnt charge conventionally so when that runs dry you can boost using the stuff that was charging conventionally while you were boosting from bonuses criterion might like boost a bit theres also tap brake to drift and tuneable suspension behavior and upgradeable cars as well as purchasable ones so while driving feels good theres a bit more emphasis on boost than i like but its fine and theres a pretty big emphasis on drifting which is kind of not fine i mean its fine in the world map and on races where cars are designed to drift this way but if you turn off tap to drift and make corner slicing grip monsters like i tend to youre going to make drifting events and the combined events really freaking hard for you which sucks because drifting and takeover events are extremely lucrative most of the time so at least until you can secure a decent second car try to keep your set up balanced and keep tap to drift on moneys tight at first 

progression is weird the story burns really slow if youre expecting to jump in a 4 banger and blow the doors off of the riff raff that just came off a meth high youre going to have a bad time the beginning segment is fairly involved its not bad per say its just involved theres a lot of world building and character stuff the game wants to get out of the way before it dumps you outside the clutches of the dreaded tutorial police but after that youre basically free to do what you want how you want so long as you prep for your saturdays honestly theres plenty to do plenty of race types and plenty of room for differentiation for your garage as it grows you can even build the off road mercedes sclass you always wanted and whoop the average truck guy with it at the dirt track whats not to like

collectibles and random challenges dot the map and the maps huge so if youre feeling a bit of petrol powered assassins creed have at it theres enough to dos and findables for 6 games this size thats either massive value or an unnecessary bowling ball added to your luggage depending on your enjoyment of completionism that could go either way

story  i havent finished it yet but from what ive seen its a hammy ea nfs story if you want literary genius in your nfs game i must insist you try to be reasonable this a series of dumb people doing dumb things for dumb reasonsits fun usually or it contorts your face into terrible shapes theres not really an in between if the story is serviceable i usually consider it a win honestly the pc isnt an insufferable pile of pixels so thats actually a plus there are annoying people and really disconnected dialogue insert grown man with skateboard meme here dialogue feels really forced at times were not expecting shakespeare here i keep telling myself that but i digress the storys fine its just not winning awards

in summation the graphics are great the sounds really good better or worse if you like modern rap or not the storys there and the gameplays fun is it worth 70 bucks no and yes yes is i think a minority this is worth it if you really want a slow grind racer heavy on the grind to the top of the ladder youll probably be more frustrated if you just want to play and progress quickly im still driving an mx5 in one up class from bottom 8 hours in around 6 actual time took breaks it doesnt strike a good progression balance its decidedly a grind but you can cut the grind by just being really lucky and reckless too by playing on really high heat levels so theres that risk vs rewards there races are pretty difficult on high difficulty they dont feel they might be though rubber banded but im also not looking too hard games fun i like it im fine with what i paid even if that was waaaaay too much technically its stable for me as well im on an older i7 and an 3060 no severe problems not so much as a graphical hiccup

i will not sing this games praises from the rooftop but you could do a heck of a lot worse

#####

just dont buy it

 awful soundtrack
 too many repetitive boring police chases
i dont care how good or bad they are just dont force one after every freaking race
 limited amount of retries  
 normal races have buyinlike why and drift eventspaint the city events absolutely freaking suck especially if you dont have a car tuned specifically for them
 cant upgrade cars to the max since youll exceed the race tier requirements if your car is too good you cant take part in most races youre in a maxed car for the current tier too damn bad others will still overtake you like its nothing
 did i mention absolutely abysmal soundtrack 
 dialogue  story are just cringe 
bring back nfs 2005 please remove this car tier restriction nonsense or at least make it like payback where you have a car for each type of event the way it is now i might have a ton of money with 0 incentive to use them on upgrading my car because of these damned restrictions

some pros
 good customization had that since 2015 but now with few additions
 unique visuals
 uhvroom vroom

tldr no fast travel the absurd amount of forced boring chases the crappy unfitting soundtrack and the lack of incentive to upgrade cars build a rather meh experience at best
it all felt like a prologue that lasted for way too long

#####

looking at some of these reviews im not sure we even played the same game people told me the cops are unfair over heat 3 and the drifting is terrible

the car weight feels different to last few games and takes a little adjusting to turn off traction control and turn up your steering sensitivity in handling tier 45 police can be rough when you have low spec cars but once you learn the unit strengths and weaknesses it gets a lot easier to deal with them

pros
looks great
cars feel good to drive
drifting once you get a feel for it is satisfying
you dont need a pure drift spec car for the events the way heat really pushed
mostly good car list
career mode feels more focused than the 2015 or heat
if you dont like the street art effects you can opt for just tire smoke in your customization
new takeover event is actually pretty good

cons
zoomer dialogue written by millennials who are incredibly out of touch
online payouts arent great and start to feel tediously grindy
some of the driver personalities do not shut up during races
soundtrack is pretty mediocre nothing really stands out
no toyota
street art racing effectscolours cant be set for individual cars
could have more tracks

 cannot turn off cartoon effect  you should go into garage driving effect original smoke

 great improvement from nfs heat  agree but sadly some downgrade too

 repetitive gaming loop  happening after 20 hours redo driving to garage every start  end

 terrible music  they are just not interesting enough wasnt mean it is terrible

 drifting is terrible  i think the game rule is force us spent long hours to discover the best drifting tune  discover the best car for drifting it isnt terrible but trendy rule to follow

 police system is too aggressive  too many  only happen in heat 5 truly annoying when they getting easily to find player after 20 hours no matter whatever heat level

 easiest story difficulty is a lie  easy mode only apply the story cops not the online cops or race opponents

remember  to  for me if you liked this review

h1an unknown error has occurred in the ea app please try again later

#####

its 7 on sale right now as im writing this and id still not recommend this terrible soundtrack boring races not a fan of the forza tier system either

#####

man i want to like this game but i cant

after a tier especially s tier and s  it is such a damn chore playing this game every race just becomes so lame

every race is ruined by one of many many things and i dont mean oh you can come back no one of these will cause you lose races
 doesnt matter if your car is max s or s there is an npc that will be 500 yards in front of you accelerates corners and etc etc etc better than you
 it seems traffic is always in your way in a turn always
 if you are being chased in a race by a cop you bet your ass they will make you go from 1st place 2nd or 3rd and when the earlier mentioned npc rubber banding perfect racing ai is an issue may as well just restart the game there have been so many instances when i will need to turn but the cop because they brake and accelerate to perfectly match you at times just literally block you from doing anything does not matter if you try and brake to turn nope they will be a wall and make you miss a checkpoint
 boost doesnt matter all

i want to love this game but i have never been more pissed playing a racing game than i have this one im not even playing the game on the hardest difficulty

#####

need for police chases after almost every single event

the progression sucks
the writing sucks how do you do fellow kids
the cops are friggin everywhere and are after you and only you
all i want to do is drive to the next event but nocop sees me so time for the thousandth police chase
relaxed difficulty is anything but why cant we tailor the difficulty for multiple things we should be able to adjust difficulty for events cops etc to our liking 
the whole daynightbanking cash for races needs to die it sucks put all the events available on the map and let me decide what i want to do when i want to do them and ending the daynight just going to your garage sucks and needs to die too its 2023 and digital wallets exist ffs
when i use nitrous the ai opponents do too all of them 
no racing lines on the road hope you like having to constantly look at the faint blue line on the mini map
doing an event like drifting shouldnt increase my heat level
the is so much annoying meaningless cliche chatter during races with no way to turn it off its very irritating
atter 6 hours playing it feels like im doing the exact same thing over and over without any sense of progression
the upgrades i actually want are limited to just two slots to equip them but theres about 20 upgradesdumb
how about some upgrades to reduce the amount of heat gained reduce cops spawn and sight or literally anything to help fight back like mw 2005 had
no fast travel 
the three updates the game has are a complete joke i dont care about all these emotes ugly clothing and car effects i dont even use i want to get better car parts andor cash to buy them let us be able to turn off cops in free roam drastically reduce the amount of cop chases happening add an xp system with meaningful rewards like better car parts increase cash rewards 

glad they had a free weekend so i didnt spend money on this garbage

if they ever fix anything ill come back when its 90 off during the winter sale this year

wtf happened to criterion

#####

need for speed unfun

#####

ea and criterion do better this aint the nfs that will cut it

pros
 handling is very versatile can opt for grip and drift handling both or a mix of it it incentivizes experimentation with handling setup
 sense of speed is nice although u feel that sense in higher end cars and not in the early stages of career
 tag system ie various effects after using burst nitrous drifting and jumping it makes it stand out of other racing games gives it some vibe and personality although it might depend from person to person if he likes these effects or not personally its a nice touch and a breath of fresh air although it couldve expanded even more
 game looks nice in both daytime and night city looks nice although offskirts environments looks a bit bland
 burst nitrous mechanic adds a bit of nuance to driving in the game it rewards drifting drafting near misses with cars taking down cops jumping grip turns and other aggressive manuevers upgrade and callback to the nitrous system in nfs underground series it gives decent speed boost and helps in end drifts by shifting the cars momentum
 plenty of cars with variety of customization although most of the car list is same as nfs heat with few additions
 car upgrade system is good just like heat

cons

 
 drifting feels weird like very jittery and causes a lot of speed loss and considering how often one can drift and nfs has huge fanbase for drifting its one of the biggest drawbacks in nfs unbounds handling
 career progression feels boring and repetitive with its weekly system
 day and night cycle doesnt have much difference where nfs heat was so much better with its day and night cycle complementing the risk and reward factor which became a serious downgrade in unbound
 open world in unbound is kinda bland only the main city looks it has some vibe but not a lot
 soundtrack is the worst till date in the whole franchise the soundtrack mostly consist of hiphop and rap with some techno music earlier titles had songs from all genres but most songs are mediocre some songs being downright cringe the techno music is good tho although music can be subjective but most of the songs are from different countries in different languages and it feels like the game is trying to appeal to wide variety of people but ending up appealing to nobody also huge missed opportunity for not including tyga the creator
 asap rocky doesnt have much presence beside for a driving job and in takeover events
 the story in career mode is downright bad and cringe and had the worst throwback to nfs most wanted 2005 the writing and voicing is also awful 
 not much variety in event types in career mode mostly circuits sprints drift modes takeover is also pretty meh
delivery jobs and dropoffs events are fine but not great
 career and multiplayer have separate progression so many people will have to grind again for cars upgrades and whatnot
 in mp each server can old upto 16 players only making matchmaking and finding races kinda annoying
 cops are annoying one can reach heat lvl 5 really quickly after 23 races and heat doesnt reset after daytime going back to garage and losing them in early stages of career is a pain in the ass 

specific to vol3
 speedpass and linkups are uninspiring and makes the game look like its going for player retention rather than player enjoyment
 had some bugs in meetups and had a visual bugs using dlss with my 3060 laptop so had to resort using fsr even tho i have 30 series gpu which kinda sucks

conclusion
although nfs unbound is a decent racing game with good racing with some style it has way many drawbacks and an overall downgrade from the previous nfs heat buy the game on sale not on full price

710
 



#####

i just cant do it 

the level of cringe in nfs unacceptable is on a level ive never encountered before who wrote the characters dialogue and story the lowest lifeforms existing in the sewers would shun this drivel even starfield is better than this and that mess was a steaming pile of intergalactic failure

do you like music not after experiencing this delight you wont well if you want something to bash your head against a wall to then this is what you want hands down the worst soundtrack to any need for speed game ever honestly no game deserves the fate of this soundtrack

have you ever wanted to play a racing game where you often find some loudmouth backseat driver sitting in the passenger seat just imagine everywhere you go a greta will be with you

the game also suffers from tell dont show mentality for example i got to an important event where i wanted to see the reaction of the characters and how the story would develop but no i got a paragraph of text on the screen about what happened at the meet the standards are subterranean in regards to presentation and immersion

i suppose i should say something positive about nfs unbearable the graphics are pretty good i guess having said that im not talking about the hideous artistic disease effects the cars have been afflicted by you can change it to look more realistic but youll still see these plague emissions on other cars and new vehicles you havent freed from illness yet

it pains me to see what has happened to criterion games if this development studio has any talent left theyre going to have to put a stop to the pandering and get serious about making quality games again

#####

if it wasnt obvious the selling point of this game is the style not exactly graphics but the drawing style and effects i can say it did affect my decision on buying it and i definitely was satisfied with my purchase graphicswise the world looks quite good and cars look amazing some people didnt like the effects and you can deactivate the majority of them but i dont think that should be a problem the game feels much better with them

regarding gameplay its a bit complicated theres rubber banding and the ai gets crazy sometimes more common on higher levels the tier system was nice to experiment with but you gotta spend a lot of time and ingame money to set up the perfect car personally i didnt hate or love it just meh not my kinda thing i have to note that something i definitely missed from heat was the daynight system and the fact that there were no police chases on day because police on unbound are really though when you start and just become a nuisance on the higher levels but other than that pretty good

i like to go for 100 on games and most of the time while it is a long task its not something i would complain about but boy drift activitieschallenges on this game were the worst should be called wiggle activities instead hated them but are doable just something i wanted to note for the completionists out there

the story was relatively good a bit more enjoyable than payback and maybe on par with heat but as usual its a racing game you dont come here for the story

there are still a few bugs here and there and i definitely think it needs more optimization not sure about this but i read somewhere that it has a memory leak and sometimes youll get polygons everywhere making it impossible to see happened to me once restarted the game and never saw it again so keep that in mind 

in conclusion good game lots of fun great vibe a few annoying bugs and quirks but definitely try it out on sale though

#####

after over 160 hours my save has become corrupted i have tried looking online for a solution and it seems issues with savingthe save file is super common i was enjoying the game but not so much now

#####

 h1 tldr better than heat in the ways that matter gameplay but unfortunately tainted by story and writing h1 

h2 good  h2

h3 atmosphere h3 
heat felt a little sanitised and slightly grey technically a step in the right direction but not so much personality overall the map in unbound is a lot warmer and combined with the added crowds on foot the meetup system instead of just randomly starting in the middle of roads and the distinct characters with distinct cars and bios it actually feels like a scene instead of just disconnected races

h3 graphics h3 
next gen game with suitable next gen graphics cars looks great and map looks great

h3 cars h3 
they all look good and theres a lot of customisation unfortunately basically just what was in heat though they handle the way they have for the last few game so if youre not a fan theres no changes there

h3 car class system h3  
encourages you to build a garage with a lot of variety instead of just maxing three cars like the levelonly system with heat 

h3 limited race restarts h3 
made the stakes feel high but also prevented just mindlessly replaying each race until you win it oddly freeing to finish a race in 2nd and just move on

h3 buy ins bets h3 
needing to buy into races and having a chance to lose money without being able to redo the race made the races actually feel risky and rewarding to finish

h3 takeovers h3 
nice mode enjoy it more than drift races i hope they keep it for the next game 

h3 animated characters h3 
hot take but the anime characters work well for nfs and feel very underground 2 they also allow for there to be crowds in the city since theyre very low detail and makes it a lot easier for the focus to go into places where it matters

h2 mixed h2

h3 police h3 
felt really really oppressive for the first half of the game and spent most of the time in freeroam trying to escape police so i could get to the actual races  it really dampened the whole experience and caused me to stop playing for a while since getting to races felt like a chore until i bought the relevant auxiliary items for my cars but since the class system leads to you having many cars it is not easy or feasible to put the expensive antipolice mods on all of them 

h3 racer ai h3 
feels like its better than at launch so not many complaints now just weird moments where a racer will crash just in front of you and then reset in an odd way that somehow prevents them from losing their lead just a little buggy and glitchy 

h3 lakeshore online h3 
missing stuff at launch and has a lot of untapped potential as usual i play online a lot more in unbound than heat surprisingly the cop meetups are fun the speed passes are whatever having separate offlineonline garages felt weird but its grown on me a little and the unlock challenges for cars add things to work for after the campaign i will actually continue playing it which i didnt with heat overall better than heat but much untapped potential

h3 dlc h3 
i honestly havent really even looked too far into these volumes and dlcs they sell just not really interested i understand that the goal is to add longevity to the game especially with online and i do think there is potential there but whatever theyre doing hasnt appealed to me at all

h3 soundtrack h3  
next game should probably just have 3 or 4 radio stations since its impossible to please everyone at this point personally the soundtrack was fine but most people disagree

h3 car effects h3 
personally liked them but the concept needs to be improved upon a lot ties in well theoretically with the anime characters but something felt off

 h2 bad h2 

h3 writingcharactersplot h3  
unfortunately did damage to the reputation of the rest of the game when combined with the controversial style additions nfs has never had good writing and writing doesnt matter that much to me personally but the shoehorned modern slang  unconvincing lines  attempts to include social media our last race has hundreds of hits on youtube just didnt land very well at all in the context of nfs the story itself had quite an anticlimactic ending too with the final race not really feeling any different at all to normal races i honestly dont think its as big a deal as people make it out to be but its definitely part of what caused the damage to the perception

h3 the launch h3  
online mode was lacking at launch no police in free roam online was a very weird omission added eventually and then the initial follow up patch did very little to address anything people its also definitely still a little buggy compared to heat

h3 weird aesthetic direction h3  
sort of ties into the writing and i dont know how to really put this into words car effects anime characters are all actually ideas i like and hope they stick with but it was all filtered through this weird slightly datedincorrect view of what kids like kind of seeped into the whole game its not even a problem to aim the game at the demographic most likely to play it but it felt like they kinda missed that as well 

h3 removal of drag offroad races h3  
offroad wasnt the most popular in past games but it feels weird to have the dedicated offroad events removed especially with all of the offroad car parts still present the people who dont like them could just skip them the way the game is structured drag races need to come back 







 



#####

good game with a stupid annoying police system 710

#####

not worth the money in my opinion heat was better

#####

well now
i did not expect this im from an age where nfs most wanted 2005 reigned supreme as the best 2000 nfs game i loved porsche unleashed and high stakes before that nfs underground introduced car tuning at a completely different level and was a very good game in general later hot pursuit 2010 reintroduced the gameplay of nfss of the prior age and was an excellent game as well the other nfss somehow came short on something every time it was either a bad port undercover horrid story nfs 2015 weird world and handling nfs rivals or just a bad gameplay loop in general most wanted 2012 and heat and the lack of cops in my nfss payback shift prostreet even underground for that matter

then came the scetchiest of all nfss  unbound and it somehow took the lead

i havent had so much fun in a nfs since most wanted this is a most excellent game
it has a good gameplay loop  you have races during day and night where each has some benefits the gameplay loop is tied to the story which is subtle and you dont need just the one car to beat everything you need 4 tiers  a a s and s to beat the final stage in the game and you use these cars throughout the story if you choose to there is also a b tier and even though you still have events for b tier cars its not obligatory to finish the game
the cops are not over the top and whilst its unlikely you will have a 6 police car chase on your tail its still exciting and fun to try and lose them the game puts you under pressure from the start and does not let go
multiplayer is fun while there are some cars that require nerfs like the ferrari pista or koenigsegg agera maybe even the old golf it has been a good experience overall

my only two gripes are the music and vanity visual effects
some music tracks seem to fit the mood of the game pretty well especially the more energetic ones however the pop and hiphop songs  they are just boring and they get old very fast the lack of dnb and rock music also hits home i liked the option to disable specific songs in some older nfss but muting them is also an option
the visual effects are possibly one of the most talked about issues in the game while they dont brake the game and they do add some flavor to the whole thing for the most part ive found them to be annoying these effects obstruct the view too much a simple visibility slider would easily fix that

all in all i like this game a lot i would be stoked to see a dlc that adds more missions to the single player and also adds more races and cars to the multiplayer

i do recommend this 810

#####

swamp ass game

#####

maybe not worth the 70 but i am enjoying the story mode cops are not difficult at heat 5 but they do get annoying when you are just trying to get to events boot up spotify with the mw 05 playlist and burnout 03 and its a blast

#####

as excited as i was for this game im genuinely disappointed
it genuinely feels like another need for speed heat while somehow managing to be worse 

i was already not feeling the toonstyle graphics from the teasers but was willing to look past it given the statement the developers made about being able to disable them by the way you cant you can only tone them down 

the story is just terrible even with there barely being much of one aside from the random dialog between the main character and the garage owner there isnt much to look forward to completing the story leaves you with a few unanswered questions with several key characters being only mentioned and never introduced a lot of missed opportunities there

their handling model also seems to have been downgraded making drift cars extremely difficult to use and for the most part completely useless outside of events avoid driving them in free roam if you have a heat level higher than 2 the only way to mitigate the inconsistency of randomly entering drifts when not intending to is to build grippy awd cars as even max grip rwd seem to completely spin andor develop a mind of their own and steer you in a completely different direction than intended overall once you start messing around with cars in the s tier around the 400 performance index youll find yourself with one of two options when attempting to take the higher speed corners the races force you to take either slow down by a large margin to fight the terrible understeer or risk it all by testing your odds at pulling off a microdrift trying to race any rwd cars outside of the lower performance tiers like a or lower is incredibly slow due to either having to slowly slide around every corner or from suffering serious speed penalties from attempting to make proper entries and exits using the apex do not use drift tires for drift events youll have a substantially better time just using upgraded versions of the standard tires which honestly doesnt make sense

the customization is exactly the same as before being able to remove bumpers on a few cars being the only exception here which is very misleading if you have been following the development updates and content teasers prelaunch extremely modified cars like the nissan 240sx shown in small videos and screenshots cant actually be modified at all with the exception of wheelstires and brakes theyre premade bodykits and not at all an example of any new vehicle customization opportunities any additional cars added that werent available in the previous title have decent customization in the form of extremely outlandish body kits that are at least in my opinion ugly an example here would be the dodge charger hellcat the wheel selection seems to have been thinned out you still cant adjust the wheel width or the suspension track width for whatever reason which makes certain vehicles like the new lamborghini countach just look ridiculous with certain wheels as they appear much thinner than the factory wheels some vehicles like the ferrari f40 and vw mk1 gti have clipping on the fenders from lowering the car and simultaneously adding bagged suspension

the races themselves feel roughly the same with the exception of the new takeover mode which feels like its just been ripped from the dlc mode added in need for speed payback the same risk  reward system from night races in heat is still present but the reward portion feels like its been removed entirely seeing as there is barely a benefit from attempting to do as many races as possible in one night given that there is no longer a reward multiplier for the heat level the side bets function seems interesting and its definitely welcomed but dont expect much from it as you cant seem to increase or decrease the amount bet theyre all set based on the performance index of the opponents vehicle in comparison to yours

the multiplayer has its own separate campaign if you can call it that there is no actual story to follow you simply race other players on the same map as the offline campaign there are no cops or timeofday progression other than in some races cars are unlocked through lengthy challenges rather than campaign progression like in the single player so you can look forward to a lot of grinding should you want to unlock anything 

the graphics themselves look perfectly fine for me but this will not be the same for everyone as i assume not everyone is playing with a rtx 3090 or better but with 4k ultra settings the only issues i have seen are some frame rate drops depending on a combination of weather conditions driving through the dense downtown city areas and lots of special effects from the cars and those of other racers small update here most every race ive done downtown has caused major lag spikes i have verified it is not my pc making online racing atrocious

your bankcash values along with most other stats seem to be server sided but the volatile money before reaching your safehouse from singleplayer races and vehicles prices from buying andor selling can be modified causing some other pc players to pick up a huge advantage over console players at the start of the game

in an attempt not to be overly negative i will add that the soundtrack is the most refreshing part of this new nfs title theyve always done a good job of incorporating a lot of artists that may not be as mainstream as others but they went above and beyond in an attempt to add as many artists from varying cultures and backgrounds as possible it doesnt feel forced like some sort of an scheme to capture a larger audience it genuinely fits perfectly with the overall feel and setting of the game

im sure there is quite a bit more that i am missing but i still have more exploring to do so ill make adjustments to my review later should i find anything else 

all in all ill give it a 510 for no other reason than its not unplayable there just wasnt any worthwhile differences to look forward to one of the biggest drawbacks in my opinion being the handling model as drifting around corners seems to be extremely inconsistent and risky compared to previous titles like nfs 2015 which did a great job of making the transitions substantially more fluid note the nfs most wanted m3 gtr is currently locked behind an ea play subscription paywall as if charging 17 more than the average price of a aaa game wasnt bad enough

tldr  save your money wait for a significant discount just play nfs heat with the much needed unite mod if you want a similar and better experience than what this game currently offers

#####

ive played 5 need for speed games and this is by far the worst but also the most expensive


dont pay 70 for this game its not worth it

a few games that cost less and are ten times better

assetto corsa 1999
assetto corsa competizione 3999
dirt rally 20 1999
need for speed 2015 2899
beamngdrive 2099

people who want realistic driving games with realistic looking cars and realistic physics will not like this game this is a fun fast paced arcadey racer with lots of energy the crazy spiderverse looking effects add a lot of style and charm to the game and i was surprised to see so many people hating on it especially considering that its very clearly one of the selling points of the game to a lot of people the cars dont handle like real cars but thats kind of what makes this game so fun

the game has its cons of course all games do  but i wouldnt judge the game based on the reviews claiming its too unrealistic and hoohaa if you like arcadey racers you will probably like this game a lot if you dont go play forza or something idk p

ps the music is kinda meh maybe turn the music volume down and play some initial d music instead

car

#####

goddamn this is definitely a horror game cuz 99 what u do is hide and seek with cops with some anime racing gimmicks on top

#####

starts off fun but later into the game the padding becomes obvious and the catchup mechanics really kick in for the ai late game grip builds are the most viable builds but at the same time are wildly inconsistent the same corner at similar speeds with similar braking will randomly lead to understeer or oversteer and if you think you can just increase the downforce to compensate then youll find yourself fishtailing randomly at high speeds when taking back to back mild turns 

cops arent fun to run from which is surprising because it was excellent in heat and i think its to do with the tuning of the ai the ai in this is a lot stupider but spots you quicker and can keep up with you a lot easier then theres the level 3 heat cop the interceptor which is simply painful to deal with youre meant to take them offroad to lose them but for the middle part of the game they travel the same speed as you offroad so really you have to try and force them to crash into oncoming traffic but because you cant catch them its really a waiting game with a luck element 

the tracks cars and music are all great but they get overshadowed by the above issues 410

#####

the bmw m3 gtr is not in singleplayer     

so this is a lengthy one so tldr wait for a sale 3040  

ugly 
1 rubberbanding is infuriating to the point where any mistake will ruin a 24 min race racers regardless of speed will always be on your tail expect a clapped out shitbox out running your porsche 

2 cops are annoying not difficult literally will just pad the game a few hours you will be punished for grinding matches to make money by having the entire pd chasing you its not even fun with the chases no pursuit breakers or anything to diversify each pursuit chances are your first pursuit will play the same as your last oh and they have the rubberbanding issue are you on a different fucking planet in a different solar system from them and manage to graze a space shuttle or hit some astroids theyll be there right on your ass invest in the spotting time decrease upgrade youre welcome 

3 everything is designed to fuck your face this game is by far the most artificially difficult game ive played in a while this isnt fun police ignore other racers to fuck your above mentioned face cars pop in around corners specifically for you racers will drive literally perfectly while you drive off track for a millisecond and get passed rubberbanding will fuck you and your wife 

4 handling is awful i had to use drift on every car as grip feels like actual shit i would be on a strait stretch and just have my ride break loose start drifting and go off track ive tried maxing grip same issue braking before turns with drift disabled doesnt matter that bitch is going 90 degrees into a family of four in the oncoming lane in a neon yellow dodge caravan while every racer goes 200 mph in a clapped out eclipse right on pass you despite your 10 second lead 


bad 

1 story but like i had 0 expectations nfsmw had a cringy story but it was made endearing by taking it self hilariously serious you could believe that razor was a wannabe tough guy compensating with a mustang i have met mustang owners can confirm this is realistic this story is actually not badly written plot wise its problem is within the dialogue and how the story is implemented the writing is cringe af the characters are awful no one has a defining trait youre drip fed the story through literal week long in game intervals 

2 the gtr is not in singleplayer ea demands 5 a month and the gtr is only for online you can make a replica m3 gtr is the only reason this is just in the bad category lazy 

3 money is impossibly hard to get starting out this is a issue because i cant upgrade my cars because most of all the races require a buyin you will not be buying visual upgrades until a few hours in my mustang boss yes the irony of the above mentioned statement is not lost on me was literally stock with a shitty decal and paint for like the entire 12 hours of the start so i could afford garbage performance parts to go from 4th to 3rd2nd 

4 goodluck winning any races between none of the racers scaling to your car and rubberbanding its gonna be a rough hour or so i personally didnt mind as it makes sense your a newbie why are you smoking all these highgrade cars i was also playing the highest difficulty before scaling it down to loosen the rubberbanding 

5 limited restarts fuck off ea 

good 

1 customisation actual really cool and in depth no ug2 but really good

2 played in 2k and managed around 100fps at ultra decently optimized 

3 when you actually start making money and winning races actually satisfying the gameplay loop is pretty addicting then

4 head to head races are very fun should be used more reminds me of highway battles form undercover 

5 wrap library as usual on point 

6 large selection of various cars from shitboxes to racecars 

7 high heat missions are generally fun minus the cops telepathically locating you through mountains 


in conclusion 

this game had a lot of potential sadly the rubberbanding is just too much of an obstacle to actually recommend this game the money and grind in the start game is just not rewarding enough but if you slog through it the mid game is very engaging overall its a 510 for me if they work on some of the ugly we could have a actual game on our hands i just cant recommend this game for full price

#####

one of the worst driving models ive seen in nfs so far theres no grip limits or optimal cornering speed car is always either understeering or oversteering for no reason also pressing brakes does crappy mumbojumbo magic with your cars controls and physics instead of braking or translating weight

#####

not worth 70 maybe on sale for 30 or so
its not a bad game theres just very little content so if youre paying full price you are getting ripped off

also the end of the main story sucks i hope there are plans to continue the story with dlc because the main antagonist getting away with no consequences is horse shit

update
i just came back to this after the volume 5 update ive been playing a lot of the crew motorfest lately and this feels like complete garbage now everything feels sluggish and the cheating cops with their infinite speed and acceleration and matching your every turn perfectly pretty much ruin any kind of fun i would be having

#####

people keep complaining about the following things

bthe game is grindyb
yes it is however for me it wasnt boring or annoying to do because i had fun collecting money to build different cars for different classes and race types also driving around and getting collectibles was also alright too this is weird for me since i can get easily bored doing grinds or collectibles but this game somehow made it fun for me

bstorystyle of game is cringe b
there are few characters who talking like 10 years old with weird slang but not every character is like that also few characters are actually characters and have proper development throughout the game not even mentioning to some fourth wall breaking topics and questions which the game brings up throughout the playthrough making it more interesting and not cringe the style of the game is unique and i do understand that some people dont like this kind of visuals but i was okay with it it wasnt annoying nor distracting to watch for me

bgame is too difficult b
not gonna lie this is the first nfs after i dont know how many years where it had some challenge in the story races are not easy you need to use your nitro and boost properly and strategies to have a good finish because you dont have to win every race you just need to get money police chases got more difficult as well since the ai got a bit more advanced and they can actually make your time more difficult you can get to high heat levels early pretty fast where you can get destroyed easily if you dont know what are you doing not even mentioning the 3 difficulty levels well at first i tried to go on the hardest difficulty but after seeing the drift scores to beat i decided to stick to challenging difficulty i understand some people disappointment with this part but i was delighted to see that this game is actually not a pushover and i have to try harder to beat the police or the races to advance so git gud

bcontrols are trash b
sadly the controls were annoying in heat as well but it somewhat got better in unbound in my opinion its not that understeery than it was before and it dont get too drifty that many times i can recommend playing with traction control on when you drive a or higher class cars which helped to control my cars also you have to understand the pros and cons for grip and drift cars im not saying criterion did wonders with this control scheme but its not that bad than it was before but this is certainly a field to get better for the devs

bgame is not optimized  multiplayer is unplayable due to disconnects b
on lowest settings playing in fullhd i had 60 fps no problem on pc meanwhile the game was still alright looking it could be better but my 1050 ti handled it alright about the multiplayer i got disconnected only two times in my 25  30 hours of online play and thats due to inactivity i never had issues with disconnects but maybe i was lucky to play in general

bsoundtrack is horrible b
yes i get this one but comparing to heat where i liked only 2  3 songs there are atleast 5  6 now which i enjoy for real and only 4 other songs which i skip instantly when i hear in unbound so yeah the soundtrack is not that good but its still an upgrade comparing to heat

even though i countered most of the critical points of the game i have to add that its a bit disappoint to see the lack of tracks in the game not even mentioning the long and grindy challenges to get cars in multiplayer i also had troubles with the confusing ui in the multiplayer and the lack of replayability of the story mode because after a playthrough you cannot replay it from scratch except if you delete your save file which also deletes your progression in the multiplayer the game also lacks anything new to racing games it uses the well known formula of open world racing games which works but gives nothing new really in terms of gameplay

in my opinion need for speed unbound is a fun and challenging game if you into it it also offers some fresh air with its style and i can recommend to play it 70 is too much for this title but getting it around 15 is a good deal in my opinion

#####

oh man im so disappointed in this game this is not the nfs i use to play 

im 31 now but when i first played nfs hot pursuit boy was it cool i still remember and i was so drawn to the music they had playing in the main menu i later began to understand why i love drum n bass music 

this is just not what i would have expected dont get me wrong the design is amazing and on its peak level but anime scribbles and stickers dont feel like the real nfs 

the music is terrible some russian singing in one of the tracks and the worst is this mumble rap crap i honestly couldnt concentrate or relax in a race listening to this degenerated genre

the best nfs so far is most wanter


#####

stop giving ea money

1 this is a copypaste of nfs heat
2 they are using anime to cover up their subpar graphics
3 the races feel grindy and repetitive 
4 what is this music just turn it off

rating 610  this game is a waste of time and money

#####

nfs heat 2 i mean that in a good way drifting is massively improved if you like nfs heat then youll like this

#####

since most reviews already talked about content like story effects customization etc ill want to talk about the most important aspect of the game the driving physics and experience i think this should be the deciding factor wether you should buy this game or not

at its core the driving physics are the same since need for speed hot pursuit 2010 if you have played that game or any nfs that was released after 2010 you already experienced the handling if you did not enjoy those driving physics you are not going to enjoy this game either
so clearly no buy recommendation

that being said ill explain in more detail what i like and dislike about the driving physics in case you are new to the franchise have not yet experienced the newer nfs driving physics since 2010



breaktodrift

first of all the core gameplay can be described as breaktodrift so in order to get your car to slide you tap the break and the car transitions from grip to drift this feels just as weird as it sounds it can still be a very fun gameplay mechanic since the game rewards you for doing it properly and its really satisfying to drift through corners at high speed 
depending on your car setup there are also multiple ways of getting your car to slide either with a gas tap instead of a break tap or by exceeding a certain steering angle at a high enough speed this gives you more options to change the cars behaviour to your preferences

however the transition from grip to drift always feels forced the game basically decides at which points the applied physics change from grip to drift which in 90 of all setups isnt smooth at all regarding the control you have over the car it seems like a switch was flicked and now it handles different than before which is really disruptive

this is especially true when transitioning back or recovering from a slide just without a button press to initiate the transiotion like tapping the breaks

the result of this breaktodrift mechanic is the loss of precise control over your car so the car in general feels very unresponsive it is incredibly difficult to weave through traffic or adjust your line through corners since the handling physics can change at any time from grip to drift too often you loose complete control over your car because the game changed the driving physics on you this is the inherent flaw with this or any breaktodrift engine




grip builds

a new feature is to build setups that do not use the slide mechanic of the game which is great there is a new way of playing the game and further possibility to modify the handling to your liking

however these gripbuilds cant be applied to every car since the basic non upgraded car needs to lean towards grip regarding the handling already

also the above described breaktodrift mechanic still is there and is quite notable you can usually pinpoint the moment where the game would switch from grip to drift but then doesnt because of the setup 
in essence these builds are more controllable but still feel somewhat unresponsive i crashed with really good grip builds as much as ive crashed with really bad driftbuilds you may call this a skill issue but i dont have the time and motivation to put in hours and hours of practice just to play an arcade racer just for fun

it also makes the game less fun since you can get the impression that the car just drives on rails which gets boring really quickly



tuning setups

trying out different upgrades like changing from a turbo to a supercharger or changing from drift to grip tires can be a lot of fun but more often than not its just annoying there is no good way to test your applied changes due to the progression system of the game once you leave the garage you can only return to it without progressing the story if you completed no event that day or night so you can drive your car with a new setup but if you dont want to accidentally progress your story be sure to play no event not start a cop chase complete no activity like a speedtrap and dont even get any collectible
this is very limiting and annoying to find a good setup for your car

i found the best way to approch this is just to look up good car setups and use those builds there are really incredible builds out there i highly recommend using those otherwise youll waste time effort and money to find a build that youre happy with since it is no easy task to find a good car setup especially for casual players



manual gearbox

this is a very nice option to get more control over your car but the way its implemented is so awful i do not understand how it can feel so alienating to use a manual gearbox for casual players definetly not recommended
currently there is also no option for button mapping for controlers so better get used to shifting with the shoulderpads


conclusion
breaktodrift mechanic is an absolute dealbreaker the car feels unresponsive to uncontrollable this can only partially be fixed or compensated not recommended for casual players and not recommended for competetive players there are games with better physics to train your racing game skills

old nfs physics up to nfs carbon 2006 are still better god im old 

#####

to be honest a very big downgrade from nfs heat not recommended at all

#####

regret

#####

great game as long as you turn your in game music volume to 0

#####

first of all

the game handling is dogwater i mean its nfs after all

the game story line felt extremely short

no first person view

cars you have a bugatti urus countach maybach etc what more could you want

cops are just better and makes more sense than heat in heat theyre just okay and weak fast and tough faster and tougher in unbound you can actually get rid of them by ramming going offroad or tricking them but theyre weak against minor collisions

driving effects well you cant completely turn them off but it wont interfere with you when cruising at 50mph


after all nfs unbound is a great game as a whole but you might get a bit bored of this game maybe wait for ea to roll out patches and project unite to improve this game

at the end if u want to buy it just dont buy it in full price

#####

in this review i will compare it to nfs heat in heat i have 400h of playtime
pros better customization better handling better mapmy opinion better cops better and longer story but the charakters are still cringe asf
cons online mode is awfully boringworse than heat soundtrack is the worst there ever was in any nfs 772 songs are listenable the progression to unlock cars and get money in online mode is awfull audi is missing no cops online no nighttime online they forgot to add cutscenes for special races that were already there shown in trailer

buy the game in a sale palace deition not worth the money

#####

shortly after buying this game to play with my buddies we realized that unlike the other recent nfs titles this takes campaign and multiplayer and separates them into stand alone experiences so you cant do campaign races with your friends no coop only pvp no running into people and vibing on your way to an event maybe doing a headtohead instantly refunded

#####

good enough worth about 1015 if you ask me

#####

i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

more of a mixed than recommend i had lots fun playing it but also lots of frustrations
its a play it once and never again kind of deal get yourself a month of ea play to check it out along with other games 
if you want to buy a game nfs heat will be money much better spent

what it has going for it
wide variety of vehicle styles
really nice art style animated and real life elements were a great idea 
fun and easy driving model
awesome music well around half of it
plot with a time limit is a new idea i like it

where it fails
small number of races you can race in different classes of cars but its still the same race 
difficulty level and catchup mechanics are broken sometimes its easy even on hard sometimes its impossible on easy game seems to pick one driver that will be faster than you no matter what unless you figure out which one it is and wreck them i usually play medium or hard in arcade racers here i had to settle for easy 
tuning the car means nothing rating is meaningless for you some cars just feel better even with a lower rating old porsche 911 is the biggest offender then again if your rating is lower than opponents ai probably is gonna smoke you unless your crash them
drifting is unpredictable and offroad doesnt exist some cars drift better tuned for grip you have to blindly test what works for your car cars tuned for road can drive just fine offroad no reason to tune a car for offroad there arent even any offroad races heat did it way better
colleting heat in the daylight limits you massively when exploring the map again heat did it better

honorable mentions for cringy writing and car mods especially poor nissan fairlady but thats to be expected from nfs
and another mention for including asap rocky making him one of the better opponents and making me sit through his pseudo philosophical bs and the cringefest that is his car doesnt fit the vibe at all if you wanna include celebrities at least choose some that are more car related vide nfs2015

#####

starts race 
taps handbrake turn 
taps handbrake turn 
collides with traffic at 90 race completion
quits the game


cries himself to sleep

#####

is good me like car me drive car

#####

asap rocky

#####

better than heat in every aspectbut bro the fortnite characters and the zoomers dialogue made it worse than any nfs gamethe soundtrack is dissapointing and the cartoony effects arent on point

7510

#####

tried it on the free weekend got very bored after around 5 hours 

i thought id like it because i keep hearing that this game improves heat in every way i disagree

the night and day cycle in heat was so much better and cops were more fun in this game cops are super easy and really just a nuisance also the rubberband is insane i am all for rubberband surely nobody wants to drive away from their opponents and be bored but the ai here sometimes catches such speed and grip that its just impossible to keep up even though their car should be weaker
palm city was a better map and thats coming from someone who loves chicago

dont even get me started on the music turned it off after an hour and played my own playlist 
story is cringe but thats become a standart with nfs games 

the animated effects didnt bother me as much as i thought they would but i would still prefer if there was a option to turn them off completely edit this option was added in an update so props to the devs for listening at least a little bit

the game does look great especially in the rain and even though i said i enjoyed palm city more lakeshore still looks pretty cool

i know criterion can do so much better than this fingers crossed that the next game is actually good criterion should work their magic and not let ea touch it in any way

#####

this feels like nfs is finally starting to return to form game is fun runs good a couple crashes handling is fun and actually works well graphics are pretty character art is meh dialogue is cringe good ole need for speed game hopefully updates will add more races cars and multiplayer content

#####

people will appreciate this game more in a few years

#####








 
 
 
 
 
 

#####

i wouldnt say this is the worst nfs game its just not worth its full price like as you play story mode you unlock more cars to purchase as you go along but in online mode you have to do these challenges to unlock them all again which is kinda dumb

also i dislike the fact you have to have one car for every tier to race in unlike in heat where you can just drive what ever you want in any race

the drift feels weird like your always understeering every corner even if you had a good drift build for your car

even the ai can be tricky because once you made a mistake in a race its very hard to catch up even in a max out car or the difficulty set to easy

you can try this game for yourself and see just i highly recommend getting when its on sale

#####

this game gets too much hate it has flaws but i thought it was good 

b good b

  graphics are nice i love the art style every racing game looks like forza now
trying to be ultra realistic 16 times the detail its getting old the comic effects give
this game its own personality
  driving physics are surprisingly good at least to me cars feel like they have weight but they are still
responsive burst nitrous is fun both grip builds and drift builds are viable 
  car customization is great most cars have a solid selection of visual parts as well as engine swaps
performance upgrades engine sound tuning and more theres only around 140 cars but the selection is 
varied where toyota tho
  theres a story and progression which racing games seem to be allergic to
right now the game doesnt give you 50 cars off the start cough horizon 5 you actually
get to work your way up 
  the map is solid theres also pedestrians around so it doesnt feel completely dead

b bad b

  story is mid theres no gripping narrative or likable characters except rydell its quite goofy you
also dont get to see or race against the main villian
  dialogue is cringe everyone sounds like an exaggerated tik toker and the cop radio is like
kids in a cod lobby the game also tries to make the racers the good guys which is weird characters
will unironically say stuff like the police are so mean   right after killing 57 other innocent drivers 
and pedestrians like lmao
  theres a large map with tons of roads but youll be repeating the same tracks a lot i dont understand why
this is so difficult for devs like the roads are already there just add some more races forza does this too and its annoying
 multiplayer is eh i wish there was more content but thats not my main issue i hate how story mode progression is seperate from multiplayer you spend all this time building up your garage in story mode and once you finish and switch to online the game just says f u dumbass and makes you start from scratch also literally every car is locked
behind a grindy challenge to complete before you can buy it in multiplayer good thing its insanely easy to give yourself infinite money
and bypass the car unlock challenges ea forgor to add anticheat lol
  police spawning is ridiculous your heat goes up so fast after a few races the police are absolutely everywhere they dont
even have any spawning limits to make it fair youll just see them pop in on your minimap right in front of you
 the soundtrack is atrocious my ears are bleeding

overall 7910
wait for sale i got it for 20

#####

balance is inexistant why is a golf better than the rsr was in the last 5 games

#####

i feel somewhat obligated to write a review because for me this is one of the better need for speed games and i honestly dont understand the hate i played it on the hardest difficulty and boy it was great for me it was for sure better than heat


i really adore that it shakes up different things and mostly succeeds at it

the set time limit until the next big race generates a nice pressure on what risks to take and how to spend your money it really got me engaged in the game because money is also much harder to get than normal you really need to do some difficult decisions
in a time of forza horizon where you get hundrets of cars just by playing the game i very much enjoy that you need to put some work and thoughts into your car choice

also i noticed no annoying rubberbanding and the secondary nitro bar where you get additional boost by doing risky stuff or just by driving clean added additional dynamics to the races


sure some things are controversial

for example there is no fast travel you have to avoid cops or you are pretty much always chased this could be mitigated half way through the game though

or the strong colorful driving effects that you cant turn off but i got used to that pretty fast

and the game is less drifting focused but for me this is also a nice change of things i dont recall drifting that much in nfs most wanted 2005 either 


i have only three main criticisms 

like with heat you couldnt really know if a car performs good enough to keep up in its class so you have to hope that your hard earned money is well spend you can unlock some cars to compensate for this but i tried to use cars i buy myself

in general the cop chases worked and were difficult enough to really think twice about trying to escape max heat cops with a b to a car but they are still fairly dumb and there are no creative ways to lose them like crashing buildings having active skills  it felt like needing to do specific things to confuse them or exploit their dumb behavior this can be much improved

and the main big thing there are way too less tracks and i played the game after they added some more its nice that races in slower classes are still played because sometimes they get you more money but a game with this length need at least 3050 more tracks to be varied enough


for me a good nfs is a linear single player experience with good and different handling atmospheric racing and some new ideas and unbound delivers


ps for the love of god please add custom controller bindings 

#####

disclaimer i would only recommend this under the pretense that its on at least a 30 sale

need for speed unbound is a uniquely stylized racing game where you race your way up the local street racing scene with a focus on risk and reward cop chases and street culture unbound manages to be one of the most unique racing game experience we had in a while while it is the bestplaying game compared to previous entries in a while the game ultimately still falls short in the grand scheme of things

ups
 massive overall physics improvement over previous installments
 burst nitrous mechanic adding new depth to racing
 art direction is unique among racing games
 colorful cast of characters
 difficulty feels right

downs
 old entry cars barely has new body customization options even with render artists on the team
 a very short singleplayer campaign
 multiplayer lacks substance
 despite being featured heavily only 8 cars get a legend customs variant out of 143
 countach lpi8004 felt forcefully added because it doesnt have any body mod options
 ai rubberbanding can be very unfair

despite not recommending the game i genuinely love this game i really hope criterion gives this game further support because this is a really great game new singleplayer campaign maybe new legend customs maybe multiplayer adds maybe

#####

for a game named unbound cops are reaaaaaalllly bound to you just get nfs heat or payback instead

#####

coming off of nfs heat they didnt need to do much besides make a new world with new races maybe add some additional cars they had the winning template but somehow they managed to mess it up 

the best part about driving in heat was the oversteer it was predictable yet dynamic manageable with minimal practice and fun in unbound oversteer is overlooked in favor of grip steering with both systems overlapping each other youll sometimes grip when you want to drift and vice versa when you do oversteer it feels likes its on rails and you dont have nearly as much dynamic control via countersteer and throttle as in heat its a dumbeddown system compared to heat and its disappointing given that criterion already pandered to the type of player who doesnt want to figure out drifting with the entire grip steering system

if ruining the driving mechanics in a racing game wasnt bad enough the cringy genz aesthetictheme doesnt help the city looks slumy i guess its supposed to be chicago so thats probably accurate and races are not visually pleasing races seem much more bland with long straightaways and a few right turns almost no new cars compared to heat and most of the cars from heat need to be unlocked before purchase via car specific achievements you need to grind why pointless

the customization ui is ripped from heat but the controls have been remapped again why and the camera control is janky as hell when viewing your car its like criterion made a conscious decision to just arbitrarily change things maybe just to make it seem more like a distinct title relative to heat if you played heatyou can feel the old ui dying underneath a lazy ripoff with the horrible new aesthetic slapped on top like a cheap sticker

unbound just feels overall cheaper and less polished than heat its not terrible but if you showed me both games sidebyside i would think heat is the newer and better game unfortunate step backward for the nfs franchise and a notable downgrade from the previous title

#####

20hrs in atm and i havent been forced to drift in every turn  

i can finally tune for grip and race as normal

this years nfs is actually refreshing to play  ive missed the detailed car modding that this game offers us and to compliment that the game is visually  audibly stunning  

police chases are slightly annoying and a little to frequent for my taste  so far it doesnt matter on the car the police are glued to you no matter how hard you try to shake them  i could just be bad  but it does slightly take away from the game imo

the world itself feels good in the main built up areas but outside of this i feel its lacking any character  feels like a generic city  so exploring it is pretty stale  as with most open world car games i wish this was set in japan 

i can finally say that after years of nfs games that have been hard passes for me  this one would finally recommend  

from the refreshing anime  comic style details theyve added this time around  to the car mods  visuals and sounds all the way down to the satisfying grip handling  





#####

ng for cringe woke 
the worst game of the nfs franchise
no game in the series had reached such a threshold of mediocrity
i didnt know it was possible to hate a racing game before

ive finished nearly every episode since 1994 and since 2011 the franchise is living an endless descent into hell i am a veteran of the franchise which sees tarnished year after year 

criterion what have you done dont you remember hot pursuit or even burnout

ea have completely forgotten what makes a good racing game

this game is a disastrous failure from start to finish

the handling of the cars is atrocious at least when theyre stock they are heavy and unsteerable i had to customize my cars enough to drift easily 

cars and parts are horribly expensive compared to old nfs 

the scenario suck probably written by retarded teens who dont know if theyre boys or girls

they even felt compelled to add a black trans character

the tiktok generation of brainless morons with pink and green hair is killing the franchise

the characters are caricatured at will with their cheey slang and their football haircut

they spend their time taunting each other when they overtake or are overtaken

same for the cops they laugh at you when you drive badly and insult you when you run into them

on the music side we are very far from what the series has accustomed us to

forget rock metal basically music for white people

here we are served only infamous rap and hip hop sung in several languages english french arabic russian and so on the same sht with different sauces 

the soundtrack makes me want to drill my eardrums and pour bleach on them

the game is also incredibly vulgar compared to the old ones both the dialogues and the songs im pretty sure it was to please the scum

forget the epic feeling of a hot pursuit or a most wanted here the races are emotionless

oh wait they can be annoying because you can be overtaken at the end on a straight line by the person you bet against thats crazy how good they are when you bet on them

another mega frustrating thing the cops are only after the player in every race other streetracers can drive without getting disturbed  

also there are way too much police chases almost after every night races when your car is heat level 5 there are no pursuit breakers 

and cops spawn close to you when youre escaping its really annoying and the helicopters that spawn above you will get you mad i mean really mad frustration at its peak

police pursuits are terrible terrible you can see the cops spawn in front of you

offer this game to your child if you absolutely want him to change gender or even ethnicity

this woke game stinks of cringe and africanization runs through its veins and vice versa

ill almost have to feel offended to play it as a straight cisgender french white dude

i think im gonna puke and not just hate this game is definitely the black sheep of the series

a this point let the series die rather than release such a crap game

even if its on a big sale dont take it 

im serious

youve been warned

i would rather play a wheelchair simulator than this failure

hey bruh im about to slide into your dms and get that clout on the street racing scene boy but make sure you finesse the heat yo my boy carlos got a sick ass whip bruh 

if you liked this dialogue then youll love the dialogue in this game especially if you read it as if i were talking to a wall and not another person because thats how every line of dialogue in this game is delivered as if they didnt do any voice recording sessions together and just had one va come in at a time and read off a script

mind you i dont expect award winning dialogue or story in a racing game especially not a nfs one but you cant go through one race without awful dialogue being nonconsensually forced into your ear holes every single character talks like what youd image a high school student in an underfunded innercity school would talk like and its just so out of tone and incoherent even the voice level volume sounds off

it takes everything heat did and does it better 

so without wasting your time heres the tldr
better graphics
better handling
better customization
amazing map
more qol features
decent cops
decent story

and last but not least the aap rocky horn

#####

no matter what i tried it doesnt wanna launch even the ea launcher is screwing it all up even more

#####

despite a ton of negative reviews i personally think that nfs unbound tries to define a new theme of street racing in the modern nfs the colorful theme in this current game reminds me nfs nitro although criterion tested the water there are many issues in this game

recycled content is the main issue since nfs 2015 both cars and frostbite engine have been using in 4 games these things make the game repetitive for me secondly the map is so dull and tiny especially in noncity area but i really appreciate that the city feels alive more than nfs heat because of pedestrians walking around and gimmicks in the city such as opening bridges and tunnel which older nfs titles dont have handling still unstable like in the older games which still use frostbite engine but the racing gameplay is quite intense because of burst nitro getting from near misses and being on air that is the reason why i enjoy highway racing

speaking of new content updating content in nfs unbound is better than nfs heat the content is new cars and game mode for free unlike nfs heat where the new cars are paid dlc paid content in nfs unbound is mostly cosmetic
not only new content online mode is much more attractive players to play class racing and coop linkups make players enjoy online mode more

i know that music is subjective but many people despise the soundtracks in the current game just because few horrible soundtracks that they dont like so nfs unbound becomes infamous for bad soundtracks which is not true i think that nfs unbounds soundtracks are diverse in term of genres and international representation which i do enjoy them those people are just biased with their own nostalgia because of better soundtracks in the old titles

in conclusion nfs unbound is still decent game if you still enjoy illegal street racing theme which other racing games dont have despite microtransactions nfs unbound do better in term of proper new content i recommend you to buy when there is a discount sale full price is not worth anyway




#####

game is fun but i couldnt imagine buying it for 80 its a 40 game the storyline is super cringe and every race requires a buy in basically theres overall way less customization compared to heat

#####

bought the game  just to test it cause i had an itch  about 5 hours ago with a 70 off sale and now im about to refund it

please keep in mind while you read this review that i have experienced possibly a very small percentage of the gameplay and maybe some aspects of this title change some time after the point i reached

tldr for me it is a very mediocre towards bad game i would strongly recommend buying it only if you really want to try it and at a major sale like this currently happening 410

right off the bat i will tell you what i liked about this game the only thing i am really keen on is the art and style of the graphics and thats nothing new that was it

game felt boring af nothing is of any importance at all characters are unlikable and have stupid goofy and unironic in the sense of goofiness dialogue that feels way out of touch with how young adults talk nowadays little to no rewards for doing anything really i played almost 1 hour of backtoback story races which garnered me only about 15k winning in 1st place and i still hadnt unlocked vehicle performance upgrades free roam collectibles or any shops which felt weird to me and unnecessary additionally during races the car would supposedly reach 200 kmh but the game didnt have any graphical effects for players to understand that theyre racing at significantly high speeds which also added to the boring parts of the game it just felt like casually cruising around town

just like in heat in unbound there is a day and night time feature which personally feels like it is there just for the sake of it and doesnt have any real meaning in heat the day was for making money and the night was for raising your rank and battle through difficult races and with cops to earn highend car parts only achievable through that means in this you dont earn a lot of money during the day and you get all the rest plus more money during the night so whats the point in having that also a general noteworthy information up until the point i stopped there was no rank or experience bartab and locked parts require the player to unlock them through activities car aesthetic customization was okay pretty much very similar to heats nothing more nothing less

just like in heat music is very shitty abominable and atrocious i wouldnt have my worst enemy hear this music obviously i turned it off and put mw2005s over it and had some fun through that with the game just pathetic

#####

need for speed unbound has some issues eg ingame economy needs immediate balancing but is still quite satisfying and i consider it one of this years best arcade racing games not that theres a huge competition you may also like its unusual art style but i personally think the developers took it a bit too far and shouldve worked harder on technical aspects of unbounds visual side

#####

this is probably the best need for speed game in a long time nfs heat was fine but felt aimless this feels like a refinement of what was going on in nfs heat with the major difference being a more focused story structure the story itself is mostly fine and the dialogue is corny as all hell but the vibes are great 

the week to week arrangement of major events qualifiers was great i loved this over just having a smattering of events all over the map instead races are contained within hubs meetups where you choose the specific race you want to do while you still have to drive back to the meetups to do additional events i think this does a lot to help the game flow

i dont know if i would call this game grindy insomuch as its easy to make mistakes and have to slog through events with a potentially bad car i had to do this after i dumped my winnings into a mid90s mustang only afterward did i realize that i was trying to turn an obvious drift car into a grip racer but my fate was set until i could earn enough to improve another of my cars

its important to note that the objective is to gain money to improve your carbuy new cars not to clear the map of events this is further emphasized by the improved heat system which usually increases after completing a race the amount that your heat is increased by varies but usually higherpayout races will increase your heat more as your heat increases the game throws stronger and more difficult types of police vehicles your way through this system the game encourages you to run to a safe house as soon as you have a decent stack of cash from races as you can very easily lose it all to the cops

cops are brutal in this game so it behooves you to dish it back to them once i had the option i almost always chose modifications that increased my damage output so that i could cruise straight through police cars with minimal issue you can also evade pursuit through speed or going offroad but there is always the option for stealth as well in any case this forces you to choose when to end your daynight just like in nfs heat however i felt like i had much more control over my fate than in heat and generally had a lot more fun dealing with the cops 

none of this would feel any good if the game didnt play well and i think theyve mostly nailed it in this aspect its an arcade racer for sure but cars feel much better to drive than they ever did in nfs heat part of this may be due to a much better map with a city that feels much more authentic and roads that feel a lot more natural the boost mechanic is also fantastic rewarding you an instant burst of speed for drafting drifting getting air or smashing your opponents into oblivion that includes cops and your fellow racers 

the car variety itself is fairly solid im sad that toyota didnt want to play ball as their vehicles are stuck in a game that is the true definition of grindy gran turismo 7ugh i only ever purchased one car during my singleplayer playthrough the rest of the time i built up cars earned through races which was a fun way to expose myself to other cars rather than running to my usual staples 

the game isnt without faults though the variety of courses seems a little thin so hopefully we get more layouts in the future or even possibly a route editor similar to what the forza horizon series offers it didnt bother me too much during the campaign but i can see it start to wear thin past that point as i start to gather other cars and look for collectibles i also wish the number of restarts available would reset between daynight as you can be forced to use one for some outright dumb reasons i recall one race where i had a significant lead on the field only to be cut short by my tire inexplicably getting stuck in the geometry of a bridge cops and your fellow racers will also try to turn you and i have had them completely ruin races for me that last point isnt as much of a problem to me as the lesson there is to be more careful and to either give space or to just hit them first the part where it feels rough to me is when the ai gets into an accident and creates an unavoidable mess that collects you in the process again sometimes thats just part of racing but it can feel like a raw deal 

allinall i feel like i got my moneys worth out of the game but i think its an instant purchase at the 40 price ive been seeing 70 feels like a bit much but i also think thats true for any game 

alright thats enough writing from me i really liked this game and was expecting a complete turd so color me surprised





#####

game keeps crashing when entering the story mode tried many fixes online but doesnt work

dont buy it

#####

i like the game the game is not that bad 

things that are neutral for me
 story
 animation effects of the cars i like it because it does not affect or hinder my racing missions

things i like
 i can do the drifting like the old times nfs underground 2most wanted
 i like the racing aspects
 i like the maps

things i dont like
 cops are dumb as hell
 no destructible mechanics like in most wanted i felt like i was running all day avoiding the cops
 no hiding spots like in most wanted
 i hate the repairing system kinda
 no drag race like nfs underground 2
 no drifting race like nfs underground 2
 weekly qualifier i need the most wanted style of story i think its too much repetitive there are less racing maps

overall its ok a decent nfs
probably my rating for this game is 6510 its not that bad and its not that good either but still enjoyable

#####

shitty physics car snaps and cannot control it
police is shit
soundtrack sucks
story is cringe
nfs is dead

#####

i played past the second race unlike nfsheat so thats a positive right there 

also lmao at people thinking nfs was supposed to be realistic in the slightest go play forza still a simcade btw ac or iracing if you want a sim

#####

the hate about the comic effects is stupid

#####

am a huge nfs fan and i pre ordered my first nfs game hoping it will be good but all they have is graphics and animations there is not a good story line and to top it off palace edition is a scam not worth the money

#####

like what every positive review says get it during a sale

even though the game was far from perfect since launch i really enjoyed playing it for a while after completion single player does start to get boring stale and repetitive but multiplayer is currently the strongest feature this game has so far the pvp and new game modes such as linkups and gauntlets are better and more fun than what fh5 has the multiplayer updates really show criterions creativity and dedication towards this game and im also glad that we are getting a year worth of updates so unbound definitely has potential 

so in summary get unbound for the multiplayer only and because of that get it only during a sale

#####

average whole game could be a lot better

#####

if id be honest the game is like a brother of nfs heat in comparsion with gameplay
pretty much same features but my god the graphics are completely amazing especially during rain
the story is rather mid but it will do for a racing game
buy unbound only on sale as its not worth the full price

#####

terrible optimisation 3040 fps on this game but 100 on forza 5

#####

not bound

#####

well i wish steam allowed me to give a mid review 

ive got some problems with the game but i still kinda enjoy it however i think the cons outweigh the pros

i was originally going to refund this due to the ea app glitching out and acting like i didnt own the game 

this infuriated me i had to reinstall the ea app then the game then reboot my pc just for it to allow me to play the fact that i bought this on steam but it makes me go through a different launcher which is so bad it thinks i didnt own the game is a major issue im tired of games releasing on steam just to say fuck you use our launcher instead its a stupid trend and it needs to stop 

when i finally got into the game i experienced really bad performance which i had to screw with the setting for like 30 minutes constantly restarting the game in between changes because you need to restart for your setting to take effect so that wasnt fun eventually i got the settings in a good spot where i can hit about 5060 frames though in the city it may drop lower

driving feels weird cars are really heavy imo which feels icky in a supposed arcade racer however i like the special effects on the cars looks cool

dialogue is cringe with poor voice acting and bad writing seems like they tried to do the ol relatable thing again look im 18 and maybe its just me but i dont find these young characters relatable at all they come off as annoying and get in the way of gameplay to the point where im literally cringingfacepalming during cut scenes 

nobody i know talks like this and while we may use terms like bruh and other slang we dont emphasise this much when speaking its like every time one of characters uses a slang term it sounds very forced and not natural as if they hesitate to speak it idk maybe its just me maybe im just weird but i really hate when games do this nfs heat suffered from this too though it seems worse here

music is debatable if you like rap youll love it but thats about it theres a few electronic songs and i think like one pop song once again just like heat they fucked up here imo 

gone are the days of variety i wish it was more like forza horizon with multiple radio stations with unique hosts and unique music selections instead were given just a playlist filled with imo trashy rap music ive got no qualms with people who like rap were all entitled to our own tastes but damn is it awful to listen to imo it doesnt get me into a race its not heart pumping it doesnt go along with the gameplay

idk it just seems fine i guess look i cant stress this enough watch some videosstreams of this game id recommend getting it on sale i did and its okay for the price i got it at anymore and id say you got ripped off

for now im gonna give it a not recommended review theres just not enough here for me to like im still gonna play it however treat my review as if your buying it full priced not on sale thats what im doing as i dont think its fair to treat it like a game on sale since you could be reading this when it isnt

#####

this series is so out of touch of what it was
the characters wont shut up the driving is awful ea still forces their studios to use frostbyte a game engine that still cant do racing games it runs like crap because frostbyte is terrible
bought it 50 off refunded and still got scammed

and dude this franchise hit rock bottom so hard people somehow try to get a glimpse of hope like there is some very few good things here but most of the problems come from a publisher that wont allow the teams to use better tools since they think what the battlefield guys have are the only tools for the job and a lack of basic understanding of what made the franchise work over a decade ago

why does an arcade racer with police chases have car health and you can get wipedout in the one game people point to and like alot doesnt have that pursuits will go for as long as they want and the game is revered for it even almost 2 decades after release
like can you understand why bringing that in these games still feel out of place even better why does your starter car have nitrousboost right from the get go no its not a prologue car to show things to come you just have it on your first car and yet you take influence from midnight club and burnout with a second boost system where you get it from drafting near misses and airtime but the boost is pathetic doesnt really give you any noticeable acceleration improvement meanwhile in mc it pretty much puts you at top speed and in burnout you get a massive acceleration improvement

where is darius on a real note you wanna know why people remeber such characters like ronnie razor darius or cross it wasnt because they wouldnt shut their mouths for the entire runtime well except for cross being there the most back in 2005 they actually had memorable moments being total idiots with their im the coolest thing in these streets and their dialogue and player interaction despite being very brief if at all they werent in your face compared to what this game does with your wingman but their actions on the game plot and basic motivation were all you needed to be invested in the game

even on midnight club were there was always a guy that would talk to you during the free roam parts their dialogue would revolve around the game stategame progression not suddenly cutting off to feeding opossums milk which was funny when my brain switched on and realized what was going on during the confusion but why was the game dialogue written like this is life is cringe people complained about the awkwardness in 2015 and your idea to make it better was to double down on it and hope people would grow to it like it was trrying to capture the goofiness of 2005 in 2005 it was brief the game had 9 cutscesnes for the whole game and phone calls that were not nearly as long and these characters not shutting up

#####

make new driving physics you psychopaths

#####

they lied to us you cannot disable the annoying cartoon effects while driving the game would be much better without them and will repurchase if they get removed but i cannot stand the eye sore

#####

as a fan of the franchise i immediately bought the ultimate edition of the game in short this is the biggest scam from the publishers of this franchise that ive encountered i havent played such a dull piece of nfs in the world 
i honestly tried to play this to somehow justify my purchase but no this is probably the first game from the franchise that i gave up on
a big dislike sincerely

#####

while i prefer the theme overall of heat this takes big steps in being a better game it falls short in some areas but handling speed of physics calculations and actual online races feel worlds improved some nice new car additions like the 400z with actual custom parts while its not the best need for speed in recent times its among them

most characters are forgettable other than rydell cops are easier once again it feels like a stepping stone game but one for sure worth playing if youre into arcade racing games i prefer this over forza horizon 5 by a long shot i just wish it got updated like forza did

#####

this review was written before the volume 2 update some information here may not be accurate

so on nfs unbound

the physics theyre good when they work the problem is that they dont work sometimes its very satisfying to microdrift the cars through fast corners and the whole burst nitro mechanic works very well however sometimes the car will just snap on you for no reason and either fishtail down the road or overrotate on you causing you to lose all your speed also the cars can be incredibly bouncy in a good portion of the map making them extremely difficult and incredibly annoying to control especially in the city or going down slight inclines such as the entry to the meetup at kennedy test track when the physics do come together however the cars are a lot of fun to drive i like the graffiti effects and they give the game a somewhat more unique look they wont make the game any better or worse but theyre very cool to have

the story i honestly liked the story despite it being as cringe as it was sometimes i really liked the world building through listening on the radio for the podcasts and phone calls throughout the four weeks of the story i liked the characters too each with their own different personalities unfortunately you literally dont even see the main villain of the whole storyline at any point you only hear about him through conversations or phone calls i really wished that you would be able to see him at some point but you dont however the story only lasts for 4 weeks once you finish the 4 weeks thats it nobody contacts you at all outside of races and thats only the generic passing rival or rival and you crash into each other messages etc there is no resolution to the whole mayor race or any other storyline i hope the story is going to be expanded on but i doubt that will be the case at the moment

the whole 4 week campaign in terms of gameplay is actually a lot of fun at the start you are being paid out virtually nothing as well as trying to get used to the car handling which makes the start of the game a major challenge as you have very little money this requires you to spend your money wisely on the correct upgrades while still having enough to pay for buyins once you get a semicompetitive car however all that challenge fades away as the ai are very bad in this game with a very good car you can easily dnf the ai finish ahead of them by more than 30 seconds however balancing the money gained vs the heat gained from events is a lot of fun 

once you finish the 4 week campaign the game just throws random events at you to continue the game the 800000 profit from the final race is nowhere near enough to buy everything in the game forcing a major grind after the completion of the story to buy everything you want the core gameplay loop is fun but there is nothing else to it why is there no race editor so we can create our own races and test them in both singleplayer and online that would add a lot more life to the game especially if online races and singleplayer races were randomly generated why are grids only limited to 8 players 

the whole 4 week campaign thing with some sort of special race at the end combined with lots of decision making on what races to race what parts to buy who to bet on etc has a lot of potential for a very difficult roguelike campaign mod

in very low class cars the cops are an actual challenge and shaking them requires a lot of improvisation and skilled evasive driving other than driving into the storm drain which causes you to basically lose them instantly it is very rewarding to escape a heat level 5 chase in a stock b class car after a 20 minute long chase however once you get into a semidecent a s or s car the cops simply become an annoyance rather than an actual challenge why arent there higher heat levels that are present when you drive faster class cars so that the cops continue to be a challenge

i have not touched the multiplayer and do not want to do so as it looks like an incredibly huge grind to reunlock everything with very low payouts even more so than the single player i dont understand why they decided to do this rather than to just allow you to use your single player cars for multiplayer 

speaking of multiplayer and car rating the whole car rating system is very topspeed biased as in more top speed increases car rating more than anything else allowing you to put huge amounts of engine upgrades on the cars and then using a gearbox that makes them top out very early on the straights i wish that the rating system was more balanced so that this isnt the case 

some cars are also completely useless it seems like a lot of the modern gt cars such as the mercedes amg black series the corvette c7 zr1 the porsche 911 gt2rs etc are completely useless as they have very little straight line speed and very bad acceleration at higher speeds weight reduction or drag reduction upgrades would help a lot with this and would allow them to be competitive with other cars most cars feel like they have 200 horsepower less than what they actually have there is also one completely broken glitched car out there that is incredibly overpowered for its class

for some car builds especially those with very close ratio transmissions the automatic transmission is completely useless as the first few gears are so short that they are not usable this is also the case for very high power cars when you get a perfect start the car will simply just bounce off the limiter a couple of times before finally getting into gear the best way to fix this would be an additional setting in the handling tuning to disable certain gears from being used so that the automatic transmission does not use those gears 

i would simply use manual transmission except the car engine audio is so quiet its basically unusable when you use the normal burn nitrous it slowly fades the engine audio out making it basically impossible for you to know when to shift other than taking your eyes off the road which normally results in you hitting something and looking at the rev counter while a minor nitpick there should be an option to disable this

the steering is still very speedsensitive something carried over from heat which makes the car feel like a boat less so now at low speeds and sometimes oversensitive at high speeds this needs to be adjustable so that we can tune our steering response how we want when the car is travelling at different speeds i would also highly recommend using the far chase camera as on one of the s tracks when hitting certain bumps the camera will fall below your car making it impossible to see the road ahead for a second or two if you are not using the far chase camera very annoying

customizable controller controls they dont exist in a game from 2022 you cannot change your controller bindings this is ridiculous you can change your keyboard bindings but not your controller bindings i also have a sim racing wheel two button boxes and a pedal set and i cant use my controller unless i physically disconnect all of those things from my computer this has been an issue since nfs hot pursuit remastered and nfs heat and this is completely unacceptable for a game released in 2022 to have this issue

so overall is this the best nfs in a generation yes is that a very low bar yes is it worth 70 absolutely not the game has a fun core gameplay loop but so little content and with the disappointing update coming out this month this doesnt seem to get any better with only 68 tracks for each class and only those classes and sometimes wonky physics its not worth spending your money 

this is a 20 game at most

#####

this game is good but heat was better

#####

i dont really like it sadly it can be pretty at times but thats just about it for my pros 

the driving soundtrack map activities and general gameplay is on a short scale of bad to awful the customization is nice but everything else is just so mediocre or flat out boring that i cant find the motivation to play it anymore 

unfortunate i loved rivals a lot back in the day but this is just boring

#####

i like the style of nfs unbound and the game looks good but has a few too many annoyances  mainly the cop chases which happen constantly completing events during a day earns you heat which then makes cop chases more likely and frequent while you are out in the open world essentially the game gives you a choice to balance between earning a lot of money during a day by completing a lot of events but risking it to the cops or earning less but being safer

that is a good system in theory but it is very easy to get to heat 3 or above which makes cop chases an absolute pain they happen constantly you will have a very hard time avoiding being seen by the police it takes several minutes to outdrive them  and the moment you are out and can finally head to the event you were targeting you likely get into another one on the way there it is a very annoying system that is almost forced on you since you need that cash especially early in the game to buy more cars and upgrades

other than that bad system the game itself is okay it controls well though the cars generally feel a bit slippery and it looks nice the story is a mess with twists a 5 year old could see coming and some very annoying characters tess and yaz specifically the characters also talk constantly even while driving around some of the dialogue is admittedly pretty funny but most of it doesnt hit the mark there are also collectibles littered on the map as well as small events like hot laps or drift challenges but those have a fundamental flaw you will not be able to complete those with all stars until you have a very good car which means you will leave most of those until you are the very end of the game

overall while i do like the style and general feel of the game i could eventually not stomach the constant cop chases irritating dialogue and boring gameplay loop with the ever same events anymore if the game was only half as long it may be better but after 16 hours i was not even at the halfway mark there are better racing games and better nfs titles

#####

i like it but i liked heat better disliked the day  night switching everytime were going in the garage disliked the tier limited races disliked the limited amount of race events disliked the very limited amount of cars and the retry limits what has nfs become really wheres lexus lfa wheres porsche carrera gt whats with the various versions of the same cars with minor differences

#####

just the right mix of soft reboot and going back to what made nfs heat so damn good

the art style in my opinion is just what the series needed to make it stand out against the crowd and i feel it works really well with the new direction of back to basics street racing

the dialogue is as cringe as ever but i almost feel like it is intentionally on brand at this point

customisation is really fantastic the cars feel sound and handle with meaty precision and the world is much more alive this time around also photo mode is much easier to navigate finally

also the soundtrack is one of the best the series has ever had

if you enjoy arcade racers youll have a blast with unbound  the series has finally hit its stride again

nowadays when i buy a need for speed game i get it to race cool cars with an arcade feel to it i feel like this game pulls it off very well in addition im a fan of the art style but i can understand why people wouldnt like it now for the cons this game is cringe the story to this game is really predictable and boring the characters are extremely cringe and poorly written the script is cringe  wacky and noticeably pushes a certain political agenda which im not going to get into because i feel like politics shouldnt even be apart of games the voice acting is poor more into the cringe  wacky point most of the characters in the game talk in a way that you will never see a mentally normal individual irl talk unbound probably has the worst soundtrack i have ever listened to in need for speed history car progression is extremely tedious police chases are pretty bad and police ai can be easily manipulated into wrecking themselves an example to this point would be just driving towards the ocean and all of them will end up killing themselves anyways thats my opinion of this game hope this helps

#####

i cant recommend this game to anyone at the current 70 this is a 40 game pretending to be aaa

im not going to leave a long review i will just point out that i use a trainer to get unlimited boost and the ai can match my speed or go faster without using any boost and as soon as i let off my boost they slow down and i can pass them normally very shitty programming that was obviously done on purpose it feels like the ai from their 15 year old games so poorly done

and the acting sounds like a bunch of middleaged actors pretending to be 20 year olds a whole lot of the word yo that just doesnt need to be used

#####

finally nfs allows you to turn off the godawful brake to drift mechanic and criterion really cleaned up the physics so much better than the ghost nfs games waterbeds youd drive around 

however whoever decided to put money by rico nasty on the playlist needs to be fired

#####

settings  audio  speech volume 0

#####

i understand this game has been out for only 1 day but the effects are weird and the character design is just extremely low quality they really postponed nfs to focus on bf 2042 and it flopped then after waiting we get this crap really the dialogue is just zero effort garbage with no thought behind it the steering is so rough you either have the turning radius of 10 semi trucks or you immediately spin out 

this game was postponed had a price increase to 70 and we get a unfinished half assed game great job ea youve fucked it up again

edit more things ive discovered so if you barely tap a npc you automatically crash and get reset if you complete a race with no cops the game automatically forces you into a chase at low speeds with the units directly on your tail and a race that requires you to cross train tracks except the train is on the tracks yes thats right the train blocks the finish line and if you touch it thats right reset as a auto crash

edit 2 game constantly closes its tab on its own mid race ive lost twice due to it

edit 3 love when im heat 5 with no cops then after a event get a insta 9 cop stack and die in a 12 mile ea you need to refund everyone this game issue a apology to the nfs community and trash this garbage ass game
edit 4 this game needs to be erased from existence its a disgrace to the nfs franchise

edit 4 uses awd with gold slicks going slower to go up mountain curvy road and i spin out every 5 seconds even tho im 4k rpms in 3rd

#####

honestly speaking im enjoying the story so far because it gives me a sense of i wanna beat this bitch in a race baaad

multiplayer is nice but man is it a little tooo grindy which might benefit it since it makes you play for longer

psthe music is dogshit this time around payback def got the best soundtrack imo and heat def had some bangers but i honestly dont remember a single song while play as i tune that shit out when im racing

the game is decent but political and sexuality narrative is just too much i wish we could play games without them shoving sexualities and orientation down our throats too much is too much 


#####

game freezing and stuck loading loby  please repair game 

#####

it wiped my save so yea

honestly it takes forever for the third party origin shit to work its fucking annoying doesnt matter if you are logged in already to origin it will ask for email and pass and as you are typing it will load the game and then attempt to load the game but not load the game and then work when you task manager origin but then ask for origin password and email its trash never buy a game that says it requires third party its fucking annoying i got this for 40 and feel like its not worth the annoyance 

stop with third part shit on steam its fucking trash

edit 1 
8im drunker then a skunk and winning on medium game is trash for racing but a good gta wanna be
edit 2 
nvm im going back to disney starlight valley more content then this garbage refund at 40 dont waste unless its less then 40

#####

pros
 engaging story
 music goes hard
 huge feeling of risk  reward i dont know what happens if you lose all your money but im not looking to find out

cons
 makes my pc heat up

#####

the cops in this game are absolutely the worst they are irritating and annoying as anything else in this game they serve no purpose at all they just waste your time the heat generates way too quickly they are everywhere you go on the map for ffs just let me play the goddamn game these are the worst cops in any nfs game that i have ever come across please fix this stupidity

edit fix the cops ea the cops still ruin the experience of this somewhat already shit game

im on neutral side wouldnt recommended this game at full price and bbetterb bwait until its on saleb even better if you can get it below 30 dollars you could get away with standard edition instead of palace unless you want the extra stuff it certainly not the best nfs but it is still quite fun despite the cons grip handling is nice but drift handling not really story is okay if you decide to buy this game please do yourself a favour search a guide on how to farm money and escape cops in this game to avoid stressing yourself up there are plenty of good guides and tips out in the internet unless you like challenge i guess before buying this game i also recommend you to check out the week 1 2 3 4 and the heat level system where you need to prepare cars for each class and save some money to participate in races too if you are not into that best you avoid this game and get nfs heat and play with unite mod instead

the graphics does look nice including the model of the cars
grip handling certainly feels better in this game but at what cost see the cons
ai opponents are okay they can make mistakes but they are still pretty fast too
the art graffitilike visual effects certainly makes this game looks unique i really love the trail lights coming from behind of the cars which reminds me of nfs world
i like the part where before you join a race you actually join a meetup in singleplayer and you can see the story behind the racers that you are going to race and see their cars too
delivering cars mission in this game were suprisingly fun for me
now there are lots of pedestrian walking and cars driving in the roads which makes the city feel more alive i guess
new cars such as mitsubishi eclipse gsx mazda rx8 spirit r nissan z prototype 400z lamborghini countach lpi 800 and bmw m1 are all my favourite cars when i see them in game man do i love it hopefully they add more exciting cars in the future even though i dont have any high hopes sadly toyota is still missing and at this point i dont think they are coming back strikeimagine driving the new toyota corolla gr new gr86 or lexus lfa in this game it would be amazing isnt hmm wink wink toyotastrike

getting money to buy cars or upgrades can be a little bit challenging
the story is alright cant stand the dialogue in the game but its not too bad but not amazing either
soundtrack does not fit my taste i only found 34 songs that i actually like and listen to put it on neutral because each people has different taste
nfs unbound has this system where you need to manage money and do racing event properly like earn money buy cars and get upgrades etc unlike nfs heat where you can switch day and night freely in nfs unbound you can only switch day and night once which progress through the whole day and week that can pressured the players if they didnt do things properly the first time i play this game i had to reset my save because i made a mistake of buying the wrong car and through out the week in game im struggling to keep up with the ai in this game until i reset look up through guides and correct my mistake
the part where you need to prepare car for each class throughout the week and preparing the money to participate in races also quite contribute to the pressure of playing this game
the ending of this game kinda feel underwhelming
despite liking the grafitti style of the game i dont like the smoke grafitti style that much but its in neutral area because i can switch it off only with mods

have to launch it with ea app which is horrible
in nfs heat players could showcase the cars they owned in the background of players garage or the cars that were owned by the crews where is that feature now in nfs unbound sadly its gone you can only show one car that you drive currently i kinda wish players can still showcase cars they owned in the background again like in nfs heat because seeing your car in the background of your garage while you are working on your current car or just looking around is actually a cool small feature
snapshotcamera mode is getting worst its miserable for people who love taking screenshots in the game because its worst compared to nfs heat they should have learned it from crew 2 and forza horizon which has done a great job time day change filters motion blur bodywork damage visibility driver visibility weather control etc
i feel like there are no sense of speed in this game so far nfs games that had great sense of speed that i played are nfs pro street nfs shift series nfs 2015 and nfs heat with pro street and shift both being my favourite i saw some people comment on how highway races in nfs unbound felt boring and i kinda feel the same way for me personally because the absence sense of speed where you supposed to feel the adrenaline and slowly losing control of your car as you are going faster its suppose to be a mixed between tension and excitement once you go over 200
grip handling getting better but drift handling not so much still acceptable though
if you keep making mistakes or bad decision not spending hard earned money wisely atleast storywise you will not enjoy this game and your progression will be stuck
the in game car crash detection system is quite sensitive and the crash or rollover camera can make you feel irritating
the constant and random spawning of cops only around me made it feel tedious it kinda feels like cops know your actual location but pretend that they dont know until they saw you instead of actually just patroling around the city or the road kinda like nfs heat

the wierdo morons at ea really need to stop putting stories in their racing games im 100 convinced the people who work on nfs games have never played a video game not surprising let alone a racing game id say they got the ideas for the physics from the electric zero smog green energy ebus these silicon valley type losers ride to work but the cars driving like that would be an improvement

#####

idk what others and old fanboys say this game is just fcking amazing the stlye graphics and music is just 1010 for me its a little bit unoptimized but hey a patch will fix that got the palace edition btw i did not regret buying that version cant wait to spend a lot of hours playing this game

#####

ive played every nfs game since underground 1 ill try my best to put all my thoughts into this review

1 driving  pretty much as expected from a nfs game
it can be pretty fun nothing impressive very similar to the heavier steering feel in the recent nfs games ive also had a few moments when im driving 200 kmh and the car decides to start oversteering and send me into a wall

2 races  decent 
diversity is lacking but i like how the timeline itself is structured i also like that you are not expected to win if your car is not up to spec the ai is actually fast and doesnt need the rubber banding we got used to in nfs games

3 graphics  terrible
there is no toggle for the comic book effects this is the main reason i dislike this game
we went from filmed cutscenes in the 2000s to characters drawn in paint i dont know how they could come up with such an idea
aside from this the game looks good but its not impressive if we compare the night time graphics to nfs 2015 i think i actually prefer that one

4 story  great
i quite like it cant say too much without spoiling but it reminds me of an oldschool nfs game 
there are a few cringy dialogues but maybe i am getting too old for this

5 customization  strike great strike ok but worse in comparison
imo nfs still has the best visual customization in the racing genre that being said i feel its lacking compared to the latest titles heat has a lot more variation of course i havent had time to explore all the cars so strike ill update this review if my opinion changes strike
update its worse than i thought seems like they focused more on bodykits than individual parts but most bodykits are outright hideous some cars have great individual customization but most get a meh from me definitely worse than previous titles

6 police chases  decent
not much changed in this aspect only thing new is it displays the type of police cars that can show up depending on heat level i feel there are way too many police cars in free roam but that might just be personal preference

7 open world  pathetic
its very small by modern standards its probably comparable to undercover but dont quote me on that and doesnt have a lot of diversity compared to nfs payback its worse by every metric i can think of

8 no fast travel  
when you leave the garage for a race it spawns you at the nearest safehouse however if you want to do another event after thats on the other side of the map you have to drive to it it took me around 3 hours to get bored of the map because of always needing to drive the same main roads back and forth

overall cant recommend it im not buying another nfs game until they ditch this art style or at least let me toggle it off somehow

#####

absolute trash

ea go suck my ball

its ok

not even worth playing when its free for the weekend

shove the cops up your developing phat arse

#####

i believe that i owe an apology for saying payback is a hitty game in my previous review now i know unbound is much worse its a shameful downgrade version to its predecessor heat with that ugly animation and boring gameplay

#####

probably the worst need for speed ive ever played alongside heat and payback after playing most wanted 2005 carbon 2006 and forza horizon 5 a week ago i can say that the controls in this game feels really bad how can one come up with idea that the only way to turn is to drift my muscle memory for controls from 20052006 nfs doesnt make me feel confused when hopping to forza horizon 5 but here its just like im driving a howercraft from the crew 2 that need extreme angles to turn and im not the only one who feels same just look at mods that people make that overhaul drift and overall handeling
cops existance in this game is a joke the thing they can do is turn around for half an hour hitting every tree every car and every road sign and their ai is made to only breakcheck you then dont push you they just follow you hoping that youd go fast enough to loose them
story campaing in this game is easy to predict and feels like you are being held as an absolute degenerate with people saying bro shit bitch etc in every single sentence events in the story serve zero purpose yaz is such a lame character and the whole drama around cars being stolen and she saying she isnt involved feels like a conversation between 10 year olds that argue over a toy or something your new companion is well lets just say i was hoping to the very end that she isnt so dumb as she speaks the whole mayor thing exists for nothing and the story just contradict with itself people race just to be seen express themselves and dare to danger normal people to do that mayor says that her top priority is to keep citizens save and she is being presented as a bad guy that doesnt let kids drive around the city demolishing everything on their way 
battlepass in singleplayer game just wow thank god people found the way to unlock everything
music is so bad that you cant even believe people listen to this some trap song ukranian rap german rap arabic rap may allah forgive us that this exists and generic western rap with 2 verses containing 10 words and the rest of it is just chorus that repeats 56 times the game just pretends to be respectful to different cultures but makes a bad work of showing people what this game is all about riding in rockport and listening to decadence just shows that the game and whole thing that its trying to show you is grim you were betrayed now you have to fight your way to the top carbon show a different perspective a chilling rithm of easternlike compositions in the canyons dance vibes from riding around wolfs territory rock on 21st street and the mix of dance trans and whole spectrum of other genres on kenjis territory and here in unbound i can only relate to the song we want some money because this game is just a grind fest
the only undeniable fact that i cannot resist is this games artstyle only poeple that deserve their money designers and whoever made the models for cars in this game this is the only thing that makes unbound worthy of a legacy on underground 12 and 20052006 nfs series both in character and visual design cars look amaizing customization is insane bodykits looks otherworldly in a good way 
trying to pursue popular trends and making every community happy nfs series lost its identity and creativity with good storytelling worth it to buy only on a discount otherwise it is overprised mix of everything that makes good job of looking cool and playing really bad

#####

the tiktok of racing games

#####

pros
gameplay is great
graphics and visuals are very nice they did a great job with the graffiti effects looks really cool
many cars oldtimer muscle jdm new supercars
great car customization performance  looks  sound
divers map
great music out of 70 soundtracks i only dont like 3 


cons
unreliable ea server
aap rocky cant drive haha i played on the hardest difficulty and he still manages to crash his car makes the s races very easy to win he needs to learn how to drive asap


overall this game is just pure fun

#####

tried cause its free for the weekend hoping it would bring back some nice memories of old nfs games

after 10 minutes i hate it

1 how the funk do you restart your account start a new save game i guess multiple people would not be able to play on the same account cause you cant have more than one save dumbest thing i have ever encountered

2 the driving undergroundmost wanted and even pro street had a mixture of simish but not overly arcade driving here you just drift like in many recent nfs games how does this make any sense in anything other than a mobile game even those are bad now overall it just feels bad

3 i get that someone thought that people liked most wanted for the police stuff but there it had a purpose be the most freaking wanted why do you get chased by police after every damn race

4 the cartoon effects look cool but you cant really see where youre going if there is a huge cartoon drawing covering half the screen 

i dont know how a franchise can be ruined so hard ea is just an awfully run company so much talent wasted in this game the design even with the cartoony stuff could have been a cool concept but somehow it feels like such a mess 

overall just a lot of great ideas some totally dumb ones lots of good effort and cool visuals and bad decisions blended into a mess of a game its a shame most of what could make a good game is there but they chose to do it the ea way

if there was an option to just modify whatever car you wanted and freely race it with a couple of friends in whatever modes you want to set up id consider buying it

#####

when youre trying desperately to find any flaws and the only one thing that bothers you is music

#####

i stumbled upon this game after searching for something to bring me back to midnight club from days of old i dont game much these days so i have nothing to go off for nfs in recent years i think the last one i played was hot pursuit yes im old lol ive been playing rocket league because i usually like sports games but i needed a change and this one was on sale 

anyway this game has definitely impressed me so far no its not the same as midnight club in terms of the rockstaresque style and energy but it comes damn close and is in the same vein of playful ghetto street ambiance the whip customization and variance between driving styles is a huge perk for replayability you have a huge stock of free cars to play with as you go through the game paint and decals are free so  can be saved for actually upgrading cars love that and the graphics are insanely good cops are tough but not impossible the radio jammer fixes their annoyance immediately 

a lot of people on here complaining about things like replay limit and cops which is kinda weird maybe just get better at the game and adapt to it i think like all review sections this one is rife with entitled nolifers who always have something to complain about there has clearly been a lot of energy put into this revamp of a game and its sad to see so many people hating it cuz its different

i will say that some of the abrasive sound design choices are a little distracting and over the top specifically the start screen chaos every time you play the game i hate that i have to spam the xa button to not hear that noise pollution but for real thats maybe my only complaint that and the fact audi is not in the mix i love audis cant have em all i guess

all in all im happy that this game was made at a time when i was looking to get back into racing games it sure beats gran turismo 1 where i basically raced my fully upgraded dodge viper in circles for hours and hours with the dullest soundtrack youve ever heard and that game was considered revolutionary you kids dont know how good you got it nowadays

#####

controls are bugged cant use controler and camera gets weird on pc will wait a few days for them to fix it because lol

#####

worse game plz dont buy it even heat and payback is better than this ea releasing same game every year and make it even more worse plus this denuvo sht is pathetic game has micro stutters it annoys me even i have a high end system plz dont buy

#####

my ass is itchy please help

#####

great game but the core gameplay still the same old handling physics its frustrating the transition between drift and grip is weird and doesnt feel natural which makes me lose control like it has mind of its own although im pro nfs player and been playing every game for decade with the same handling model which they still cant get right i think its worth buying when discounted and project unite mod fixes its handling and turn it simcade
cops after heat lvl 3 spawn every where even after evading them even choppers gets spawned its crazy i keep looking at the map and changing routes to avoid them but sometimes they get spawned all around me thats too much doesnt matter easy medium hard difficulties its still too many cops

#####

this franchise at its worst

how to enjoy modern nfs games
wait for massive discount 
turn off music volume
turn off dialogue volume
turn off subtitles 
skip all cutscenes
play your own music or better classic nfs playlist
enjoy

#####

you will start enjoying the game after you reach the week 4 where you can play in s tier then the fun of the thrill and speed starts otherwise before than that the game feels slow and boring so you must give it atleast 10 hours of your time to actually start enjoying the game

i know everyone is criticizing the game because of the artstyle and music but the thing is one can not keep making the same style of games some  people may like it some may not so its ok  not every  game is meant for everyone 

its a good game though  you can try

#####

i really enjoyed playing this game it gave me the vibe of underground racing scene animecartoon effect was a really cool and fresh thing graphic design in the menu and stuff are top notch and trendycool
sucks that bstoryb is quite short but atleast its longer than heat every racer had their purpose in the underground league of racing  trying to prove to their people that everyone struggles with something and their will to prove themself is quite inspiring the story itself was less confusing than in heat the ai can be quite pain if you dont get a decent car in s class
bdrivingb is okayish i really hated default tap gasbreak to drift after playing loads of forza good thing you can turn it off its no longer meta to handbreak to turn like in heat 
bcustomisationb is way better than in heat much more options you can now remove parts wo using any glitches wraps are almost the same like in heat but with more options aswell 
bsoundtrackb i cant say it sucks the game has some good selection of songs i agree some of them are quite wierd and out of the vibe but most part of soundtrack really fits i will defo put some of them into my playlist iyea yea its not like in most wanted bla bla bla who cares if you love it so much go finish it for the 20th timei i paid full price and im happy really enjoyable way to spend my free time definitely recommend it

#####

with the approach of vol 4 i thought i would share my experience of the game

before i start the actual review if you are going to play this game and care about your progress i highly recommend you create save backups there are instances where your save will just get deleted and the cloud will be useless in that case create save backups

in addition there could be several other issues where for example the game wont start in my own experience i found out that the official forums usually have a fix usually

on to the actual review

first of all get the game on sale dont bother with the dlc unless you really want to get them or want to support the creators

the graphics are actually really good the cars look jawdropping and while you may hate the cartoon style characters at first you actually get used to them and begin to think that they make a good contrast to the game world character customisation is also fairly decent minus the clothing options also an important note the cartoon car effects could be disabled

soundtrack is it is not for everyone definitely not for me so i mute the music and put on my own music from previous games but you might enjoy it if not you can just do what i do

car customisation is great there are a few missing things but the way the updates are going it will be fine

the gameplay and difficulty is rather unexpected the handling is different than the previous two games but once you get used to it you enjoy it i have heard from my friends that the game is surprisingly difficult but if you ask me it is closer to that arcade racing game feel which is i believe what the developers were aiming for i enjoy it

you need internet to play the game even in single player which could be annoying and trust me you will be spending more time in online as of now the online racing in about doing linkups but i believe they are going to fix it

all in all it is a nice game under no circumstances perfect but nice it needs more work more polishing more options just give it time the game has potential while it would be unfair to compare it to the previous games i believe it could be what nfs world could not well see if it lives up to it

but again buy it on sale and create save backups

#####

nfs unbound has succesfully unbounded my ballsack

#####

small update to my previous opinion the game itself isnt great its handling is truly annoying not fun at all the visuals are really good game looks so much better than previous nfs titles online isnt extremely enjoyable but its fine the way it is right now for a casual player i didnt try singleplayer yet so ill update the review with it one day

#####

best one since hot pursuit 2010 criterion nailed it hope this game gets a much broader postlaunch support than heat

#####

h1 review need for speed unbound h1

ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ foreword
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ small review if you cant be bothered to read the rest
soundtrack 
a notable improvement over heats while heats music was 95 ass nfs unbounds soundtrack i would say is like 40 ass i barely skipped songs and i even came out of the game with a couple new personal favorites of course its no most wanted 05 but hey its good 

plot 
not incredible but definitely not bad i will admit though that i liked heats a bit more i liked the seriousness of it the stakes were a nice incentive to keep going not that this one had bad stakes how could i say no to a story with mw05 tones i love it when the objective is taking something back it makes it feel personal the characters were great too way better than heats in fact i loved rydell easily my favorite character its not every day that you feel a connection with an nfs character lol

ambience 
simply perfect every single element of this game is a well oiled cog for a well oiled machine everything works to build ambience the driving effects the lighting engine the speedlines around the screen the character designs the models can be eh at times but they grow on you the dialogue the custom score and licensed tracks everything builds up this amazing atmosphere of street and car culture simply sensational

gameplay and game feel 
although theyve done a great job with it criterion cant help being criterion like it or not this game still keeps a couple of burnout traditions the crash cams and the takedowns although the latter is not a full feature in itself 
handling this time around is pretty good although not as good as heats at least in my opinion more variety you can really tell they wanted you to be able to choose between grip builds and drift builds pretty comfortably dont believe what youtubers will tell you both ways are good to beat the game easy to access and perfectly viable i have some thoughts on the week system but thosell be down in the big wall of text

graphics 
what can i say game pretty just like i said in the ambience section everything works and it contributes towards building a game that looks and sounds amazing my particular favorites were the driving effects the ui and the garage menu the fact that your car is in this weird box with walls that display text its just perfect
its so close to giving me that classic 05 menu feel great stuff

worth the full price
honestly yeah i prebought it the second it was made available youll get more than enough game and quality

ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ b end of the foreword
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ on to the big wall of text boys there will be plot spoilers b

so i beat it and i got a couple of thoughts let it be known that i am a bit emotional the ending did get me 
i was invested since the beginning they make you choose a starter car and win a few races with it customize it visually the engine upgrades are on the house for now and you really get attached to the machine and the characters too rydell is honestly the nicest man and maybe i love him a bit too much hahah and yaz is written in a way that makes her feel pretty real she will laugh bicker get emotional with you she really feels like a real personality

then the betrayal comes honestly its pretty well executed especially that one dialogue when the garage has just been emptied between rydell and yaz i dont know them then a randome guy screams yaz lets go and rydell says they just said your name and it really comes through the voice acting how much it affects rydell the game is full of these little pieces of writing that give it a lot of charm and charisma 

after that the main chunk of the game takes place sadly what i giveth i taketh and i do have something to take here im gonna talk about the progression 

h1 the progression system h1

so i am conflicted regarding this aspect of the game the week system is it has its ups and downs lets start with the ups 
list 
 pressure you can really feel the pressure coming through specially during the first week races are hard you will rarely end up first place and the price money takes a huge hit through the entry money yes folks youre gonna have to pay to race for the first race of the day itll have to come from your bank however after that when you make your first earning of the day every other payment that you need to do will come from your volatile money a number displayed in red in the top right corner of the screen so as i was saying that first week is tough prize money is low and entries are high you wont finish first most of the times and on top of that the police is always on your ass and if they bust you spoiler lol it aint gonna happen spoiler you lose all your volatile however even if its a harsh first week i never thought it felt unfair challenging sure but not unfair
 structure honestly the fact that its weeks divided in days that are divided is a positive in the sense that it also adds to the atmosphere you have no time to waste youre gonna need that money and a good enough car for the qualifier at the end of the week sadly thisll not be the last time you see structure come up in this review
list

not much to go off i know and if you feel bad i felt bad too because i didnt really like the week system

cons
list
 cops yeah they are here i have a problem with the cops in this game more than one problem in fact i have many problems first theyre too damn easy i played in normal and let me tell you after that first though week the cops lose any form of intimidation they may have had before and they just become a freaking drag its not something you have to fight to survive its something you have to deal with bear with even they will die to a couple pushes and give you a full meter of burst nos you can outrun them as soon as you get an a class car and the worst part of it all they wont hop off your bum literally 90 of my chases were just chase starts  i outrun them  i go into hiding and then one out of two things happen a a cop spawns right in front of me on the opposite lane and the cooldown stops resuming the pursuit or b the worst one the cooldown bar empties the chase finishes i pick a new destination and oh oops hehe an undercover unit spawns right around the next corner and since their spotting time is so low they start an entirely new chase i have had this happen to me up to three times in a row its very annoying not to mention that the game purposefully spawns cops al along your route to the next destination you better learn that map because using the gps  just picking a fight with the lpd
nearing the end of the story youll unlock the increase spotting time part get that in your most used cars as soon as possible itll make the undercover cop problem more manageable although it wont completely erase it 
 day structure admittedly this might not be as big a problem if you havent played nfs heat before as i said before the week days are split in day and night nfs heat had a similar structure although there you could choose to go out either during the day or at night to gather either rep or money here youll go out in the daylight do anything you need to do and when you go to a garage youll switch to night with no chance of going back this system would be okay if you could choose to enter a garage without changing the time of day but you cant if you earn even a single dollar during the day and head to a garage youll change the time of day wanna make a couple of changes to your engine setup get a new car for a different race during the day nope youll have to finish the day 
 the g r i n d

#####

one step forward two steps back tired and sick of ea

#####

ea launcher makes the game literally unplayable it played fine for 2 hours then when i tried to launch it again the ea app keeps saying im offline and it wont launch again cant even refund because its been more than 2 hours thanks ea app totally useless

#####

first off gameplay is amazing it feels like like nfs heat but with tighter controls and better drifting mechanics the graphics are drop dead gorgeous effects are super cool and you can unlock like over 70 different colorseffect types people complaining about them can just turn them off in the settings

sound track slaps 

story is cringe but interesting enough to kinda care about what is going on the city is beautiful and huge but it starts to all blend together after a bit i personally liked heats city more 

my only main issues are that the cop ai is so stupid you can sit still and they will lose you the difficulty is insane even on normal i had to switch to easy just to not rage quit no joke and they for some reason only give you 4 retrys per race so if you retry it more than 3 times thats it you have to place whatever you get on that 4th try which i find so stupid why force the player to move forward like that but thats pretty much it for my complaints 

all in all its very addicting and i would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the nfs series

#####

the physics sucks and it is same as nfs heat

#####

with soooo where do i start
based on my own opinion
this nfs was even more fucked up than payback
1 bad optimization
2 it runs poorly dont let anyone tell me that my computer sucks when cyberpunk 2077 runs at ultra 70fps
3 those certain effects cannot be turned off even though they promised that they would be available
4 loads a lot so you can get your hands on fallout 76
5 the music seems to have been put together by a group of preschoolers #kindergarden
its like the chair squeaks and every track is n n and n
6 even though i paid 80 euros for the palace edition i didnt get any extras nor the legendary bmw m3 gtr
specifically i got the base game
this is pathetic
 7 the refund took place quite quickly so i was able to buy other light years better games from it
cue
if you want a good car game be it arcade or simulator choose assetto corza forza horizon old nfs series gran turismo believe me this game is not worth 70 euros or 35 on sale 

#####

truly fcking sad even for ea standards i paid 20 and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone 
i mean if the goal was to create an annoying boring and uninspired piece of shit then this is a huge success

swing and a miss compared to heat and 2015  racing feels like a low priority here and instead youll find yourself either constantly evading the police or having to micromanage the hell out of your routes in freeroam because cops spawn like civilians  im talking 5 cops per quarter mile at times  and your heat builds up way too fast in this game just a few races in a 69 mustang and i had 3 corvette interceptors 2 offroad interceptors and a helicopter chasing me  mind you escaping the police is not hard it just takes forever because their sight lines are obnoxiously large the cooldown takes way too long and like i just mentioned cops spawn absolutely everywhere literally to the point where you will sometimes see them spawn in you thought heat was obnoxious  lol you have no idea

and the cops are absolute kamikazes during races believe me in my 4 hours of ingame time i already lost track of how many times a cop has absolutely launched off a cliff or some sort of edge right in front of me completely perpendicular to me and parked directly in front of me as im going 175mph down a straightaway  and every time i absolutely careen into them causing a huge crash which by the way forces you into a cutscene surely killing them which seems to be their goal most of the time  not only is that not fun its just not how cops are supposed to work in racing games period the end

the physics also seem to be slightly worse than nfs heat or at least they feel less consistent  sometimes youll have to really wrestle your car into a drift while other times itll suddenly go completely sideways for no reason  and just like heat dont even think about trying to grip your way through turns its just impossible to keep a decent pace that way since youll just perpetually understeer while the forced stability control constantly disregards your throttle inputs  that said the best way to describe the driving physics of this game is imprecise  theres also this weird antiinertia thing going on where the game really wants to straighten you out as you exit a drift so connecting drifts is extremely frustrating and feels about as responsive as steering an aircraft carrier

then theres the ai  my god  the ai practically puts their cars in park when taking turns in front of you and you will slam into them because they are always right on the racing line but then they have the straight line speed of a rocket ship so theyll just get right back out in front of you rinse and repeat  and because of that antiinertia effect i just mentioned once you hit the ai good luck getting back into a drift and have fun being stuck in the most frustratingly unresponsive understeer of your life  but theres more  they rubberband just as bad as the cops  theres also the fh5esque runaway first place problem where the 1st place ai will pull so far away from you and the rest of the pack on lap 1 no matter what even if youre already way ahead of everyone else that you will have to pray that they get into a huge crash so you can catch up  if they dont you will have no shot catching them  but even more annoyingly if you do get out in front of everyone staying in first is a cakewalk unless the police or traffic screw you over  also fun fact  the ai can and does skip checkpoints and the traffic patterns are completely rigged against you so youre also having to play frogger at all points in time

alright look the game isnt hard its not like you cant just cheese your way to the front by slamming into the ai a few times because you can and you probably will find yourself doing that  but the thing is that is exactly why the races arent fun  because thats not racing and this is not a racing game  this is an action driving game  and that sucks

the story and dialogue dont need to be discussed  theyre both abysmal and you already knew that going into this game  its worse than heat  and yes apparently thats possible

such a shame  the graphics and aesthetic are absolutely sublime the visual customization is as amazing as always the sound design is fantastic and the game seems to be pretty well optimized but it needs serious rebalancing  at the moment it just feels like its trying to be more of an epic gamertastic action game and less of a racing game  maybe thats what some people want and maybe itll draw more people into the series i dont know and i dont care  its not a good racing game its a step down from heat and the series is still caught at the bottom of its plummet from the 20032006 era of nfs  oh well

#####

the worst aaa experience i have seen in at least the last decade and the worst major racing game i have ever played in my 33 years alive i had to uninstall the game and will never buy an ea game again for at least 5 years because i feel like ive been robbed by ea 

the game design is pure grinded up insanity whoever thought these game design decisions were good should be followed home to their family and given a knock on the door my question is this meant to be a casual arcade racer ie a video game or a gambling racing simulator that mimics going bankrupt and having to refinance your car to get by and eat and having your license suspended by cops who are willing to kill you over speeding i consider myself a nerd one who is pretty good at games ive played tons of racing games before many nfs such as ug2 mw forza test drive unlimited i even used to race a lot online on project gotham racing and had an a rank on that game yet i found this games difficulty actually absurd who tf is this game for

i play zoomers in video games they arent that good like im still trying to figure out what exactly is expected of a player such as myself when you have an ai that rubberbands like this can wipe out on traffic and then immediately teleport to a mile ahead or just drive through the other cars at a 100 mph like a tank and not even slow down

in the meantime and i will make this clear cops who engage in the races do not target the ai players they only target you regardless of your placing in the race your car will be targeted even if youre dead last cops will fly from off the screen to plow into you im already in fucking dead last what do you want

this is not to mention that civilian cars will not spawn in any driving lines that the ai uses they will only spawn on your lines many people complain that they will take blind corners and immediately hit into traffic thats because this game is spawning cars on your lines and they know that criterion decided this was to keep the game engaging for you so youd have to randomly figure out how to change your lines in split seconds all the time that would be fine if traffic rendered at a reasonable distance it doesnt even the highlighting borders of the track can visually render in front of you as youre driving this game engine is hideous for a racing game as it simply cannot keep up with the need to render the environment and objects quickly enough for a racing game 

even worse is the lighting in this game is atrocious during the day time in tunnels traffic is pitch black on an oled where blacks are truly black it becomes almost impossible for my old man eyes to see where tf this traffic is to avoid because there are no lights around these cars or even your own car is this a glitch or game design i actually couldnt tell 

this is just the beginning of the insanityyou have to bet money on races meaning you can lose money in a video game can you retry well yea4 times per two cycles yup thats all  and any crash in a race will guarantee you will lose money so you have this insane pressure to perform and not mess up with all these crap that i just described above as the ai drives completely perfect with cheats enabled for them earning any money becomes such a nightmare and is a slow and painful grind the money you can win can all be lost before you even get it because you must end the daynight cycle and return to your garage to cash your earnings for the day but ofc you will gain heat from races and cops will begin to chase you as they see you no problem avoid the cops yeah good luck its like theres a state of emergency and theres cops literally fucking everywhere in this game it becomes such a chore to avoid the cops because you will have and im not exaggerating 5 cops spawn in 10 seconds around you as you drive who tf balanced this garbage cops will chase you for at least a few mins depending on the difficulty and yes even in the beginning of the game you can easily hit level 5 heat keep in mind that at lvl 3 heat you will face z06 cops imagine being chased in the first 4 hours by z06s with your shit bag civic like what level 4 has fucking helicopters and i faced that in my first 10 hrs while i was still in my shit bag civic and if you get caught guess what you lose all the money you earned wooooooooooooooooooooooo sounds so fun right 

if this is a call back to the older nfs titles like mw guess what happens when you get caught by the cops oh right you just start the chase again and nothing happens in this game nope because it thinks its not a video game and there has to be consequences for you losing even quitting out and going back in the developers fuck you they will remove your restarts completely make you lose money for quitting without saving etc yes im serious they will fucking wreck you and you will not be able to do the events again if you quit out to the title screen because you have to face the consequences of losing in a video game

the game comes up to the boss fight at the end of the first week which you need 20k for and a good car for guess what happens when you either a dont have enough money for the event or b just lose the event it takes you back to the previous day and you are now stuck in an unlimited loop of grinding the same fucking races for that money or to upgrade your car ive read nightmares of people doing this day 20 times over losing money to cops not being able to win the event having to upgrade their car a bunch still 

so what do we learn from this the ultimate consequence to you losing in this game is your fucking time and forcing you to do repeat the same gameplay until youre so sick of it and want to kys thanks criteron this is such a fun game you fucking brts 

oh yea the developer is brtish and wanna know something i learned about this game that goes back to its nfs underground roots they even called this game unbound to make you think its like underground but out of the 143 cars in this game 80 yes fucking eighty of them are european what the fuck the put a fucking old ass volvo in this game over a mitsubishi 3000 gt a honda prelude 03 eclipse the fucking nissan 300zx 

the nissan 300zx a legendary tuner car is not in this race and fucking mini cooper is in this game think about it dont tell me the developer bias didnt come to play there are 33 american cars with fucking 6 of these being mclarens and 30 yes thirty japanese cars total in the 143 car roster 13 of those are fucking nissans btw 

tuning cars and racing them like this has always been a jdm dominated scene and underground had a jdm dominated roster to reflect that and then american cars but for some reason this game thinks this scene is about tricking out a lambo and a ferrari its fucking not and this is so disconnected from reality its unbelievable 

oh and from what im reading apparently the civic type r the car i chose as my starter is one of the worst cars to pick and one of the best a fucking old ass beetle yeaaa so not only does the roster number reflect bias of these brt fucks but the game balance does as well apparently the civic type r is so bad that people said playing this game with that car is like playing on hardcore difficulty and european cars across every class are all top tier vehicles 

forgot about trying to customize your car tuning it taking it a track like in underground and doing lap races for fun having access to the whole roster of cars and being able to just enjoy this game you cant practice run on a track in this car you will have no money to buy any of the limited poor variety of customization available in this game seriously ug2 had way more customization than this game and thats a fifteen year old game 

and i havent even mentioned the zoomer cringe in this wreck of a game



#####

firstly i wanted to address the downside this is one of the hardest need for speed ever the difficulty is like that of nfs mw 2012 or maybe harder i should git gud or ea should give balancing updates i didnt know that i just bought a soulslike racing game 
the cops are also everywhere after you gain more than 1 heat level you will be driving hiding and dodging cops in which can be assisted by the use of your map radar also after you escape the cops looking at your map radar where cops are patrolling everywhere makes you feel like playing a pacman game with highend graphics

otherwise the game is fine if you like nfs heat then youll probably like this game too the soundtrack is not that bad if you enjoy listening to mainstream and current trend songs if not then spotify does exist brudda as for the visual effects and animestyle characters i personally love it as they give a fresh feel to the current racing game market

for handling who cares its a need for speed an arcade racing game anyway the handling is more varied than nfs heat for eg in nfs heat you can drift with any car but not in unbound i actually prefer the drift handling from nfs heat though

#####

ok but dont pay full price

#####

old days are better than now 

#####

i owned it for 3 hours 1 hour was character tutorial then first car tinkering the next 2 hours was messing with settings and restarts because of the constant stutterfreezing game is basically unplayable at this time according to reddit im not alone

#####

 driving effects is a new things in nfs unbound
 car modification more out of the box bumper delete
 more new cars for play with
 police cars more reliable to runaway

 handling sucks your car will always be understeer everytime you turn even you set to 100 drift 
 story to short
 drifting in this game is a big big issues
 online multiplayer is worst than nfs heat because you need to search other 7 player to play with you
 race on online multiplayer now using playlist so you need to race 3 times before you get the prize and thats a thumbs down for me

#####

overall the game is really fun cops are a bit too easy even on the hardest difficulty and they dont really work together like previous games i think that all of them having their own strengths and weaknesses is pretty cool and in a future update they could change the ai to work together and use said strengths the real stars of the game are the art direction and the amazing nos mechanic the art is very different in this game compared to old nfs games and isnt as game breaking as people might seem i originally thought it was dumb but grew to really like it the other thing is the nos mechanic the two different types work really well together and when mastered you can almost always have a good bit of it ready to go overall 657 out of 10 lots of things done right but can be improved on and is an average arcade racer with some small improvements to the genre i cant recommend it at 70 but when on sale definitely pick it up

#####

the nfs gameplay is there but wow the devs are pathetic it took 2 months for 2 cars to be nerfed and thats it what kind of free update is that then now we have to wait another 2 months with no details on whats coming not sure why devs love to kill their games too many things in this game need to be fixedimproved the future of this game is already gone

edit vol 2 updates are lackluster but did improve the game not saying much still leaving a negative review until the posted races are not covering the car stats

edit2 i was going to change it to a thumbs up because they finally fixed the ui issue from my last edit half a year later but they cant even post the update news to the right game why is unbound news under nfs heat eacriterion get it together

#####

playing unbound is pretty much exactly like that one time i unknowingly purchased shower gel containing menthol extract and it gave me all sorts of unexpected  strange sensations in my butt hole 

not necessarily a bad thing

#####

pretty fun game although cops stick to you really well if you have heat 4 or 5 races are difficult even if your car rating is higher than everyone elses because opponents stick to you like a thread only complaint is that when they get anywhere above 300 yds ahead of you its impossible to overtake opponents and you just have to restart limited restarts is also another issue because of the aforementioned problem

#####

i played for 11 minutes and the dialogue already made me wanna die and the game ran like garbage too not to mention how clunky the drifting mechanic feels

#####

best modern nfs series yet
the cell shading character and cartoon effect suprisingly works well in game
customization is on another level but missing some parts on few cars like sunline kit for r34 as example and some cars like subaru brz and rx7 doesnt have new body kit option no new aftermarket wheels too
physics is improved from heat that finally you can set your car fully grip but sometimes the car is acting weird still needs more improvement
the world lakeshore city is really nice to explore
perfomance optimalization on pc version is really good
soundtrack suprisingly works with the vibes in the game
cops is good but not as hard as heat 
i dont really like the story in this series
photo mode feature has downgraded a lot from heat i hope codemaster can work with criterion with this to improve photo mode like adding feature like shutter speed and bringing back old photo mode features
progression is really solid and slow which is i like



overall the game itself is very addicting and look very fresh than any current racing games
85  10

#####

the game was alright and nothing special the game felt underwhelming than nfs heat i had ea play to test out the game on early access the game feels like a tik tok culture game and it is very short the pursuits feel weak than nfs heat online mode was miserable because racing depends on people being present and there is no ai bots to race compared to nfs heat the online mode races had ai bots and players to race online mode is player dependent honestly this game is not worth the 70 or 80 if desperate to buy the game get it on sale instead 

pros
 ai bots in story mode are competitive
 lots of customization options
 added some new cars into game
 car rewards in story
 money system
 graphics

cons
 online mode is terrible
 online mode is player dependent
 car list is underwhelming and majority are reused from nfs heat
 story is very short
 cartoon effects unable to remove it and requires mods
 no skipping a bad soundtrack

neutral  questionable
 physics and handling improve
 game theme is tik tok culture
 soundtrack list it is a mix of international music around the world

#####

the positive parts about the game

solid enough gameplay
lots of cars
pretty big map
the aesthetics aint that bad once you get used to it
balanced cars compared to the previous games
rydell and holden parker iii those characters are the best
the police in this game are an upgrade from heat while they are annoying they arent as tanky as before

the bad parts about it

its soundtrack probably this has been mention hundreds of times but its just god awful
some parts from previous games got removed an example would be the cwest front bumper for the r34 the one that ty has in nfs payback
a lot of recycled cars from previous games
the story we have a villain that we never see or adds anything to the plot
politics in a racing game



overall a decent game for any petrolheads out there although its not worth the 70 price tag it has so get it when its on sale wish they added an option to play your own music since games like burnout paradise or nfs most wanted 2012 in the ps3 let you play your own music

#####

i hope they update the multiplayer experience

 cops in multiplayer
 better matchmaking to fill lobbies now mostly 1 or 2 people join the races
 challenges you can do  special events
 you respawn way to fast its okay


#####

try the 2012 and 2013 versions instead of this one

#####

after few hours of gameplay i can write down a little review
ive stopped playing any nfs games that were released after nfsundercover every ea title went down down and down
nfsu  nfsu2  nfsmw were the top of the top really simple yet enjoyable games so far

ive been back into nfs since this month with unbound
a lot of people may say its too much cartoonish but i find it really cool
its a simple funny and interesting game with a plenty of customizations the plot is really good and if you have the money for it i really recommend you to buy it really worth it

#####

overall its a good game but still has connectivity issues almost always due to the ea app and leans a little too hard into the how do you do fellow kids vibe

#####

better than heat in every way

 cars are unique and feel fantastic to drive sense of speed is really good when using the nitrous not so much otherwise
 the best campaign structure pacing and progress in a modern racing game satisfying risk reward gameplay loop
 cops become a big annoyance from about midgame onwards
 story is alright but a lot of the dialogue is delivered very flat and a lot of it is cringe
 good variety of open world events such as speed zones speed traps jumps etc
 grip handling is good and viable brake and gas to drift are still here for those that prefer it
 drifting physics are quite unsatisfying cars dont have inertia and it feels like youre fighting the car when you try drifting as a result i didnt do a single drift event
 good variety of cars from jdm classics to modern euro cars to exotics but a few slots are the same car just the convertible version
 surprising lack of customisation when it comes to the driving effects none of them are carspecific so you cant mix and match the driving effects with a particular car theme you might be going for
 subjective but im disappointed in the lack of proper rally events
 surprisingly little variety of tracks given the size and density of the map by the time you reach midgame youd have raced on most of the tracks in the game
 the map is fine lakeshore looks and feels alive thanks to the pedestrians
 graphics are a step up from heat and overall fantastic given the lack of ray tracing dlss2 dlss3 and fsr2 are here to boost framerates game performs great i havent had a single stutter or crash
 the music is highly subjective but i found most of the tracks to be quite bad with a couple of good ones sprinkled it regardless it fits the game which is i guess what matters
 the online component seems a bit lackluster you can only party up with 4 people and lobbies max out at 16 people theres no matchmaking so you have to hope that people join when you queue up a race

tldr  both handling models grip and drift are viable fantastic campaign annoying cops alright story good open world activities good car list very stable performance

#####

the game itself looks and plays well but it feels like a step back from heat online is pointless its just forza unbound 

you cant do coop story for some reason they didnt want you to enjoy and play the main part of the game with friends 

as i said the game is fun to play and looks fantastic you get used to the effects quickly they did say you could disable them but didt implement it in true ea fashion

7510 a lot of things can be better and there needs to be a point in online imo

#####

the soundtrack makes me wish i was born without ears half the time but besides that the game is pretty darn good
the handling is really nice and overall better than heat and the cops well they are annoying as all hell in certain areas you can almost get to a point where its impossible to get past them to get to an event spoiler the mini cooper delivery for tess took me around 10 minutes of going back and forth to get to because cops were nonstop spawning around the only 2 paths to get to it spoiler but atleast the cops are quite easy to take down

#####

im not normally moved enough by a game to bother reviewing it but this title was so poorly handled that i feel like i should genuinely warn others not to buy it 70 usd for an incredibly short experience that effectively simulates late stage capitalism with how dogshit the payout for events are compared to how much there is to buy an embarrassing story and interactions that takes itself way too damn seriously and such a small selection of events that by the first qualifier youve already done every available race layout and will just be using faster cars from then on

race events themselves are pathetically easy even on the hardest setting meanwhile the police is coded to be less challenging and more annoying they can barely keep up with you seem to often randomly kill themselves without you doing anything and overall arent that intelligent they decided to compensate for this by spawning cop cars directly in your path every few seconds or so the moment you do finally get out of their sight regardless of where you were or where youre going and helicopters will happily reappear after only 510 seconds from when they leave a chase

this game is only tolerable with mods but guess what as if needing to launch another third party client that cant keep your account information saved for longer than a week after steam wasnt annoying enough already ea decided to shit out a new version that the existing mod client cant launch the game through so youre forced to deal with unbound the way it is i know the hot meme is to shit on unbound for the cartoon effects and bad soundtrack but i dont see nearly enough talk about any of these much bigger issues i just want to reiterate the game is flat out unplayable without mods but assuming you do feel like logging in to an extra client every time you want to launch it any mods you install wont work anyway 

tldr this shit isnt even worth pirating just get nfs heat or honestly just pick a different genre arcade racing as a genre is dead

#####

the game is alright however i work in the oilfield and spend a lot of time in places with little to no internet the game even in offline mode will not play because ea wont connect to the internet absolutley pathetic


#####

it feels numb to drive i used to love the franchise but again they fail to focus on whats the key feature in racing games the racing please stop making games until you figured that out no artist feature and no fashion label collaboration can make up for the lack of fun playing a game youve got to understand please

#####

refunded this trash so fast they ditched nfs heats life cycle for this i dont know how anyone can overcome the cringe and irritating effects that you cant even turn off weeb for speed more like

#####

really bad they force you use ea account and denuvo driving controls not good and it isnt feel fun to drive story boring and music is so bad that you need mute it in low difficulty there is still too much stress there is no soul in racing and feels like you play some gta because police always after you you cant use your upgraded story car in multi only ok thing is good graphics but it is not enough crazy price in this trash game

#####

unbound isnt a bad game but it hasnt even been a month since its release and its already 40 off

never again ea

#####

thanks for the continuing tradition

#####

fun af

#####

never thought that i got to see the day id be really excited with nfs series again after nfs mw 05 nfs unbound turned out to be really good despite the lacks of gameplay trailer and no reviews before released nfs unbound is the best modern nfs games a mix of cartoon and realistic is something that i liked in this game its unique as no other game has did this before seeing a cartoon wings appear while in airbone is pretty badass imo 

lakeshore city let gooo

#####

the problem of being faster than light is that you can only live in darkness

#####

car handling is still bad and doesnt feel controllable most of the timethe progression feels extremely sluggishthe money earnings are so low experimenting with different cars is impossiblelimited restarts are a thingwhich isnt bad on its own but then ai uses rubberbanding killing any sense of challenge if the game can screw you over at any pointcar balancing is a messtrack layouts start repeating from day 2 of the first week

on top of that add the usual nfs quality like ai teleporting out of existenceai not knowing how to take uturns without sliding off the roadgrip turn burst nitro bonus being applied whenever the game feels like itcops getting destroyed at randomand giving you free burst nitro even if you didnt do anything to themcollision issuesinconsistent ramming damage and constantly having to reapply wraps onto your car because the game keeps resetting them

so many issues with the game but at least your character can wear versace clothes

unless someone actually competent with a game engine made for racing games takes overthis franchise is dead

#####

i would not recommend buying this game the cons outweigh the pros in this title controls are completely useless you are not able to even make a turn without keeping your eyes on the map there visual queues for turns are not in sync with the actual game cars spawn randomly in your way and you have to fight just to stay in your current position ai has overpowered speed advantage at all times so good luck get first and keeping it without something knocking you off the track visuals are great but thats about it i would recommend forza or any other series nfs is dead in my opinion

#####

nfs is ded

pros 
story mode had a cool concept if not necessarily original cars handle decently once you turn off the weenie hut junior mode drift entry unless you like arcadey controls nitrous was actually pretty fresh take i appreciated art style was pretty cool tuning grip and drift felt natural car models and environment actually look pretty good

cons
couldnt finish the story and i tried voice acting was atrocious felt like a high school drama club attempting their first voiceover online is stale took months after launch to even get cops in online yet nothing has been improved aside from linkups and special races which are lacking regardless small game world while also not using about 30 of it for anything apart from story beats tracks are repetitive since they are limited to class some are shared adding to the monotony matchmaking is horrendous since the only pool of players to race are the ideally 15 other people in the server who are usually racing 1v1 just being chased around by cops or sitting in their garage

 if you dont mind repetitive tracks and customizingtuning decent looking models of cars might be for you pretty fun if you have a few friends to play with definitely not worth 70 especially a year later maybe 20 was gifted by a friend bless him glad i didnt spend it

#####

fun at first but then gets old real fast

list

 b cops are not here to actually stop you from speeding they are here to stop you from participating in more races than designers want you tob and my obsessive ass wants to get all big money but cant since starting from 4 heat you get helicopters above you and it starts to be real hard to get away from them 
if you have 5 heat and want to do one more race during the day instead of just driving to it you will run from cops for like 15 minutes those fuckers will call big ass trucks that you cant destroy and reinforcements come too quickly so they feel more like annoying thing than cool shit as it was in older games most wanted 2005

  btoo little race tracksb youve seen them all after like 56 hours come on

 b progress doesnt transfer from single player to multiplayerb grind twice bitch

  bcartoonish effects get old realb fast but they are ok and make this game distinguish from other games including forza but keep in mind that you cant disable them

  the whole writing in bthis game feels too wokeb and we support current thing kind of thing here we have acab ukraine support  eat rich cops are clowns insta not that i mind but feels really weird

  there is a lot of dialog and there were so many time bi just wanted to say shut the fuck upb

  bthe upgrade system is very bloated for arcade racing gameb you cant adjust drift vs grip directly and make you car behave good all the time you have to buy and balance fucking upgrades its annoying af and i wish it never existed i want to have 1 car that drives exactly how i like instead of having to setup a whole fucking garage just to race in different types of races 

i expected to finish with like 6 cars at the end of the game but instead i already mid game have 6 this game doesnt give you enough money to support big garage and you either grind and fight versus very predatory cops that are designed to not allow you to do that or lose a few races here and then 

the biggest let down for me was when i had perfectly fine mitsubishi lancer but sucked at long race because the race is challenging and i did a small woopsie and you car is 4 point from perfect car but you cant install anything that gives you less than 4 points and instead it moves your car in different tier

  now bi have to do math to see which races i should skip and which to visitb i do math at work i dont want to do math in vidya games

  i dont mind modern hiphop but this shits gets very old real fast i especially hate the alina pash  воїн song because its just too bad and doesnt fit well into the race and like in every other modern nfs  you cant have your own music in game you either disable this shit completely or enable spotify in background which is not cool because in game music is being mixed and spotify just plays it

  bopen world exploration is boringb and i think there are more collectibles than in a fucking forza where it is at least fun to drive around

  due to the plot concept byou have to grindb in this game and it starts too feel very long for no reason after 165 hours i dont want to continue

  i dont like the cars wrap styles which this game promotes you can get custom community wrap but you cant edit npcs all cars look like driving walls

  your character can look like 
   olist
          mtf trans
          ftm trans
          hipster girl
          hipster boy with beard
   olist

you cant have brutal kind of dude that i image drives the car so i had to become hipster girl because at least she looks nice also it looks like this games rule is for everyone to have gradient color hairs i mean cool but why so overused

  bthey have a lot of clothes but it all looks the sameb and most of which are branded and just have brand logos or nasa bs you cant have non baggy clothes that makes your shoulders looks like bouncers shoulders thats hiphop for ya

  no toyota prius let me be green and save the earth while beating my opponents asses

  cant play on steam deck because origin bfuck originb
list

dont get me wrong at first races are great until you get into main game loop and then cops come in formula and it gets not so fun and art style makes the game pop from the rest but its too long and repetitive its absolutely not worth 70 bucks maybe at 30 i would have recommended it i still think that nfs 2015 is the best one out of modern nfs

#####

launched unfinished lacking in multiplayer content and isnt good enough of a single player game to be thought of as just a good story game  i plan to keep playing to get my moneys worth but my expectations were already low going into this game and they still managed to disappoint  if they update the game so its at minimum complete ill try to remember to edit my review

#####

nfs unbound definitely deserves more attention i want to start by saying that bwe wont see a game comparable to most wanted 2005b so if you look at unbound bobjectivelyb you can highlight the main points
list
    the game has its own unique graphic style that has not been seen anywhere before and if you dont like it you can now simply turn it off
    the games campaign isnt too bad and is quite interesting
    you can do various activities all over the map
    high speed is felt
    large selection of cars
    a large number of car modifications including engine sounds neon lights horns huge selection of wraps and much more
    the ability to completely tailor the controls to your own driving style grip  drift
    yes the music is not comparable to music from the underground and most wanted 2005 but its not that bad and 50 of it is definitely suitable for racing
list

#####

update 81823
vol 04 update has really put the game in a good place its really fun now with the difference of things to do the only issue i would say the game has is the progression to unlock cars and the fact that if people dont join your playlist u cant play

#####
