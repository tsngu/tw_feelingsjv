buy our game today and we promise itll work next week

edit  its been a week  the patch is out game still crap recommended system requirements is there for a reason 

#####

the price is higher than the fps you will be able to pull in this game

#####

no absolutely not even if they do fix the performance issues we collectively need to stop buying games from developers who think its okay to sell broken barley functional games for aaa prices with the expectations of we will fix it one day screw any dev who thinks its okay to sell people this crap where has the passion gone in game development

#####

it sucks to write a negative review on wild hearts its fantastic when it works but my god multiplayer 9 times out of 10 is poor due to connection sound bugs out frequently graphics pop in and out and the framerate tanks all the time games in this time should not be releasing in this state and its shocking for devs to be slapping this price tag on wild hearts theres no way this has been play tested and someones given it the thumbs up promising our game will be good in the next month when we patch it isnt good enough

#####

first off i actually loved this game which is why i am actually taking the time to review it

next there is so much going for this game when it is good its a fucking blast satisfying weapons and combat unique monsters the karakuri is a good implementation too however when the game is bad it is absolutely horrid from the constant stuttering and from drops to the inconsistent enemy ai and boring food mechanics it almost seems likes the games tries to make you not want to play it 

i stuck it out for a minute beat the campaign did plenty of side hunts and tried all the weapons this latest update was the final straw new content is fucking pointless if the game doesnt improve never mind the fact that it seems to run worse that it did when i first started throw on the absurd price tag and it seems like an out of season april fools joke i would only recommend playing this game after and only after they get their damn shit together and fix the performance and even then i would wait till it is on a really good sale

it pains me to write a review like this because i wanted so bad to enjoy it but i would rather the next person doesnt waste their money like i did

#####

i just dont understand how it isnt fixed yet i played this game on release got a crazy kstaff build fought all the endgame kemono everything all of that locked at 30 fps with an rtx 3080 this game is amazing on paper the karakuri is so cool the kemono are awesome everything but its not worth getting if it cannot be played properly

i left the game for a few months after beating it and came back today to find out that it still stutters and lags like crazy if i set the fps to anything above 30 i assumed it would be good to go after waiting a while but upon learning that it is not i had to leave a review im very disappointed because i love this game its just not playable with any decent amount of graphics right now

#####

game was released on feb 16 2023 with minor technical issues i could ignore  as the days went on and more patches were put in place the game performance steadily went into decline  today 06202023 had a new patch and currently the game will not get passed the loading screen  i do not recommend this game and advise gamers to opt out of seeing this game on the store page

#####

very bad optimization and game coast 70eur better save money or just buy mhw

#####

it saddens me to say that although im enjoying the time ive spent so far with the game
we cant just let game companies get away with atrociously terrible launch days theyve had their chance to fix it before launching it and for 90 usd this is just unacceptably unoptimized
wait for a patch and discount for the very least before considering spending any money on this
ive got a 3090ti and i912900ks and for theres no excuse for barely going over 60fps when weve had more graphically extensive games like monster hunter world and red dead redemption just for example

#####

ea releases monster hunter competitor
is broken as f and unfinished
sales are terrible game is dead on arrival
ea just cuts the cord and acts like its not worth making monster hunting games

reality if they had just shipped something stable and complete it would have done well people loved the concept for this game and even the gameplay was fun if they had put time and money into quality it would have had a massive playerbase and done very well now instead we get no mh competitor and ea will abandon any future attempts instead of fixing their mistakes

#####

this is a game where i just have to open with it and say why did this game have to be published by electronic arts this game had so much potential it is fun and inventive with great designs for practically everything combat is fluid and fun and every moment playing this game feels great until it doesnt because its riddled with performance issues it hurts that i cant recommend this game because it is really fun and has so much potential it will never reach because electronic arts simply doesnt care about it like most of their games and i will be honest this game is never getting another update 
i can tell koei tecmo who have experience in the monster hunting genre with other solid games like toukiden knew what they were doing here and really wanted to make something good i wish they would have been given the chance the game is solid but its launch was riddled with performance issues and like any ea game that was enough to give it the axe instead of just giving it that little bit of time and resources it needed to be a great experience and maybe even a true monster hunter franchise competitor 
its a shame to see games like this that could really do well be ruined on the whims of corporate suits but sadly that is the reality of a lot of game development dont buy this game now unless its really cheap and go in expecting mediocre quality this game is such a lost opportunity and thats a shame its also a shame i have to lament the money i spent on it but im sure ea is happy about that

#####

performance is terrible beautiful environments awesome mechanics top notch gameplay shite fps laggy and unbearable hard to enjoy when it runs like a potato i can run red dead redemption 2 on max settings and yet this game cant even its like everythings gone backwards prices gone up and quality of releases is downright shameful and disastrous  wtf is happening

#####

edit found out koei tecmo is cutting support for this gameim honestly not surprised when i said they are notorious for releasing really bad pc ports that they never fix i wasnt lying

its a damn shamethis could have been a decent game it had potential all they had to do was optimize the game to run decent lazy developers

for the time i spent playing the trial im going to be honest this game has a lot of potential yes it is a literal monster hunter clone in every sense

i dont think it will be a monster hunter killer at any point from the very first fight the ui layout the combat character movement environment all feels great the character creation is absolutely incredible 

but the one thing that tears this game down from being a decent playable monster hunter clone is the atrocious and outright offensive optimization the worst part about all of this is that the developer is koei tecmo they are notorious for releasing really bad pc ports that they never fix 

dont count on optimization patches from koei tecmo save your money

#####

im so conflicted with this game i love the monster hunting genre and this game has a ton of innovations and the gameplay adds a breath of fresh air to it

however in its current state it is simply unacceptable that it has such bad performance the game itself is great but i cannot recommend it simply because of the performance issues it feels like im playing in slowmo half the time and thats extremely detrimental in a game that requires you to dodge monster attacks at the right moments

because of the performance issues i get frustrated more than i have fun with the game if it was more optimized i would love it

also this is a 70 game justify the price for the performance

#####

 update  the game is 50 off as of the steam autumn sale and while i maintain my original recommendation i dont think anyone should pick it up at full price now 

its still fun it still brings an interesting and innovation mix up to the mh formula but the on going performance issues and lack of continued updates makes this a hard sell now that there is no budding optimism for fixes 

its a shame i truly did fall in love with game and see something passed the unrefinememt but it just didnt end up getting the support it needed

 original review  do i recommend this game yes but in the words of ian malcolm that is one big pile of

the thing is there is a gem here hidden behind the bad optimization and performance issues at its very heart the game is fun not just fun but all caps fun the karakuri system is beyond innovative it brings a lot to the table and can keep fights feeling fresh and give you a lot of ways to counter monsters

the kemono themselves feel good to fight but there isnt as much variety as id like to see i find the later story driven kemono to be more fun and interesting to fight and while variants of the same creature is nothing new to this genre i would have liked to see a few more skeletons until we got to the reskins

i recommend this game with multiplayer as it is honestly a great time hunting down the kemono and using various karakuri loadouts to take them down but id like to see us be able to pick up side quests while in multiplayer as it makes it difficult to run those since only the host can grab them and unless you coordinated before hand you wont have the quests to get credit

having come from playing monster hunter world and monster hunter rise this game has a lot of appeal there is something justenjoyable about the experience but there in lies the problemeven with the patches there is a lot of dirt you have to dig through until you are having fun it lacks polish and that is a shame because i can truly see this franchise rivaling mh if it can iron out these issues

i wish i could give a maybe option for this recommendation because it is really going to come down to how much you want to work to get a good experience performance issues are still rampant even with two patches down and since i primarily play in multiplayer where the issues are at their worst ive had to jump through hoops using the some tricks with the nvidia control panel to get stability 

still even with all that said since i cant give a maybe recommendation im going to go with yes i would recommend this game while im not happy to support the lack of optimization and what feels like a product that got rushed out the door i know the dev team put a lot of heart and soul into this and you can really feel that once you cut through all the muck

#####

while wildheart introduces new and fun mechanics to the monster hunter genre the game suffers from extremely poor optimization that makes it difficult to recommend 
the low fps and stuttering detract from the otherwise enjoyable gameplay and the games unique mechanics and monsters cant make up for its technical issues 
overall i would not recommend wildheart due to its poor optimization

#####

they stopped updating game before they fixed performance issues

#####

ill keep it short to start with

the main reason this is a no is because of the price and the current performance issues both making the other hurt a bit more 

if it was cheaper and ran better it would be an easy yes whats there is fantastic for monster hunter fans but is currently too expensive and poorly optimised to be fully appreciated

that said neither issue has stopped me from having a blast its a monster hunter clone if you like monster hunter and want more this will scratch that itch for you that said it doesnt have the same magic as capcoms franchise the soundtrack is probably the biggest shortcoming in terms of soul that monster hunter brings compared to this it isnt bad but i cant shake the feeling that proof of a hero is about to start blasting and it never comes but besides that the monsters the combat and the exploration has the same charm and its not without its differences its a clone in the core gameplay loop no doubts can be had there but it does have its deviations and innovations no sharpness for example but being able to set up camps and customize hunting grounds to a much higher extent  

if it was cheaper and ran better it would be an easy yes again whats there is fantastic for monster hunter fans but is currently too expensive and poorly optimised to be fully appreciated there is meant to be a patch in about a week and i have no doubts the game will run better after more and more time passes but that price wont change anytime soon and a large part of monster hunters success has been how the devs add content frequently and keep the end game fresh inexpensive and rewarding it remains to be seen how future content updates will work here and given that price tag youd certainly hope its at the very least comparable to the positive endgame player experience capcom gives monster hunter

#####

months after release and still horrid performance

#####

buy now and we will patch later with 70 eur price tag kinda puts you off and its sad cause the game is pretty good but i cant recommend it right now with severe performance issues glitchy light effects and broken sound the devs better start throwing those patches fast

#####

recommended only if you have a very powerful rig for now there are serious performance issues which is why it is getting review bombed you can make it better by doing the following

nvidia control panel  add wild hearts  set power management mode to high performance  set threaded optimization to off  set max frame rate to 60 fps yes even if you have a higher refresh monitor just for now

in game  change sound to 5171

edit added the 60 fps in nvidia control panel fix this made a huge difference for me and noticeably improved the performance

its a very good game it takes the monster hunter formula and puts a new twist on it the combat feels a bit more arcade y and floaty than monster hunter however the fast pace is welcome in my opinion you dont need to sheathe your weapon to be able to move around effectively for example items while still present have been streamlined and are not as prevalent letting you focus on combat

update  some additional points after 70 hours
 all of the weapons feel viable and none stand out as head and shoulders above the rest some are much easier to do well with like the claw blade but everything is viable

 the building system is fairly well done i have spent a good amount of time building nice looking bases on each of the available areas this is entirely optional though and you could just do the bare minimum camps to spawn at and towers to find monsters and be perfectly fine  i have also seen a lot of people comparing it to fortnite which is inaccurate its not the same as well

 fairly good variety of starting skills and different weapon upgrade paths which let you build the way you want to want to focus on mainly using karakuri you can put skills toward that want to focus more on your own combat ability you can

 movement feels great after getting used to it coming from monster hunter i originally found it a bit janky and floaty but after a couple hours i was hooked you can do some really cool things with the buildables and pull off some moves that will make you feel like a badass

 although the lineup is relatively small for now each monster feels unique and has different quirks  attacks you need to learn how to counter

 i was a bit disappointed to see reskinned versions of monsters right off the bat i can understand rolling them out as future updates or for events but at release it was a bit surprising

 monster attacks can feel a bit cheap at times for instance there is a particular boss later in the game that has a ground wave type aoe attack that knocks you back if it hits you the problem is if you let it hit you the wrong way you can get chain hit over and over and lose a lot of health and may very well die also monsters generally hit very hard and sometimes the follow up attacks feel a bit quick you can easily go from full health to dead and feel like you had no opportunity to get away after the first hit due to being stunlocked part of it is a skill issue yes but it does feel a bit cheap at times

 some weapons feel a bit overly formulaic in the way you are meant to attack with them the bow is a good example the gimmick of the weapon is that you mark the target with your horizontal arrow shots and then use a charged vertical arrow shot to detonate the marks and cause a large damage spike all at once the issue is this pattern gets very repetitive and while you dont have to do that the damage without using this is very low it feels like there is only one correct way to use a lot of the weapons i would like to see a bit more variety in how you can choose to use the weapons not all weapons are like this thankfully and it wont bother everybody but i did find it to be an issue for me

 as of this update feb 23rd 2023 the performance is still very poor a patch came out already which as far as i can tell did little or nothing to help and actually made things worse for some people

im having a blast with it thus far i will update the review as i get further

h2when you swing at the king you better not missh2

its not fair what im about to do to wild hearts 

its not fair to compare a new ip from a company experimenting outside of their dynasty warrior wheelhouse to the titan of monster hunter whose had decades to polish its fangs however i sense wild hearts would have it no other way with its achingly similar art style and a price point 10 higher than the competition it is the cocksure hunter swaggering into the den of capcoms behemoth depending on its gadgets to carry it through the fight unfortunately it ends up carting itself in the process

h3where it falls shorth3
 awful optimization my recommended cpu cannot maintain 30 frames especially in multiplayer
 quickly recycles content small number of unique monsters armor sets and weapons
 weak perks a 3 increase in anything is not exciting

h3where it struggles without comparing to mhh3
 unengaging narrative
 floaty movement can be rough when trying to make precise movements along uneven surfaces

h3what is workingh3
 karakuri are wonderful fun to use in fights and when traversing the maps excellent twist on the formula
 camp building adds personality to the zones
 the nature  animal art style is unique and integrates well with the environments
 soundtrack adds texture to fights each song tailored to the creature hunted
 seamless drop indrop out multiplayer bloodies monster hunters nose in that regard

h3recommend toh3
 any monster hunter fans who need something to play while waiting for the next monster hunter

h3so which monster hunter should i play insteadh3
 pick mh world if you want deep combat mechanics immersive environments and are more of a cat person

 pick mh rise if you want lightning fast arcade gameplay a japanese aesthetic and have frankly inappropriate expectations of twin siblings

regardless of which one you pick you will get a substantial variety of monsters expressive weapons armor and perk options an enthralling art style and theyll even throw in a junk mode youll play once and never again as a bonus

wild hearts succeeds in convincing me that theres space for some real contenders in the hunt monsters genre and with some expansions and a few patches to fix the optimization problems it could eventually return to capcoms den and pluck a few of the beasts nuggets for itself until that time however unless youre just jonsing for another mh bump i cant justify the 70 price point

#####

my review of this game wont offer much more than most others have i will simply use it as a space for putting my thoughts about this game to letters and i will use monster hunter world as a baseline of comparison

in summary wild hearts is at its core a very creative and original approach to the monster hunter genre it is expansive and bristling with vitality it has a beautiful world spectacular monsters called kemono here an interesting story with several compelling characters all overarched by a very interesting article called karakuri 

karakuri the immense amount of player freedom in armor  weapons and the fact that you have to cultivate the hunting ground in wild hearts is what sets it apart from the crowd of mh games


bkarakurib

this part magical part mechanical article is where wild hearts becomes unique karakuri is like a conjuration spell you can conjure various objects with various properties in the game at the cost of a material called celestial thread  which can be extracted from the world easily in rocks or trees or in combat by attacking monsters climbing on them and using your hunters arm to extract celestial thread from them theres two subsets of karakuri regular and dragon the former is meant to be used at will to move to fight in defense platforming flight etc you can conjure karakuri boxes to jump from either to platform or to unleash a lethal attack from the sky on a kemono you can conjure a torch to set your weapon ablaze you can conjure springs to lunge a long distance in any direction you can conjure lanterns to fly around the world and not only can you conjure karakuri as they are you can even conjure combinations of karakuri which can then fuse into something else like a huge wall that will block attacks or charges or a harpoon launcher that will bring down flying kemono or an explosive bomb and much more


httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2995795006


dragon karakuri is meant to be used to conjure longterm structures like a camp campfire storage chests celestial thread towers radars to spot kemono rollers that can be used to drive around the world etc dragon karakuri is dependent on dragon pits around each world in the game each structure costs a specific element fire earth water etc you have to upgrade dragon pits to increase that element thereby allowing you to spawn more dragon karakuri 

bkemonob

theres a somewhat decent variety of which and many of them are truly a glorious spectacle to fight and the differences that separate them i felt are more stark than in monster hunter world however past the first couple chapters a large amount of repetition occurs with lots of recoloring taking place

there is also a major story kemono that is extremely similar to zorah magdaros and while its not as extremely annoying as that its still there 

there are later major kemono reveals that are very interesting and very difficult like amaterasu  which id just failed hunting for the 8th or so time 

overall i feel like the game needs some more kemono right now its just fine and future prospects are not looking so great from what ive seen of this games postlaunch support

bcombat and weaponsb

theres 8 different weapon times that more or less play similarly to ones found in mhw but theyre very different in their movements or combos simply put theres a lot more moves and combos in wild hearts than there was in world and the karakuri adds even more to those weapons such as jumping and lunging attacks with their own follow up combos the ability to literally hurl conjured karakuri at kemono using the maul and many more unique interactions that allow you to pull off a lot of crazy moves or reach any part of the largest of monsters

bfauna crafting cooking survival etcb

while these aspects in mh world felt like they were somewhat sidelined here theyre far more omnipresent there is a massive plethora of various types of food around the world either vegetables and fruits you can forage fish you can catch no fishing you just run and catch them or conjure a dragon karakuri that scoops fish for you over time or meat you can collect from various small kemono you can hunt there is a hunger meter  how much you can eat before you get full and theres many foods with various bonuses economizing what you eat is a gameplay vector 

theres various ways to process food you can dry food pickle it you need a type of seasoning ferment food and smoke it pickling and smoking food can give different types of food different bonuses and theres a lot of permutations theres some types of food that can only be acquired by taming some small lifeforms and placing them in cages and waiting a period before collecting the yield 


bperformanceb

a few days ago a patch was implemented that alleviated some of the performance issues particularly the stuttering its long overdue but there is finally some progress ive been led to believe this game might perform really terribly and while it ended up being far above my expectations its still not great with dlssquality and all settings ultra on a 3080 r5 3600x and 16gb of ddr4 3200mhz it runs between 4050 frames sometimes sinking to the 30s depending on the level to me this is playable and i was more than fine going through the majority of the game i followed some technical advice that purportedly enhances performance set audio to 71 to that end i believe i should easily secure far more than 60fps if i lower dlss internal resolution

bcontrols and camerab

this is one of the great ills that plague wild hearts the controls in this game are unbearably floaty and often irresponsive sometimes inputs wont be executed for unclear reasons your character turns in a wide circle highly annoying in the heat of fighting and the dead zones are awful when it comes to xy movement sometimes when you want to conjure 3 boxes vertically the instability of moving at an angle will cause the huntress to conjure 3 boxes horizontally 
 
camera angles  it will be quite common for the player to find themselves stuck in a corner or under a structure or some kind of natural formation incapable of seeing everything because of the wild camera angles the fov is also annoyingly low even if you max it out the game wouldve benefited from a more drawn back camera or more fov there is a significant combat mechanic where you can climb kemono to extract celestial thread from their wounds if the kemono is moving violently while you are climbing well words escape me here but its an utter joke what happens with the camera at those instances

bstoryb

for the most part it is very contrived from mh world nature is becoming unbalanced and the kemono are encroaching on human settlements or attacking eachother it is underpinned by themes of feudal japan with warring clans and the existence of a shogunlike authority which adds a lot of interesting flavor to the world your character also has much more presence in the story than world you can participate in dialogue and formulate your characters personality and motivations the ending was epic and took me offguard

the npcs ive found most interesting in the writing theres a nice cast of unique characters with interesting stories which you can unravel by doing their quests or finding items for them

blet the grind beginb

its hard to quantify the grind in wh compared to mhwib iceborne had some insanely rare drops like attack4 and agitator 4 gems wh has some grinding but it can be alleviated by eating foods with skills that increase drop rate acquiring some kemono parts requires breaking specific parts of said kemono while fighting them

my review is long overdue mainly because i was saddened by how this game lost its support this game had a lot of potential in the monsterhunting category maybe not enough to make the monster hunter series sweat as new competition but enough to make the players see that the genre can evolve more than what monster hunter currently provides

if this game is on a big sale at least 50 or more maybe 75 if you cant spare too much this game is worth picking up just to experience the fresh ideas the devs had please note that my pointers below are in comparison to monster hunter as its arguably the biggest name for the genre wild hearts is in

h1pros h1
 the karakuri system as an idea as well as how it was executed is the biggest pro it is a new inventive way to interact with your environment in order to plan your hunts and mobility to augment your quality of life during gameplay this was something that i strongly feel was not expected by anyone coming into the monsterhunting genre much less this game it expanded how you approached each quest rather than simply augmenting some factors of it

karakuri introduced new ways of basebuilding such as being able to customize your own camps and move them around resource farming ziplines you could place for mobility and so much more to me this was something that monster hunter should have adopted a long time ago the freedom to make a map comfy for you in whatever shape or form is amazing

combat karakuri added a fun and freeing way to approach how you can augment your fight kind of like how wirebugs work in monster hunter rise but combat karakuri are more tangible in use as they can directly influence combat rather than passively influence your skills you can build a wall to shield yourself build a gadget to hover in midair for eagleeye vision and positioning or simply create weapons like ballistas for extra damage

 diverse weapon fighting styles is something that monster hunter already has but wild hearts expands on this with its unique weapons that encourage you to dominate not only on the ground but in aerial combat as well because of the karakuri system weapons have ways to incorporate aerial combos not only for mobility but to get better angles on hits

the claw blade lets you perform guerilla attacks to a monster the cannon lets you use an arguably nuclear laser and the wagasa introduces a new way to enhance people who like parries or counters

h1cons h1

 linear gear progression specifically armor theres not many skills to customize and most of your changes are tied to your weapon crafting tree the armor skills are still neat but because it pits you into choosing one or two forms of passive skills theres not a lot you can customize i suppose this is somewhat fair as the available weapons and combat in general are already customizable

 performance can tank at times this is an ongoing issue and even though i rarely ran into this myself i do admit that because wild hearts requires you to be able to watch things happen smoothly any frame drops may kill you both ingame and your motivation to play a part of me thinks they definitely could have toned down on the outer ends of the environments and made it easier within the sandbox instead


i havent played in a long while due to responsibilities irl but this game is definitely one i look fondly back on wholeheartedly recommend this game to those who can afford it andor those who wish to see a new way monsterhunting can still evolve as a genre the pros outweigh the cons and with enough budget and time this game could have easily solidified a spot as a monsterhunting game in the genre

#####

i cant believe that the only thing they had to do was fix performance and this game would have been received better yet instead they just ignored it and now theyre apparently ending support for this game what a shame i hope its not true but it genuinely doesnt look like theyre gonna continue adding content or more importantly fix the performance 

the game itself is good and it adds in some spice to the monster hunter formula sometimes its frustrating mostly due to performance but most of the time its fun but the fact that the game is apparently so fundamentally flawed with performance issues that even after the many patches claiming to improve it the game still runs awful and it never will be fixed 

ive been waiting for months to see if the game can run but every time i reinstall its the exact same 
what a massive shame

#####

i played 11 hours  yesterdaysaved  quit and when i lunch the game today i loss my progressbc the ea cloud save overwrite my local save fk u ea

#####

abandoned genuinely insane for such a passionate game it feels criminal

#####

ea sell this game to someone who will actually update and take care of it this is a masterpiece in the making but the performance is abysmal seriously so depressing getting a monster hunter competitor that lags and frame spikes on medium settings meanwhile im running mhw iceborne on max make it make sense

i went out and bought a radeon 6700xt gpu and since then the performance has been immaculate just kinda sad i had to upgrade to enjoy this ive already beat the game and plan on hunting every kemono this game has to extinction switching my review to yes after playing the game with no stutters but seriously needs optimizing for low end or budget pcs

#####

dang man dang too much money in this industry to send a final build to print like this

#####

i want to play this game but it is still unplayable 
the stuttering is just

its unbearable

i just found out that they stopped support for the game as well go play monster hunter world i guess

#####

when ea makes me think they arent so bad anymore they go ahead and destory any good faith theyve built up 

the latest example of that would be wild hearts a monster hunterlike that brought some genuinely good things to the genre but was abandoned less than a year after it came out

what we are left with is an unoptimised mess and a game with a few good ideas left without any meaningful content to keep you hooked

a damn shame because this could have been a worthy alternative but alas ill be sticking with monster hunter


#####

so heres the deal its not a bad game at all in fact i think it rivals monster hunter the karakuri is super neat the setting it great the hunts are great however the performance as of writing this review is absolutely unacceptable i have a 3070ti with a ryzen 2700x and i am extremely lucky to see anything past 25 fps i have done all the fixes i have done my homework to get this game in a payable state do not buy this game until a significant patch is made to address this issue its not worth saying what i love about the game if it remains unplayable

#####

the performance issues are not overstated

#####

2212023 edit a recent patch dropped and was hoping for the game to be fixed but it didnt do a damn thing still awkward hitboxes random stutters strange distance popins please stop normalizing releasenowfixlater practices especially at 70 

2162023 this game is really rough around the edges played on a ryzen 5600x rtx 3060ti 16gb memory from its floaty controls random frame drops to awkward hitboxes its kinda hard to justify its 70 price i do not mind editing this review should they actually patch out the issues mentioned above

it has potential to be a great hunter clone like god eater and toukiden im not really ashamed of playing it because i only payed 5 bucks for the ea play trial kind of reminds me of how video game rentals save you from spending more on an unexpectedly rough game back in the day

what i can say positive about the game is that i really like the japanese mythology with the map aesthetic and kemono creatures

#####

crashed 5 times in 30 minutes seems like they havent fixed anything save your money buy something else

#####

price of 6999 is way to much for a unfinished game like this its fun with friends

#####

ea abandoned this game unoptimized for pc no hope now dont touch

#####

i will update this to positive should any actual performance improvements be implemented the game is fun when it works but it rarely runs well

#####

changing my audio output settings from stereo to 5171 resolved my performance issues for some reason it was nearly unplayable before but now runs well on my middling pc at nearly full graphic settings 

the game is great and quite distinct from monster hunter i have thousands of hours across various monhun titles over the years and ive found wild hearts to be a refreshing and incredibly challenging experience the weapons look and feel great it took several hours for me to drop my ingrained mh habits and muscle memory but now that i have the combat is extremely rewarding and crazy

ive also played a bit of toukiden and ive found wh to be distinct from it as well similar in some ways but it does not feel like toukiden 3 to me as ive seen others say

love the adventuring and exploring aspect of this game as well the game really leans into the fantasy of setting up  camp and hunting which really appeals to me

id say try the demo and test out the audio output settings fix to see if it improves performance if it doesnt maybe skip the game and pick it up once its been better optimized its a great game but when its chugging it is almost impossible to play and extremely frustrating

#####

after 70 hours playing through all the crashes the last one corrupted my save and i am not willing to start everything all over again
nice game but frustrating

#####

they killed this game like they killed anthem let that sink in

#####

could of been great if ea wasnt involved

#####

gave them a chance after so many months nothing has changed in terms of pc optimization i feel scammed never touched the game again with its unplayable state never buy this game

#####

optimization bad 

game good 

#####

still havent fixed performance issues

#####

i never write reviews but ive bought and refunded this game 3 times after big patches in hope for the performance to get better  stuttering go away 

ive given up on this game mh 4 life

#####

i really wanted to like this game so i fought against the performance issues and played until after the deathstalkerice wolf monster at the 4th area from what ive experienced fixing performance wont save this game i wont mention these in this review as they are supposedly being fixed and i believe the game has bigger things to worry about

the karakuri system is really cool in concept but is frequently janky in practice to build larger devices like the funny hammer you have to place multiple smaller objects in a configuration however the placement is grid based and sometimes even standing still you can stack two objects but the final piece is placed to the side failing to complete the build building these combinations while under attack or moving is essentially impossible with slight camera movements causing basic karakuri to be placed outside of the configuration
interacting with karakuri is also clunky for example the torch karakuri causes you to do a short dash forwards and perform a melee attack when you enter a radius around it the animation cant be cancelled and sometimes if you walk directly towards the torch the dash attack animation will end with you still in the torches radius forcing you to attack again combined with the above problem of karakuri grid placement often getting misaligned you can end up in situations where you accidentally just place a torch alone and get stunlocked by the attack animation it forces you into

monster diversity is basically nonexistent each area has around 45 monsters that can appear there  monsters start being repeated as reskins as soon as the 3rd area and by the 4th area all but one of the monsters is a reskin after completing the main quest in the 4th area my next main quest was to return there and fight a mighty kingtusk this monster wasnt even a reskin although a reskin of the kingtusk is present in the area as well it is simply the same enemy from the first area with inflated stats in total the game has 21 monsters however 7 of them are reskins so there is only 14 unique fights and one of those is basically a dollar store zorah magdaros you just hold down the attack button against the monsters dont also really do anything they mostly just stand around waiting for you to come and beat them up i know they can sleep but i think i only say this twice in my entire playtime both times being the same monster in the same place monsters dont interact with each other at all outside of scripted encounters which try to replicate turf wars from monster hunter large monsters dont interact with small monsters small monsters dont interact with each other and all will just run at you and attack you with no context for each other and cant actually damage each other at all why are these lizards and mice teaming up against me when there is a giant boar 50x their size stomping around

the story of the game is not at all engaging to the point where i thought it was actually bugged upon being introduced to the city hub area there as a cutscene and a time skip after which you are already well acquainted with everyone in the town theres no development of your role in the town through gameplay and you are never given a reason to care about anyone you just walk around with people youve never met before saying its good to see you again and how important you are sidequests mostly boil down to a couple generic lines of dialogue about a family member or something and end in anyway go kill sapscourge again

the gear system is pretty tragic with weapon skills being almost exclusively garbage like 2 crit damage or something to that effect armour is for the most part the same with the majority of the gear sets i unlocked having no skills attached at all there isnt very much diversity in armour sets with many of the individual sets being tied to multiple monsters and remember there is only 21 monsters the humankemono path system is interesting with some armour being able to be modified to be more human or monster like affecting a balance gauge that can unlock skills based on how far youre tipped towards either side the system isnt fleshed out very much with the majority of the armour not being modifiable and sets that do allow it usually dont let you modify every piece the skills requiring these paths are few and far between usually dont do anything particularly interesting and are often the only skill on a piece of gear as such skills being locked behind these paths comes off as arbitrarily locking you out of your gear skills as opposed to a nice bonus for following a certain path

the freedom of movement and different movement options are awesome but come with their own problems flying around frequently gets you stuck on invisible walls has you walking on the air or clipping you through scenery these issues get progressively worse in each area with the 4th map being difficult to tell where you can and cant walk at all

the weapons are actually really fun for the most part if not balanced really poorly with some weapons being just objectively worse than others additionally you dont unlock every weapon right away  there are 8 weapon types with 3 cannon clawblade and staff locked until the end of the first chapter of the story and there are only 4 chapters as such if you want to use one of those 3 you have to play with a different weapon for the first several hours of the game

overall this game isnt worth 70 id struggle to recommend it even at half price even if the performance issues get fixed the game is largely a shallow experience that struggles to prop itself up with just the karakuri and cool weapons id like to hope this game gets the no mans sky treatment and becomes the monster hunter competitor i was hoping it would be but with ea at the wheel im not holding my breath

tldr just buy mhw lol

#####

rtx 2060 super ryzen 9 5900x 16gb ddr4 ram downloaded onto m2 ssd and this game is unplayable at the lowest settings still really poorly optimized for pc unfortunately

#####

extremely fun combat with the drawback of the developers still unable to fix performance issues

we were told that 1 week after the game came out that they would fix these issues and everything will be fine instead weve got a few updates over the past few months that havent fixed literally anything about the stuttering or fps issues ive left this game to cook for about 4 months and when i came back im still unable to play without constant stuttering or fps drops sadly i wanted to recommend this game but cant until they fix the issues

edit due to reports this game is probably going to be abandoned without further support due to ea what a terrible company

#####

super good game optimization is super bad its very easy to tell ea pushed the devs to release early especially with only 2 weeks for major optimization patch and 2 months to an entire new weapon and monsters dont blame the devs for the ea curse its a great game and worth a shot but maybe wait for optimization fix

#####

first of all ball negative reviews are 100 valid and well deservedb
when the game released there were several issues like bcrashes and horrible performanceb
some of them have been fixed since then but the bperformance is still not fineb
bfor this price you would expect something to work smoothly without any issuesb

babout the gameb
the game is great ive done every content available except for collectibles at the time of writing including the crazy monke it is a fun monster hunting experience and i do like to think that this game is my second favorite of this genre right after monster hunter worldiceborne

bgood thingsb
list
the atmosphere of the game is great 
the world and its visuals in an artistic way is superb it really feels detailed and alive almost like how monster hunter world felt not that great but similar 
the combat is great and there are a lot of unique weapons some of them resemble mh weapons and some of them are unique
the weapon tree is amazing 
the monsters or kemono are awesome the designs are unique they all look very detailed the attack moves are well detailed and animated and some of them are just beyond awesome
the endgame is okay there isnt much really at the moment except farming layered armors and talismans which are kind of like charms in moster hunter
the building system is great feels smooth mostly and is unique 
list

bbad thingsb
list
my one and only issue currently except the performance is that i do not really dig the armors and weapons some of them look fine and some of them look bland i wouldnt really be able to tell which armorweapon is connected to which kemono i hope this will change later
i have an r7 3700x paired with an rtx 3060 ti and 32 gb of ram i would expect the game to run smoothly but it does not i had a couple of crashes as well one of them was able to crash my whole system this is unacceptable
the 70 price tag is way too much if the quality of the game is as bad as it is currently
list

ioverall the game is amazing a fresh experience in the monster hunter genre which was really needed since there was no real contender for monster hunter like ever there were some tries but none of them were this great it would be awesome if there was some competition and as a result monster hunter would improve as well i really hope they will be able to fix this game eventually and then this game could be successful tooi

#####

the game is great but the game has awful performance issues on pc they plan on releasing an update in the coming week or so to help stabilize the game i would wait until then

do not recommend this game right now

but i do recommend this game once the issues are fixed

#####

oh wow look a different option to monster hunting games finally something to challenge the genre

the only thing challenging is trying to figure out how its been 2 months after release the devs are putting out new content but the game still runs like dog water id argue that 85 of my playtime is spent trying to fix frames stutters that all 5 content creators for this game are suggesting online and none of them work i swear they designed this game on that one giant ai supercomputer china has

dont waste your money its not worth it even if it looks cool dont even buy it on sale either no point in supporting a company that does not care enough to have their playerbase actually be able to play it


#####

this game is a blast after tweaking some settings im experiencing no issues with an nvidia rtx 2070

h1bugs encounteredfixedh1
 unable to enter starting town resulting in crash to desktop 
 slowdown bug action being slowed down noticably
 low fps
 screentear  stuttering

h1heres what i had to tweakdo h1
 latest nvidia drivers
 verified integrity about 6 times until it showed all files verified
 in nvidia control panel image scaling on  low latency mode ultra  max frame rate 60  power management max performance  triple buffering on  vertical sync on
 change audio in game from stereo to 5171 and then close the game fixes slowdown bug stereo sound is cpu bottlenecked atm

game now runs smoother than butter for me heres hoping ppl see this and give it a try
doesnt excuse the poor performance on release for everyone at all game shouldve been released a week or two from now im guessing ea was rushing the dev team to crunch it out for the target release date 
glad to know patches are on the way

h1game reviewh1

this game takes bits and pieces from multiple games and combines them resulting in a really cool fusion of mechanics that compliment each other pretty well to name a few monster hunter world obviously shadow of the colossus zelda breath of the wild and even death stranding

bcontrolsb good currently using a ps4 controller to play 
bweaponsb pretty easy to get into hitboxes on the monsters are a little odd and dodgingcountering takes some getting used to
bkarakuri mechanicsb the fortnitelite building system is honestly a really cool breath of fresh air and youre encouraged to utilize it in battle to be super effective dealing more damage and giving you dodgeframes depending on what you use
bbuildingb your buildings persist death stranding and remain in the world when doing other quests i would see the remaining structures left over from the battles id had in that area and honestly it was kinda cool and added to my immersion factor
bmusicb slaps really hard with a bombastic eastern orchestral flair even the music outside of hunts is just soothing and really nice on the ears
bvoice actingb honestly isnt bad ive seen some people complain about the english voices but theyre honestly really good a majority of them speak with a really good japanese accent and some speak with more americanized accents like monster hunter does
bstory bso far its okay its there for people that want it but its not the strongest part


#####

this game is probably the best case for the damage bad optimization can do when it runs well this game is a genuinely enjoyable hunting game with loads of fun tidbits like the building system itd honestly be one of the better hunting games out there if it ran at even a consistent 30 fps even with a more powerful pc you are going to see frequent stutters abrupt and random drops in frame rate and even some crashes 

i had multiple friends stay away from this game purely due to the poor optimization seems they werent the only ones to do so as now the game is well and properly canned we went from relatively frequent updates to an apparent gap and theres also the fact this game has more or less failed to meet expectations its all a huge shame because this game had insane potential it just needed to be fixed up better 

to the team that worked on this i hope you give another shot to hunting games and put more focus on optimization its clear youre all very talented folk and id love to see a new attempt succeed

#####

what an absolute waste of potential

i really enjoyed the time i put in with this game i was one of the lucky ones my performance was on the more tolerable side i cant say the same for the others who played this game obviously as their voices are loud and uh constructive to say the least but this game really was a diamond in the rough if you ask me the game play was fun weapons were intuitive and had style even the building mechanic while reminding some of a certain battle royale really set it apart from other monster hunting games and really added to combat also the music was chefs kiss oh and the game didnt look too bad either

which is why seeing a project such as this be completely gutted when it had all the potential to deliver hindered all because of something like the performance is absolutely one of the lowest points in gaming for me personally it was literally the one thing people were screaming at to fix who even bothered to stay and put up with this messy game i think the most irritating part to all this is that we will never truly know why we didnt get that performance update yknow one that actually worked anyway the game is held together by duct tape especially the way it was at launch its a miracle that this thing pumps frames at all for people

overall to see a game that could of succeed join the bargain bin section is really disheartening ea and koei also had a pretty bad track record with performance in their games at this time like star wars jedi survivor for ea and wo long for koei i want to tell myself that if they made a sequel it could fix things but that is a really dumb bar to set for even me plus it will most likely never happen now if you need to acknowledge the great parts of your game by making a whole ass other game then youre missing the mark a little that game may do well and bring in a lot of people sure and the game itself could be seen as a positive however just because there is a new shiny game that people like does not influence the turd before it or stops it from existing its still a smelly turd only now you are trying to justify the state of it with something that stands on its own merits 

im not saying sequels to rough games is a bad thing im just saying it doesnt justify the bad game from being bad wild hearts hit all the right notes except performance that is tragic and concerning its tragic because of what could have been and concerning because this isnt the first game ea has pushed out before its done and then wipes its hands with and it wont be the last

plus id probably not want to even see a sequel of this game as much as it pains me to say because i do not trust ea or even koei not even to let me down one more time

#####

cpu i913900
ram 32 gb
gpu rtx 4060

with such a pc i can not even run this smoothly with standard graphics settings and my cpu only has one core working on the game process
i like the graphics design and the music and the gameplay is okay but the performance led me to a negative evaluation

#####

very poor performance stuttering low fps galore decided to wait a few updates to see if it would be fixed it has not game hasnt been updated in months and there are now reports its been abandoned just 7 months after its release laughable this was supposed to be a contender to monster hunter it is not in the same universe and not worth the time or money

#####

wild hearts is really fun like a casual alternative to monster hunter 

i cant recommend it in its current state though this might be the worst pc port ive played in a while 
im playing on 1080p low to make the game barely playable at 3055ish fps with the occasional slowmotion bug 

specs ryzen 7 3700x  rtx 3060ti  16gb 

my system should easily handle wild hearts at 1440p max with locked 60fps or more 


#####

months later still runs like trash on a r9 5900x and rtx 3080 tried to refund sice 8 of my 10 hours are reloading with diff settings while reading guides on optimizing trying to get a solid 60 fps out of this dumpster fire real bummer

#####

do not buy unless they fix it
the game isnt bad but it has some serious issues like heavy stutters very poor optimisation especially steam version

for an unknown reason my rig runs well on ea version stutters are far less frequent

my rig
intel i513500
b660 mobo
32gb 6400mt ddr5
intel arc a770 16gb
2tb gen4 nvme ssd

i really like this game it has so much potential to be an mh competitor

ea  kt please fix the game

update rip wild heart

#####

the ea trial counted as playtime no refund for me 


#####

sadly unplaybale with i7 13700kf and rtx 4090 if fps are set higher than 60 the game has unbarable stutters how can this be why is nobody testing the stuff beore they release it so sad

#####

the base game was a surprisingly solid and different take on the monster hunting genre that was let down by performance issues in spite of this i could have recommended it however

the game has had its support dropped by ea buyer beware youll be purchasing an incomplete product that lacks any of the planned postrelease content

#####

when i need to warm my room up i launch this game and let my computer cook

#####

i played for about 40 or so hours on game pass to try it out and well i put about 40 hours into it there and got it on sale here i wasnt expecting my save file to transfer over and that was a very nice bonus surprise i like the game and hope the surge of game pass players and sales from people like me who liked it enough to go buy it encourage them to come back and keep adding more content or make a sequel

ive had a few performance issues here and there but nothing more noticeable than a slight dip in framerate in certain spots or when grouping up with other players and a ton of effects go off at once but its not even a consistent enough problem to impact my suggestion to check it outif only on sale or on game pass it has crossplay so dont let the steam numbers fool you into thinking no ones playing it it also launches thru eas stupid launcher so im assuming thats not only how my file crossed over but how the matchmaking is supported its very unfortunate ea is the publisher of this game because it is a fantastic foundation to be a true competitor in the monster hunter game genre

for starters the movement and combat system is better than in either of the monster hunter games ive played so far those games felt pretty wonkyjankyclunky in terms of how you fight and move around to chase down the monsters in wild hearts however the movement system is a lot faster and the combat feels more fluid and fun to play with more of the weapons ive mainly used the bladed wagasa umbrella but i enjoyed the katana they start you off with and the bow and hand cannon as well as the clawblade and the shapeshifting staff weapon that turns into a giant shuriken twin tonfas or a bladed polearm with different attack sets for each transformation i havent tried the giant hammer or sword yet because ive been having so much fun with the umbrellas combat

outside the weapons you also have access to an increasing number of what the game calls karakuri contraptions used to move around the maps or fight the monsters in the game as you keep playing you might get what the game refers to as bursts of inspiration while fighting specific monsters and unlock fusion karakuri basically you can quickly place a combination of basic contraptions and theyll fuse together into a new one that does something to help you out during the fight it could be providing you and your allies a healing mist in an area a giant bomb to damage and stun the monster a fireworks explosion to bring down a flying one a big barricade to stop a charging attack and so on theres a wide range of things you can try to quickly make or place during a fight to help the basic karakuri can be things like springboards to launch yourself at or out of the the way of monsters a flame to coat your weapons in for a bit to potentially set the monster on fire blocks to climb up high and do a dropjump attack on it or even a celestial thread to connect yourself to a point on the ground and quickly move yourself around all those and more can potentially be combined to make new things on the fly that will help take down the monsters faster and it all makes hunting them more fun and engaging

then theres the weapon crafting and upgrade system as youre running around the maps there are plenty of small monsters to kill and materials to collect to help make weaponsarmor in addition to the parts you get from hunting the big monsters each weapon type has a big upgrade tree you can look at and enhancealter its damage type and appearance as you work down it if you choose to revert to a previous version to try a different route you usually get the items back used to upgrade it i think its done to encourage experimentation and changing your weapons for specific monster weaknesses i like that it also lets you change the inherited traits from previous versions you upgraded it from like if youre working down a path that adds a specific trait you want you can keep it for future upgrades and sort of further customize your weapons as you upgrade them in addition the armor sets often have whats known as a human or kemono path you can use to modify and upgrade them depending on the path you choose you not only get a different cosmetic look to the armor but you can potentially unlock different abilities for it if youre far enough down the path for example i went full kemono and have a trait that will let me ignore death once when i take fatal damage its great for giving me an extra chance to try and heal and finish killing the monster

in all i think i fought about a dozen different big monsters not including different versions of the same one but i also havent finished hunting the main monster from chapter 3 i dont want to spoil anything but i think not long after i got to chapter 3 it felt like going from low to high rank in monster hunter world if that makes sense to anyone like the world shifted and a bunch of more powerful versions of monsters appeared and some new ones showed up and im able to go to the next tier of weapons and armor i tried to fight the big monster for the chapter asap and it wrecked me i now am trying to upgrade my gear before trying to tackle it a second time with the realization that for the most part ive been having more fun playing this than i did during most of my time with monster hunter games i wanted to like them but i think i like this more

after each hunt of a big monster you get something called kemono orbs you can also get them from breaking and chopping off parts of kemonomonsters and you can use those to upgrade and unlock new karakuri the basic and fusion karakuri used for combat arent the only kind in the game there are also a kind called dragon karakuri and they are permanent structures you place in your mapsworld they can be simple decorations or a means of collecting materials or further processing those materials for use during hunts such as a device to collect fish from water sources and then a drying rack to dry out those fish fish are one of the kinds of food you can eat raw or refine to provide better stats in exchange for using up more than you get out of it like 9 veggies to produce 3 dried veggies with better stats eating the food is this games way of temporarily boosting your stats like hp or defense only they seem to last for a certain amount of real time rather than a specific hunt because ive had it last even after i lost a hunt and tried a different one beyond the food you just have a simple healing item you can increase the amount of which can be carried by finding and collecting things called tsukumo scattered around the maps and upgrading yours at a campfire a campfire is one of the dragon karakuri you can build around the map there are also things like ziplines and aerial lifts and a scouting tower to help locate monsters for huntingand all karakuri which can be upgraded from the kemono orbs you get for hunting monsters

with all that combined and the lack of needing to stop and sharpen your weapon to keep fighting without your attacks bouncing off the monsters its a lot more fun and engaging to fight the monsters in this like i said earlier in the review if you think your machine can handle it i definitely recommend checking it out theres not only a good amount of content to this game for their first attempt at a monster hunter style game but all the things they did different to put their own spin on the formula make it work better overallat least in my opinion its one where i think whether you really enjoyed the monster hunter games or tried to get into them and just couldnt you should check this out probably on sale andor on game pass i like the devs koei tecmo but i really dislike ea and their decision to try and charge 70 for games now

#####

i wish i could play this game but it runs horribly even after the fix releasing a game in this state is a perfect example of a shameful practice in the modern gaming industry almost heartbreaking

#####

that price more than your fps

#####

all the patches and yet this still cant run smoothly gonna keep waiting i guess

#####

they released thier fix btw and the game still runs like molasses

#####

not much to say about wild hearts that hasnt been said a unique spin on monster hunting as a genre fun fastpaced fights fantastic weapon concepts such as the wagasa karakuri staff and clawblade some really beautiful environments and absolutely abysmal performance issues that dragged the entire thing down id still recommend it if you can deal with that last part but otherwise i genuinely feel that the impact it has on the game as a whole is too great to ignore

hope the devs get a chance to revisit this genre one day because wh had a lot of potential

#####

its a nice game with pretty good combat and story
but the performance for now is extremely bad bugs everywhere and things
ea app launcher causes so many problems that just ruin everything
your save isnt safe on ea cloud as well manual or auto they can be irretrievable

also  denuvo  is a thing blocking your performance further

cool game nice concept failed on publisher

#####

really fun and enjoyable game played a lot more outside of steam

but for next time lets not go with ea

#####

pros
 graphics
 fun combat
 does some minor stuff better than mhw
 the monsters look really great

cons
 the story is basically stolen from mhw
 worse armor system than mhw
 monster variety
 even more grindy than mhw
 performance frame timestuttering
 price

not pro or con
 could use bit more weapons

despite being able to enjoy the game i will give it a negative review due the performance and price
i will recommend it if you can deal with the performance issues and buy it on sale

overall 78100

#####

heres a review not talking about the performance issues horrible though they may be im going to talk about the gameplay as a mh and souls veteran and the problems i have with it to give you an idea of if you want to try it out on any device im going to reference mh mechanics a lot as a comparison 

compared to other third person bossfight games previously mentioned and dauntless and god eater the fights arent balanced at all the fights are very fast paced and your ability to react is actually more limited than other games despite the extra tools you have available in wild hearts 

the audiovisual cues are hard to read every monster has one or more moves that come out very quickly with very little visual windup and hard to hear or missing audio cue the hitboxes are baaaaaad the camera is also awful mhs lock on always sucked and it does here too with the bigger enemies its difficult to see what its doing and read the aforementioned cues

your fundamental ability to dodge is also worse overall with your weapon drawn its almost useless especially with certain slower weapons they overcompensate for this by making sheathingunsheathing your weapon faster and giving the player a cartoonishly long power slide when you sprint and dodge with your weapon sheathed every single monster has attacks that cannot be dodged with your weapon out and come out too quickly to use one of your buildings to avoid

anyone who completed mhworld will know about the nergigante divebomb you had to sheathe your weapon sprint faced away from the monster and hit the dodge button to do a leap which granted you invincibility frames to avoid basically being one shot by that special move at least with nergigante it had a cool buildup throughout the fight and you knew what to do and he gave you time to do it 

the monsters in this game have attacks in their normal pattern that will deal heavy damage come out quick be missing significant cues have a bad hitbox and dodging them with the short roll doesnt cut it 
a lot of these moves are lock on until the last moment even timing that correctly however the hitbox is big enough that again the short dodge roll with your weapon out is not enough to avoid it 

and when you get hit in mh theres different levels of hit animations some of which can be canceled with the dodge button if you get knocked gently you can dodge out to avoid being combod or when you get knocked all the way down you can get up with a roll to reposition or choose to stay down longer for invincibility frames

well in this game monsters just combo you if there are invincibility frames in certain damage animations i havent noticed because you can get smacked back to back repeatedly and pressing the dodge button to see if you can cancel these the same way has yielded me very unreliable results sometimes i can dodge out and sometimes i cant theres no readability in the damage animations because i cant tell the difference between what i can roll out of and what i cannot 

and the knockdownrecoveryobvious damage window states the monster goes into are the shortest in any game ive ever played 

 i played the crit draw greatsword in a lot of mh games im super familiar with the get in get out style of fighting a boss but in this game it feels like im just managing the bullcrap instead of having a proper fight the mh games are usually well balanced enough it feels like a dance a back and forth of opportunity action reaction in this game im just mad every 25 seconds at what i have to do to deal with the enemies attacks

im going to keep playing for the sole reason that i havent unlocked all the weapons yet which i think its stupid to have them locked from the early part as in these types of games a lot of players specifically use one kind of weapon you should have them all available and maybe maybe trying the other weapons will give me the edge to make this game tolerable 

tldr camera bad hitbox bad audiovisual cues bad dodge bad balance bad 

edit in all of this i meant compared to mh which has better cues and balance wh is worse doesnt mean i just cried and gave up i can still beat the monsters its just these issues give me enough frustration that i dont find the experience comparable or as rewarding as the proper bossfight dance i felt in mh and thats why i honestly dont recommend it as a 11 for the obvious many mh players that will come to this game exclusively for the similarity its different enough to be jarring and a less solid experience

call me bad if you want but i dont think im wrong and just crying for pointing out that these aspects are worse dauntless and god eater have the same problems with missing cues readability issues short down states and high damage quick windup moves i still beat those too and im gonna play through wh as well 

the point is that yes i believe its a design issue the difference in the dodge between sheathed and unsheathed has been mentioned by other reviewers too not just me i believe 100 they did that on purpose because they knew it was necessary and i also believe it shouldnt be 

these things i talked about should have been tweaked differently and had more time spent on them and if anything i think the performance issues point out that they should have put more work into this game either way but if you just wanna call me bad okay im still gonna beat the game eventually

 if i feel differently about it later then yeah ill come back and admit i was bad

#####

the game barely runs probably wait until the patch goes up probably better to play monster hunter rise or world in the meantime

#####

why did i think they will fix the performance issues i dont write reviews but this one deserved it you wont enjoy this game with its current optimization

#####

requested refund
do not bother to play on pc yet if your rig is not amd 7950 with rtx 4090 with water cooling or better try consoles
intel i7 12800h with rtx 3070ti set every setting to low turned off every graphic related enchanting options and yet the fps feels like 20 even the nvidia fps counts 40and yep constant fps drop on top of that optimization 404
refund wait for wo long try this game again when it is on discount

#####

it is simply not reasonable to release a game if as a dev team u are fully aware that theres a very real issue with the cpu threading saying that a patch is coming 1 week after the release the game is great dont get me wrong ive been a mh fan since the old days and i praise wh take on the formula the kemonos design are beautifully done on the few ones ive seen so far 
 i wouldve pushed myself to keep playing despite the fps issues and the ungodly sttutering but given that i dont want to go over the 2 hours for the refund id rather wait for the promised patch which shouldve been there since release to see if the performance issues are addressed if not a refund it is then 

in its current state i cannot recommend this game but will gladly change the score as soon as the issues are fixed but up until then fingers crossed that it gets taken care of

#####

i wish i could refund it but i am an idiot that took a chance on ea hopefully adding content to this game and fixing the performance issues 

do yourself a favor save the money and your limited time on earth and play something else

#####

games broken still

#####

a genuinely good game but buried under a mountain of performance issues if they would have launched with solid performance i feel like this game could have been some real monster hunter competition but unfortunately even all this time later the performance has not improved in a meaningful way

if you really want a monster hunting game by all means give it a try but  be prepared for the possible performance issues 
buy at your own risk

#####

h1 this game should be called wild bugs instead when it first launched h1

it has variety of bug and performance issues from the annoying kind of bug to the game breaking one that halt the progression of the game ive experienced some of them i was even forced to lock my game to 30 fps my device is not the best but it can runs mhw on high setting in constant 60ish fps so im sure wh just had very bad optimization it was rather awful experience ngl

h1 so why the thumbs up  h1

because if we get passed all of those for instance by tweaking some settings its possible to get decent performance what we can get is absolutely amazing monster hunter like experience but with its own unique charms  i wouldnt say this is a ripoff or clone but more like a close competitor to mh

what makes wild hearts unique is the karakuri system basically its some kind of structure that we can conjure freely on the map whether its in or outside the battle on map generally it helps a lot in various things like setting up camp food production resource gathering map traversal and other useful setup its so fun to customize our own map i could literally spent hours just exploring map finding collectibles and setting up karakuri here and there and if were talking about using karakuri in battle they have tremendous advantages to help kill kemono faster especially useful in late game contents it can be the matter of life and death as the end game kemono can be brutal overall i would prefer the battle here than in mh it just feels more fun than just relying in weapon skills and limited tools each hunt also we can setup camp closer to the kemono dwelling or runaway site to save time when chasing them by teleport

as for the graphic and aesthetic i still prefer mhw especially in the armor appearances and also the skills only handful of them looks interesting in my opinion so not many options but i really like the weapon tree system basically weapon can inherit skill to the next weapon we create following the tree node and we can go to any direction its fun to find ideal weapon with all the skills of our own choosing thats probably one thing that im still interested after completing the base game aside from future updates because the intended post game content currently just too grindy and not giving any significant rewards

h1early march 2023h1 current state of the game i would say is pretty good strikethe dev effort to fix all the bugs and performance also keep updating contents are much appreciatedstrike but please dont nerf anything thats not broken the performance or fps still not ideal for example changing the graphic setting to low doesnt improve fps at all only make it uglier but at least no more slow motion minimal stuttering and can go beyond 30 fps i dont find anymore bug either ill probably still play this for awhile because its fun and new contents keep coming but for people whos perfectionist about performance and interested in this game might want to wait a little bit longer until the next performance patch better than jumping in now and become a hater later

overall 7510 recommended especially for monster hunter fans
can be higheror even perfect score if the dev do their homeworks

#####

was a fun game but it didnt get enough traction because of performance issues so ea abandoned it dont buy it

#####

i write this knowing full well that i saw ea hesitated and bought it anyways theres a really great game behind the lazy jank that is the optimization the few times that the frames would hold steady it feels really good to play and the mechanics with the karakuri innovate well within the monster hunter genre to make it feel unique however when theyre more focused on content drops than fixing the game it just spells out that they arent listening as such buy at your own risk and ride out the 25fps journey or just wait until you start seeing that its turned around in its current state i wouldnt feel any better if it was a free to play game

#####

a wonderful game marred down by shit performance i hated it first but once i got it running at an acceptable level i played nothing else until i saw the credits

#####

i want to play this game but constant shader stuttering gives me brain damage

#####

actually really fun but leaving negative until performance is better

#####

was about to get into chapter 3 and my save file was deleted


#####

bbuggy as shitb
bno optimizationb
blow performance on high end pcb

the bperformance bof wild hearts on pc is bdogshitb and game developer should feel bashamed bto put out a game in such a bpoor stateb


#####

so for anyone looking to purchase this game i recommend that you wait a little while before you do it has a big issue where theres a massive drop in frames causing the game to move very sluggish to the point where ive turned it off due to being frustrated with how its been preforming and this is on max settings with my gpu being a 2060 super

the game is by no means a bad game with me being 63 hours in but its hard to enjoy fully with the issue thats plaguing the player base on pc the weapons are dope and the monsters even doper the combat is fluid too and the customization is great along with being able to forge weapons and gear at anytime giving a nice quality of life touch to the game

if the devs of the game are to see this review please see to it that the issue is fixed as the patch that was put out for the game didnt fix the issue within

#####

still runs like trash on 3080 

#####

i dont understand the hate this game gets been playing for 7hrs no graphical issues no stuttering no drops in frames the combat is more streamline than people are saying either this game went through update hell like no mans sky a case of mistaken identity has taken place because this game is absolutely amazing between this and monster hunter i gotta say this is just way more fun and a little more realistic with the weapons yeah you still have a giant ass bonk hammer and a damn umbrella but they look like they actually fit in your players arsenal instead of the buster blade or an axesword thats 2x the size of the player

#####

this feels like a fresh take on monster hunter with hunts focused on being short and fastpaced even more so than the already quick hunts in risesunbreak unlike in the mh franchise the combat system is less realistic and weighty on the other hand the weapons in this game are really flashy and overthetop almost every weapon you pick up here will make you feel like the main character 

however as of writing performance issues continue to drag this game down unless youre prepared to waste time gambling on how well this game runs on your system i strongly advise potential buyers to hold off until these issues get fixed this is not a minor issue im running on a rtx 3070 and wild hearts frequently dips into the singledigit frames and maxes out my cpu during monster encounters 

tldr great game would be worth the full price if it actually ran well

#####

dont buy this just go play monster hunter instead the mission structure here intentionally wastes your time by relentlessly dumping copy past missions with recolored variants of the same 8 or so monsters over and over again i still have yet to understand why completing missions in chapter 4 adds more missions to a previously completed chapter pc performance varies by machine but mine sounds like a jet engine with medium to low settings i have a 3060 with a ryzen 7 im beating the main story of this game purely out of spite and i will never come back to this again i have played a lot of koei games so i blame ea for all of this

if i had to say one good thing about wild hearts the karakuri system is pretty cool

#####

absolute garbage optimisation but superb gameplay

#####

the game currently has performance issues recognized by the devs as a cpu bottle neck they are working on fixing it and the patch should be out at the end of this or sometime next week
i recommend the game still because its good and ive spent over 30 hours on eaplaypro pro play so my hours on steam does not reflect actual game time


the reason im writing this is that i keep seeing people speak negatively about the game in areas where theyre wrong and i want to show you that theyre wrong with as little friction as possible and before you pick up the pitchforks hear me out im not attacking anyone


however i feel that sometimes youtube or websites that cover a lot of games usually have some games where the reviewer plays them poorly mostly because the reviewer doesnt play those kinds of games but is rather tasked with reviewing them

that isnt true for everyone but its pretty obvious when that happens and anyone who is really into a certain genre seeing people who arent talking about them its pretty obvious


one of the first things i want to talk about is the performance on pc its bad but not abysmal the reason for the poor performance was the game bottlenecking your cpu so performance was low for the most part when i played the game it would hover around 5559 never going above with drops into the 20s and 15s when those drops happened the game didnt stutter it turned into slow motion which is a negative but they are aware of the problem and they are fixing it so thats a good thing

another thing i want to talk about is the monster attack patterns and the pace at which they attack you people were saying the monsters attack you constantly with no pause and you never have a chance to get away from them 
that they have undodgeable attacks and you are helpless this simply isnt true the monster patterns in the earliest parts of the game are usually 12 punches sometimes being 3 in a row unless there is a special exception in between those you can attack the monster however this isnt a monster hunter title it never was and as a result you have massive amounts of iframes on your dodge roll what this means for those who dont know its when you enter your dodge animation there are a certain number of frames where you do not take any damage from any source this means you can stand in place and have the monster land its attack directly upon your head and as long as you pressed the roll button at the right time you were a god and would negate the entire attack on top of this you can build items and eat food that extends the evade window so you have even more iframes in your dodge which makes it even more forgiving if you cant time the dodge properly

watching people complain about monster attacks being too fast too many impossible to dodge and not having any options to deal with them feels dishonest the people in question dont understand what they are doing and sure you can blame that on the game as im fairly confident i was never told that dodging was this powerful


another complaint i see is that traveling across the map is slow and tedious at this point i feel like you never played the game if you think its tedious to travel across the map in wild hearts but the speed at which you ride your dog in monster hunter rise is okay i feel like youre being dishonest again you can put up custom camps on the map in wild hearts you can also make vines travel from one spot to another quickly you have the ability to pull yourself with celestial rope to travel faster you can make catapults to toss you across gaps in the terrain you can make a karakuri helicopter to descend from tall places if you didnt use your vines for the same purpose you can even make a motorcycle of sorts to travel faster when you havent established camps on your map traveling in wild hearts is not slow or tedious 


for the final complaint that i want to address is when people say the karakuri system is clunky why is it clunky combat karakuri or placing camps if youre building camps youre not fighting anything and you have all the time in the world to place the structures where you want them if youre using combat karakuri you hold the karakuri button and press the corresponding face buttons to make the tool you need the only time where this can mess up is if youre on wildly uneven ground and you have to make structures that go 2 by 2 and one is placed higher than the other  but even then building single stack structures wont fail its easy to use and the only thing you have to do to make any of the structures is to match the face buttons with the recipe displayed on the top right corner of the screen in certain conditions during the fight you are given extra time to make the device needed to counter a monsters attack by having them reel up slowly showing you that a big attack is coming and that you should respond accordingly


using the lock on camera is also something people grumble about but that exists in monster hunter world and in monster hunter rise as well you can have it track the monster which makes you lose manual control over the camera for it to assist you most players in the monster hunter series will turn this off and instead have a button press to face the camera in the direction of the monster  you cant do that in wild hearts but you can lock on i dont recommend doing that though as for some monsters it can get a little wild 

the game isnt clunky you are expected to manually aim your character in the direction of the monster like in monster hunter if you do not like that it doesnt make it clunky it means you dont like it and that is okay

i dont like to shift gears manually in games where there are vehicles and racing  but i wouldnt say that its clunky to do so its just something i dont want to do and thats okay

you dont need to like wild hearts if you dont like it thats okay you have your reasons

however dishonesty shouldnt be the hill you die on because you didnt like something thats all i wanted to say

have a good day

#####

been eyeing the game since its release being effectively thrown off by the price tag and negative reviews concerning the performance issues and whatnot decided to give the game a college try and see the performance for myself given a discount and steam refund policy with a goal of seeing as much as possible in a 2 hour time span

to my genuine surprise the game works now the trick is i have a pc that could i still i be considered pretty good 3080 ryzen 9 5950 32gb 1080p and the performance is not great it works but its not great when out of combat playing on medium settings frankly ive never tried playing on high and i dont dare trying i manage to pull off 110120fps whereas in combat it drifts between 70 and 100 as i said its playable some of you may say oh it plays above 60 if so thats great but the problem is it does not really feel like 60 despite it running around 70120 it often feels like 50 might be due to the occasional stutters happening here and there

performance aside the game is great im digging the asthetics the gameplay the graphics are nothing to write home about but the art direction makes up for it game is i for now i recieving content and qol updates which is a good sign  performance patches  those can be hit or miss 

game is not worth 70 bucks but then again i dont believe any game is if you are interested in this game get it on discount or full price its your call give it 2 hours and judge for yourself if it sucks just refund

#####

tldr this game is not perfect but it is incredibly fun if you have a fairly beefy rig and the money to spend on it worth a pick up if youre a fan of monster hunting games even better if you have friends to play it with

long review

uconsu
b performanceb when this game first came out i was getting roughly 4050 fps with stutters and drops on a r9 3900x  3090 at 1080p after a few patches i now get roughly 7080 for the most part sometimes down to 60 at worst but its at least smooth and unnoticeable when the fps varies instead of being obvious frame stutters while im glad that the game now runs a lot smoother for me i feel like the bar to entry for decent fps at 1080p is unreasonably high and midtier pcs might not be able to have a smooth experience
b price tagb 70 is a steep  price to pay for a game but i will say theres no battle pass or microtransactions or any of that crap plus theres free content updates which is great if youre on the fence i think you can still play the 10 hour trial with the 5 ea trial that 5 goes towards the cost of the game and your progress carries over i believe 
b roster bthe roster is noticeably small its got about 15 unique monsters and 7 subspecies aka reskins i feel like this is kinda to be expected since mh initially also launched with a very small roster and then has had nearly 20 years to expand on each following title im hoping well have even more unique monsters added through updates because the recent one just added is amazing
b camerab this can be aggravating especially if you get thrown up against a wall or terrain and the camera is up your characters a and you cant see anything other times when a monster is in the air the camera will start clipping into the grass so you cant see whats going on but for the most part camera is fine imo
b storyb kinda mid and dialogue cutscenes feel like theyre fluffed out and dragged out because of how much and how slowly everyone talks the further i got in the game the more frustrated i got with the story dialogue taking up time when i wanted to hop into the next hunt lol but this is probably just a personal issue 
strike spineglider stock dolphin soundstrike

upros u
b combat  movement b so good i enjoy the verticality and movement so much in this game that its hard to go back to mhr the combat is so much fun that it makes the small roster size not as big of a deal to me because i enjoy fighting each monster so much because boy is parrying satisfying
b mapsb the map designs are incredible imo the colors and variation are beautiful especially when its old dilapidated buildings overgrown by vibrant flowers and vegetation theres also a reason to explore the maps either to find upgrades for your tsukumo palico new talismans or to find new locations to put a fast travel point or zipline for quicker shortcuts for future fights i wouldve loved to have one more map since theres technically only 4 maps but the size and variation within each map does really make up for the low map count
b camp customizationb you can place your own fast travel locations something i didnt even know i wanted in a hunting game you can place a tent right outside of areas that you frequently fight monsters in so that you can jump right into the fights the further along and more you hunt in the game the more camps youll be able to place down
b cross playb this speaks for itself although theres no crosssave at the moment being able to play with friends on console is a huge plus
b weapon trees b the weapon customization in this game is one of the coolest systems ive seen imo you can either do a very straightforward upgrade path and just accept whatever skills you acquire along the way or if you want to dedicate the time and resources you can custom build and fine tune a weapon with exactly all the skills you want on it to perfectly fit your build 
b bladed wagasab

honestly i could keep going on about the things i enjoy about this game it really scratched an itch for a fastpaced monster hunting style game that feels really fresh and fun to play and really surpassed my expectations

edit im disappointed that theyre already cutting support for the game despite not fully smoothing out the optimization this was one of my favorite games ive played this year and i was really hoping that it wouldve cemented itself as a good mh competitor if you have a beefy pc i would still recommend grabbing this on sale at least i genuinely loved this game and its a shame that the performance held it back

#####

36 hours of gameplay on steam but only 16 hours ingame lost 20 hours because of corrupted save data it already happen 3 times

#####

a game with potential marred with terrible pc performance thought after a few months the game would fix the performance issues still runs like shit on my pc

#####

a pc port like this is simply unacceptable i dont have the worlds best pc but i can run almost any other modern video game i throw at it with at least 100 fps running everything on low with a resolution below native a handful of community found fixes i barely hit a consistent 30 fps

its such a shame because what little i was able to play on pc and ps5 but theres still issues there is amazing this is everything i could have wanted from a new entry into the monster hunting genre everything in this game just clicks the combat is super smooth the karakuri building system is amazing theres base building elements its all awesome and should add up to a 1010

my review will remain a negative review until performance is hammered out where then i will update to positive and reply with an edit regarding performance

#####

i really want to recommend this the game is super fun the combat is fantastic and the kemono are some of the best monster designs i have seen outside of mh
unfortunately the game has several technical issues that make it nearly unplayable
i have a pretty decent pc and i still need to run this on low graphics to get above 30fps on top of that the controller support is awful it will work for about ten minutes or so before saying my controller has disconnected and then after that it simply does not work i tried several different solutions i saw posted elsewhere and none of them worked
i really hope ea sees that this game still can be saved and is able to fix but we all know thats not gonna happen unfortunately

#####

pretty much unplayable on an rtx 3070



#####

its unfinished its buggy clunky had potential but its it was abandoned and it sucks

#####

pros 

 a nice take on the monhun formula the karakuri are a lot of fun to experiment with
 some monsters have pretty nice designs
 melee weapons are fun to play with especially the claw thing its the best weapon

cons

 small monster pool 20 on release and like a good quarter of them is just instead of a black bird that spews poison you get the same bird but white that spews water
 horrible performance on launch i712700f and rtx 3080 gets me to around 60 fps but the frequent drops are really frustrating
 they lowkey botched the setting maps are sometimes hard to navigate and some of them look horrible for example the snow map especially when its actually snowing which is a big shame since i personally adore icy and snowy themes in games
 ranged weapons are a joke the bow feels like they got the idea of putting the weapon in the game around a week before launch and the cannon is just not fun to play for me
 the game is extremely grindy sometimes taking tens of hunts to even upgrade a single weapon if youre unlucky like me
 most armors desingwise dont appeal to me at all besides most of the skills are completely useless if youre looking for damage
 some systems like food for example dont work for me at all it takes ages to produce remotely useful food to boost yourself again games a real grind
 the game is also extremely easy there was only one monster i ever died to and it was at the end of the game most of them you can easily overpower if youve ever played a monhun game which is sad because you dont really need to use the karakuri stuff to defeat anything
 the game is short only taking about 30 hours to beat if you do a bit of grinding here and there cant imagine how short it could be if you just rush through it


overall the game isnt worth the 70 they ask the idea is great just not realised as well as it deserves either wait for a sale or just buy either monster hunter world with the iceborne expansion around 50 or monster hunter rise with sunbreak around 60

#####

i was hesitant to buy this after seeing all the reviews but i realized i had that ea play thingy from the game pass so i was able to demo this through that it runs well enough on my pc so i decided to buy from here the game is absolutely fantastic if you like monster hunter stuff but buy only if you have a beefy pc build my 4070ti 3700x 32gb ram rig struggles sometimes so i can imagine how it is with lower end stuff

#####

70 triple a game moment

#####

i love the games setting and beautifull look issue is that the performance as of now is completely low 

i dont have a high end pc but it is a good midclass pc with 3060n plenty of fast ram and a i9 processor unfortunatelly even on lowest settings when fighting in a forrest with structures around my fps drops tremendously

i will most likely give the game a shot on my ps5 windows is unplayable rn

#####

fpsprice

#####

love the game but its sadly unplayable due to ports issues 
my pc is 
gtx 4080 ti  
32 ram
2t rom
42 cpu
if my pc cant run this maybe nasa can

#####

performance issues and poorly thought out designs still plague this game even after several patches the gameplay is slow and clunky and the player will often find themselves fighting against frame rate drops and falling through the map or pieces of geometry that load in at random then disappear again even walking through town or exploring the map outside of combat results in a slideshow of frames that are choppy and disjointed 

this game might be worth playing someday once performance issues are addressed but save your money until the inevitable sale to keep it at 30 or less

#####

great game horrible experience refunding for now but hoping to be back

#####

bad performance game run poorly  its good game with bad performance i cant handle it anymore

#####

this game is so good but it comes as no surprise that ea destroys everything it touches they need to sell the rights to this game to someone else that will give it the love it deserves because without the performance issues this is better than monster hunter and im not joking

#####

so i was very hesitant with buying this game because of the performance issues and the price 
i picked it up on a sale and i have to say that i am happy that i did
as a huge monster hunter fan this game is very good and fun entry in this genre
the price tag is too high in my opinion so if you want to try it get it while it is on sale

performance
the performance could be better i got to smooth and consistent 70 fps with my setup on 2k with highest settings rtx 2060  amd ryzen 7 3700x  32 gb ram
in my time playing this game i experienced 3 fps drops that brought it down to 30 fps for about 3 seconds so it allows for low fps but they are at least consistent
have had no crashes or anything like that so far

monster variety
there is a solid amount of monsters kemono in this game
all of them are vastly different from another
you also have subspecies of kemono that change their moveset andor ailments they use

story
the story in this game is very enjoyable
it took me around 25 hours to complete it i have not rushed through it
even after you are done with the story you have a lot of requests from townsfolk that lets you fight every kemono again or with different conditions to the hunt like reduced hunt timer or less faints

multiplayer
i have spend a couple of hunts in the multiplayer of this game
it worked flawelessly for me
either i searched for a hunt of a specific kemono and joined or i opened up the hunt by myself and made it open for others to join
i have not had a problem of finding assistance online

gear
weapons and armor have a broad variety in terms of looks and skills
the weaons themselves seems pretty much balanced across the board
i have seen every weapon being used multiple times online
about the weaponarmor skills you can find more below in the endgame section

endgame
i am going to continue playing it and hope for new updates in terms of content because the endgame is pretty shallow 
it is just like monster hunter 
80 of the armorweapon skills are just not worth it compared to the 20 that are used in almost every build if you want to go for the best dps that is
you also need gold for basically everything in the game crafting armorweapons roll back weapons to get backthe  materials used building works inside the hub area etc
i mainly used a single weapontype and weapon itself so i have not had the need to grind gold
but if you are planning on crafting multiple weapontypes and multiple weapons within that weapontype then you should prepare to spend a pretty hefty amount of time farming for gold
but if you are coming from the monster hunter series the farm for gold should not be something new to you

conclusion
overall i will say that i really enjoy this game and i am fine with the current state of the performance devs confirmed that they are still working on fixing the performance issues
i can without a doubt say that i can recommend the game to anyone that loves the monster hunter series
just try to get it while it is on sale

#####

game good performance bad

#####

uninstalled after 20 min looks like a cool game but performance is abysmal my 4070 rtx can handle almost everything i throw at it everything but this im lucky if i get 20fps runs like utter unoptimised crap id ask for a refund but i got it on ea play maybe itll work in a few years but right now most pc gamers shouldnt bother

#####

im not mentioning technical issues as ive not had any using an i7 and with that out of the way i started this in as monster hunter fan and the game has mostly hit all the right marks for me

for reference too i mostly used the bladed wasaga the bow and the katana as my choice of weapons

 goodengaging gameplay with interesting weapons to pick from with their own unique mechanics

 movement feels good

 the main mechanic of the game the karakuri is interesting and useful its not perfect in coop it can be a bit buggy sometimes but it works well

 monsters are challenging but fair with most hitboxes being far sharper than in monster hunter

 monster designs could be considered by some as simplistic for me however they look amazing and further help with the storytelling of how dangerous these creatures are to the ecosystem while in monster hunter most of the time you feel like youre going to a zoo with these mystical creatures and get told theyre going to destroy everything so you kill them in wildhearts you actually see the impact the animals you hunt have in the enviroment and how all of them at any time by just existing are bringing chaos to the ecosystem this is also translated in the final blow mechanic where a defeated monster will lie still and must be finished off with a final blow where your character finishes them and then bows in respect as the creature youve slain was just an animal trying to live its life but needed to be killed you cannot capture a monster as they are all clearly dangerous to the ecosystem and need to be slain

 the game allows for building your own camps with their own facilities meaning you decide where to set up your own waypoints you can warp to and if you want set up a full base so that you wont need to go back to town for anything but picking up main story quests or sidequests hunts can be started outside the town armor and weapons can be crafted outside of town food can be made and eaten outside of town you can even put down a training dummy to have access to the weapon tutorials in your own crafted base

 a lot of quality of life improvements between monster hunter and wildhearts small but simple example you can eat anywhere in the map rather than only by a camp and your food doesnt go away until you succeed a hunt or you choose to lose your food buffs

 the story is simple as tends to be the case for monsterhunting games but this feels better told and better set up than the story from most monster hunter games

 the soundtrack is good with a few of the monster themes being absolutely beautiful andor intense most monsters have their own unique theme a very few amount of themes are shared

 when enraged all monsters change visually their music change to become more intense alongside the usual moveset change that is already common from monster hunter this makes all fights a spectacle once the monster enrages rather than world where sometimes you cant even tell if the monster is enraged or not

you can go back to character editor for free eventually once you unlock a certain item without needing to pay the game for a characteredit voucher

 forging a weapon is far more interesting and provides with more actual options while monster hunter has you picking between 14 different fire weapons with similar stats and then you pick whatever is the best for a raw set anyways because you dont want to grind for all elements wildhearts has a weapon tree allowing you to pick weapon skills from other weapons as you go down the tree you can also go back upwards on the tree or sideways to make your own weapon with its own set of skills gathered from the previous upgrades it does tend to be the case where raw is better just so you dont have to go through grinding for each element but you still have a whole ton of options of which raw weapon to pick and how to go through the weapon tree so to get the skills you desire

 every weapon can break every part no more having hammer unable to cut any tail just to have 2 or so special part breaking interactions that are never important anyways

 while endgame will show up below in a complaint the fully new kemono recently added murakumo is absolutely beautiful music and visuals and challenging a fight thatll be in my memory for ages hopefully more updates like this one come to the game

 most updates touch on things that players have been complaining about drop rate on x is too low bam they increase it this weapon mechanic isnt working out too well bam they improve on it this hitbox is incorrect bam they fix it this is beyond refreshing considering certain things on monster hunter stay the same once released never to be fixed or improved on

 i dont know where to put this as it depends on the person but its interesting though monster hunter usually has its focus on poststory content where sometimes it feels like the game actually only starts by then whereas on wildhearts the focus seems to be on the actual story content while leaving some grind for those who want it post game and players who like just getting to the end of the story wont feel like theyre missing much though as mentioned earlier the fully new kemono is fantastic and a memorable experience

my complaints

 on creating a character like in monster hunter you must pick underwear for your character the choices are very limited and sometimes ugly while this isnt a big deal in monster hunter in wildhearts some armor sets are sleeveless or just a thong at which point your ugly blue shorts will appear to censor you or your ugly blue underwear shirt will have sleeves that are visible on your sleeveless armor there is a sleeveless option for underwear no not even the men can be fully shirtless which is a chest wrap but if you use the chest wrap you must also use ugly blue tights on your legs this isnt a huge deal as theres a lot of armor choices that will work fine with it but it does limit your choices sometimes and as of writing this right now there arent any mods to remove this weird censorship

 while also not a big deal some few mechanics are not well explained while i like the ability to revive my coop partner there are times where the window to revive is impossibly short without a proper tell of why the general assumption would be if you got revived earlier then it goes faster and faster the more times you get revived but that doesnt seem to be the case what it appears to be is that the longer you are in the hunt the faster the revive timer will be until someone fails to be revived then its reset back ive done basically the entire game in coop the fact i still dont know this core mechanic for certain is concerning

 while i wanted to play a lot with the ornament system you can add little accessories to your hunter for cosmetic purposes its unfortunately very limited in options and so im left wanting to use it but nothing in there i want to make

 even other games and monster hunter struggle with this one keyboard controls are sometimes weird or unintuitive but perhaps thats a little bit my fault for forcing every game to be on a keyboard in any case it might take some messing around with the controls to get something youre comfortable with


over all though loving the game and hoping theres more in the future to sink myself into

#####

on both highest and lowest settings the game runs bad looks bad and plays bad this is an unfinished product with the promise of updates to make it playable 

refunded if youre going to buy it wait for a patch and a sale do not support scummy business practices

#####

wild hearts bring a fresh and interesting concept to monsterhunting style games theres a lot of weapons the movesets are wonderfui and also impactful for those liking your hits to have some oomph and character customisation is somewhat in depth the monsters are well designed as well they take irl animals and enlarge them while adding some fantasy  natureinfused aesthetics in most of them however do note that theres not much variety and some of them are reskinned

and the combat i can say that it is satisfying in a way the twist in this game is that you build constructs while fighting the monsters theres tons of them and you unlock them as you play more theyre used to help fight the monsters you can climb on the constructs build a gate if a monster is charging to knock them back build a cannon a harpoon to bring down those flying ones healing and ofc to trap them although temporary

however i dont like the weapon crafting system basically the weapon trees are bundled together unlike monster hunters dedicated trees for each of the monsters its hard to explain this so i suggest looking it up and see for yourself how it is but know its not as intuitive as monster hunters

lastly the performance this is so poorly optimised it was terrible during launch and theres barely and changes right now for me i have an rx6750 xt and ryzen 5 5600g with 32gbs of rams clocked at 3600mhz playing at 1440p yet i get around 45fps  occasional stuttering despite the game doesnt look as good as mhw or even mhr i can even run rdr2 or something similar having over 80fps consistently without any stutters 

with all that being said as much as i want to like the game and its uniqueness i cant really recommend this game if youre thinking of picking it up i suggest playing a different monsterhunter game better options would be monster hunter world  iceborne monster hunter rise  sunbreak the ogs god eater series or even dauntless all of these are fairly optimised doesnt have a weird crafting system fun and challenging in their own right

#####

terrible optimization

80 euro for an unplayably optimized game id rather spend that on a guilliotine
seeing as this was a full release for full price and with performance being similiar across most platforms i wont be changing my review as this is the version they proudly charged full price for

abandonware avoid

#####

it is a mixed bag
the game feels and plays great the weapons i tried so far are their own while feeling very familiar from mh in their design in that the hammer spins a lot and you got the sweet superslam with big sword etc
i played a lot of odachi maul and katana so far and i gotta say that maul and katana are cool and the odachi feels very powerful when you play solo as you can stun even the highest level of kemono and deal tons of damage with animation cancels and repeated charged slams
umbrella and claw blade are entirely new concepts in mhlikes as far as i am aware but so far i only played a little of claw blade out of these 2
its an extremely mobile weapon that lets you literally fly in and out of combat when you are linked with the kemono
the gameplay feels like a mix of dark souls in you have your rechargeable estus and a very useful roll with a lot of iframes and mhr in exploration the pace of battles and zones combined with their own spice the karakuri system which feels great and rewards tactical play and the base building

there is a lot of stuff they throw at you and they dont soften the blows right from the start which i think is kinda neat
a mh game starts you off by letting you hunt a few jagras and picking herbs and this game the first mission is big monster go punch and thats a  from me

the basebuilding lets you just stay in the maps and doesnt return you back to lulisland everytime
hunters arm is a good system where you can latch on to wounds on the kemono and absorb resources to build more karakuri and get back some estus

every base karakuri feels important and depending on what weapon you chose you can choose 4 out 6 to suit your playstyle and give you access to different powerful fusions
the way you unlock the combinations is great as well in my opinion but i dont want to spoil to much and there is a lot of variety

the kemono are a good fresh wind for any hunter who loves to see something new they are somewhat limited in number right now but i see great potential here as you would expect from a fresh new game

the game has a lot of character which you dont expect from the model on background patchnote headers sometimes but you can play around with a lot of stuff in the game find weird caves cool objects a lot of lore and build a massive bridge over gaps with your basic box karakuri and enough patience if you feel like it

the obvious elephant in the room is the performance and the game could have used a few more months in the oven which leads to the next problem
ea our charming greedy corporate mega company is not the greatest middleman if you want to have a great product that is not whipped out before it is done on a technical level

the usual siege type encounter that no one likes

the price makes it even harder to forgive the state the game is in right now and it is another reason this struggles so much in ratings

missing options the ability to pick up items instantly and not hold lt to fill the circle to pick it up is technically there but doesnt work great atm 
if you want to pick up a plant you cant tap the pickup button you still gotta hold it a tiny bit
i would also prefer if i had an option to not hide the hp bar
i also use a old controller that is currently suffering from if you push the stick to the left it might not fully recognize that the stick is pushed all the way and slowly walk you insteadsyndrome and when you slowly walk you crouch instead of rolling when pressing b 
that could also be an option to only crouch you when you fully stand still or when you are not in combat with a giant kemono as almost all controllers i had in my lifetime had this problem at some point before they died or i replaced them

as described further up youve got an arsenal of powerful karakurifusions but they are so good that you can actually abuse them which is okay in a pve game but theres another problem
the placement script regularely completely screws up and puts 3 boxes next to each other instead of on top if you try to place them quickly
i dont know how many times i pressed xxyxxy or babbab expecting to get my cool weapon or tool to come out just to find a mangled mess of parts in front of me
and i can accept it if i screw up the combinations or i make obvious mistakes but the tiniest slopes or a random straggler karakuri can sour the whole thing

the cast of npcs and the story is okayish i debated if i wanted to put it in negative but it is not that bad 
there is a high chance you might dislike 1 or 2 characters but i dont see anyone hating all of them and the story is presentable grimmer and more real than mh which balances it out in my book

very japanese if you like the setting and cool anime moves this game got it

cooking is a decent system to pick and customize your own food buffs but it feels unrefined and there are many useless ingredients
if you dont want to dive into the system just dry and smoke meat for damage or pickle rice or veggies with misovinegar for max hp
i personally think there is something but if you are a player who just wants to 321 go this is very annoying

very grindy you need to hunt a lot of kemono to build up your arsenal and cosmetic armor requires you to hunt actual dozens of the same kemono to build full sets of 5 which is a neutral point for me as i actually like having to hunt a lot but it might be to much for someone with less time drive to farm or patience

overall i enjoy the game a lot and i got to recommend it
lovers of monster hunter who are open for something similar but not quite the same will find their moneys worth
if you are very allergic to performance issues it is a pass for now but usually koei tecmo fix their stuff over time
i see a lot of potential for a new great ip and i hope ea doesnt squeeze the life out of it with their slimy greedy mitts

#####

i just dont understand how they havent fixed this game after all this time

#####

months after release and the perfomance is still horrible
please for the love of god focus on perfomance optimization and not on new content
game is great monster hunterlike but fills its own niche and all but the perfomance is ruining it for me

this rating will remain negative as long as the performance problems are not seriously addressed or otherwise corrected

#####

i am writing this review shortly after the the mhwilds hype train and getting done with my second playthrough of world there are just not enough monster hunterlike games out there and this one i actually found to be pretty special it stayed true to the formula but had enough of its own ideas to make the combat unique and engaging the monsters kemono are beautiful and a blast to fight the world is gorgeous and diverse honestly the closest thing i could find to rival mh

i just wish that ea never had their hands in this it could have turned into something special and maybe even its own series but of course ea pushed this out too early and in doing so ruined any chance of it gaining a large following due to reviews rightfully bashing on its performance 

all that being said i still highly recommend playing this especially if you need something to scratch that hunting itch i know i do and once i am done with rise i am coming back to this game

#####

after several months of release koei tecmo finally felt us worthy of dlss and the game still does not run well for the vast majority of users expect eos within a year because they somehow they thought it was a good idea to develop a game in a genre mostly successful in japan and market it towards the west accompanied by a corporation known for undercooking their products and not supporting them in the long run i really dont know what they expected but they got exactly what they deserved regret spending money for an aftermarket key i can at least sleep soundly knowing none of my 70 dollars went to ea nor koei tecmo with wo long earlier this year being a moderate disappointment theyd better put all they can into rise of the ronin or else ill be questioning whether i should boycott koei tecmo for the foreseeable future

#####

i have tried checking my graphics settings enabling dlss so on and so on my machine is nowhere near toaster levels of bad and i can run all sorts of demanding games in my library bar this one  

i have a few friends who miraculously enough can run this game and have told me that it is actually fun when it works
as such i wanted to give this game a try and pray that it runs but here we are

how do you expect people to play your game when your pc port is held together by duct tape
it has been months and clearly no inprovements have been made so much talent locked away behind a horrible port absolutely no fucks given by koei

unacceptable


edit apparently the devs have completely abandoned this game there has been no response from them either here or their discord server since july what the fvck you guys cant just be making a monster hunter contender and not even knowing how to develop a game that cannot even run itself at this point  good riddance i can finally get rid of the ea client thats been sitting on my desktop just for wild hearts screw them as well

#####

gameplay is fun and is a great monster hunter like if youre into it unfortunately it is poorly optimized and takes a lot of work to get running even on a nicer pc

#####

i bought this for steam summer sale 2023 the game has had 5 months of patches for performance please keep this in mind when reading the following

rtx 3080 i79770k  trying to play at 1440p at 144fps the opening sequence had incredibly jarring stuttering i closed the game looked up that its generally recommended to cap the game at 60fps in game and with rss or nvidia control panel did that started the opening sequence again the stuttering was reduced but still quite bad 

i dont know how youre supposed to hunt monsters like this i really want to play this game but its performance in the first sequence is so awful that i doubt getting further into the game will improve much of anything so i refunded it its a shame too because i really want to play it

#####

rx 6800 r7 5800x3d and 32 gb of ram on nvme ssd still runs bad

#####

i wanted this game to be good so badly i was so hopeful for the future of this game even though the pc release was bad it brings me so much sadness that this game is essentially dead i loved it though i lagged horribly but i still loved it the movement is clunky and i still loved it this game and the whole concept of it as a whole was such a great idea and they could have done so much with it but they didnt it depresses me so much i eventually stopped playing after a couple of weeks give it time i said theyll release a couple more updates and its gonna fix it

they never did will they its been this long so probably not and its so sad it is such a good game but i fully blame the developers i want to recommend this game so badly and i just cant i wanted this game to work and be the best new thing with all of my being and it just doesnt most depressing review ever

i hope that somebody in an official position reads this and puts effort to restoring this game and making it what it has the absolute potential to be i dont think anybody will after all my poor review is obviously not the first one ive all but given up hope for its comeback ill never not be sad about wild hearts

#####

sadly the game is no longer supported there was some special monster hunting here and some great mechanics the perf issues werent fixed fast enough afaik so the game flopped but its worth playing

#####

i got to try this for free and i still have buyers remorse

#####

the game has been out for 4 months and still stutters even at lowest its settings 

no amount of changing system settings helped

dont buy unless it is fixed

edit i have since upgraded my pc it fixed nothing and the performance is still terrible

#####

no do not buy this game yet typical ea shit not tested for optimization 70 price tag for a subpar aaa game that they say we will have an update for for next week next week after buying the game we can play it  

nope im tired of this shit you should be too

#####

if you like monster hunter you will probably like this game i do not have the same issues others are reporting i have a 10700k and a 3070 ti and do not notice much more than occasional fps loss if you cant handle that maybe wait but if you can i think its worth it

the game itself is very fluid fast and streamlined its like the most tedious parts of monster hunter were removed or made simpler easier and faster for example gathering is one button press without an animation nearly every item is as quick and painless to gather as honey is in mhw mechanically the game is solid

the world looks nice monsters are cool multiplayer progress saves for all players when youre on the same quest

a couple cons apart from the issues some people are seeing are
some cutscenes take forever and in multiplayer you will not have any control while another player is in a cutscene 
some actions are annoyingly long and repetitive such as finishing off a monster camera angles dont always work out during a finisher

70 bucks is a lot to ask for if you have ea play and a 10 hour trial its advisable to use those 10 hours to see if its worth that to you if not wait for a sale there will definitely be one in my opinion this game is worth at least 50

#####

this game deserves better publisher then ea

pros
 monster huntergod eater type of game you hunt down a monster or kemono in this game getting its parts to craft more stronger weaponsarmor as you go solo or with your friends
 gameplay wise i think it has smoother in terms of battle mechanics then monster hunter it doesnt use gigantic weapons so its has faster movements in battle which makes avoiding the kemono attacks easier probably its signature moves was to attack downward after jumping high on the air with the help of karakuri which really satisfying to see and use
 new kind of additional powers then the one introduces in monster hunter or god eater you deploy karakuri which basically wooden mechanical devices thank god they use the words as it is and not trying to find another word to translate it the karakuri are used to help you in fights be it to defend attack support or held kemono on its places
 vibrant areas in town or in hunting area
 coop play can be done to progress story together with your friends until the final boss thank god for this many new game that promoted itself has coop function in the end cannot do it on story mode eg grandblue aot 2 etc 
 despite of having being released a year ago and many thumbsdown review you can still find quite many people creating session for coop play

cons
 poor port from ps4ps5 to pc resulting some bugs here and there especially for mediumspecs pc on 20232024
 ea
 ea
 no seriously ea coop play needs to connect to ea server that most of time out of sync causing some people not able to use or see your karakuri or vice versa and random server disconnect really koei tecmo you have better chance to make this as big game like monster hunter or god eater but why did you have to choose ea as your publisher at least have a mode that allow for local coop that doesnt make it necessary to use ea server for those who play with friends in one roof

#####

i honestly cant remember the last time ive just had so much fun playing a game its everything i love about monster hunter with a bit of strand type gameplay added to it ive never used a heavy weapon in games like this but with the structures you can build for defense offence and utility i had no problems going with the slowest weapon in the game the combo system is so fun with the hammer and i could gush about just that weapon alone for a while its just an incredible game

#####

the performance is completely garbage why is it recommended because when it doesnt stutter like crazy or have slowdown that requires a 30fps lock to fix it is pretty darn good the weapon types are interesting the environments are nice i like the 4 seasons approach that was kinda novel 
armor system kinda sucks skill wise not presentation wise
weapon system is highly customizable and you feel rewarded taking long branches down in upgrades
monsters are really really aggressive or ive played mh too long to notice but either way its a good thing keeps me on my toes

i highly recommend this game to fans of the hunting genre now if you dont mind the performance issues and ridiculous work arounds to get it stable

edit i came back to this in april i wanted to see if they fixed some of the performance issues joined a random hunt was about to win then ctd im gonna let this one stew in the oven more ill leave the review as is unless something dramatically changes

#####

im honestly enjoying the game

#####

absolutely amazing gamplay with one massive glowing throbbing caveat if you can run it im on a 3070 running an eight core i7 36ghz cpu and i can barely manage it even in the best areas i have to cap at sixty and in the worst im lucky to breach thirty often times dipping to below fifteen during extended action those fights are tedious and painful and at times i get full second stutters and framelocks that make it nearly unplayable sound bugs if played more than an hour or two and slowly drops sounds until its simply background silence until they all come back suddenly in a ten second burst of headache inducing white noise carnage

but when it works oh my god is it good graphic fidelity isnt huge but it makes up for it in the sheer level of intractability and procedural change activating your hunter sense flutters everything not tied down billows and blows your cape and hair carves a path through entire fields of flowers the wind alters the landscape gusting through terrain monsters carve paths through forests leaving trails of glowing bamboo stumps to track them by creatures writhe below the grass fleeing from combat attacks crack the earth monsters carve trenches and furrows and paint the entire landscape in their element and terrain the weather shifts dynamically as they move and fight and the very map changes as the elements clash and collide none of it is in the highest rez and at times it looks clunky but the sheer level of change on display here makes every hunt feel unique in some small way as you look back on the carnage youve wrought punctuated by the towers of crates scattered springs and glowing torches youve littered in the fight

the map development can only be compared to death stranding at times you will find routes carve paths set up ziplines place tents in key locations to fast travel to build towers to glide from and if you go all out even build skybase platforms of crates holding entire industrial hubs at the sky limit scattering bikes to give rapid chase ziplines across mountains and through caves learning locations and arenas to preplace traps or walls to shift the fight its gloriously dynamic and permanent and leaves you feeling as if youve truly mastered the map around you

combat is deceptively deep with even 50 hours in im still finding tech and tricks to make it faster and better long combo finishers can be canceled with karakuri box hops interrupting strikes to spring dash out of danger training your fingers to slam down fusion karakuri to counter moves as the monster does them weapons are fairly simplistic and easy to master because they are only half of the depth of the system intended to be woven seamlessly with building and engineering at every turn

the weapon upgrade and skill tree promises absurd builds with a dozen steps to get the exact tool you want and is fully refundable encouraging experimentation and practice never locking you into a single path that you cant get out of with a few coins the karakuri tree is intimidatingly large unlocked both with currency you spend and inspiration you earn during specific hunts and in unique ways

the pool of monsters is fairly slim compared to monster hunter but aside from variants of the same monster no two feel the same theres no reused skeletons or animation assets with each fight playing out distinctively differently from the last elemental variants are used but even those mix things up introducing new behaviors and attacks to the base kit

as a fan of monster hunter this scratches that same itch improves in key ways that i didnt even realize i wanted changed from mh and falls short in some areas despite that this title has more than earned its seat at the monster hunting table and i cant wait to see how its refined going forward more content and larger setting is the only improvement i can think of for this title but even the content here is depthy and lengthy enough to keep you satisfied for a very long time

just so long as you can run it im recommending it based on the gameplay and my sheer enjoyment of it but i want everything said within this review to be taken with a grain of salt about performance if you can run this you will find a lot to enjoy but that is a mighty big if

#####

honestly i can recommend this game if you can run it and i shouldnt have to say that but i will give it a yes with the caveat that try the trial first

for the game itself its fucking fantastic



edit

no patches for ages they let it sit and new monsters for ages even though we were told we would get more its a dead game that was really awesome

#####

has boob slider performance issues are now tolerable 1010h2200 hour updateh2i find how some say that if you like monster hunter youll like this a bit deceiving they have very different play stylesh3dont likeh3i dont like the combat building gimmick its too complicated and has too many pieces for it to be something to easily commit to muscle memory to me it seems like the gimmicks in monster hunter ie the clutch claw and wirebugs give you an increased edge in hunts but the game can be played perfectly normally without them the building is basically required in wild hearts if you dont want to have a miserable time the monsters are too spastic if you dont lock them down endlessly else youll rarely hit themthere is no defensive style weapon ie lance from mh for anyone who plays that way and the hand cannon the games answer to the bowgun is convoluted and not a satisfying standin none of the weapons in this have that 100 feelgood for methe monsters track you almost perfectly and can make 180 degree trajectory changes midair to hit you dodging is more about using iframes than evading an attack thats not something im a fan of in a monster hunting game especially when you have to be very well timed its neigh unforgiving and gets more frustrating than funthe story got stale fast and i ended up skipping most of itpc performance and bugs are abysmal at the time of this reviewh3likeh3at least wild hearts puts your weapon away and automatically makes you spring when holding sprint something mhr took away after world for some reason on ranged weaponsthe zone sizes are vast and fun the base building is neat and the methods you can use to travel around are really cool the food making concept is neat but it gets annoying after a while having to fill in each individual apparatusthe game bdoesb have the all important boob slider kekthe combat while not as enjoyable for me can be better with other people since the spastic fiends will focus on others every so often so you can do somethingthe biggest issue is often finding people to play withthe way hunts are started and grouped are looked for is much simpler in this the way the map works and hunts are selected and such that is a major plus in this game the ui in general is fantastic however it does act up a lot with with the mouse i have to click several times for a button to work at timesh3conclusionh3i like everything but the combat and while the weapon styles can be good its the design on the combat itself that ruins it for me the awful dodge system the monster that track you so closely and the not great building gimmicki tried i really tried to enjoy myself putting a couple of hundred hours into itwhat i can say about playing the combat in this game is that it made me go back and playing mhw for old times sakefor me this isnt competition for monster hunter

#####

its a shame literally such a great game but the technical issues just make it unplayable i have good specs and it still stutters all the time

#####

bought the game on release and every patch day i redownload to test on a 4090 ive started to put on clown make up every patch day cause i tell myself this may be the patch that fixes the game a bought a while back runs amazing if you like power point presentations and if anyone else tells you it runs on their pcunfriend them cause they are a liar or still game on ps2
i enjoyed redfall more and have had less problems

#####

i was very lucky that i did not have the myriad of performance issues that many others had  not sure why my rig isnt particularly powerful and i was able to play just fine with the settings up high enough to be pretty ive played mh since tri never felt satisfied by risesunbreak but wild hearts just clicked unlike mh games where you really want to get through the story asap to get to the highest tier of monsters take the time to farm new armor and weapons while progressing through the story in the grand scheme of video game storytelling its not groundbreaking but i will say it does it so much better than mh plus theres no real endgame and it seems there never will be  honestly if wild hearts had ripped off the guiding lands from mhw it wouldve been awesome to have a reason to keep farming kemono after you get the build you feel comfy with man i really do love this game and i am so sad the resources and effort arent being poured into it the way any mh competitor would need to  capcom has had like 20 years to reach the depth and breadth mh has reached seeing this game wither is like seeing a cute sweet dog be neglected and left out in a junkyard 

theres solid bones of a truly great mh alternative here and i hope either the series gets resurrected by a studio who canwill put continual passion into it or that a studio takes notes of where it diverged from mh in positive and creative ways and creates their own engaging alternative

id say pick it up if you havent already and love mh with the caveat that if you cant get it running satisfactorily within the first 90mins go ahead and return it but if you can get it running i think youll be pleasantly surprised and find it a refreshing break from what weve come to expect from mh

#####

1  lm finding myself fighting the poor camera controls more than anything else the lock on camera will constantly spin the camera to face you as a monster prepares to run or do a big attack

2 the mauls tutorial is so incorrect you will be there ages trying to figure out what the heck the buttons youre meant to press for the mauls timing mechanic theres no weapon cmbo page if you want a quick refresher

3 supports playstation controller has a ps5 game outpc game doesnt have a simple controller mode for selecting xbox or playstation ui really fun trying to not press x when it means square

4  where did they test this game how did it get launched with that poor a framerate l have a 2070 super and it runs like a potato

5 99 aud this would have been acceptable at a 60 pricepoint  lm guessing ea went full greed yet again




#####

since the performance update that game now runs worse than at launch it runs in slow motion at 3040 fps 

specs
cpu 5800x3d
gpu 4090
ram 32gbs 3800 mhz
storage nvme ssd 

i want to recommend this game but cant in current state

#####

good game  tell ea to get their stuff togehter for pc gamers

#####

this game literally destroyed my pc and ive been apprehensive to even start it up again to try and see if it works cause i dont want to have to rebuild my computer again i cant with sound mind give this game a good recommendation i will say however that the actual setting and gameplay aspects of the game are top notch and id put them up with mhw in terms of overall design when it works

#####

i finally completed the game after about 80 hours of frustration grind fun and pain

when it came out it ran like crap and even now it runs like crap for a lot of people no matter the specs i was kinda lucky that the first performance patch helped me reach an almost consistent 60 fps which made it actually really fun 

the gameplay is nice and the weapons feel unique enough to make them worth switching around 

the karakuri system feels fluent enough to not be in the way and gives you a lot of options to hunt

even though there are a lot of monster related karakuris that i havent even unlocked since i dont see the need for them if you got the basics like trap and harpunes 

overall its a really fun experience and i can recommend it to any monster hunting fan who feels the urge to conquer another world of monsters but only if the performance is patched and the price drops to around 40 bucks for the content it holds

#####

great game play honestly it ticks off many boxes monster hunter never looked at the story line is even richer


#####

i refunded the game wouldnt recommend buying it unless you have a nasa pc buy monster hunter world or rise instead cheaper and probably better at least they are fun and playable this isnt playable

i heard this game had bad performance but i naively bought it anyway since i have a high end pc and knew if it was that bad i could get a refund i got around 50 fps max on low settings with drops as low as 30 fps is very unstable it feels awful constant stuttering and fps spikes fighting small enemies in the tutorial the devs have said they are looking to fix some of the issues next week yes next week paying this much for a aaa game and you have to wait a week to possibly make it playable what a joke embarrassing

#####

extremely fun monster hunting game with quite interesting building mechs inside and outside of combat the only thing i hate is that the game runs very poorly they promise a performance patch within a week of now so maybe itll be aok then also 2 patches in the first 2 days so far to deal with bugs and stuff so im optimistic

#####

way to much performance issues super cool concept and designs but it dosent matter if the game stutters every minute

#####

this game does so much right i hope that if they fix the performance issues you all give it a second chance

#####

seeing that this could now be axd by ea i thought id share my peace

as a fan of monster hunter for 15 years this game was a fresh take on the way to approach fighting the big baddies

the karakuri system was fun reactive and allowed you to approach the big baddies in a way other than traditional mhs dodge and slash it was really fun

performance was an issue and i had to do a lot to stay at 60fps but when it was there it was great on sale this game is worth your admission 

i hope capcom tries to buy the karakuri system or mimic it in some form it will be missed if its now dust in the wind like many other ea titles

im looking at you ssx

#####

if you consider getting this game just remember to back up your whole save file after saving in game or else you might lose everything in a random bad day

i really want to leave a positive review for this game but the incident with losing my whole game progression 100 hours of gameplay after 1 blue screen crash might be a thing you should consider when getting this game the fact that this game has no steam cloud sync option  ea sync is not working the way it should is unreliable even the ea support couldnt recover your progress if you deleted the save files folder by unintentional bugs i did contact them and that was the answer for my case if you wonder

#####

if i can run a vr game like half life alyx at max settings or even far cry 6 at max settings yet i cant run this at low settings that says a lot about this games optimization even says my computer cant run this game which is bs poor optimization and just a cheap cash grab at dark souls ea cant get their shit straight

#####

the performance issues seem to be fixed and the gameplay is great as a monster hunter fan i allways wanted to give this one a shot and it sure feels great to play so far

#####

a great game that was abandoned too early

#####

i thought by now they would have fixed this game enough to be playable at least so i picked up on the sale 30 off i did not have any fps issues but boy does the game stutter alot maybe this game will be playable in the future but for now i refunded it

shame

#####

i read the review about the guy complaining about the cues being too fast and the rolls being bad and unreliable i just want to say that the iframes on the rolls are incredibly generous you just cant roll as crazy as you can in mh there is a pause between them and it makes it feel limited if all youre using to dodge is what the character can do youre gonna struggle hard with the game the springstep structure has iframes on its start up and they are massive the backstep when you create a structure while your weapon is out has iframes theres so many ways to move around and a ton of iframes to play with but you have to break out of just thinking you need to use your standard roll to do it

this game is a ton of fun im having an absolute blast with the amount of freedom you have that the building mechanic creates i was really mixed on it at first but once you unlock a few and get used to it its one of the main points of the game for me its so refreshing 

you can tell they really thought about how to make this game unique and they did please give it a try when it gets patched or when its on discount i dont think you will regret it

#####

i really dont like giving it a negative review but its almost unplayable
im on a 1080ti and im getting somwhere bettween 12 and 25 fps on low settings depending on area and fight and with more than 1500h in mhw in gotta say the telegraphing is aslmost non existent by the time you realize a large aoe attack is going to happen its to late to dodge it sometimes it feels like you must know what the monster is going to do before it even does it and long range attacks have better tracking than a homing missile

it would be a really cool and pretty game really unfortunate maybe it gets better over time but as long as devs push new content instead of fixing the game its not going to change i feel like 

edit seems like the game is dead now httpssteamchartscomapp1938010

#####

game is great the gameplay really fun and interactive
however as of right now the game have performance issue still playable but not the best when you play around in a high grass density


#####

at this time i cannot recommend the game still runs like trash and stutters a fair amount shame to because it does alot things better then monster hunter imo

#####

look i know the game doesnt run well for other people but it has for me even prepatch so i cant knock it for that 3070ti i7 1100k 36ghz and i know the game needs a lot of polish descrptions are wonky like they were ai generated karakuri crafting is super finicky and doesnt want to connect a lot of the times and gear is kind of lackluster

buuuut its still a really fun game once you get into it chapter 3 and beyond gameplay is solid everything else just needs some work for 70 maayyybbeeee get it on gamepass or ea plus if you wanna give it a try or wait for a sale but if youre not too concerned with the price tag go for it

#####

performance is terrible beautiful environments awesome mechanics top notch gameplay  fps laggy and unbearable hard to enjoy when it runs like a potato i can run red dead redemption 2 on max settings and yet this game cant even its like everythings gone backwards prices gone up and quality of releases is downright shameful and disastrous wtf is happening

#####

i important note almost all of the negative reviews are because of the games poor performance and that is fair i dont want anyone to dismiss this game because of the reviews though performance aside it is a very good game im able to get a stable 60fps but realistically should be getting much better than that many people due to the current poor optimization are not able to achieve even 30 once things are patched up give it a shot

update nov 12 2023 support for this game ended a few months ago and performance is still a major issue particularly in the late game despite this i loved my time with the game and recommend it to anyone who can tolerate a lower frame ratei

i want to keep the comparisons to monster hunter as limited as i can but it will be unavoidable with mh being the foundation of the genre this is an oversimplification but the gameplay is pretty much exactly what it looks like monster hunter with building the building mechanic or karakuri as its called ingame seemed like a weird gimmick to me at first when watching gameplay videos before launch i was pretty torn on whether i wanted the game the karakuri looked weird and out of place and combat seemed to lack proper impact im happy to report that when actually playing the game these are not issues for the most part

the karakuri feel like a perfect extension of your moveset the basic buildingsthe box the torch the spring and the gliderall provide new attacks for each weapon so they dont always feel like building in fact most of the time i dont even register that ive built something rather i use the karakuri with the intention of using the attack associated with it it feels naturally integrated into the rest of the game

outside of combat the karakuri are great mobility tools you are able to shape the map to your liking by placing ziplines giant upward fans etc to make traversal easier everything you place is persistent so if you leave and come back it will all still be exactly where you placed it using this same mechanic youre also able to set up campsites anywhere you want this means creating fast travel points at any spot on the map there is a limit to how much you can build in each area although this limit can be raised as you progress

speaking of progression this game absolutely nails it the game scales at the perfect rate so difficulty is constant as you encounter new monsters called kemono new karakuri are unlocked each time you fight a new kemono plus the obvious new armor sets and weapons the weapons to me are the most interesting part of progression because weapon trees are not linear its more of a web with each upgrade connecting to several others including previous upgrades with this system youre able to wind your way through the upgrades transferring the weapon skills you like along the way this flexibility in crafting allows you to easily create a weapon perfectly suited to your play style and the best part is you can refund your upgrades to regain all spent materials except gold so its super easy to try new builds or even new weapon types

there are 8 weapon types all of which handle completely differently from fast whipbladed katanas to slow extendable hammers or attack on titan style dual blades theres something for everyone theres even a weapon that transforms into 5 different weapons the 5th being a sword the size of which would make even capcom jealous all the weapons have good damage output and feel equally viable no one weapon feels objectively better than the others they also all feel satisfying to use with proper weight behind the attacks

being in the monster hunting genre combat is the highlight of the game unfortunately the combat is also where the game starts to show its flaws weapons for starters have a more limited moveset than youd expect its not painfully simple but it never gets quite as complex as something like monster hunters charge blade this does seem intentional because of how the karakuri can function as attacks with each weapon having unique attacks for each karakuri if you are frequently using all of the karakuri at your disposal your own moveset does feel adequately varied the weapons by themselves though feel like theyre missing something this moveset limitation extends to the kemono as well with some fights particularly the first couple feeling a bit repetitive

the karakuris use in combat is very fresh and creative and can lead to some satisfying moments like baiting a kemono to charge into a karakuri wall that then launches them backwards leaving them momentarily toppled youre able to combine the basic karakuri in different numbers and patterns to create new larger karakuri like the wall unfortunately as fun and clever as this mechanic is it can be frustrating to pull off during a fight when you need to place say 6 torches in a 2x3 pattern within one second or less while a kemono is baring down on you youre gonna make a mistake now you have 6 torches scattered around serving no purpose which are immediately destroyed as the kemono ploughs through the torches and your body it is far too easy to mess up these larger karakuri combos in the heat of battle which often leaves me feeling unwilling to use them despite the huge advantages they provide

finally perhaps the biggest issue in combat is the camera locking on to kemono feels unresponsive youre frequently left with the camera facing the wrong direction despite being locked on and if there is even the slightest bit of environmental detail blocking your view then you are screwed ive been killed because i had grass blocking my camera covering up the entirety of the absolutely enormous kingtusk this is a problem far more often than it should ever be i havent been this frustrated with a games camera since pacman world 2

thankfully the bulk of this games problems can be fixed via patches camera controls can be tweaked rendering in front of the camera can be changed and the karakuri combo building can be adjusted wild hearts has an incredible foundation that allows for frequent moments of pure heartpumping adrenalinerushing joy it just needs a bit more polish which im hoping to see in the promised free content updates

#####

quite simply do not buy this game a real shame because if you get a period of stability with it its a really good alternative to monster hunter

i did most of my playing at 1080p on a midrange system then i upgraded to something capable of 4k60ultra and the stuttering is actually worse

update
because the game is fun i decided to stick at it and try to find away to improve it and i think i found something basically i think the game needs a huge performance overhead

to expand on the original review i was playing on a 5600x6600 xt16gb ram pc i think the settings were 1080p fsr quality and normal settings it was playable but occasionally stuttery then i upgraded to a 5800x 3d7900 xtx32gb ram pc and hoped to get good performance at 4k not happening so i decided to go back to 1080p and the game actually runs pretty flawlessly in 1080p no fsr and highest settings so i hope it stays this way and i can at least play the game again this way it uses 8gb vram about 12gb system ram and 60 gpu utilisation 

i still dont recommend the game because while the game seems to work for me this may not be the solution for anyone else

#####

when considering the merits of this particular entertainment experience it must be noted that when everything works precisely as anticipated and you dont try to minmax the content is quite enjoyable and engaging the graphics quality is satisfactory with a reasonable level of detail and visual appeal additionally there is a fair amount of fun to be had in cooperative multiplayer with friends extending up to endgame

combat itself is rather enjoyable often providing an immersive and thrilling experience unless one encounters technical or control input difficulties which can and do occur frequently if it isnt a graphics issue rare is for me more about graphics below an inconsistency with dodgeiframes controls or latency will almost always spoil this generally quite tight and responsive game i feel that the game works as intended 9598 of the time during hunts that 25 is frustrating breaks all immersion and is easily one of the most significant issues with this title

content wise wild hearts has a simplified approach to hunts it drops some of the more timeconsuming elements of mhworldrise hunts such as sharpening eating in the tenttown and managing multiple potiongearsets there isnt a slotin replacement or improvement for any of these elements they are simply removed leaving nothing but the hunt and a simple food menu 

the fortniteesque karakuri elements are fine though i rarely find any of the karakuri more enjoyable than switch skills andor the wirebugsilkbind attacks in mhworldrise they certainly have far less flow that similar elements in fortnite and can easily take you out of the fight while you press 3 or 6button long combinations

material farming isnt bad in wild hearts with most gearweapons requiring only a few kills for the required materials weapons and armor have a variety of valid configurations but the best options arent hard to parse out  biggest damage number with the biggest damage enhancement traits matching your play style this potentially streamlined and engaging experience is utterly undermined by the significant time investment for other simple things food production and gold 

everything requires gold and there is no easy way to make gold thus to try a new weapon or armor build where you already have the materials expect to invest 12 days of playtime farming gold just to try a new weapon or armor configure that probably wont be any better than your last weapon food production is not nearly as bad as gold farming but the best options still require multiple steps each step is 10 realworld minutes for production

in terms of more general shortcomings

poor performance is be a persistent issue with limited fps and 1 lows that can be quite jarring im playing on a 5800x3d  64gb ram  7900xtx at 3480x1600 highest settings my fps average over 30 hours is 801 my 1 lows  427 average latency  16ms friends with fairly highend systems from 13 years ago or modern midrange systems experience 40fps at 4k 60ish at 1440p every one of us gets stutters and frame drops no matter how low settings are configured

the lore the characters and the plots are relatively lackluster and predictable relying heavily on generic tropes and cliches with few if any surprises or innovative elements to differentiate it from a 6thgraderwhosjustdiscoveredthelordoftherings first attempt at fantasy writing honestly the 6th graders probably got better stuff than the wrote garbage in this game

monsters are somewhat unique and their movesets arent bad but variety is severely lacking leading to diminished replay value the game has none of the arcade feel of mh where youre just pounding on something for the fun of doing just that no this game is all about flow and mechanical execution the 100th time you dodge the same move in the same way when the dodge works you start to ask  why am i doing this

because of all of the above there is really no endgame and because there is no endgame or replay value few people continue to play this game

all things considered it is difficult to recommend wild hunts at the 70 price point given its relatively shallow nature notinsignificant technical and control issues and general shortness in comparison to its competitors such as the monster hunter series

its a fun game and i hope to see more competition in the monster hunting space improve the genre buy it on sale and play with some friends

#####

i dont recommend this game for now
playin with the prelaunch of the game

technical issues
 inconsistent framerate and weapons to hitbox to hurtbox frame timing is so inconsistent
wehn you have a frame timing of 34 frames to parry but your games inconsistency with spikes down to 2 fps how do you expect to parry attacks avg framerate in around 1520fps on low
gsnodachi has no hyper armour so trading attacks is just not a good idea you get punished so hard for trading if you want a nice world with better frameratre and better frame timing for weapons go play mhworld iceborne
highly not recommended will wait for day 1 patch

#####

game plays like garbage on a top tier pc  4k 60 fps it has not been optimized at all i refunded it before the first mission was finished did not need more than 30 minutes to know that turning down the settings would be the start of a long string of frustrating events

#####

okay so wow do i have some thoughts on this game

first would i recommend this game to people

answer no
simply for the fact that it feels like an unfinished game 

second why dont you recommend it exactly

answer umm let me explain
it runs terribly
it feels as though the game is in early access but it isnt
i have a friggin 3080 with 32 gb of ram and the loading screens take ten yes ten minutes to load 
like what the hell man

third why does it feel like an early access game whats missing other than the performance issues

answer
okay so this game has armor sets made out of monster parts right
you know the whole monster hunter thing that makes these games fun
well the armor sets are butt
5075 of them are completely worthless
like why do so many of them have the same abilities on them
why couldnt you vary the abilities out between armor sets better
also no one i repeat no one wants your stupid stealth attack ability
its trash stop putting in on every gd damn pair of gauntlets or boots
stop that ability is completely pointless 
ooooo i get a 30 on my first attack before the monster aggros me
shoots one single arrow
oh wow it did 130 damage instead of 100 amazing
ugh

fourth are there any redeeming qualities about this game 
you played for over 45 hours it must have something to keep you coming back

answer yes but thats what makes it so sad to give it a not recommended

this game is a wonderful foundation for what could be an amazing series of alternative monster hunter games
the game play loop is solid the actual fighting and weapons are extremely well done
the only reason i kept coming back putting up with texture popin stupidly long cutscenes and long loading screens was the game play
the karakuri system is actually extremely fun to play with and definitely increases the variability of hunts

fifth more complaints

there is a huge flaw with the way you unlock the main karakuri the inspiration system is trash there are about 10 or so major karakuri that you can unlock by completing hunts with specific monsters while have specific minor karakuri equipped the issue with this system is its friggin rng also if youre playing with other people and they need the inspiration for that specific karakuri too they will more often than not get the inspiration to proc before you and thats not even the worst of it they give you literally 2 seconds 2 friggin seconds to click the right mouse button during a hunt to initiate the inspiration like imagine if you will youre in the air doing a sick air combo filling up your ultra instinct gage its not actually called that and a thing popsup in the middle of your screen saying push me but you cant because youre literally stuck in a combo animation for the next 34 seconds and by the time you finish that animation and land back on the ground again the prompt is gone poof you have no idea how infuriating that is and how often it happened to me screw the inspiration system cool idea needs to be implemented better

im going to be uninstalling the game and no longer playing it
im done ive reached far enough into the end game to see what is there or isnt there rather
i could have kept going but i dont want to the armor sets may look pretty but are functionally useless in every way
so no incentives there

my hope is they learn there lesson with this one and make a more compelling game for the inevitable sequel because this aint it chief

ps  the story is dog poo i was yawning throughout the entire thing after the first 2 hours or so i just started skipping all the story cutscenes this game is the perfect lullaby if you or someone you know is having sleep problems haha

#####

wild hearts is actually really fun i was genuinely surprised there are a ton of interesting ideas here all pretty well executed the combat is great there are like 6 or 7 different weapon types and theyre all really unique you can have a big ass fan with blades on the side of it or a staff that warps into a giant shuriken or of course a giant hammer there certainly arent as many weapons as in monster hunter but what we have here is still a great package
the art team for this game absolutely crushed it they need a raise this game is gorgeous the fight with the dragon where it changes scenery when he roars is so cool i kept my settings on mediumhigh and it looked fantastic however the performance was pretty booty
the story is complete trash english voices are on by default and i didnt feel like changing it they fucking suck obviously i tried to pay attention to the story for the first few hours but i just couldnt its so boring and nonsensical
performance is unnacceptable i have a 4080 i911900k 32gb ddr4 with the game installed on an m2 and i never hit above 60fps for the vast majority of the game i was around 3040 fps i tried lowering the settings messing with dlss and updating my drivers but it didnt matter performance was never good

if you have game pass or ea play you get a 10 hour trial of the game definitely do that before you buy

#####

everything wrong about  pc gaming bundled into one product xd

#####

tldr cool gameplay sad performance buggy controls

will say the gameplay is really cool however it feels hard to do right and very sluggish if you dont do it right straight away if i put more time in i could get better discover more and enjoy it so much

unfortunately the performance just sucks i can comfortably run cyberpunk maxed out and average around 60 fps no stutters its just a seamless experience thanks to the tireless effort they put into optimizing the game in wild hearts however while maxed out i can get a very unstable 60 fps for some reason turning off motion blur helped a little but its still far from a smooth and consistent experience and worst of the game will completely freeze for up to seconds at a time often in the middle of combat

to top it all off the controls for mk just suck thats why i tried to play it with my controller this worked pretty well honestly untill the game just completely stopped taking inputs for the controller it acknowledged it was there knew when i disconnected and the controller worked outside of the game but nothing i did would let me continue my playthrough using controller

thank god i used ea play to download it but honestly a waste of a day downloading it

#####

i recommend this game to all lovers of the monster hunter type games
it scratches the correct itch but id still recommend to either play monster hunter world or rise before bothering to get this 

im happy to not need to sharpen my blade every time the monster runs away
im not very happy with being unable to dodge midpotionanimation i swear half my deaths are because of this

it is not a pure weaponskill game unlike monster hunter here you have karakuri you can craft in the middle of battle you only get to choose 4 and using these four you can create combinations to create things like fireworks basically flash bombs that makes the monster the flinch big bombs that go boom walls the monster can crash into and then become stunned id argue that with the proper use of karakuri the hunt might go easier than monster hunter tho personally i suck at that type of multitasking and remembering comboes so i generally only use one karakuri and thus i feel like wild hearts is a much harder game than mh i atleast swear a lot more playing it

a lot of people are having performance issues despite having already seen one patch that is supposed to help personally my game runs fine but i might be one of the lucky ones 

but its a great game to play when youve run out of monster hunter games to play 
id recommend it over god eater god eater will run smoother and have a batter story but its always been a little too easy

#####

caveat this game runs unacceptably poorly i have a 4090 and i still get fps drops below 60 pretty regularly that is ridiculous and should never happen i cant recommend it if youre not confident about your rig

but that aside this game is freakin fun the weapons are way cooler than the monster hunter ones and using them feels a lot more flexible than the get locked into an animation with no way out thing the mh games have had since i started playing them 20 years ago the world feels open with lots of little nooks and crannies to explore the upgrade paths for weapons feel a lot more intuitive because they follow a map theres some basic base building but its a nice touch the npcs are not unbearably 

i love it i love this game i dunno if anyone else is playing so i might be soloing it all but damn its fun

#####

pretty great as long as whatever setup youre running can handle the subpar port

#####

lucky to get a stable 4550 fps on the lowest graphic settings oof
theyll ask for 6080 for their poorly optimised aaa game but wont release the bug and stability fixes until next week huh

clearly this game was rushed and or ea gave them an unrealistic timeframe to develop and be launch ready

cool concept genuinely like what they have going so far but man is this game not ready

#####

edit dispite its many graphical flaws and cons below the gameplay itself is very fun the game has had many patches to smooth out its flow

pros 
fun weapons
unique combos for weapons
karakuri building contraptions very fun and engaging different combos create different effects
beautiful environment
seamless assist for hunts when you activate it
weapon progression treeskill transfers great idea
karakuri development tree
supposedly free expansions and updates

cons
graphics settings if you cannot find the sweet spot
opens ea launcher to play
facial expressions bad
people talking really slow you probably read the whole subtitle before they get out 3 words
monsters are glitchy
monster physics arent there sometimes going into the monster and get lost
camera and actions are very hard when you grab onto monster
3 players max 
there are typos in the gamenoticeable grammar issues with some descriptions
things dont get explained well example when you pickup collectible items it tells you to hold down button but that button always moves your cursor around if you dont let go of it perfectly for controller it will cycle around and you dont even know what you picked up
crashes and lose saves


overall
6510
i still think this game is fun with its many issues a very high competitor to mhw i want to recommend this game i would say wait for sale for those who havent heard about this game its a hard sell to say get it for the 6999 cost i still enjoy my time on it with friends and figuring out the monsters combination for it being unpolished i still would say a lot of people can and will still have fun with it unfortunately the cost vs casualweekend gamers would probably have to pass on this one because making progress with a chance to lose it all is rough and finding the correct graphical settings was a lot of time wasted i do like that they said future expansions will be free thank god but still dont think i am near end game yet with 30 hours going on hunts is fun and manipulating the terrain with different contraptions to traverse the land is very fun another thing is story why even have response options not like it changes the story or path of what is going to happen so responding with i will avenge them vs what would do we do now takes you to the exact same placehunt so why add this at all as stated with all its cons it is still a very fun game for people who like mhw

scores
graphics 610 tentative as explained above but can be as good as an 810
customization 810 7 for character and 9 for weapons
soundsmusic 710
controls 510
difficulty 610
story 110

#####

fix the performance and then ill be able to recommend it


#####

the game runs like hot garbage while looking worse than older games that run perfectly fine im on a 2070 with an i79700k

i was hoping theyd have a day 1 patch to address what people have been making clear for the last 10 days even a day 2 patch hearing the official response that ill have to wait till sometime next week to properly play a game ive purchased today is just unacceptable especially at this pricepoint if the game was not ready the game should not have been released

youll notice i only have 02 hours in game i didnt even get to the action standing still in the tutorial level i couldnt manage more than 20fps on medium settings i wish i could be one of those people who runs against the grain and calls the review bombers childish for overreacting but this is one of those few situations where its simply warranted release a finished product or dont release it until its finished

#####

i would love to give this game a good rating really do the setting is fun the idea is fun the gameplay is fun for the most part

however the way it was released is a joke

ever since the promised patch the game has been running worst my barely 60 fps on rtx4090 has gone down to 40 at solo hunting in multiplayer is usually at 20 fps at best and slow mode most of the time

but this is just the tip of the iceberg 80 hours in and this is the not the worst of it the game itself is janky beyond belief

camera tracking just doesnt work on flying enemies if an enemy flies in to the air good luck landing a counter or dodging an attack camera wont track so you better hope there is some sound cue to listen to

the worst of the jank however comes not just from camera but the enemies all too many times have i fainted from a monster hitting me then tossing me into fake iframe only for my character to hit a tiny ledge or bump where it auto resets the iframes of getting hit for the monster to instantly hit me again and one hit kill me

i truly wish for this game to go well i want a competitor for the monster hunter series

maybe this game wouldve been that if it was less janky and ran better but so far the biggest problem is yet to be fixed and the rest will most likely wont be touched on

#####

had to update my review despite its horrible optimization which was still playable cuz i have a strong rig wild hearts is a fun game the premise is so good being able to construct structures to fight  traverse adds another layer to monster hunting i am still not sure if it works indeed as intended during the fights as it sometimes can be overwhelming to build during the fights no i dont have a fortnite history but for the traversal part it works really well connecting the map and mastering your very own shortcuts makes the chase part less horrendous 

interaction with the world is quite limited but each map has their own habitat where you probably would need to pet or slay their kemonos monsters for farming materials for the first entry i would argue that there are enough karakuris for both fighting and traversing issues however for a sequel i wonder how further they can push their imagination armors for the most looks fair and decent with each offering different weaknesses and strengths to each elements and offers unique stats however i really didnt see the benefit of completing a whole armor set 

weapons are low in quantity that might be good for the beginners as you wouldnt get overwhelmed by the mechanics however after spending a while as much as they are fun to use they are not just enough weapons are unique by themselves not necessarily by their upgrade paths while there are slight differences upgrade paths are mostly essentially the same it makes sense being able to utilize every element for each weapon however does not make much sense that there are no further skill sets which you can unlock upgrading by weapons they are mostly mathematical calculations which are shared by pretty much every weapon regardless i wouldnt say weapons are not satisfying qualitywise they are there are enough different type of attacks with unique animations to make the journey enjoyable but it still somehow leaves lot to be desired 

main drawback of wild hearts is the uniqueness of its monsters there are a dozen of damn good fights but the whole endgame is the stronger version of a stronger version of a stronger version of a kemone you fought before it gets stale mostly due to the fact those kemones are a fkn sponge and not unique or variable in patterns or more aggressive endgame is easily skippable as it offers pretty much nothing besides cosmetics and achievements for completion increasing hp pool and presenting it as a new boss is always a lame move i am aware its a thing in monster hunter as well and monster hunters variety is also correlated to the fact it was and still is a strong ongoing series and probably will be for years to come if anything a wild heart sequel can unlock its potential for good

graphics are overall good however texture quality is not as strong as some of the current gens products makes you wonder how they failed to optimize it this badly also snowstorm during chapter 4 in the fort map was quite irritating to me

music is banger

story who cares well some might argue its still better than not having one though

810 solid 

ps i did not really care about omega forces works til fire emblem especially three warriors but this pushed them further in the market as i read it looking at their portfolio which is stuffed with musou strategy games and licensed weeaboo games this probably feels as a breath of fresh air to them too there are just not enough decent hunter games

another ps you are able to create some of the best waifus in this game

#####

game runs through the ea launcher has issues detecting controller with the controller accessing the mouse and keyboard as well as its own controls

in game controls unresponsive unsure if graphically bugged but couldnt locate threads with hunter vision screen tearing and fps issues on low settings despite having a 4080

not playing beyond the first hunt as this is abysmal

#####

so im not sure if ive just gotten lucky or if they have fixed the major performance issues but the games runs fine for me now that being said i have found this to be an immensely rewarding monster hunter like game to play 
the art is gorgeous the weapons are fun and the story is weirdly good for a game in this genera
so bearing in mind that as of this moment i havent had any bugs 910 for me

#####

review is meant for friends but anyone else is welcome to read

1st of all i believe im one of the lucky players who does not have a single problem with the game so far i have no massive frame drops no stutters and online pretty much works as intended as for the ea app to launch the game problem that everyone else seem to be having problems with again i dont have that problem yes it takes a while and maybe 2 clicks of play on steam but it just works after i wait a few seconds

i know a lot of us are not fans of ea including me but i have been dying to play this game so i couldnt care less who publishes it i just need it

the price ah yes here we go again yes the price is damn high yes ea published it i know but honestly i just want the game so theres that i dont care about ea whatever

as for the game review gameplay is great im a true monster hunter fan been playing since the 1st mh on ps2 up to mh rise and wild hearts has been such a welcome new change and variety to the monsterhunting genre some times combat may feel a bit clunky but most of the time its fluid the iframes are harder to predict on this than monster hunter just a heads up and the new karakuri mechanics might mess you up the first few hours because of how important it is to your hunts you can manage to just swing away weapons but youll be missing out on so much potential if not

performance for me like i said i havent been getting any problems i sometimes dip near 5560fps but rarely ive been playing with a stable 80100fps everything on high except shadows which i keep on medium that seems to help a bit as for what gear im running im using amd ryzen 7 3700x with a gtx3070 and 32gb of rami play a lot of flight sims and do work on this machine too havent seen any reddit posts or guides to help with performance but im sure theyll roll out a patch

so my final thoughts for should you buy or not are as follows

 first if you think you love what the monsterhunting genre has to offer and want to try wild hearts but still a bit doubtful on the performance either borrow a friends account if they have it to try and run on your machine or get ea play and play the trial to testcheaper option i wouldnt recommend straight buying it and refunding it later if it does not work
 secondly if you do buytest the game make sure you have the new ea app and not the old origin launcher migrate your origin account to ea app to eliminate some of the hassle
 if you have been playing monster hunter for some time and love the developers koei tecmo games for what they have created in the past nioh aot dead or alive rottk and dont give a damn about ea just get it they will surely fix the issues someday and if not well the world is never fair huh
 or just dont get it on pc buy it on console

and finally yes i recommend this to anyone who genuinely loves the monsterhunting genre


#####

theres a lot to digest here and it would take me a while to list them down 

first and foremost yes i do realize the game is very much held back by poor optimization my 3070ti can barely keep the game up over 45fps on medlow settings and dont even try to use the upscaling  it is terrible on a whole entire level though if im being honest i got over that quickly by how fun the combat system is

on to the game itself 

yes its a hunting game and i know your first preconceived notion is  oh its just another mh clone im not gonna outright say no its not because the hunting genre is similar from game to game the core loop is to hunt monsters craft better gear and take on the next beast 

personally it does a good amount to make itself stand out one such thing is by using the karakuri system its a good strategic element to the combat and ive so far found it mostly positive some are awkward to use and craft but you figure out things as you go 

im also a big custom character kind of guy and the options are varied and plenty much so that i wont see the same hunter with the same face and hairstyle often online at least i hope i wont haha 

all in all if i have to give the game a rating i give it a solid 810 at its current state i want to inform people that its really bad optimization however there is a major patch coming soon which seeks to alleviate the issues

also one more thing to add  the armors and weapon look really badass theres a lot of great designs especially for low rank  starting monsters 

its a good game just dont get hung up on the fact that its being review bombed

#####

got to play a little early without the ea pass so did not have to feel rushed with the 10 hour limit 

the game world is beautiful and in my opinion amazing the kemono are extremely well designed and are a lot of fun to fight combat is challenging from the start and continues to be so 

the karakuri crafting is really fun brilliant to have in this game creating launch pads weapons and more 

you can build your camp anywhere makes for a good atmosphere

gathering is not to much of a grind for bits that you need on the go monsters are fun to fight multiple times to grind their bones and parts for upgrades

just to point out im not defending the poor performance ive just been lucky and at the moment ive not had any issues other than a dip in fps now and then

the price is quite high seems thats a trend lately and the performance issues are being worked on but this is a great game a must own for monster hunting fans

with post launch content already planned for march and april this game is a great start to what i hope will be a title thats is supported for a good amount of time would love to see it become a franchise

#####

insane game that runs at 20 fps when im not even doing anything first game optimized so bad that i had to leave a negative review here refunded how dare they sell this absolute shit for 70 bucks

#####

negative till the devs start releasing patches my game now runs at 10 fps and i cant seem to fix it this steam  ea combination is terrible as well needs a lot of fixing back to mhr

im leaving what i said before up because i feel like the game still needs work but the update they released did in fact help a lot i set my graphic settings to max and played for a while and got slight stuttering issues but not as much as before 

the game is fantastic and im excited to see whats in store for us in the future dont let too many of the negative comments get to you as a huge mhr fan i will say this stop comparing the 2 games itll ruin your experience 

one last thing the person singing in minato is annoying af i turned music off and hoped it would shut that person up nope shes apart of the dialogue please change this

ill start by saying that the 70 dollar price tag is not appropriate for this game in comparison to its equal mhw that also paired with the simple fact that this game released nearly unplayable for a good sum of people just doesnt make this game to many approachable this all said however i will easily dump 100 hours into base game content simply because its fun

sitting at nearly 40 hours and i would say maybe half way through the story i have had nothing but fun with combat while the game has its own jank with the construction aspect of the game often times causing needless frustration because you placed the wrong karakuri somewhere along with its sometimes questionable hit boxes yours and monsters damn claw blade the combat is just enjoyable if your a fan of mhw then the combat is defiantly for you with its own spin and uniqueness and perhaps at times slower or more clunky aspects it proposes a good equal that has room to grow and improve with time to perhaps surpass mhws combat one day

as for the story i cant say much its got a lot of parallels to mhw and because of that its quite bland to me personally while there is aspects that differ due to the roots of the game concept the general idea is more or less the same its not bad but its not going to make me miss it 

overall having bought the 90 dollar version of the game preorder karakuri edition i dont feel as bad as i thought i would ive gotten a lot of play time and as ive stated before a lot fun out of this game while it currently cannot hold a candle to mhw i do believe with the right support and love from its developers this game can achieve things and go places mhw couldnt unfortunately at this time it is evident this was a rushed release but if your like me and want to see this game succeed then play the demo if you like and find yourself willing to endure the waves of time with this title then purchase it 

honestly these days games dont release like they once did and thats not entirely the fault of the developers but more so the corporate body which publishes the game deadlines are deadlines and it is what it is however time is a thing and things can get better with it you just have to be willing to endure the time it will take to achieve what was intended and what is yet to come dlc



update after having finally beat this game i can easily say this was worth every penny the story comes together at the end and the final boss just a breath taker all the way if your considering getting into this i can do nothing but say indulge

#####

im going to recommend this game with a caveat  only purchase this if youre bored with monster hunter and are ok with throwing away your money to feel out other conceptual areas that concept could expand into there is so much good going for this game and it has some very strong design elements but it runs like absolute shit and was clearly rushed through development

#####

game is surprisingly addictive and a breath of fresh air in the monster hunting genre i went in with no expectations seeing as how it had eas name attached to it and came out with a ridiculous amount of hours within the first week of release thoroughly impressed by the karakuri mechanic in the game as i was a bit skeptical playing it thinking it was going to become on a hindrance and a gimmick turns out i was surprised yet again and got the hang of it pretty fast the game is a blast to grind out and while ive just started chapter 4 as well as mighty hunts i can say for sure its fun punchy and fast paced the game is also surprisingly easy to pick up and understand especially to those who may be new to the genre

while ive been lucky to not have run into any performance issues besides some fps drops here and there i did run into a few audio bugs and even some monsters getting stuck on top of karakuri another issue i had specifically with the great tusk and its variants were it running from an encounter several times within seconds of chasing it around from another location which may be a pathing issue all these complaints can easily be ironed out with patchbug fixes though which im sure will be addressed

overall a great addition to the genre and some competition to the giant that is monster hunter its refreshing has its own unique strengths and brings more to the table that is honestly going to be so fun to watch grow

edit after doing several other encounters pathing is also broken for other hunts too monsters will just roam for long amounts of time after just fleeing a location even though theyve barely sustained any damage another bug ive encountered was when trying to finish off kemono if more than one hunters timing are close to each other i guess the game has trouble trying to decide who gets the final blow the other players competing cant move after the kill and isnt able to loot the breakable parts worst bug by far to be honest

final edit just have to say severally disappointed in ea and the ea originals program they dont care to let a game grow nor planned to help support the dev team in pursuit of creating something truly unique they thought they could simply market a game as a monster hunter killer without having anything in their repertoire to back this claim ea is truly where good ideas come to die lol

#####

turn on vsync and lock the game to 60 fps 
i have had 0 performance issue after doing so

the game is monster hunter world  death stranding combat is fresh fast and building animation cancels allowing you to do some pretty sick sequences one the fly but im only like 4 hunts in and theses games are more about the long haul so we still gotta see

story better than mhw like im a huge world fan and i will admit that this game just does it better like the fact that the person youre saving on for a hunt is actually in the monsters nest and watching you fight is really cool 

building your hunting grounds is really cool making some psuedo rube goldberg machine of jump pads boost pads zip lines and more makes traversing the map much more functional than rises wirebug system you never gonna be out of wire bugs or stamina like rise 

monster designs are kinda busy and monsters animations are kinda messy so there isnt the most visual clarity when it comes to reading the monsters movements 

overall i would say this is a solid entry to the monster hunter genre and rises about the mere mh clone status that games like god eater toukudenwhich fucking blows and dauntless are all tacked with

#####

if there was a mixed feelings recommendation choice id choose that but ill lean on to yes for now the games really good gameplaywise despite how its perceived as a monster hunter clone theyre both in the big game hunting genre as i would call it but its very much different from monhun the weapons are fun in their own ways and the karakuri is quite enjoyable to pull off mid fights still the game has many shortcomings at the time of review but im praying it gets better performance issues and latency issues when placing karakuri are some of the ones i had gripes with do give it a chance if the budget allows

#####

game runs poorly but it runs
i firmly believe that because ea isnt doing micro transactions theyre crypto mining in the background hence poor performance

i do hope they fix their butt leak though

update as of 33123
praise be to clang
the game runs proper now still not up to snuff for the price tag but a slideshow no more
im only getting 30fps with a 2060 and ryzen 5 but i find that acceptable rating changed from not recommened to eh get it on sale

#####

unacceptable performance and visuals still even post patch update
graphics like this should not run this poorly also game looks like it was designed 5 years ago and runs hugely worse than mh world
is the game playable yes if you can get around the poor performance it technically is still playable but for this game to launch in 2023 with no dlss no fsr no ray tracing not like you could run it anyways no 329 resolution support and having the settings have nolittle impact on performance whatsoever is unacceptable 
im running a 3700x cpu 32gb ram installed and playing from a m2 ssd from a 3070ti and in some spots of the world im hitting around 70fps just roaming with dips down to around 45 as it loads the next area fighting the monsters varies but guestimating around 50ish fps on mediumlow even lowest settings however with that said it is not smooth what so ever even if you can get above 60 fps in a fight it wont last and the frames will be constantly having drastic fluctuations
performance rant aside i can see the potential for this to be a fantastic game my friends and i logged nearly 30 hours into it despite the performance but without them i would not buy this game in this state and if this game continues like this then we also wont buy future titles we have just dealt with the performance issues in hopes that it would be addressed but hope for a patch to fix it will only last so long before this game is just written off as another clone that couldnt meet or exceed the experience we can get from just playing a different game

#####

remove denuvo please it is the thing causing performance problems

i love this game this scratches an itch for hunting type games that mhr couldnt weapons have weight to them and require some mastery to use monsters require you to use more of your arsenal through the karakuri and reward you for doing so this is a good game and its going to get free content updates to make it better too

i cannot recommend it unless they remove denuvo it makes the game slow as shit graphics settings dont change anything its denuvo

please remove denuvo 
for the love of god remove denuvo please see this devs remove denuvo

edit 414
youve played an additional 15 hours would you like to revise your review
no i still cannot recommend
the devs clearly love this game with lots of new content and constant large patches that fix bugs and rebalance weaponsgear i want this game to succeed i really do
remove denuvo please

#####

just get monster hunter

#####

all i can say is the same stuff as everyone else great game and ideas awful performance

#####

embarrassing that they even decided this was good enough to release for this price with this kind of performance for computers

#####

due to the ea app being dysfunctional i was unable to really play the game shame its tied to ea and them pushing the live service app to just play the game

#####

combat is actually pretty fun and i like the monsters but unfortunately the performance is really bad at the moment changing the graphics settings also doesnt make any difference for me

#####

great game and i had fun playing it but it still has alot of tuning needed
i spent almost 100 hours to 100 the game i more or less only used 1 weapon out of all of em thru the entire game
the monsters are cool and some are quite rough
the issue is the game is very hard if you are solo and dont use the building mechanic
if you use the building mechanic then it gets alot easier and you can abuse it to the point of everything becomes too easy
then if you play coop everything becomes a stomp where the monsters have no chance combining this with the easily abused building mechanic you can more or less cc a monster to death making it boring
so for that part the game is as hard as you let it be handicap yourself and the monsters can be really quick agressive and do alot of damage
the story is fine and all but the endgame is more to be desired
there are currently 4 deeply volatile monsters that you can fight you have to farm keystones from slightly easier monsters every time you defeat a deeply volatile you kill theese to get a charm that will help you minmax and it just feels pointless
you can also farm orbs for transmog on the slightly easier endgame monsters but mjehn ty

all in all i feel like i got my moneys worth but the endgame needs morebetter content and the tuning with multiple people vs solo and building mechanics are needed

#####

h1new takeh1

hello i just spent about 30 or 40 minutes typing a few paragraphs thoughtfully telling you why i think you should buy this game even though it still runs like butt cheeks icirca feb 2023i however while editing the review i decided to tick the box on to enable comments as for some reason it was off this deleted everything i typed and i am a little upset here is a summary of what i had to say which is basically just the last paragraph i typed anyways

bmonster hunter but somehow more japanese but also fortniteb if you like monster hunter you will likely enjoy this game as long as you can tolerate switch level performance on nonspacerig hardware being able to place your fast travel camps anywhere on the map is pretty awesome if you havent played monster hunter before this title may be overwhelming in some ways but thats a problem this genre has plenty of experience with

h1old take for archival purposesh1

this game has some truly special stuff going on with it as someone who absolutely adores capcoms monster hunter series it is so unfortunate that the people behind this project are under ea of all publishers supposedly a patch to fix the rampant performance issues should be around in a week but that doesnt matter in this moment

everyone has lost today those who payed day one cant play a fantastic game those who made the game may face job insecurity and the executive that put the greenlight on this build of the game might get a stern email tomorrow truly this title could have easily been a massive success but an unwillingness to delay has let another high profile title trip and fall on the starting line heres hoping that it can catch itself back up later down the line

#####

they werent lying this game can run like shit

just get monster hunter world or monster hunter rise instead
they are
cheaper even without taking into account the common sales going up to 60 off
better optimized for pc and thus run way better 
better looking especially monster hunter world is gorgeous
better to control with more weapons with deeper movesets customization etc
bigger just have more content in the base game alone then theres a whole gamesized expansion to experience on top of that 
better designed this is a bit subjective but i feel like the way monsters look and move is way better in monster hunter

i think monster hunter has a chokehold on the genre and it definitely needs competition but this is not it

#####

excellent game overshadowed by its poor performance issues

#####

it sucks to write a negative review on wild hearts its fantastic when it works but my god multiplayer 9 times out of 10 is poor due to connection sound bugs out frequently graphics pop in and out and the framerate tanks all the time games in this time should not be releasing in this state and its shocking for devs to be slapping this price tag on wild hearts theres no way this has been play tested and given it the thumbs up promising our game will be good in the next month when we patch it isnt good enough

edit even after 2 months and several updates later the game still looks like it came straight from the ps3 era and runs like absolute garbage it is sad to see they cant manage to fix this game

#####

performance isnt worth 70 

i refunded

#####

r7 5800h rtx 3060 and powerpoint has more frames than this game

#####

not a nextgen toukiden but there is a bbath houseb scratches that toukiden itch and you can see some of its dna in this specifically with the monsters kemono and karakuri being the new meta game instead of collecting the souls of historic japanese figures but the bbath houseb is back baby

bbath house timeb

nice spin on the mh genre with the building elements being quite fun
once you master them you can do some amazing things to torment your prey or your hunting party

bdid i mention the bath houseb

reducing this to a mh ripoff highlights an immature and patently asinine thought process  that is like saying every fps is a wolfenstein 3d 1992 rip off variety is the spice of life and different takes on gameplay mechanics allows the genre to grow and evolve

no seriously you unlock the bath house again

getting a solid 60 fps with frames uncapped mode in 4k using a 3090ryzen 7 3700 and 64mb of ram if you have a solid rig it will run fine though it is a shame it isnt optimized for lower to mid tier systems hopefully dlss inclusion later will allow more to enjoy this

bthere is a bath house i didnt make that clear enoughb

hoping that like most japanese mh titles god eater soul sacrifice monster hunter toukiden etc there are still hidden elements to unlock the more you progress if there is anything like the you think it is over but that was only the first major arc seen in titles like god eater or mh this will have some legs

now i just need a modern take on soul sacrifice 

band for it to include a bath houseb

#####

its truly a shame this game is published by ea the game was great the customization with weapons and the way the weapons work with the building mechanic 
its like a monster hunter game the story isnt much but its there its the hunting with people that makes it fun
theres no more updates dont bother buying this even if its on sale

#####

if only i got 1 fps for every dollar that was spent

#####

runs terribly the whole time through the game stuttering on low graphics settings with i9 and 3080 that being said the ideas shown through the weapons and weapon tree is awesome loved shooting lasers at giant animals

#####

so
first time i saw trailer for wild hearts i was mehhh
but now ive played it an i very like the game combat is fun and the building give litte bit more diversity from other mh games
but the fps manfps are all over the game 12700k with 3070ti 1440p 32gb 3600ram and nvme drive im ranging from 8020 fps the drops specialy in combat are terrible no dlss or fsr on launch for 70 bucks some graphics effect like snow are a joke in my opinion they release the game way to soon im playing on ea trail thingy and as much i would love to buy this i think i wait til patch  discount

#####

price higher than my fps on low

with a i7 and 2070super

#####

it really is a shame that wild hearts not only launched in a near unplayable state but continues to be one of the worst optimised games ive ever seen in my life the shame comes from the fact that had this game run well it would actually excellent monster hunter as a series is one thats no stranger to clones including from the developers of this game no less but this is the first game ive ever seen in this genre to actually compete with monster hunter as an experience and not just be a shallow boss rush game thats cashing in on that behemoths success
to keep things simple wild hearts is like a twist on monster hunter rise though its simultaneously more streamlined and has additional features for example youll note that unlike in monster hunter you dont have any items except for your healing flask however whereas in rise you had the wirebug wild hearts gives you the karakuri which lets you instantaneously build all manner of structures from a singular resource be it a wall a dodge spring handheld helicopters and some more stuff whats impressive is that for the longest time i didnt actually realise that my only consumable resources were the healing flasks and karakuri threads  the latter of which is used for pretty much everything
like monster hunter and unlike all the other clones of the series wild hearts actually does put exploration pretty front and center in spite of this but in a different way where monster hunter has you looking around for items and traps to help you more efficiently hunt and grind wild hearts instead lets you use its levels as a sandbox to build the traps and conveniences to get around yourself these constructs are actually permanent across play sessions though they can be destroyed by the monsters in combat and its really cool and impressive to come across something hours later that you had forgot you put there down the line it makes the setting feel like a real place instead of just a stage to get through
the actual fighting mechanics during combat is also excellent feeling a lot like monster hunter worlds combat more than rises which gives it a feeling of weight and heavy hitting and some cleverly thought up combos to dish out most every weapon is just as satisfying to use as in the monster hunter series and despite being limited to one weapon at a time unlike some of the other clones it doesnt really get to feel monotonous because of how the mechanics all interact together
the story is actually pretty good too not mindblowing but engaging and interesting with good pacing and some fun characters and dialogue the stakes actually feel pretty real and grounded in spite of the inclusion of things such as ancient magics admittedly i havent finished the game yet but this is yet another thing that i think it has going for it that can compete with monster hunter it knows how to slowly ease you in to the mechanics with slick presentation and engaging exposition rather than just infodump everything in long threads of hub npc dialogue

recently i got a new 4070 rtx computer and as of the patches and updates its running smoothly for me however anything below that seems to be unplayable for a lot of people or at least has been in the past the visuals certainly dont justify that level of lacking optimization and i do wish it gets fixed soon

#####

this is just how it is community is still active on pc the game runs very rough around the edges granted i have a i77700 and a 1070 8gb vram plus my mother runs a i7 as well newer gen dont know which plus a 2060 card with 4gb vram that being said heres what i have experienced

1 gameplay is extremely fun and active  challenges you which is nice it doesnt spoon feed you like other games

2 the co op system with your friends is extremely well done the story progression so long as you are both on the same quest will progress you both together otherwise whoever is behind will have to host until you catch up to them that being said this game also has seemless co op meaning no kill a monster and back to camp unless it was a assist hop on

3 building i didnt think i would like it but it has been stupid fun and provides different ways to get to your point of interest that and some of the gadgets just wreck the monsters which helps a ton at times or staggers them

4 performance to be honest it runs like crap with the specs my mother and i have yes i know its not recommended specs but it works we play at 3040 fps on standard setting with particles shadows and a few other things on we do experience heavy frame stutters ever now and then but we have played worse for fps cough cough ark

5 combat weapons staring out there are 5 choices katana best bow great if the monster leaves you the hell alone maul aka hammer does heavy damage but again if monster leaves you along long enough great sword medium not bad or good seems balanced umbrella as a weapon that seemed like a gag if your a dex player its pretty damn solid all in all its nothing like mhs complex weapon systems people get confused as hell with or drools over its 1 weapon and it has a talent tree of sorts

6 armor if you played monster hunter its the same

7 movement omg the movement took me a bit to get used to as i was so used to mhws movement system and this one just takes all of what i wished mhw had for fast movement and quick retaliates and integrates it nicely traversing areas is fun as hell climbing walls is stupid as hell gadgets that launch you up allow a burst of hight  a fan to make you go higher ziplines its motorized so its up and down no matter how steep catapults and im assuming more

8 story  acting  rp blah blah blah short explanation there is a ton of it

9 pros and cons here is the big draws ill start with the bad and start with good from my experience 

cons you need to have the ea app to even play the damn game so if it has issues then your screwed its hard to get solid fps out of any graphics card unless your rolling a high vram 20 series card or at least 8gb 30 series card just to run everything maxed out and enjoy the visuals of the game 70 is not worth it wait for a sale

 pros solid gameplay all around fun as hell to co op with fun to play solo there is a little bit for everyone who loves games like mh and dauntless there is plenty of exploring to do and thinking outside of the box to figure out were you need to go at times the combat is very satisfying with pretty much any weapon

10 my over all rating id give it a 710 only because the devs have something good but just bad optimization for medium end hardware granted they are still working on it but still its something that should have been done out the door

#####

this game is great not sure why it has such bad reviews up to like the 10th mission or so and having a blast havent had any performance issues and only a few minor glitches its late cause ive been playing this nonstop so short review but you should buy it if you like monster hunter

#####

after finishing the game on pc
running a 3070ti and a 5800x

cant really recommend in its current state the game is playable at the bare minimum on lower resolutions and settings but a plethora of technical issues overall leave a whole hell of a lot to be desired
a shame the gameplay itself is actually pretty great as someone whos put well over 1000 hours into monster hunter its a fun alternative perhaps the best alternative so far
the weapons feel good the monsters are fuggin huge and threateningthe karakuri system works well its responsive mostly and its a pretty nice looking game at least i imagine it would be if i didnt have to run it at well below native resolution to get anything even remotely resembling a decent fps

needed more time for a game to release this poorly optimised is simply unacceptable sadly while this is already a trend for koei tecmo its starting to encompass pc gaming as a whole this games chances of succeeding have already been severely impacted because of it one can only hope it gets fixed quickly

i hope wo long doesnt run this terribly on release the demo actually ran pretty well

edit well after playing the game for another 7 hours this review is just reinforced further
after the game crashed to desktop once actually the only crash ive had surprisingly the game now utterly refuses to launch ive tried uninstalling both the game and ea app itself installing them to different locations on different drives ive even uninstalled the game and then deleted registry entries in an effort to erase even a trace of it before reinstalling still nothing hands down the worst launch experience ive had with a game in recent memory

edit 2 managed to fix my launch issues by deleting the system save data for the game even though id previously tried this to no avail it chose to work the 3rd time around

edit 3 the new 103 patch actually managed to make my performance worse fantastic
i was managing to play the game fairly smoothly capped to 30 but now i cant even manage that there is literally no combination of ingame settings that i can use to get smooth gameplay anymore

edit 4 finished the story endgame sucks

#####

has some performance issues like stuttering but it is a very solid monster hunter like game very smooth combat fun exploration fun quests and coopmultiplayer with some mechanics from zelda botw the building mechanic reminds a little of fortnites building but way more complex and with tons of possibilities a truly solid game ruined by ea games curse

#####

optimised 010
gameplay 610
new and refreshing take on monster hunting 910

#####

710

tldr
promising another monster hunter like with great ideas but does not developed and deliver well
monsters are 510

 weapon types are interesting
 monster are quite unique and interesting it does have a lot of variants and the real monster type is actually a lot smaller
 environment and scenery is interesting
 sound and music is good 

 camera can be enemy
 monster movements is not fun to play it feels like the monster movements and gameplay are not tested using all weapon types most monsters feels like just chaining movements with little to no opening specially for slow weapons it may also have huge input reading
 weapon crafting is one of the great ideas but the implementation left more than half of the weapons not viable and the mods are not very interesting
 most weapon and armor mods are not informative on what they do and not interesting
 end game grinding material is very random and and not fun to grind

 performance is not good i can run the game fine on mostly max 2560x1080 60fps but i can run other game better and more stable with less resource
 bad upscaling and upscaling setting
 expensive specially looking at the graphic and issues
 there is audio issue

#####

good besides having less frames that bloodborne on the ps4

#####

the performance has been improved but still not super smooth i think its pretty fun overall its a solid replacement to fill in the monster hunter gap since rises endgame farm is kinda boring

old review literally unplayable like actually it was running at 5 fps and i have a decent computer


#####

i thought i could try the game for 10hrs but they only let you play till the gates of minato which takes about 34 hours of playtime to continue you have to preorder or have ea pro really ea selfish much

so heres my 1st impression of the game i played like 3 hours vs 3 bosses 
 game is very similar to mhw but has less depth to it  combat is more player friendly can be pros or cons for certain people to me is a con because i dont like it easy 
 the game world feels less open and more on rails
 the monsters in mhw have more personality 
i was expecting better graphics than mhr but i got the opposite instead the textures in the game are very low
 game is unoptimized even with my 3080 i was only able to run at 50 60 fps at 1440p and not even at the highest settings pathetic no dlss support nothing
 the game is unpolished 
max party members are 3 players 
 there are no capturing monsters only killing 
 the building during combat is fun but there isnt much to it you will just keep spamming the same wall when the monster is charging and there isnt any item to use maybe because i still havent progressed far enough im not sure i only have health potions which is super easy to replenish even while fighting the monsters there are refills everywhere 

it makes sense people have an interest in a new experience like wild heart once they got bored of mh however this game is not worth the full price the only reason to buy this at day 1 is because of crossplay you can play with your pc and console friends the game is fun if you like monster hunter style of game but i do not recommend this game at its current state and price point as expected from eashit jedi survivor better be good

#####

while its not a perfect game i really like the new ideas they brought to the table compared to other monster hunting games and the creature designs are gorgeous

#####

edit the game now constantly crash because of memory leak despite i have 16gb ram and been playing fine for the last 60 hours

so i want to talk about the good part of it first
 unique weapon and armor upgrade mechanics human path kemono path and their unique skills my change how you upgrading you weapon and armor weapon tree no its whole fcking weapon web since you can go far through so many nodes can collect useful skills just to upgrade 1 weapon and there are mid tier weapons can be upgraded further to competitive with endgame weapons if you like their inherent skills or rng roll the 2 inherent skills on them but only 5080 as effective as highest native on others  this make some good replayability and reasons to revisit lower tier kemono and help newbies
 elemental and elemental resist system very straight forward unlike monster hunter kemono take full elemental damage but theres only one endgame monster that worth crafting entire elemental for it the rest arent very much improvement consider the huge weapon tree to upgrade 1 weapon
 weapons are unique have depths to them and feel very good to try theyre not like 10 hours to practice and learn one weapon mechanics like mh tho once you get the hang of it there are certain effective combos with katakuri you can spam only it completely lack the guardtank type weapon
 overall combat will be great if you okay with very fastpaced monster hunting game but feel like niohdark souls with brutal bosses and iframe there are a lot of epic moments in combat  like mmo devil may cry level of visual flashiness combining with noticeably huge damage numbers everytime you upgrade too the iframe and the katakuri is an essential part of it so if you dont like spam katakuri in your combo or learn iframe youll be messed up in later fights
 difficulty wise despite the generous iframe and the ability to spam katakri to interupt monsters or cancel your own animations the game will get hard with certain kemonos in your progression that youll have to learn and adapt very fast combos with katakuri system and learn iframe through most of their attacks endgame bosses are very fast and brutal
 you can shape the lands with your own camps and fast travel methods making it your hunting ground etc  this is the open world aspect that monster hunter world lacked
 music are crazy good
 overall artstyle and the scenery looking good

this is both good and bad the qol and more streamlined straightforward into action design help people easier to get into the game into the action without thousands of mechanics to learn and tedious preparation  but it also shorten the game and make it lacking nuances and charm compare to monster hunter

although i wanted to leave a positive review as the gameplay is good the game is fun and refreshing for mh genre but the bad is way too much to consider
 graphical environment is very unpolished at first glance the game looked good but instead of a consistent visualartstyle it chose to be something look like from ps23 era that got new makeup to look like modern game characters constructions trees flora looked good most kemono look decent water snow ice grounds boulders some textures many environment details and effects from many monsters abilities looked terrible like they dont belong to this dimension lightingshadows sometimes flickerflashes a lot of popin issues  sometimes it looked like sunny in front of you move 1cm and it changed to shadow 
 more to visual is every kemono has those epic moments that they even change environment around them with their attacks but only few feel like its smooth and integrated into environment a lot of other kemonos they looked so janky especially the way those effects fade out immediately took me out of immersion like the golden shard kemono it look like something from 2014 mmo boss aoe attack
 crashes crashes from the very first moment i bought the game and go back to title menu even got break point something error then nothing showed the game just disappeared in the next launches luckily it was able to launch in the next pc restart couldnt understand why and there still occasional crashes but its more manageable beware with bugs crashes and my friend even got save file corrupted without anyway to recover it although theres a hidden ea save cloud
 unoptimized performance despite it got way better than when first released it was unplayable bad with my rtx3060 dropped down to 20fps on medium when i tried the game on 2nd month after release now it way better but still drop fps everywhere hardly get stable framerates i even wanted to lock it at 4045 for that stability but somehow 50fps the framepacing feel like 30fps while 50fps it pretty smooth all that next gen performance mess while looking way below something like horizon zero dawn
 story ending was a let down theres an important character got killed offscreen and many other details  feel like the game got rushed and there should be more the story boss fight too although it looked very epic but too easy not on par with the level of epicness and the true last boss was totally 100 let down i dont feel rewarded dont feel accomplished something when i end the story and there are some weird use of japanese words in english subtitles albeit there are some words add a flavor to the culture like arigato but there are some words that felt like some thing pretty damn important and i couldnt understand wtf is that what relation with what were talking about without understand japanese
 i wish there was more kemono to fight more equipments and such  minor complains limited fashion options and somehow the male character cant have fully naked top they share the same underwear as female character and it looked weird with some gears showing your chest
 bad endgame endgame monsters reuse of the same monsters reskin mostly with some crazier moves and bigger hpdmg  although the playtime worth the money for a typical aaa game not really a big deal for the first game of the franchise if they want to continue as a franchise even mh have a lot of iffy with their endgame grind the grind for cosmetic armors is insane like you have to kill story boss at least 65 times to make its armor set cosmetics not to mention human path and kemono path varian looks
 updates and supports seem abandoned koei techmo is notoriously bad with their pc ports and lets not talk about ea as the publisher seem they dont see profit in updating the game anymore compare to monster hunter keep getting new contents qol bug fixes and support for at least a year after launch every game and every expansion
 there are some other minor things like janky animation and some clunky parts of combat hit boxes animation cancel to spam moves etc bad ragdoll like you got hit in one side then you fly off to other side of the map some monsters movement doesnt make sense at all that theyll hit you in the most annoying way overuse of aoe and near oneshot aoe  especially like endgame bosses they keep spamming with insane tracking that like dark soulsernioh but every hit is aoe you need to iframe through or spam katakuri it doesnt feel good as you can barely fit a combo unless they stop theres hardly such thing as calculated combo to hit them between attacks like mh for big attacks you have no hyper armor whatsoever immediately lost all the weight from the unleashing huge attack just by small flinch but these are fine for the first game of a series

#####

the performance is trash i can not recommend this and i suggest people do not buy this and this game needs to go unsupported by the fans

#####

best summary of the game from most players   wasted potential 

enjoyed most of my time but coming back after a few months of patches 
the game still runs like crap most iframes got deleted karakuri building is too hard to memorize again end game is just the equivalent of mhr anomalies but worse just impossible to kick back and enjoy the game after a break
all of this thanks to money hungry publisher and out of touch overworked devs
also  my friend lost her savefile due to the game not saving properly in case of crashes  this 

#####

cpu amd ryzen 9 5900x
rx 6700 xt
ram 32 gb

got 2030 fps most of the time
got 4060 fps on open field with not many objects
plus slowmotion gameplay as bonus
the game is unplayable for me i just wasted 70

#####

game runs like absolute shite everything about it feels fun and i really love the combat but its really hard to recommend a game that has serious hiccups and single digit fps drops i can play cyberpunk 2077 on max settings with medium raytracing just fine  but somehow this game cant even perform well on the lowest settings its absolutely absurd how a game can be this demanding while looking pretty average at least its not the xbox series s version that one made me physically sick playing it but this one isnt really any better would be nice if it could cache shaders at the start of the game but somehow it only does it during gameplay

#####

if you enjoy any iteration of monster hunter you will find this game quite fun while the weapons at first glace are an order of magnitude simpler than any option in monster hunter the katakuri building mechanic and how said constructs interact with the weapons and monsters fills a lot of that complexity while also permitting you to personalize youre hunting style and tolls to youre preference i believe a review i found on youtube said it best this is an expansion on the monsterhunter genre pioneered by monster hunter 
over all i would strongly recommend this game doubly so for monster hunter fans

#####

nvidia geforce rtx 3080
intel core i911900kf
32gb ram

still cant play

#####

runs like the monty python black knight

#####

performance has gone down since denuvo was added dont buy unless they remove denuvo

#####

its an actual good contender to monster hunter finally this game has a lot of potential if they keep adding on to  it
the weapon system is super in depth and has a ridiculous amount of options to build it how you want

#####

i am writing this review on 2023 may 19

i am really sad how messy state this game is in if it would play smoothly and look like the trailers it would be an amazing game the naturetheme the combat and the world is really enjoyable the music is simply divine but the immersion is corrupted by constant stutters blurry visuals and messy looking textures on standard settings i tried to lower some settings but the game just looks more bad but the performance never improves significantly

i will update this review if the game becomes better but right now it is really a struggle to play

#####

as others have said the game performs terribly and the price is just unacceptable for a game in this state

#####

zero optimization

#####

the game itself may not be that bad its just that the optimisation is not quite there
good luck getting above a stable 30fps if you do decide to get this game even on high end pcs

#####

very fun game but it performs pretty poorly

#####

single digit fps with a 3070 on low settings

#####

monster hunter world  breath of the wild

very fun but the tutorials are ｍｕｎｔｅｄ

#####

 important 
enable dlss  to double your fps

i5 13600kf
rtx3060ti
16gb 3600mhz ram

performance is beyond ridicoulos  thats what i heard before playing and experienced when i started the game
tutorial 55 fps drops to 40
open world 45 fps drops to 30
unplayable for me since i normally play everything at least in medium settings on 2k on a widescreen monitor tried to change the graphic settings  5 fps difference between max 2k and lowest 1080p

then i enabled dlss and whoops max settings 2k resolution widescreen 65 fps min average 7075
this looks way better than before with almost no quality loss

game looks fun so far currently playing the 10h trial will update my review in time


#####

no beating around the bush right now the performance issues are about as bad as everyone says there have been successful workarounds like changing audio to 7151 sound no longer helps after feb 21st patch that helped frame rates tremendously as well as other speculative fake fixes that youd barely notice a difference from biggest frame rate increase i saw was from starting up the game and then using task manager to force close the ea thin client entirely this disables eas cloud saves and was a roughly 50 increase in frames for me

im a fan of the monster hunter series so this game appealed to me greatly however while i was a fan some of my friends were not as big a fan of monster hunter

wild hearts is a whole other story the design around using your karakuri contraptions to assist with mobility and combat and crowd control while working in monster hunter style gameplay and gear progression works incredibly well this is a game that deserves a second chance when the performance fixes hit down the road and definitely deserves your attention the day our fixes come and we all get a a solid performances delivered this will change to a positive recommendation

i didnt care much for the story and ended up skipping a few sections of it but i didnt play this game for story i came to hunt monsters 

kemono as the monsters are called are not wholely original concepts but i do like the designs they landed on animals infused with nature and bursting at the seams with the energy that fuels your own contraptions 

while omega force has made a few monster hunter themed games in the past see toukiden 1 and 2 this is their first big pitch into the same theme as monster hunter id say i can only hope this spurs capcom into more innovation for their own series rather than stagnating it with boring borderline mandatory usage features like the wirebug

in terms of the game great job omega force this is a fantastic outing just fix all the performance issues quickly please

#####

bcant recommend this game right nowb to anyone and at this price tag that is ridiculous for a game like this

mind you i can definitely see some potential in this game but unfortunately the bad performance unables you from experiencing it

the almost 30 hours i have ingame right row is me btrying to play the gameb because since bday 1b ive been playing in slow motion mode and just took down lavaback its really painful and i havent seen a game perform so bad like this in a while
devs knew about performance issues on launch day but decided to take action only a week after and the 1st patch version 103 did absolutely nothings to the majority of the player basse

bwill change the review if things change and an actual patch fixes these horrible issuesb

#####

tldr 
1  it forces you to install origin while racking up play time
2  game runs like dookie
3  big attacks that make no sense with huge hitboxes that make less sense
4  environments are too small for the monsters melee is annoying ranged it ok 

its not worth the price right now btier game for an stier price go buy monster hunter or toukiden instead

unless the game is on lowest settings it just runs at 20  30 fps and if its in a fight it runs at 5  10

at lowest settings i can consistently get about 30 in a fight and 60 when out in the world most of the time

the hitboxes are really weird arenas feel crazy small for how big the monsters and their attacks are being on the opposite side of the arena from a monster does not feel far enough being in melee is a chore since you cant really see what theyre doing when your camera is absorbed by their left calf

cluttered environment means you cant see anything when you get knocked around the camera is not your friend here and has frequently gotten shoved into the decorations of a scene and then i get slapped for not reacting to something  i couldnt see

i was worried when i saw such bad reviews on the game so i tried to run it myself and i spent a whole hour trying to get origin to work which i didnt realize was racking up playtime so now that ive only played it for about an hour i cant refund it so im stuck with 70 of a game that is pretty mid to be honest

monster designs are a miss for me theyre very overthetop fantasy in that very ea american kaiju sort of way its really visually cluttered monsters mostly attack by spinning their whole body instead of swinging their tail or head i think every monster ive fought which is only 3 has had a move that spun their entire body the monsters just dont feel like monsters they feel like an object that some kid is playing with smacking all the other players around with his big toy and saying its an attack

melee is seriously lackluster for me in the beginning of the game every attack locks you into an extremely long animation more so than monster hunter theres some really cool ideas that i think are fantastic even compared to monster hunter but honestly the kemono dont let you play with the weapon you just work around their nonsense and aim for a big power move then rinse repeat its made worse by the above mentioned hitboxes making it really hard to deal with especially when every monster covers half the arena in particles and knock you on your ass for 3 minutes at a time

i think this may be an issue i have because im coming from a long history of monster hunter gameplay but this feels incredibly bootleg  btier game i think id be far less bothered if it wasnt for the ea origin forced install the hour long setup of origin because i had to recover my account while it was clocking game time the 70 dollar price tag and the lacking performance of the game itself

all of these things together make the game really rough and totally not worth the money i was hype only because i saw a few youtubers play and they made it look like a lot of fun

it is fun if you can look past all the garbage in the way of that fun i can and i will but manthis is not a game id recommend as it is spend your money on sunbreak or mhw until this gets patched

or better yet if you want a similar game thats made by the same people but way more polished go buy toukiden 2

#####

absolutely stunning game incredible world oozing with style let down by major performance issues 3080ti and lost my save twice due to some cloud save error after two crashes 

i think if they can patch this up further id change this to a recommend as this is a really solid contender in the monster hunter genre that seems to have been made with a lot of love and care a real shame

#####

id love to recommend this game but as of 103 optimization is bad bugs are plentiful and performance is inconsistent throughout different pcs so if you were to buy this your performance experience may vary

wild hearts is an amazing game within the monster hunter genre fights are tough combat is simple at first but has so many hidden combos and mechanics when you incorporate the building aspect karakuri within the game 

the death stranding mechanic where dragoncomplex karakuri persist in your world lets you optimize the way you move and farm

koei did replayability so well the total monster count is fewer than capcoms monster hunter but each chapter introduces and changes existing moves while introducing new monsters to fight

i came in expecting it to be another monster hunter clone but wild hearts has certainly bring new things to the table and if ea choose to support and develop this it can rival the giant which is capcoms monster hunter


#####

editing my review from launch after steam wouldnt refund me after 3 hours of play time i decided to just play the game all the way through i can say after playing through until the credits rolled i regret paying full price for this game after the couple of patches the game still gets frame drops and stuttering quite a bit for me and im running on medium settings i didnt think a game with ps2 textures would be so hard on my pc i had to lock my framerate at 60 to keep the audio from glitching out too the main gameplay the hunting monsters part is pretty fun the monsters have really cool designs and all feel like they really have their own styles and the weapons are all fun and unique too the building mechanic adds some cool stuff to it and makes combat feel a bit more open to different strategies i feel like there wasnt that big a variety of monsters though after playing through it all i felt like i was just fighting the same 5 monsters over and over maybe with a different variant of the same monster the armor and weapons were the same for me when i was hoping for cool new stuff most of it was just the same stuff with a re color or a slightly altered shape maybe monster hunter spoiled me throughout the years but it just felt really lacking after fighting one of the main bosses a new monster that i havnt seen yet after a really hard fight excited to see what i unlocked yet another reskin samurai armor and the same weapon but another color the monster and human armor paths too werent even full sets but i can kind of see why they might have done that the fights were fun but the monsters would constantly glitch into weird map hitboxes and stutter back and forth like crazy sometimes the one main large boss would jitter back and forth like he was breakdancing and it made it impossible to hit his weak spots then the scripted event that shot a zipline to him didnt even connect the line and it flung me into the ocean all of the little things on top of frame drops and weird hitboxes made it really frustrating sometimes

overall the game had a good core but i feel like it was executed poorly which makes me really sad because i wanted to like it but it just kept feeling like it fell short i wish i could see this game done right it just feels like a weird indie game knockoff of monster hunter with a japanese aesthetic and that sucks because at 90 canadian the game is so lacking compared to its competitor which has a full dlc and way more content that actually looks and runs great and its basically half of the price with all of that 

if youre really desperate for a hunting game then knock yourself out but i cant justify the price for the janky mess of a game

#####

the game is good but it isnt a smooth frame rate its like its constantly loading in the next place youre going or simulating the entire map its just bad your cpu will not be happy its not worth 70 right now if they want aaa fullpolished price then the game needs to perform like its out of alpha

#####

the game runs perfectly fine for me with no lagsryzen 5
 5600 3060 rtx 
you can pet all the little creatures and seeing then being happy
and of course you can make your hunter look ripped and thick and that makes me happy

#####

runs like sht

update the game is super fun specially if you are a monster hunter fan but still runs like sht

#####

i cant recommend this game because it has been out for a couple of months and there is nothing from the developers nothing in terms of new conten fixes or anything else pretty much

#####

i love this game but sadly like everyone else is saying this game is plagued with performance issues

pros
combat is fresh and new
world is beautiful
music is nice
monsters are a fresh take
shop keeper is 100 waifu material would buy feet pics

cons
good luck playing with friends
single player mode still staggers and lags even on high end pcs
as of now lack of end game content
weapons are not balanced
lots of bugs some are actually funny
70 game but doesnt feel like it deserves it at least for now

until this game gets more patches i can not recommend this game

#####

unfortunately a waste of money fix the bugs and make smoother and will definitely come back

#####

i have a pc with recommended specs and the performance issues with wild hearts are so terrible that i cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone yet 

once denuvo is removed and a few more patches are out im sure itll be a great game as it stands right now however its nothing short of a complete stuttering disappointment 

my pc specs 
ryzen 5 3600
16 gb 3600mhz ram
rtx 2070 super

#####

its been a month and the game still doesnt run like it is supposed to
barely playable on anything that cant brute force through the bad optimization
playable if you use the games own resolution scaling which makes it look like a mid game from the ps2 era
a lot of players report that their gpus are under 25 utilization same here while their cpu is trying to fry itself
they fixed a heavy stuttering  freeze issue but the cpu bottlenecking is still a thing 
also their tactic for addressing the issues is to not address the issues
instead they keep on pretending the game is running fine and already dropped a content update which of course only enrages the players with problems further some people report that they said it would be fixed this month on discord 
but that is still bad communication and ends up being hearsay for the majority of players

this game could have been a good alternative to monster hunter i think that is out of the picture now
safe your money and your sanity

addendum 48 patch from 46 game crashes in main menu now the devs keep breaking their game and its a disgrace

#####

only technically playable on higher end rigs but is just a huge let down when you cant play with your friends because this game runs horrid this game really could have been a good change of pace from mh it is unique and fun in its own right but now its just a huge show of incompetency from a developer team that does not know how to utilize a graphics card seriously its 2023

#####

monster hunter meets jade empire with a dash of horizon and smothered in jank the frame pacing is awful considering the graphical quality the movement often feels clumsy missions are frequently recycled and i love it theres just something here thats got me hooked i was timing myself playing so i could refund if i needed to based on the negative reviews going in but i missed the alarm because i was so absorbed in a boss fight after a slow start the game really starts to open up and while camera issues and getting stunlocked are the cause of every death so far im some how not annoyed and just happy i get to replay those sections i really cant put my finger on it but its just charmed me

#####

issues review
i do not recommend this game until it is fixed after two patches the game still runs like garbage my pc specs are way above the recommended requirements and it constantly pushes my system to 100 cpu high settings and low settings run exactly the same

ive requested a refund and you should save yourself the hassle and not buy the product until everything is fixed

i was able to get a refund thanks to talking to a human steam customer support even though i exceeded the 2 hours limit i told them most my game time were in longer than normal load times and the game in a frozen state

it is a shame there was no demo otherwise we would have seen all these issues

i continue to try and read the patchupdate notes but there has been no communication about a foreseeable future if they are communicating about it they arent doing it publicly i read that they are saying it in their discord but steam has a way to provide us updates we shouldnt need to go into a discord and get more irritated by seeing the few people that can play the game talk about it in there

gameplay review
mechanics are amazing
customization are plentiful
could use more weapons
thats all i got since i couldnt play the game enough to enjoy or dislike the game

other review
game trying to force you to use the ea app i was able to force it onto origin i was able to bypass ea trying to force us off of origin by editing some files some quick google search can help you if you want to stay on origin and not use the ea app

i also dont think this game is worth 70 definitely a 60 game

#####

i think its a great game very fun for long stretches especially the early game my first monster hunting genre game but i realize this genre isnt really for me

as the grind became worse i lost interest more and more

i spent two days farming kemono to craft wind resistant armor so i could fight the golden tempest the armor made a difference i was surviving longer and doing better but i realized i was doing very little damage meaning id need to grind another day or two to complete the armor set and upgrade my weapon

the early game didnt require quite as much grinding maybe 13 of a certain type of kemono to get the materials required for a full set of armor by chapter 4 though it was taking 45 battles with two different kemono each to get the materials

by the time i fought the same kemono 45 times in a row i was bored

i like the game i like the combat i like the karakuri system but i dont like all of it enough to keep playing at the rate id been

i dont know if ill continue playing much or push through and finish the more hours i put into this the less i get out of it

but i think its me not the game this genre seems to involve a lot of grinding

performance was fine for me

#####

    i love this game the way it mixes up the monster hunter formula and gives me something new is great the mechanics the monster and the combat are all excellent however i can not play the game it became so frustratingly unplayable i altf4d during a hunt because the game was running so poorly i couldnt even track the kimono with my camera

    this is even after the early feb 21 patch i want to enjoy this game but it is still unplayable even with a 3070 ti and a 13600k even if the game could keep 30fps locked i would be able to push past the performance but as it stands now you should avoid this game

    i looked forward to the launch of the game but it appears it is impossible for most modern games to actually launch in a finished state as miyamoto said a delayed game is eventually good but a rushed game is forever bad

#####

the price is a bit steep but the game is actually fun does it have performance issues hell yeah almost like theres 0 optimisation but after lowering the resolution and a few setting i was getting a stable 60fps you shouldnt have to do this and i can see why everyone is upset but if you look past the bad frame rate there is actually a really decent game hiding underneath it after some patches bug fixes and performance improvements i would highly recommend for some good fun

#####

will set your gpu on fire wait for optimization patch if at all

#####

had high hopes sadly the game is so poorly optimized that it barely runs well on a high end system upscaling makes the game look unimaginably bad 210

#####

i simply wanted to say on how much fun the game is but unfortunately it seems like the game performance is horrible at this point i hope they are continuing to fix it my issue was that the frame rate remained constant at 60 over the first hour of play then moment after theyre about to drop and begin stuttering wildly

edit it appears that switching the audio option from stereo to 5171 fixes the games issues but that doesnt imply that the game is safe to play or in a playable state

update by pointing over my hours on records like i said the game itself is engaging it actually feels fresher than its counterpart monster hunter rise you might wanna give it a try on a console as it supports crossplay but if youre eager to play it on a pc you might certainly give it an attempt your choice still stands although the fan patch considerably enhances performance but dont expect a smooth gameplay like its 120fps or more

#####

this review will have spoilers

pros 
the combat is fluid and makes you feel extremely badass the katana turning into a chain whip the cannon shooting a giant laser and the claw blades letting you zip and slash around the monsters are all unique animeesque takes on traditional hunting genre weapons 
the karakuri are integrated well in the flow of the hunt they are situational and provide new strategies for you to use durings hunts
there is a lot of content there is a unique weapon tree system with inherited skills that allows crazy builds there is a whole cooking and passive resource generation as well as allowing you to capture small creatures and put them in cages something that monster hunter rise is sorely missing the maps are imaginative and vast enough to hide secrets that will take hours for you to find everything the devs have hidden
the monster designs are varied and unique the concepts of elements and real life creatures really separates itself from monster hunters wyvern designs and other hunting games fantasticalmythical designs

depends on you
armor upgrades are limited with slight variations with hunter and kemono deviants there is no upgrading system like in monster hunter so the game kinda balances around that however by the end of the game you can only take around 23 hits before needing to heal this means you need to constantly heal after taking a single hit this makes the combat flow feel more like dark souls especially in arena fights where you cant refill you healing water 
weapon designs are underwhelming with most of them being recolors of several models at least for claw blades armor designs can be cool if you like the eastern influence but a lot of them are bulky and over designed while not really being based around the monster parts needed to craft them 
i dont really care for the overall story the characters themselves are great but the game doesnt really build up the dynamic of the village very well you basically save two of the villagers at the beginning of the game and then there is a montage of you helping out the village and then the story tells you to defend the village for the rest of the game your motivation is also i dont like war i want to kill stronger enemies pretty standard for a hunting game though but i think other hunting games do it better 

cons
of course there is optimization personally i had no issues playing the game before the patch however after mondays patch my frames have dropped down to 1520 compared to the 4560 i was getting before as well as experiencing slow downs in fights now this also causes your fusion karakuri to be hard to summon smoothly since the placement will glitch out with some floating in midair or clipping into each other
endgame grind is only for cosmetics and the volatiledeeply volatile monsters dont provide new gear expect talismans essentially decocharm grinding in monster hunter if they had provided parts to upgrade your weapons and armor there would be more of an incentive to grind it out but if you want to make a meta build you can basically do that before the final boss 
balancing between weapons is really bad claw blades are op giving you godly iframes while your gauge never falls the staff gauge falls really fast making it essentially impossible for you to charge it fully in the endgame since those monsters just like to fly and jump around constantly 
final boss is annoying since it likes to fly around playing into the weapon issues above and the hitboxes are really bad you would think that you can hit the tail but the end of the tail has no hit box same with parts of the body 
many many bugs i joined a multiplayer session to fight the tiger and when i returned home i lost progress with the game saying i never killed the peacock when i already did several times joining multiplayer hunts sometimes just bug out and the monster will just stand still without taking any damage slow down in multiplayer is also really bad
randoms can place karakuri in your world and they dont disappear this means that your world will be a mess that takes forever to clean up there should be an option to destroy all basic karakuri on the map to make cleanup easier especially since a lot of them will lag out the game

it is a fun game and i enjoyed it until the end we need more hunting genre games like this but until the devs fix the optimization and balance issues as well as give some incentive to keep playing after the story hopefully with the already announced free updates i cant recommend anyone spend 70 on this game i heard the game runs fine on ps5 so get it on that if youre a big monster hunter fan

h1 do not buy this game now especially full price h1

i have 10 years experience with monster hunter so i believe i have a grasp on the type of game here however this does not change much considering the fact that this game is unplayable
it legit keeps crashing took me over 50mins to finally get the game to get to the title screen
config   2080 r7 3700x 32gb 3600mhz

i can barely hit 60fps on lowest settings and i have many freezes and frame drops this morning i couldnt play for more than 5min at a time it keept crashing
on that basis alone this game should not be bought but for 60 quid no way

ubit on gameplay now  u
bbig prosb
list
building is crazy fun intuitive and reactive
exploring is really fun and environments are nice especially once you get some different karakuri to get around
weapons feel nice and combos are flashy umbrella is amazing
theory crafting looks inspiring and food prep is fun and is worth your while
list

bmajor consb
list
the 1st 5 monsters i fought were fing terrible the ones the game story leads you to fight 
their design all blends them together i feel and they have highly unreadable attacks leading me to dodgeparry when i feel its time and not because i can see im getting attacked or i can see im in danger this leads to frustrating gameplay of giving up early on combos or over committing when you think the monster is performing an idle animation or recovery one when in fact its an attack or vise versa
story is hot garbage i mean i play mh im used to a stupid excuse to perform the core gameplay loop but man all the characters are the same soppy generic npcs burdened by the monsters around them and with the constant crashes and gameplay drops and 30fps cut scenes you just wanna get moving so them chatting shit makes you even more frustrated honestly with a couple of lines here and there you get the big picture and you can safely skip and its really not inspiring
level geometry is horrendous the kemono love to push you onto tree stumps up walls into rocks etc because instead of moving you aside when they hit you they drag you along with them so if you want to use the build in tools to dodge like the karakuri you cant use them in mid air when you are levitating because the monster pushed you all the way up a wall and you clipped into some weird part of the wall geometry making it frustrating once again
the bloody camera is just trash it loves to move on its own with level geometry you get pushed into sooooo you get quickly confused as to where you are  the fov is terrible especially for the bigger kemono ie king tusk and you cannot see their attack animations when you are in melee striking distance making it even more unreadable the see through mode when the camera is behind walls is very meh and it leaves some things like vines there so sometimes you cant see anyway also  if youre gonna step up to capcom at least take a few pages from there book dont use a goddamn lock on camera sure leave the option but you also have a version where you can tap a button to centre the camera on a targeted monster because placement and environment awareness is key in these kinda games especially with the shit fov there is just free cam but its nice to be able to center onto the monster when you lose track of it in the confusion of the game also this maybe wouldnt of been good as the monster move faster than the camera can when targeted on them
 lastly it runs like a toddler swims in a shallow pool  barely and without support soon its gonna drown and die
list

tldr dont buy this game full price even when it gets fixed apparently coming this week dont trust itll fix much just play monster hunter if you like this kinda game if youre looking for something else other than monster hunter then play the older mh games or try something else entirely

#####

much worse monster hunter with 0 optimalistaion it shouldnt be released in this state

310

#####

fun with an extreme caveat the game itself would be a great monster hunter competitor if it didnt run like complete dog shit

#####

im impressed with this game as someone whos played monster hunter likegames a lot on consoles id say its the closest one to scratching that itch id say it executed some ideas better than monster hunter in some areas such as gathering and difficulty progression a lot of the weapons feel barebones however and having no invincibility frames when reeling from an attack lead to very cheap garbage moments 
its a shame what happened at launch and even currently for some has soured the perception people have for this game i could see a sequel further polishing the performance and adding more kemono so i hope the devs dont give up if it ever becomes a reasonable price on sale 70 is insane you should give it a try if you like mh


#####

edit its already in sale look at this kekw

first of all my specs rx 6950 xt i9 10900k 32gb ram nvme
so before anyone cries about it my specs are far above the recommended ones
and i run hogwarts legacy almost everything on ultra with constant 100 fps on 1440p

what a shitshow of a release

first i couldnt play the trial the first 2 days with ea play simply didnt start the game
then i found a workaround on reddit i could play it horrible stutter frame drops and it
didnt recognize mit controller simple xb1 controller

and now they said they are gonna patch it next week i paid 70 i wanna play it now
you dont pay for a whole cake and only get half of it delivered i think we shouldnt allow the devspublishers
to toy with us this way a digital product is still a product and as a customer you have the right to get the quality
you paid for they had plenty of time beforehand i am not responsible for qa  its their job

i dont know what to say anymore i was so goddman hyped for this release and the reveal of this clown circus
tore it apart for mepiece by piece

my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

rant is over

#####

aaaand its broken again
fuck this company and its backwards priorities


#####

has it strengths dont recommend at full price but discount price is worth it please reduce the amount of reskin monsters if you make a second game i shouldnt be coming across reskins  variants of the same monster 15 hours into the game

in a market where most triple a titles are massive disappoints whether if it terrible drm botchedrushed dev cycles gacha walls or being online only i usually just accept the disappointment and move on however i find myself coming back to wild hearts because the game is fun in a lot of ways wild hearts was able to accomplish something that monster hunter hasnt done in several games offering a challenge the monster designs are cool and the bladed wagasa is a counter based weapon ive been dying for in a monster hunter game im a sweaty guard lance main for well over a decade the bones of this game is amazing but the optimization is not 

a problem that is shared with modern monster hunter titles and wild hearts is the urge to make the games look as good as possible in lieu of optimization this might be subjective but games of this nature dont really need an open world wild hearts does manage to make the environment very interactive you can climb walls fly farm or encounter roaming monsters 

i still believe that having zones that partially load as you travel throughto them would work better if the focus was making the game look nicer a game that requires percise timing audio ques and 4d movement should be stable

the storyline is whatever however in a game genre where the whole purpose is to hunt boss monsters exclusively i feel like hammering in a very mediocre story and forcing the player to sit through generic and skipless dialoguecutscenes is just padding to make up for a botched development cycle im talking about you monster hunter world

would i recommend this game yes but to only two groups of people console players as the game is much more stable on console and monster hunter fans who have been very disappointed in the direction the monhun franchise is going in even then i would still suggest to catch this game on sale 70 is a lot to ask for

what a shame game releases with extremely poor performance issues devs patch coming next week to fix
next week patch drops and does absolutely nothing performance is still extremely bad 
this game is trash asf do not buy

#####

this game is fun like rlly fun 
but it doesnt work price is way too high no optimisation ea games as it is it looks like the history repeats itself and ea doesnt learn even a tiny bit 
this game is unfinished probably forced release from publisher a lot of bugs 20 fps giant price terrible visual settings 
literally prebeta state dont buy it now but keep the game in mind since if they fix all technical issues  it would be game with a lot of fun like a lot a lot

#####

excellent game marred by subpar performances

its basically a monster hunter game with its own ideas and mechanics 

this game introduces the karakuri small buildings that can be combined and used to setup combos and dodgeprotect from attacks its implemented very well and it adds a lot to the combat making it quite fluid and dynamic while adding a layer of depth to how you engage with monsters

also semipermanent karakuri can be constructed across the map which can be used to traverse the zones really quickly it is quite fun to setup all these buildings to reach the monsters as quickly as possible as you can place these buildings wherever you want

in general the game is wellmade the weapons are unique and feels good to play with the monsters have good animations and movesets with the lategame monsters going bonkers the maps are quite nice and the gameplay loop is addicting the monster variety is not as good as the latest monster hunter games but this is the first game so its understandable

unfortunately there is all kind of stuttering occurring while playing the game traversal stutter shader compilation stutter and random frametime spikes you get used to it eventually but its omnipresent and there is no escaping it some areas seem to be better than others with the first being the worst the game will not be updated anymore so the state of the performances will not change

all in all the game is super fun and in some regards i liked it more than monster hunter but it does not run very well on pc


#####

gameplay isnt nearly as good as mh games optimization is horrible and 70 is an absolute joke of a price for this game

#####

the game is amazing if it actually runs for you but riddled with frustration due to imprecision with the controls the karakuri not placing for any reason the food system the endgame loop and the multitude of oversights and minor issues in result this game is a beautiful cake filled with rat droppings that someone thought were raisins you can tell its a cake thats been made with love and care but all youre going to remember is the droppings and the missed opportunity this was the core gameplay is amazing when it works and wild hearts would easily be a 1010 but the aftertaste drops it to a hard 6 at best buy on sale if you can play it then stop before the deeply volatile thats when the raisins really get flavorful do this and you have a good chance of remembering this as a good game

eat ass

glad i tried the game using the 10 hour free trial still have 95 hours left and dont think i will be using any more of that time until its optimised better rtx 3060 i7 11800 16gb ram and still cant reach 50fps on low settings constant dips and stutters at 1080p it still looks like a blurry mess no matter what setting i use gameplay seems clunky so its a no from me

#####

the game itself is good

but theres performance suck totally ruined my experience and i will leave this negative review until they fixed this problem for all pc players even they release fix patch to resolve this but they look after to highend pc players instead the rest of lowmidrange pc player keep suck at this

i cant refund this and im just mad right now to write this review

for people in steam or pc players i dont recommend and cant defend how suck of this game totally disaster

i give it 90 for the best supporting to them and this is what they gave to me and im make sure this is not bomb review of monster hunter haters cause im not monster hunter fan

#####

pretty fun some performance issues but should be a lot better in a few patches

#####

h1 fun but unplayable h1

this game is incredibly fun ive been having an absolute blast with it when it works 

b however b the performance is abysmal im not a stickler for fps as i grew up on consoles and lowspec pcs but the game consistently hits sub30fps during multiplayer hunts today i experienced 11fps for the entirety of a hunt in the fourth area i was holding out for the performance patch and what they released did not solve a single problem it doesnt matter if i play at 720p on lowest settings or 1440p at the highest settings there is no difference in performance whatsoever im not even sure how that is possible

 b i cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone until they solve these issues and were i not in so deep i would likely consider requesting a refund b

#####

game is optimized like trash
stuttering
low fps
freezing in menus
save data corruption and loss due to game freezing and not autosaving

for a publisher who is pioneering the new 70 pricepoint to combat increased cost of development this is unacceptable who wouldve thought ea stands for early access

#####

wild hearts is a fantastic game that has kept me entertained for over 100 hours its been a long time since ive completed a game 100 and this title has definitely delivered on that front although it had some performance issues at launch with various bugs in the game the team is gradually fixing them

despite its performance shortcomings wild hearts is a great game with impressive graphics that make it a joy to play the gameplay is incredibly engaging and enjoyable with plenty of challenges to keep you coming back for more the controls are smooth and responsive making the gameplay experience all the more enjoyable

overall i would highly recommend wild hearts to anyone looking for a fun and engaging game to play while its not without its flaws the game is definitely worth the investment of time and effort i give it an 8 out of 10 and im eagerly looking forward to future updates to see what new features and improvements the team has in store

#####

poor optimization and way way to much bugs is why this is getting a thumbs down for me if things get fixed and ever is on sale i might revisit this one but well see

#####

god optimize your game and stop robbing us

#####

so i got this for like 40 on sale and at that price i think its a fine game

performance issues it runs and it runs smooth like 95 of the time thats 60fps 1440p with a 11700k and 3070ti it does stress the hell out of my cpu especially and id like to see the performance be better but its 100 playable for me

gameplay if you like the monster hunter gameplay loop then youll be at home here its got a story and its mostly voiced the story is ok nothing special but its not too bad though the random japanese words they toss in do make me feel like im talking to some high school anime club members

at 70 i cant recommend it
4050 if you love monster hunter give it a shot
2039 if you like action games its worth a try
sub 20 youll get your moneys worth as long as you seem even remotely interested

#####

i love this game wild hearts is basically mh mixed with studio ghibli vibes it really is beautiful well it would be if i could play it on any settings other than the lowest it can go i play mh world on maxed graphics but i cannot play wild hearts on its lowest without terrible lag which i am putting up with because this game is truly great i waited months for this game to get optimised and i dont think it ever was  

in this state i cannot recommend it hopefully they will fix it in the future but anyone with a lower than highest quality gaming desktop should stay away from this purchase for now

#####

lets see where to start take this as constructively as you can ea but this is a slap in the face to people trying to support you 

 ea desktop launcher we already have a launcher right steam lmao no thatd be a good experience heres a second launcher to really suck up available resources  you 
 no cloud save have a steam deck and a main rig  you 
 no actual upscaling solution like dlss or fsr the upscaling toggle they provide makes the game look like you smeared vaseline all over your monitor just in case youd forgotten to  yourself go ahead and do that now 
 performance is bad on medium settings with 32gb of ddr4 a 3080 and an 8700k i should be getting more than 4050fps definitely not 70 performance or 90 if youre a sucker like me  

the systems and gameplay here are a promising mh competitor but this is just unpolished

#####

gameplay  85
character customization  9
music  8
story  still early cant tell for now
performance  as bad as indonesian government 

i recommend this game if you like mh or toukiden like gameplay but for now the performance is so bad yikes
