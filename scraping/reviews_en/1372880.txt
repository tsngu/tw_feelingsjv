game is shutting down  do not buy

#####

the fact that steam is breaking their return policy for this game and giving people no question asked refund regardless of the time played really tells you the full story

#####

this is not a open world mmo this is a small area extraction shooter the devs deleted all the old videos showing the open world elements the city is dead and there are barley any open buildings there are no survival elements in the game because its based on being a extraction based shooter game like tarkov shame the game could have been the next day z i would not recommend buying this game most of the city isnt open anyways

#####

studio shut down 3 days after release omegalul

#####

the day before  buy
the day after  refund
1010

#####

this game is a scam edit studio has stopped development

 no openworld survival elements its just an extraction shooter and a bad one at that

 combat is terrible i went into a raid and fought a player it was laggy and completely unsatisfying the zombies are dumb as bricks stand on a car and you are invincible

 there is no reason to even progress in the game from what i can tell it lacks the hook that other games in the genre have like tarkov theres no satisfying differences with gun customization and every gun feels the same loot seems pretty easy to get too for instance i found two military guns within 5 mins 

 everything is slow looting is slow the intro is purposely slow it really feels like they try to make you waste as much time as possible so you dont hit the 2 hour refund 

 the game is bugged you can hide in objects with no hit box you can fall through the floor you can get softlocked and completely break your character very easily 

 frequent crashes also good luck getting into a server if you run into one of the many game breaking issues because you cant who could have predicted this

 finally  this game is not an mmo despite being advertised as such its completely misleading runs like ass looks like ass just dont buy it 

tldr game is dogshit avoid

edit the devsvolunteers are astroturfing the shit out of comments check out all the comments on reviews that are negative with private accountsbarely any hours played on games either that or theres a bunch of weirdos defending this game game is trash regardless

edit 2 to all the idiots defending the game  the studio has just shut down due to lack of funds the game is done do not buy

edit 3 i refunded the game straight after posting this review i thought it was supposed to show on the review but for some reason it hasnt dont worry i have been refunded for the game

#####

the day i got scammed

#####

turns out it is a real game

kind of wish it wasnt

#####

absolutely do not even consider buying this broken game

#####

 no vaulting cant get over small obstacles you have to jump over them
 no directional audio
 no melee
 cant climb ladders
 zombies tank 5 shots before they die
 barely any zombies in a zombie game
 they promised an open world massively multiplayer survival game we got an extraction looter shooter game
 you cant enter 90 of the buildings on the map

the performance is very bad and so are the servers this is to be expected on release though wait a year or two before you buy this unless they abandon it which they are known for from their previous titles i want this game to be good but its not unfortunately

#####

lmao  not an mmo not open world

lying about the genre is a bad start

its a bad tarkov with zombies

#####

valve needs to step in here and stop companies like this it is a scam nothing else valve remove publishers like this please

#####

dont buy and report the game for fraud

#####

the day before  buy
the day after  refund

im posting this here mostly to make it available in case it is deleted from steam

httpspastebincomzwc0qazw created by xxaustinjames

the company was not incorporated until oct 2021 the trademark was then filed for in jan 2022  this tracks timeline wise it should also be noted the some of these asset packs did not exist prior to oct 2022 which implies a much shorter development period below is an imgur its a bit messy but it follows the timeline of events roughly enjoy

#####

all positive reviews are bots by the devs

#####

best part of the game was the refund button

#####

no melee in a survival game

#####

dont dead
open inside

#####

soooooooo

i live in germany and i am baffeled how something like this release even can happen we have rules for the size of candy wrapping paper we can not decide for ourselves which kind of heating we gonna use we can not have tobacco advertising and i could go on forever with these examples

yet it is possible to be lied at by a company in a way that is basically almost on a crime level

i mean open world mmo
i mean 40 euros for an ea

and then you get an extraction shooter with a stamp sized map

i mean next time i advertise my fiat500 as lamborghini on ebay  i fake videos and pictures and i ask for 350000 euros  obiviously thats an okayish tactic these days

anyway  f you fnawhatever your company is called 


#####

this game is a scam and you cant convince me otherwise you cant advertise your game as a survival mmo and then its basically tarkov w a handful of infected sprinkled around the city

they used buzzwords they knew we would all like and then slapped this slop down hoping we wouldnt notice well it seems everyone did

the city and basically everything else as far as i can tell are all assets that were bought is that a bad thing no but when youre already claiming the game is something it clearly isnt i start to wonder how much work was actually done on this game

the streets are empty the loot is nonexistent the gunplay is basic the bugs are numerous i wouldnt even call this an alpha this game needs at least two more years and to actually be a survival game

you can say its not an extraction game all you want but when i load in get loot and leave at specified extraction points then guess what its an extraction game 

oh yea good luck changing your resolution without the game imploding and getting you stuck in a loop

#####

httpstwittercomfntastichq and httpswwwfntasticcom

game is less than a week old and already the developers have ended all future development despite being an early access game not even a month within early access release 

by definition of a scam this game was a scam with false advertisement of the game as an mmo to extraction shooter false trailers and gameplay footage of the game pre release 
 


#####

greatest scam in gaming history

#####

fastest round trip from add to cart to return to sender in history

#####

this was my take on the day before


before we start here are some key points throughout my experience

 game was in development for 5 years
 not open world small city with barely any buildings to explore
 not mmo total players i saw combined at safezone and outside maybe be close to 1015that was when i joined a high pop server
 jump button is useless
 zombies maybe 13 every 3 streets
 combat has poor handling and damage makes no sense
 building is in a completely different area within the game that doesnt tie to actual gameplay
 cant stop the eating drinking healing animations drinking animation is also delayed by about 5 seconds

here is the description of the game

the day before offers players a uniquely reimagined journey into postapocalyptic openworld mmo survival set in the present day on the us east coast following a deadly pandemic



so when i first loaded into the game i was hit with a character creation screen where i was able to customize my character to what i want not a lot of options for customization but there were enough to make a somewhat unique character then i am greeted with the option to join a server i go look into the servers majority is full which i expect the game just came out i find some servers that are high try to join them cant connect test your internet connection okay the internet is fine im in discord and im ethernetd in i can clearly see i have internet so i try the low pop servers same issue after about 10 minutes of trying not to slam my head into my desk i finally join a server i get greeted with the cutscene to which i spammed spacebar until it was over i head into the main area of the safezone and immediately knew this was not an openworld mmo just felt like i was in ghost recon wildlands safezone so i was like f well cmon maybe its not bad i did the whole tutorial in safezone then finally get ready with my gear and head out into the world to find some items for my  quest starting to feel a lot like tarkov here but hey still be open minded right i head out visuals are amazing character movement feels like a stiff version of gta 5 i run maybe 1 street over and see a zombie took a few shots at it felt like when i was shooting it the gunplay was way underrated and the zombies feel like the off brand walking dead game almost every building has no access i tried jumping over a barrier that was at my ankles and i just couldnt jump over it or vault or do anything so after that i run down the road a little more and i hear gunshots dont know where start taking damage so i get behind cover to heal and i see this player coming over to me in this still kneeling animation with his gun on the ground keep in mind im still healing cant cancel the animation btw and we proceed to get into a gunfight and of course as you can imagine i die

now you may be wondering well mrfloppybottomss died from a simple bug and now he rushed to the reviews

hold on not done yet  

keep in mind this game has been in development for 5 years

so im like well that sucks but lets get a new kit since i lost everything i buy a bolt action head back out to see if i can get what i need for the task i finally make my way to the area i need to be in lookin around for a bit see another player is here gets engaged in a gunfight and bolty aint as good as we imagined itd be takes same ammo as all the other 762 guns but for some reason it dont do the same damage so lost that fight no biggie spend the last of my coins on the starter gun again and head on out

i survived a lot longer this time actually killed a player and got most of what i needed for the quest i end up heading towards the extraction zone and run into a player also heading to the extract we engage in a firefight where multiple shots were entered into both players i mean we hit each other no kidding 15 times with the 762 ak i bled out and died 

this isnt a post of me saying the game is trash because i am trash this isnt a post of me getting in the game for 3 minutes and raging i put a solid hour and 20 minutes in to realize this game aint what it said it was gonna be

lets check some key points here

 game was in development for 5 years
 not open world small city with barely any buildings to explore
 not mmo total players i saw combined at safezone and outside maybe be close to 1015that was when i joined a high pop server
 jump button is useless
 zombies maybe 13 every 3 streets
 combat has poor handling and damage makes no sense
 building is in a completely different area within the game that doesnt tie to actual gameplay
 cant stop the eating drinking healing animations drinking animation is also delayed by about 5 seconds

overall the game was not what we all expected it to be i mean i had massive doubts and really wanted it to be good and i did my best to put enough time in to experience it but like this game is so hard to like its just a huge dissapointment to the community and i think all the reviews it has gotten so far show it i mean the game has only been out for a few hours and its at overwhelmingly negative reviews 7k like there are always going to be people that dont like games and give bad reviews but this is just insane i would seriously look at the reviews because it shows what the game actually is



#####

i wanted to give it a chance despite everything this companys past but once again i am very disappointed and they promised a massively multiplayer open world survival game and what we have received is an extraction looter shooter

all the problems that the game have

 goes less than 30 fps
 there are literally 3 zombies all over the map there are almost no enemies
 there is almost no loot weapons are easily obtained
 i have met about 10 players in almost 2 hours of playing
 no melee weapons
 it has no progression of absolutely anything
 you cannot jump over even a simple wall or small fence
 zombies cant climb on top of a car and if you move 1 pixel you can avoid their stupid blows
 you can fall under the map at any time
 sometimes your inventory disappears

they are charging you 3899 for a game that promised a lot and then tease us

i dont recommend it even if it takes 40 years to fix it this company disappoints as always and with 40 you can buy something better than what they advertise at the game awards

and this game has been in development for 45 years it looks like monkeys on vacation made it

aboud the day before discord and steam posts they erase absolutely everything that people dont want them to see for example i said that we would have to report the product to steam and they banned me from the server it is simply a horrible community which should not even exist

status refunded

official announcement that the company closes httpstwittercomfntastichqstatus1734265789237338453

#####

do not buy 
developers closed down
httpstwittercomfntastichqstatus1734265789237338453

#####

they should pay me to be playing this lmao

#####

created a character changed servers to meet up with friend game deleted all our of equipment and loot so we had nothing when changingokay no big deal were hardcore like that we decide to just head out in the city and get some went out into the city to get loot no zombies anywherethen we find police station and we cant punch zombies and there is no melee in a zombie survival game rip wanted to give this game a chance but felt violated by this game miss me with this hot garbage what a fking joke scam

#####

i refunded the day before they shut the game down

#####

they started working on this game the day before it came out on the day it came out we found that we had been scammed on the day after it came out we found steam doesnt care about what is on their store

#####

the day before you got scammed its an absolute garbage game compared to other games that they compared it too
1 developers clearly were not prepared servers are completely full and are people are having issues with random instant deaths
2 gameplay  is nothing like the gameplay footage shown zombies are typical in line of sight growls rushes straight at you nothing crazy you are able to fight anyone you see so that is a plus but other than that that is the only action about 90 of all the shops along the streets are locked up so you are left having to wander through the streets hoping to find a viable store to loot along with a few generic loot boxes 
all interactions are bad healing yeah let me rotate one hand around the other with no visible bandage or anything 
you want to customize the menu nah you dont even have enough options in the key bindings menu to use your scroll wheel toggling keybindings are nonexistent you have 9 key bindings as a whole for just movement even the shooting is horrible roblox has better shooting mechanics than this game 
3 the crashes and random deaths are insane several of my friends loaded into the game and before they were able to interact with the first person were falling through the floor and instant death best part is now you have to exit the game because the only way to play the game is to talk to the doctor who is behind a door that you cant interact with so restart the game and then refresh the servers for 15 minutes until you finally get into a server and then talk to the doctor so you can begin you trash experience 

regardless the devs have had so much time to correct and prepare for its release and have constantly marketed this as something that its just not the whole game as a whole is beta at best and it was not marketed as that i could include more but you should get the gist of the post hopefully in another 23 years its all fixed and what they actually marketed as that is if the developers dont drop this game instantly like they have in the past games

#####

dont buy this game its a scam

#####

they released the day before and closed the day after

#####

goty

#####

horrible game devs took advantage of us they are no longer backing the product

#####

httpstwittercomfntastichq

#####

if you are curious on refunding the game after 2 hours of gameplay yes it is still possible but do it fast before these scam artists take your money and go to thailand to get plastic surgery

#####

was a scam after all

#####






 

 _




#####

the cycle of this game
the day before
the depression after
the relief after the refund is deposited

#####

no

#####

do you know how a game is complete trash when lord gabe refunds it for me without me asking for it 

11 out of 10 on customer service



#####

tarkov pubg and the division had a baby except the baby was dropped on its head fatally

#####

do not

#####

this game would be fine for a free to play game and even then there would be atleast 10 players 9 of them developers trying to fix their garbage game close the game open it in 10 years there might be some content in it and working feature

killed like 10 people 9 of them disappeared in like 10 seconds couldnt even loot them
loots are garbage most of the things that you expect to be lootable is not lootable
every zombies almosttheres 3 type of it looks the same
no melee in the game kekw
theres probably like 30 player lobbiesand im being nice with the numbers so its not even open world
naked zombies takes like 3 headshots froma  762 ammo to die
shadows not even there all you can see is your guns
big boss zombies which eats like 30 bullets and drops 5 penny worth of stuff
inventory  garbage you need to lay down on the ground to look in your stash
alarm sounds is just amazing when you are inside a building its feels like alarm knocking through your skull then when you are out in the street it feels the same again
all of the safes contains 1 woodcoin  so you just need to open 16million safe to buy a house for your land plot
boss zombie suddenly spawns in my face then start slamming my head
theres enough money to buy 1 kit and thats it if you are dead twice then you are fked since you cant melee anyone in the game
there was 2 interactable doorsone of them was the tutorial door which wasnt even functioning at all you had to crouch to open it and one was in prison i just had to walk 5 miles for it

thanks for this amazing game keep up the good work i hope i can play in 2030  



#####

well im going to start simple this game is a major letdown far from the promised openworld survival experience its just a lackluster extraction shooter that fails to deliver any excitement the zombies are laughably dimwitted stand on a car and suddenly youre untouchable performance is so bad and bugs plague the game from hiding in objects with no hitbox to falling through the floor 

best to save your money

#####

the day before you got scammed

#####

ah i get it now this game was made the day before launch

#####

the day before feels like a scam it is a scam we all knew it we all called it they showed us gameplay that is not this game they showed us combat open world zombies details graphics so much more what did we get a half assed game that is not a mmo its an extraction shooter below i will state what is wrong with this game

h1b edit think about this carefully limited servers limited people per server try to connect for 2 hours steam refund policy is 2 hours scam bh1

h1b cons  issues bh1
so there is limited servers for eu na and asia all of them are already full apparently each server can only fit 36 people in them and all the pings are above 90 so i been told here is a screenshot showing you httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3107984784
the servers do not show you how many players are allowed on them how many players are in them already and it also does not show you your ping 
the game has weird lags spikes in the open world which leads to you getting spawn killed or grouped up upon by zombies and instantly killed
the game is not an mmorpg it is an extraction shooter game like escape from tarkov which is not what we were shown here if you want proof httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3107967353
already came across several game breaking bugs when i started falling through the map in the starting cutscene which led me to disconnect and then wait 20 minutes to try and find another server to join here is a screenshot to show you httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3107933055
i came across a guy shooting me in the hubsafe area which gave me intense bleeding he realised he could not kill me and left for the open world here have a look yourself httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3107971868
you are given this open are to build your little base just like tarkov but its stupidly expensive 12 million for a log cabin house gimme an axe and let me build it myself
no ultrawide monitor support
very little character creation options to choose from its forced presets more or less
changing your resolution leads to the game shiing itself

h1b pros bh1
na 

h1b my verdict bh1
this is a joke right this is not the game we were shown this is not the detail we were shown this is an extraction shooter like tarkov this is a scam i am refunding this right away stay away from this we all knew this was going one way or another the graphics are terrible the zombies are terrible and the servers do i need to mention 

h1b 110  terrible servers terrible graphics terrible settings bh1

h1b the scam before bh1

#####

i got a refund after 4 hours thats how bad this is the company pulled a scam and closed down one week after ea release
i actually respect steam for allowing this refund

#####

i bought this game just to give it a negative review

#####

got my refund the day before the studio shut down

#####

what a beautifully crafted refund simulator

#####

h3the day before i was totally dissapointed h3

the game is better than dayz and the division that would be true if it was made properly

 the shooting is awful
 the physics and animations of game characters and npcs  are unimpressive
 the sounds are just disgusting
 the open world is empty and boring
 its not really clear what there is to do in this game no story no motivation no specific goals

is this survival yeah only not from the apocalypse but from a boring unfinished alpha that was presented as an exciting adventure but in reality it turned out to be a shitty teaser for a trivial but potentially promising game

i dont think it will release from early access anytime soon and even if it does that it will change for the better theres just no hope for it

h3refund my expectationsh3

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3108205838

#####

for every like this review gets i will consume 1 spoonful of mayonnaise

#####

its a shitshow 
its always gonna be bad at release for any game but this game does not even have functioning settings 
try changing resolution i dare you


edit  
its also not a open world mmo its a poorly made extraction shooter
and for those that defend it saying its early access is just in denial 

i have refunded it might consider bying it again if they ever remake it into what was promised

#####

the refund button works better then this game does

#####

this is why aliens wont talk to us

#####

started game did the cutscene waking up and my character was out of the map falling through the map for eternity great sign for a good start also no one is ever gonna read this review so im gonna say that im gay and no one will ever know it

#####

















#####

this was the greatest fail in the history of gaming and im glad i got a front row seat to this disaster i laughed from the moment the game started to the moment i got a refund

#####

the day before  i got my money back

#####

15 minutes ago fntastic announced they were broke scam of game good ending for gaming community

#####

please give us what you promised years ago

#####

the fact that they closed the studio down is alarming steam should refund everyone who wishes to return this dumpster fire regardless of how many hours were played we were lied to they cut and run steam should honor any refund request

#####

myself and 2 others could put this horrible joke of game together ourselves and add vaulting and voice chat in 3 months what the hell did yall spend 5 years on the developers should all be ashamed of themselves for this unreal store asset flip i was so excited for this but its bull it looks like yall just put this together in 2 weeks do better or fire your entire team and get developers that actually know what there doing

#####

 remember no russian 

#####

just another what could have been game

#####

this open world is smaller than a new york apartment but with more rats

#####

its crazy how the original version of the game they alluded to is the exact game everyone wants a true next gen graphical open world zombie survival crafting pvepve game with animations and all of that content and between all of the good games out on the market and in the past this idea has still not been achieved lmao

dayz is probably the closest but it still has so many issues laggy non threatening zombies and the somewhat clunky and overly complicated controls for a lot of people who arent fans of the control scheme and player control feelings of military sims like arma

state of decay 2 is great other then the lack of personal customizable characters and its more of a community based sim focused more on the community then the individual survivor

a lot of these games get some individual elements perfect and yet lack in so many of the other departments or arent designed with them in mind more designed around their own specifically mastered mechanics
7 days to die with building dying light with parkour project zomboid is awesome but not for everyone arizona sunshine and twd saints and sinners are vr exclusive left 4 dead is a very arcady experience etc

everyone knows what we want and literally nobody follows through or creates the game we want just something else every single time

#####

if i wanted to be railed from behind id go visit my uncle

#####

this is a tarkov clone 
you promised a day z clone

you lied 



#####

rating 010

the day before a game that had the gaming community buzzing with anticipation for years has finally arrived and the verdict is in  its a colossal letdown the stark contrast between the promising trailers and the actual gameplay is nothing short of disheartening as a longtime fan eagerly awaiting its release the bitter taste of disappointment lingers as i recount my experience with this seemingly promising title

one of the major issues that plagues the day before is the vast disparity between what was showcased in the trailers and the reality of the gameplay the trailers painted a vivid picture of a postapocalyptic world teeming with dynamic encounters intense survival scenarios and engaging combat sadly the final product fails to capture the essence of these promises leaving players with a lackluster and disjointed experience

the openworld survival genre is known for its immersive and challenging gameplay but the day before misses the mark entirely the supposedly expansive and dynamic world feels empty lifeless and riddled with uninspired design the gameplay lacks the depth and complexity suggested by the trailers leaving players with a shallow and repetitive experience that fails to hold their interest

one of the most glaring issues is the evident lack of polish in a game that supposedly underwent years of development from glaring bugs and technical hiccups to unresponsive controls the day before feels more like an early access title than a polished finished product its bewildering how a game in development for so long can be plagued by such fundamental issues that detract significantly from the overall experience

furthermore the progression system touted as a key feature falls flat the promised sense of accomplishment and growth is overshadowed by a tedious grind that does little to enhance the gameplay this lack of meaningful progression only adds to the frustration and disengagement of players

in conclusion the day before is a prime example of unfulfilled potential despite years in development the game fails to deliver on its promises providing a subpar experience that leaves players questioning the time and resources invested in its creation from misleading trailers to lackluster gameplay and technical shortcomings the day before is a disappointing excursion into a postapocalyptic world that fails to live up to its own hype save your time and money for a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewhere

edit the reason why this review is chatgtp is because the game doesnt even deserve to have a review

should be named the scam after week

h2the day before a disappointing early access experienceh2

h3introductionh3

upon launching bthe day beforeb this is my first look into the day before and i want to provide an honest helpful review to not only consumers but also the developers

h3character creationh3

bcharacter creationb unfortunately felt generic lacking the depth the absence of finer customization options left characters feeling bland and basic

h3technical issuesh3

load times despite my highend system were surprisingly long

h3graphicsh3

while the graphics were undeniably smooth they fell short of the expectations set by promotional videos the city as portrayed in previews featured wet surroundings and illuminated buildings elements that were notably absent in the actual gameplay this discrepancy left me wanting for the enhanced graphical appeal that the developers seemed to be striving for

h3gameplay and lack of survival elements more like tarkovh3

as gameplay unfolded it became evident that bthe day beforeb falls short in delivering a true survival experience scavenging lacks depth focusing primarily on hunting other players for loot and accumulating money to buy basic necessities like food and water this simplistic system detracts from the immersive survival aspect turning the game more into an pvp shooter than a genuine survival experience

no firstperson removes much immersion from the game i found it quite funny that in building mode they force you into 1st person but every other time youre stuck in 3rd person i really do not like playing 3rd person shooters as it feels more like fortnite than a real immersive survival shooter

the absence of an openworld and a noticeable lack of a massive multiplayer online presence was disappointing instead of the expansive environment promised i found myself in what felt like an instanced pvp area with only a shared interior accommodating a possible 50 other players across the entire pvp map this stark difference from the portrayed genre left me feeling misled and undermined the immersive experience i had anticipated

h3developers promiseh3

now considering this is an early access game its crucial to acknowledge the developers timeframe of 6 to 8 months while expectations for early access titles are typically set lower its essential to hold developers accountable many ea games use the early access tag as a fallback for prolonged bugs and glitches

lets hope bthe day beforebs developers adhere to their timeline avoiding the fate of becoming another permanently in early access game that falls short of expectations

h3conclusionh3

in summary bthe day beforeb proves to be a letdown in various aspects from technical issues to lackluster gameplay and a lack of true survival elements as it stands its hard to recommend it to others seeking a more immersive and engaging gaming experience i would suggest playing other games like the division 2 or escape from tarkov as this game felt like a variation of those two games

sincerely disappointed

if covid was a game this would be it

#####

im confused i thought steam doesnt allow scams onto its platform 

dont buy this hot garbage hell its not even the garbage itself its that liquid garbage juice that slowly formed a pool at the bottom of the garbage bag you know that really stinky garbage juice

the refund button works 

#####

nothing like we were told the studio shut down do not buy

#####

do not buy the game they have the devs have done one with everyones money closed down fntastic completely 
scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam scam

#####

scam

#####

i spent the best 33 minutes of game play of my life in the day before  guys remember we have at least 8 months before the devs abandon the project get out there and enjoy this social experiment 3 for every like on this review i will purchase  another copy  for myself

#####

well well well look whos decided to play the day before  spoiler alert its the day before you finally get to play if connecting to a server was an olympic sport this game would win gold in the waitlympics grab your favorite snacks folks because this review is longer than my wait time

first things first the concept of the day before is intriguingsurviving in a postapocalyptic world scavenging for resources and facing off against zombies what they didnt mention in the brochure though is that the real survival challenge is trying not to lose your sanity while staring at the connecting screen

i pressed the ominous connect button with the anticipation of a kid unwrapping a birthday present only to be greeted by a loading screen that felt longer than the actual apocalypse if patience were a currency id be a billionaire by now but alas all ive got to show for it is a growing resentment for virtual dystopias

the game teased me with glimpses of the postapocalyptic world in the form of loading screen tips like zombies are attracted to noise stay quiet well guess what game im staying so quiet that ive started communicating with my neighbors through interpretive dance to avoid any noiseinduced zombie invasions

i tried every trick in the book to connectrestarting the game restarting my computer even restarting my entire life in the hope of finding a server in the afterlife i considered sacrificing a usb drive to the tech gods but they must have been on vacation because my prayers went unanswered

in a desperate move i consulted the games official discord channel hoping to find solace among fellow survivors little did i know we were all stranded in the same boat floating in the sea of despair waving our virtual paddles in futile attempts to connect it was a support group for the digitally forsaken

the irony of a game called the day before being the day before i actually get to play is not lost on me its like buying a ticket to a concert and spending the entire night in the parking lot listening to distant echoes of music the only thing im scavenging for now is a refund

in conclusion if you enjoy the thrill of uncertainty the suspense of perpetual loading screens and the slow erosion of your faith in technology the day before might just be your apocalyptic dream as for me ill be spending my day before playing something that doesnt treat my time like a postapocalyptic resourceprecious and scarce

#####

this game is just not what it was sold as and now the company is packing up and dipping with the money just do not buy this game it shouldnt even still be listed on steam

#####

the game was out for less then a week and the studio shuts down

#####

the day before lawsuitsuper hyped for the sequel

h1 positives h1

 its actually a real game that released i cant even believe i have to mark this as a positive however given the shady marketing and the history of the developers youd understand why this would be a positive

 beautiful graphics atmospheric and immersive world

 a good amount of enterable buildings with detailed interiors

 detailed central safezone hub 

 good amount of customization for your base like purchasable furniture that you can very easily place around and rotate to your liking

 character creation includes 3 classes for different types of players with brief backstories

 roamer  increased weight capacity looting skill and automatic rifle recoil control
 pathfinder  increased trading skill healing skill and sniper rifle reload speed
 ghost  increased stamina injury resistance and automatic rifle reload speed

 decent weapons behaviour

 decent and detailed environmental design dense urban environment with loads of abandoned lootable vehicles  boxescontainers


h1 negatives h1

 the devs straightup lied about the genre of the game  biu not an openworld survival mmo as advertised the game is basically a 3rd person extraction shooter uib

 it took me personally about an hour to actually get into a server after creating my character only 32 players per server and all of them got full not even 10 minutes after the game released

 poor optimisation  if you do manage to hop into a server the game is laggy and stuttery regardless of your pc configuration

 zombies are insignificant there are barely any zombies on the map probably 20 on the entire map and they do not pose any danger but rather an annoyance that disturbs your loot run

 no vault mechanic

 no melee mechanic

 no automatic inventory sorting

 no inventory items rotation

 no trading system with other players

 the game is a buggy mess  people are shooting through covers some players become giants visible from the entire map looting while standing too close to the container causes visual glitches some players appear permanently crouched and just slide around etc

 map feels empty

 very limited character creation options

 full loot pvp which gives incentive to large groups to camp extraction sites and gang on solo or small group players

 terrible anticheat just ask tarkov players it is kernelbased which means it has the highest priority access to your pc just below your os which itself can be both a positive and a negative it makes it harder to cheat but can make your system vulnerable to exploits

 lore makes no sense you are all survivors that have been saved by the woodbury survival colony and are all working on gathering resources to help the community as the quests dictate two minutes later you go into the city and its an rdm random death match  random players killing off one another pvp hell you were supposed to be working to bring resources to the community you are all part of but instead you are mindlessly killing each other for the same resources

 quests are basically  go to insert place on the map and gather x amount of insert recource type here

 there is nothing to grind about in the current state of the game there is no reward system and no leaderboards

 some players report missing gear after leaving it in the storage

h1 conclusion h1

the game is still in earlyaccess so i have not refunded it and im willing to trust the devs and give them time to improve it even after the shady marketing lack of communication and the outright lie about the genre sadly the current state of the game does not justify the price tag with more optimisation added content community servers bug fixes and penaltieslimitations for large squads that camp extraction points and gang on solo players i will recommend purchasing it as of now i will advise against spending 40 on this game and instead waiting a couple of months to check if the progress made if any is satisfactory for you  overall i cant judge people that instarefunded the game as it is justified however i ask the people who already purchased it and think about refunding it to give it a few months and see where it goes with that said though if you do not have spare 40 to spend on an early very very very early access barebones product that has potential to be a very good extraction shooter do not purchase this game

h2bi glhf gamers i hope this review was helpful  ibh2

absolute scam by the devs

#####

worst game of 2023

#####

i would actually worry more about liability where as its an early access game mmos have a very structured level of player base by game development standards an mmo has large numbers thousands of players online at the same time not 32 the game company is verging on a liability of false advertisement which could cost more than the refund of the games theres enough players for a class action law suit if you had a roadmap towards a larger player base and all the promised items to show that there was progression towards the promise then you wouldnt have as much liability or possibility for law suits 

however this isnt the case you have taken peoples money many of which wont realize the false advertisement until they cant get their money back its not a matter of the state of the game the overall game design is different than advertised and thats fraud 

theres also the possibility of removal from steam over this as again the game is playable but is not within the promised design facture which is a requirement to publish on steam selling the product you advertise 

this isnt an open world mmo with a considerable player cant theres no crafting theres no level progression that ive seen theres a mention of skills but it doesnt look to be implemented the only thing you basically have is counter strike with zombies a parcel of land and coop opportunities its completely fraudulent and falsely advertised 
imagine if 38k players didnt see the limitations and false advertising until they couldnt refund and what that would mean for your company  honestly we the players should setup a hashtag seem how many we can get together for a lawsuit



#####

yikes i dont know how else to say what hasnt already been said coming out in this state shutting the studio down less than a week later big scam vibes yikes

#####

the best part of this game is i finally got my refund

#####

the day before i got scammed
i will eat 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise for every like this review gets

#####

just a real poor game early access or not truly believed in the game despite all the negativity 

within 4 days they shut down real shame do not purchase

#####

do not buy this game the developers left their company no more updates shame

#####

great game and super fun please let my family go now

#####

pure scam

#####

very bad tarkov spinoff no open world no exploration 10 zombies on the map most buildings are unaccessable save your money

#####

scam

#####

ive played a lot of early access games but ive never seen anything like this before
this is straight prealpha
delays are temporary but a bad game stays that way forever

#####

okay so a small bit of input from someone who is a big fan of zombie games mmos and the like as well as being in college for game programming and development

1 with the premise of it being an mmo open world survival zombie game the inclusion of having to extract to a safe location to do any trading is insane 
2 i ran on one server for around 30 minutes and saw 4 total zombies given one jumped out of a car i will say that part was cool but overall disappointing also they shouldnt be tanking a mag in the face with a 762 if i get a headshot it should feel like a headshot 
3 looting took a moment which is fine and i like that i could free look around but it seemed like all the loot boxes for the most part were empty
4 the intro tutorial stuff took a hot moment and involves a lot of running around back and forth which could have been streamlined and put in an order that made more sense 
5 the lack of a melee attack is not good if i run out of bullets what should i do cry
6 every store i found was absolutely lacking in loot of any kind
7 there was very very very bad stuttering at times killed a player had the corpse despawn then got shot by a guy who literally popped in and out of existence
8 the attachment system is interesting but the attachments themselves could use some form of identifiers for what goes to what besides improved or enhanced magazine being their names
9 the cost for upgrading your little land plot is insane especially with the fact that it is supposed to be an open world survival mmo i understand we all cant live in the same area really as there would be too many of us but it would have been nice to have the option to loot stuff for the homes gather some resources in the world to actually craft parts of the home god knows you all had enough time to create a simple crafting tree for that

will add more if i think of anything but as it stands i do not recommend this game for purchase even as an early access game it is hell i would rather go back to star citizen where i can literally fly from one side of a solar system seamlessly and land on the planets wherever i want with decent performance at that

what a bunch of criminals liars and cheats

#####

welcome to asset land 

the 2023 scam award is decerved to gotovtsev brothers

#####

studio shut down steam wont refund me for being at 5 hours even though 4 of those hours were spent trying to get into the game what a huge let down

#####

do not buy this game i understand it is ea but this game should never have been released 
1 its not a mmo like they said it would be
2 its not an open world game like they said it would be
3 the storage system is broken the items you place in storage do not save you loss everything making it pointless to play 
4 the gun sounds while out looting are not real half the time they are just added to make you think there are more players in your world then there actually are 
5 there is no melee really there is no melee 
6 the game is barren 90 of the buildings you cant go in you can not climb ladders there are not enough zombies in the world 
7 the sounds in this game are junk an alarm from one store you can hear 4 blocks away like your standing next to the alarm

this game is nothing more then a terrible wannabe darkzone thats in division 1 and 2

#####

rug pull

#####

spent 40 minutes in the game world saw 2 players and 0 zombies while getting 30fps and loads of pop in on graphics  they sell this as an mmo lmao i have seen more action on a screensaver

refunding now

#####

be aware that you can refund

#####

im sorry to say that it is not as bad as we expected its actually worse

im sorry fntastic i really was hoping for the best but the game is absolutely unplayable

game seems to weirdly lock at 60hz stutters on my rtx 4090 servers are extremely laggy nothing is explained in the game it doesnt even show you the keybinds teleported through the wall in the very first moment in the game the zombies have like 5 different models theres like 2 different sfx for zombies and this isnt even half of what was wrong with this game ill be refunding this game is at least 3 years away from being anywhere where it should be

#####

collectors item now

update 23rd december lmao guess not

#####

cash grab took them 5 years to come up with this decided to release unfinished unpolished and put together who knows how then decided to go bankrupt lol

#####

received the game for free and still going to refund

#####

this is probably the biggest flop in history of a game the dev team launched it 4 days ago and literally just stated theyre closing their doors and arent supporting this game anymore they are known for scamming and we fell for it because the trailers looked so promising i bought two copies and was able to refund both even after 15 hours played i didnt have to email anyone i just did the normal refund process and explained it was a asset flip and they scammed everyone with the trailers and after about 30 minutes they refunded both my copy and my buddys gifted copy dont give up if they deny you keep trying to refund it regardless of the play time and eventually you will get it also be sure to report this game to steam in hopes steam removes the game and allows everyone to have a refund

#####

the worst game i had ever seen seems like a free to play extract game they promoted as an open world mmo game lmao its a smaller as fc map and theres nothing to do in this game plz dont spend your money on this game

#####

h1the void beforeh1
dont buy the game the gunplay is bad 90 of the city is filled with closed buildings the ai is terrible many elements of the reveal trailer from 2 years ago are not even present in the game like the simple climbing feature 
 fntastic have abandoned all their previous games and this one will be no different if you do a little research youll see just how catastrophic the development was and how disastrous the devs communication is

in short dont give money to a studio like this one its clearly a scam
you can have such incredible games for much less

buedit the studio closed 4 days after the games releaseub

#####

biggest catfish of a game

#####

these devs need to be arrested for fraud

#####

imagine making such a shit show other game dev companies reply to your tweet about how much of a scam you are

#####

the developers fntastic and the publisher mytona fntastic are both being closed this game has been abandoned by both the developers and the publishers the game has been released for only 3 days the has a good idea but these is no update to fix the game or to update the game to add new features to the game
there are hackers in this game do not buy this game

#####

this game was a scam it was a very top bad game in 2023

#####

studio just announced they are shutting down taking the money and running refund this game asap

#####

the day before i had 3999

#####

dont buy
biggest scam in history
server closing after 4 days
no open world mmo only a tarkov clone btw a rly bad clone

#####

as to no surprise the game developers with very little experience and reputation let everyone down who would have seen this one coming this game is not an mmo it is not a survival game its a wonky extraction shooter the most zombies i have seen at one time is 2 after 5 hours of playing too so i guess its not a zombie game either

#####

the day before closing the studio lmao

#####

as expected the scam before
 worst ui and zombie ai of every game ive ever played
 100 reused assets from unreal engine free shop andor copied from others games
 cant connect to servers andor insane latencylag
 full crash fall in void bug that stuck you forever with no unstuck feature obviously 
 not a open worldmmo just a poor extraction shooter

just unplayable dont get scammed and keep your money

#####

update the company is closing this is what happens when you lie to your customers win for us

they lied to us guys they lied hard i like many who got this day 1 was very excited for this game an mmo survival game yes please

what we got was a 32 player looter shooter extraction game with bad lag not enough servers and terrible sound

and they tried to get us to pay how much for this

save your money save your time pass on this game

#####

go buy a few breads and have a good breakfast this game isnt even worth 2

#####

false advertisement game was advertised as open world survival mmorpg in reality its extraction trash like tarkov

#####

ultimate scam studio closed 4 days after release

#####

i went into the game expecting an open world survival zombie mmo as they announced

i found out the game is instead a third person wishcom tarkov extraction shooter that is buggy and dead

#####

ive attempted to refund this game several times due to being scammed and lied to but steam denied it 4 times because i had 5 hours play time the majority of my time playing was sitting at a server selection screen and buggingcrashing and repeating the process how are there hundreds of reviewers with over the maximum 2 hour playtime getting their game refunded but not i dont buy this game please for the love of god and steam is part to blame for allowing it in my opinion

#####

i put 10 hours into this game because i saw the foundation and it was solid i was recommending to friends to wait a few months to buy because the game in its current state is repetitive and gets boring after a little while however i did enjoy this game and im sad to see the studio shutting down this game had so much potential to be great and i wish the dev team would have pushed the game back again i know for another year to try and give us a better final product 

all in all the game on release was a 310 due to repetitive gameplay and core mechanics missing vaulting crafting etc but the pvp was pretty enjoyable had some good fights 

steam i appreciate the refund i just wish it didnt have to come to getting a refund

#####

im doing my part

#####

i had fun with the little i played the game but after the devs said they were abandoning the project i had to refund it baffles me steam will allow this to stay on here given the games been abandoned

#####

went from being one of the most wishlisted games on steam to being shut down 

i would be sad but these devs deserved this and i hope they learn from this failure

#####

alright here we go

getting into the game is your initial problem seems like they only ordered a small handful of servers per region there is no limit indicator on number just says full on mostly all of them if youre lucky to find one that says high then good luck with it letting you actually access the server there is no queue system 

once in game you will find yourself with addition issues to overcome

uivisuals

first and foremost  settings along with a terrible ui if you change practically any setting whatsoever your graphicsvideo will reset to default and changing to borderless etc is hit or miss if it will actually save the proper setting sometimes it seems like it does but it does not its actually a bit too zoomed etc and you need to resave again

black strings of artifcact glitch lines will be randomly shooting out from objectsstores etc very weird doesnt help with the already struggling nonoptimized fps conditions

gameplay issues

clunkyyyyyyyyyy period game feels released super unready sprinting feels terrible want to run around but also be looking around as you do so character autostops moving nearly have to stop and restart sprinting so often in the middle of roadsstreets etc get stuck on all the cornersobjects that you want its almost impossible not to do so 

looting issue huge issue bodies disappear within 4560 seconds after dead so kill a player but injured and want to heal before looting ha body will disappear and no loot will be left for you my assumption is that a backpackloot pile is supposed to take the bodies location to allow being looted after the body sprite disappears but it does not work this way your loot will be gone kill a player better loot them quick while bleeding and unsure if they had mates good luck

zombies  if youre lucky to find any lol they move clunky and take 3 9mm pistol headshots to kill or roughly 1216 9mm pistol body shots fun sponges 

you will see lots of players skating around enjoy the crouching skaters hidden tposers

stash issues

once you organize your stash the way you like it but leave and access the stash again everything is scattered about the way it was originally nothing saves the way you set it

backpack swapping works in city and in base but not in the stash system very annoying

money trying to buy from vendors in base is a problem you must go to your stash put your money in your inventory then go to the trader to buy the item it does not see your money unless actively in your inventory qol please

inventory issues

cannot split med stacks

having no quickbar access is slightly annoying need to heal gotta find a safe spot pull up huge inventory overlay and hold space bar on your med for a good 5 seconds just to heal a small portion of your hp good luck being low hp and needing to heal in a pinch before having to loot fight again or even just seeing if youre hungry or thirsty etc

want to check your mission items no ui overlay for this either need to find a safe space and pull up huge overlay screen and navigate through the journal to see what you need to finddo 

speaking of missions  only being able to accept one mission at a time is blasphemy the game gives you multiple options for questingmission progress but only lets you do one at a time very annoying and easy qol change here

got all of this based off 27 hours of gameplay and that was 27 hours too many good luck

#####

barely playable right now and why does it take 4 12 gauge to kill a zombie

#####

well that lasted long xd

not as advertised  it is not an open world mmosurvival it is an extraction shooter with hardly any zombies and dubious pvp fake recoil horrible player footsteps and much more

its early access so some can be forgiven but false advertising cannot

it feels like a show piece a prototype more than a released early access title

sadly i went over my 2hrs streaming this to my community so i cannot refund i will however see if they actually update and fix anything over time but im not holding my breath

#####

scam 

#####

early access game release on december 7
they closed the game developer studio on december 11

what is wrong with this picture

#####

in the games loading screen it quotes pain is inevitable suffering is optional so i uninstalled and got my refund

#####

a generic zombie extraction game made of off assets from the unreal store
got a refund even after 8 hours of playtime

#####

this game is a master shet simulator tiny map nothing to do

title the day before  a shameless scam disguised as a game

rating  15

let me start by saying that the day before is nothing short of a colossal disappointment and a blatant attempt to dupe unsuspecting players the deceptive marketing tactics employed by the developers should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone considering wasting their time and money on this socalled game

the initial hype generated by the trailers showcasing an apparent openworld mmo experience has proven to be nothing more than a smokescreen the developers shamelessly deleted all previous trailers that showcased the false promises they made leaving the community puzzled and infuriated this alone should have been a red flag for prospective players

upon entering the game the stark reality hits you like a ton of bricks  the day before is a shameless copycat of popular titles such as escape from tarkov and the division the lack of originality is not only disappointing but insulting to the gaming community that expected something unique and innovative

one of the major grievances is the false advertising of an open world in truth most buildings are nothing more than cosmetic facades rendering them inaccessible and turning the supposed openworld experience into a monotonous and linear grind the promise of an expansive immersive environment is shattered as players are confined to a disappointingly limited play area

furthermore the promise of a zombie apocalypse is nothing but a hollow echo the sparse presence of zombies in the game is a far cry from the thrilling and intense encounters that players were led to believe would be a significant aspect of the gameplay

the day before isnt just a letdown its a blatant scam perpetrated by the developers themselves the early access release feels more like an attempt to snatch money from players wallets rather than an earnest effort to deliver a polished and enjoyable gaming experience

in conclusion i strongly advise against wasting any time or money on the day before the developers have demonstrated a complete lack of integrity and their disregard for their player base is evident save yourself the frustration and look elsewhere for a game that lives up to its promises

#####

not the game that was advertised zombies look awful and dont path correctly mostly running into trash bags on the street and getting stuck in a endless attacking animation if youre lucky enough to not die in the intro cutscene and get stuck inside a room not being able to interact with anything then you get to experience the day before where the servers are super laggy and get to experience a loot simulator with clunky movement and combat also running out of bullets means youre screwed with no melee refund pending

#####

scam of the 2023 year

#####

the biggest scam of the year award goes toooooo

#####

not good

#####

a looter shooter where both the looting and shooting are god awful
the map is tiny and feels like something you would see on an unreal engine demo
the survival aspect pathetically simple to the point where calling this a survival game feels like an insult to the entire survival genre
the ui is finicky youll find yourself approaching a lootpoint multiple times and from different angles in order to get the prompt to appear
the movement feels incredibly stiff and annoying  getting stuck on piles of trash bags glitching into windows as you try to jump through them and your character randomly stopping midsprint are all common occurrences in this game
finally i should mention that there is a bug with the item storage where all your items disappear so beware of that and know that your time and effort might vanish in a puff of smoke if you are unlucky enough to encounter this bug 

thank you fntastic for this pile of garbage you have made a disservice to the gaming industry and to the concept of early access you should be ashamed of yourselves for releasing this joke and i bamb ashamed for buying it

#####

100 false advertising should be pulled from steam as well absolutely nothing they said that would be in the game is in the game refund time

#####

they released the day before and closed the day after

#####

its like tarkov but with mediocre pvp what seems like ai voice acting everyone seems flat and dead inside youll immediately forget the cast and wish for a 2d menu for respeccing after a raid it takes forever to run between spots to gear up

what makes tarkov or hunt good extraction shooters are the limited choice of exits a shared objective and limited enemies its all controlled variables its all tight in tdb youre in an open map constant spawns of zombies other players alarms going offlike constantly gunfire in the distance it feels like a team deathmatch lobby if youve ever played apb reloaded youd be forgiven for thinking this is the same game

shooting is floaty zombies take 34 hits on average of 762mm ammo this feels insane surely a higher zombie count weaker health made more sense it seemed like what they were advertising

performance isnt that bad honestly props to the devs for this it stutters a little but so does every early access title they have bigger fish to fry
my excitement basically got held down and murdered after the first 15 minutes of painthe tutorial is a joke it feels like a f2p mobile game 

once i got into the open world i think i just was so sick of the janky opening mobile mmo into that i didnt really want to keep going im going to play for at least the two hours to be fair to this game just maybe hold off if youre not into extraction shooters or wanted something like dayz this aint that

i was initially so so keen for this i wishlisted it at 14000 wishlists total i removed it when the devs were being suss readded a couple weeks back and obviously bought it this isnt what it was marketed to be it barely works dont buy it

#####

do not buy this game fntastic now tryna delete all the evidence showing it advertised a massively multiplayer mmo its just a shit tarkov

#####

finally i got my refund xd

#####

seems like the game still isnt released you get to create your character with very limited customization options just to get brought to a server list where every single server is full without the option to queue there is no information for these servers no indication on how many players can be in these servers or a count other then full or high no information on server ping and no option for community servers

#####

they lied its not an mmo and it is an extraction shooter you can just run away from the normal zombies the special ones seem to run after you farther and need to be killed there is no voip from what i can tell

edit the company officially announced they are closing do not waste your money

#####

horrible horrible horrible game with lots of issues  do not download   by the time you can actually get into a server you have past your refund time from steam steam counts your hours waiting for servers to become available i give steam a giant middle finger for this i give the game a  01 10 for terrible game play  terrible hit reg atrocious ability to get onto a server  total trash game and total trash refund support from steam

#####

the day before i exit scam 

#####

i have been following since this was it announced  this is not an mmo this is a extraction shooter and it is barely that i am sure with time it could be an awesome game 

the good game looks and feels great looting is fun when you find things good frame rates base building can be fun

the bad pvp is just bad no mention in game that you should just shoot everything that moves zombies eat way too much ammo no mention of how skills improve 

if you like games where you loot the same things over and over attempt to do missions without getting killed by people camping also was killied a few times by the lag but will blame early acesss for that

#####

game developers shut down within 3 days of game release refund all thanks

#####

extraction shooter does not equal open world mmo survival this game needs love alot of love and time 
also for gods sake if the devs arent paying attention to actual community feedback right now today the first 24 hours is the time to start im probably gonna keep playing i didnt spend 5 years following this to let a failed launch keep me away

#####

the day before i wiped my ass

#####

this game took forever to make and minutes to break

#####

my experience
spent 50 minutes trying to join a server
got in after an hour and fell through the map 5 seconds in the cutscene
died and became task locked
spent another 30 minutes getting into a new server
spawned in a random room unable to get out
got in another server and finally got to play the game and i died from swimming
1010 would refund again
seriously this is bad

#####

spent almost 2 hours just trying to get in a server then spawned in a wall and got softlocked 1010

#####

ty steam for refund 3

#####

the day after the scam

#####

i came in not expecting much and did find not much

graphically its honestly decent im not familiar with the unreal asset store to say if this is an asset flip but even if it was i did not see any two assets that didnt go together so at least props for that
the city is quite big and even if the view distance isnt huge even on max settings it felt immersive enough

i did not have any performance issues the game was running at 120 fps on a 3080 with max settings

the story starts like the generic zombie game story no idea if it evolves into something but it was neither bad or good theres voice acting with some facial animations the npcs have some dialog options to learn more about the world or story and can give you small tips nothing much but it did help giving some sense of coherence to the world

but well that was the best i had to say about this game its all downhill from there

first the gameplay while it technically functions its really lacking in the enjoyment part the movement is as basic as it gets you can run but youll get stuck on any small ledge you can jump but you need stamina for that of course not sure if it consumed stamina but when i was out no jumping for me

then theres the lack of melee a lot of people are complaining and rightfully so if you ever run out of ammo or find yourself with no equipment whatsoever for some reason foreshadowing then youre as good as dead  you cannot outrun zombies nor fight back you might get lucky and get them stuck on some decor piece but youll eventually run out of stamina and get hit at least once which inflicts bleeding slowly killing you

and then theres the world itself it is pretty sure but gosh is it empty all throughout the 40 minutes i managed to spend actually playing i saw a grand total of drum roll 11 zombies  woohoo  and i went inside buildings to loot firing my gun left and right in the streets occasionally finding a couple zombies

during this entire time i was hearing gun shots constantly from other players i do not know how large the range is but i never managed to find any player i ran and ran and ran stopped to regen stamina on some slightly elevated decor which zombies dont know how to climb and then resumed running

i did loot some stuff on my way but lets talk about that  a select few random assets youll come by will have an interaction prompt to open them i could not find any common pattern between them sometimes an asset could be looted sometimes not sometimes you had a pile of 20 crates and not a single one could be opened sometimes theres an icecream cart with ammo inside its impossible to tell beforehand if itll be lootable and youll only know once youre up against the thing youre trying to loot all that for a handful of random items that didnt seem to have any relation to what you were looting so no strategy as to where to go or what to prioritize making it a fairly bad looting experience

the gunplay wasnt too bad but it also wasnt particularly impressive the only issue i had with it was from the lag

oh yeah i did not mention it yet but joining a server is hardcore i could not manage to join any in europe nor north america but did eventually manage to join asian ones
im saying eventually because thats what the 30 other minutes of play time are selecting a character waiting 10s for the server list to refresh scrolling alllll the way to the bottom to find a server that wasnt full selecting join and waiting 10s being booted back to the main menu with an error message and repeat again and again each time taking me about 15 minutes to manage to join a server

so of course playing on a server in a different region isnt great the lag ranged from actually not bad to about 1s delay on everything wouldnt be as much of an issue with a joining queue or more servers in my region but alas the team seemed unprepared for accomodating many players ironic for an mmo

also mmo as i mentionned i havent seen a single player outside of the hub area a few friends i was playing with did see some apparently but after some research it appears that you can at max play with 32 other players in the same instance to put it in perspective pubg isnt considered an mmo and you can fight against 100 players in a single match

while on the subject  the open world portion is as much open world as an extraction shooter goes there are a handufl of random buildings you can enter the map seems fairly large though i feel like you could explore most of it in under 30 hours of playtime

did i say i was playing with friends  sorry i meant to say all 4 of us bought the game but played each on our own because no matter how much we tried joining the same server was impossible the others played for a couple hours more than i did and not once did we manage to have two people in the same server
quite the epic experience for a multiplayer game

lets not forgot to mention that the game is quite unstable on average you should expect a crash every hour or so or even faster sometimes and everytime it does its back to joining hell of course

oh but thats not the worst part when you disconnect your avatar stays there for 60s before youre actually logged out
do you care to guess what can happen during those 60 seconds in game where you loose all your stuff upon dying  thats right if there was a zombie or another palyer nearby youll die and lose everything in your inventory
well if its a zombie it should all be on the ground for you to loot that is if you manage to join the same server again haha good luck with that i couldnt manage that

so yeah i ran saw nothing ran looted a bunch of random stuff ran finally found a building i could go in that looked kinda interesting crashed 5 minutes after joined back and was in the middle of the city with nothing no ammo no armor no weapons no bandages no food just the 500 coins you get after dying
so i ran towards the nearest exit point came across one zombie ran eventually got caught up and took a hit started bleeding ran regen stamina ran found another zombie ran and died of bleeding not even halfway to the exit point

there are vehicles in the game supposedly but the cheapest you can buy costs 1100000 credits to ground that number the most expensive weapons cost in the thousands up to like 20 thousands or so and those will already take you multiple trips to buy so i hope you have freed up your schedule over the next couples months if you want one no idea if you can steal them from other players or if there are any lying out in the open but i could not interact with any of the vehicles i came across

i tried looking into all the shops to see where the game could go but as far as i could tell there really isnt much beyond a bunch of weapons a few attachments some armor and backpacks
i dont know where they plan on taking the game but at least for now there doesnt seem to be much to progress towards again dont know if the story is any better than the typical mmo fetch quest excuses of a story

in conclusion whether its for the lack of gameplay lack of content server issues or expectations towards the promised experience id urge you to stay away from this at least for now
the game didnt feel like a scam to me there clearly was effort put into it maybe not 5 years though but it still felt like an alpha of an actual game

at least if the game was 10 or so maybe i wouldve kept it and tried it again every once in a while when an update seems to bring something interesting but 40  for this lackluster shell  yeah no

come back in another 5 years and maybe itll be interesting then

#####

you know how many people have the game wishlisted why wouldnt you have your servers ready   when will companies learn how to launch just crazy

#####

the day i got scammed

#####

release date  dec 7 2023                 gamecompany bankrupt  dec 11 2023

#####

how to refund 
help  steam support  the day before  refund 

refund worked for me with 18 hours playtime


#####

this game sadly has no depth its called an open world mmo but in general its a extraction shooter

#####

you can smell shit when you see it as well refunded the day before they shut down

#####

game was made the day before it launched

i would rather pay 39 for the division 1  2

#####

i says recommended gtx 1080 ive got rtx 3090 and still runs bad i know its early access but still 
 the game is not i repeat not open world they brought up so many videos of open world the city is super dead barely any open buildings and when you find one or a shelter with crates you cant even loot them this could have been the new dayz but instead its a bad copy of tarkov

#####

trash

#####

the day before the end

#####

the company straightup lied about their product its that simple

#####

5 years and this is what you came up with not an open world not mmo more like 10 people in a small map with maybe 1 room per block you can go in it feels more like a throwntogether lastminute moneygrab scam its just repeated assets from unreal 5 in a tiny map with no openworld aspects
do not buy
scam

#####

010 game  my first refunded game

#####

run

this is fntastic studio seppuku

#####

no melee in a survival game
no proximity chat
extraction not an mmo
big kek

#####

what the actual fk is this game my friend duped money and you cant even buy the 2 million dollar house probably because it wasnt included in the asset pack they bought i hope they recouped the cost of the 300 asset pack they bought for the game maybe in another 5 years of blood sweat and tears with game with be more than just an asset dump whatever media machine they had to hype this game up needs to be studied because holy st

#####

not what they said it would be  it is an extraction shooter  no voip no melee no jumping no vaulting  its not terrible but it is not what they said it was going to be  also the game does not support 329 resolutions

#####

servers are dead no filters to even help looking at the reviews its a scam

#####

utter garbage seriously janky and failed to keep their promise on being open world been in development for how long  seems a rushed 2 month project

#####

i had 27 hours and got the refund i honestly didnt hate the game with some effort it couldve been good maybe another developer will get their hands on this and make the game we all wanted

#####

someone really said what if we charge 40 dollars for a game we almost entirely ai generate and thought it was a good idea 

everything that was shown in trailers is surprisingly not present it is a love child rip off of the division tarkov and the last of us and none of the good parts either the tutorial is stupidly long and unaccessible until you get into a server which will take at least 30 minutes to find an open oneit does not tell you if a server is full just that the population is high nor is there a queue

intro tutorial is time padding i wouldnt be surprised if its only purpose was to try to reach the two hour refund limit the intro cut scene is clearly ripped from new vegas characters are spread out the workbench is oddly placed far away from the weapons dealer and the forced tutorial consists of putting a dust cover on an ak something that could have been done on the spot once you get past the clearly ai written and voiced dialogue the game just leaves you with no direction and the actual raid game play gives you no guidance no tips no goal and is so horribly optimized that zombies die seconds after getting shot in the head 

the gun play has this horrible sway that is almost entirely impossible to account for not that it matters since the reticle and the actual shot placement are counties different you have no idea what shots are landing and arent landing and damage seems inconsistent you end up wasting ammo trying to kill zombies since that are both super spongie and their death animationsragdoll are delayed thats even if you can raise your gun without freeze framing in place due to the horrible optimization 

the open world is gone
the dynamic terrain and environment is gone
all the enter able buildings have an alarm that serves no purpose other than to annoy you 

changing the settings at all including audio requires a hard game restart that does not even save your settings hell i dont think the settings even matter 

there is also this land plot settlement builder dynamic that seems extremely out of place especially since the open world aspect has been completely chopped 

and the voice acting is so clearly generated it hurts 

you can tell that they were at risk of having all the their money pulled if they didnt deliver a game so something was hashed together at the last second this is not at all what was advertised not that you could tell as they pulled all of their previous advertising featuring almost entirely different gameplay 

the only fun part about this game will be refunding it 

010 total asset flip at least whoever created the assets and put them on the store got some money out of it 





#####

the day before the scam

#####

do not buy this game i have never left a review before and dont believe in bashing games for no reasons this game is nothing like what they advertise do not buy

#####

early access  hope it gets better  wait to buy until reformed

this game had a really rough launch didnt have enough server space buggy laggy etc it is an early access game so some bugs are expected but not to this extent it has potential but like my exgirlfriend you need to spend a little bit of time working on yourself before im ready to jump into a 40 game commitment also not really an mmo it is more like a looter shooter but downgraded version of tarkov with zombies 

hopefully this games improves but i was excited to jump into it and was pretty let down even with the expectation it was an early release seems like a little bit of a money grab to me

#####

christmas is ruined

#####

do not get this game just a big scam sadly i wish they had potential but noooo please save your money dont get it they already left the project not even a freaking week before launch

#####

worse game ever released they should never be aloud to do business on steam ever again

#####

this game is nothing at all like the devs said it would be 

mmo  not a chance
open world  nope
survival  sure kinda but its all about pvp and the zombie survival aspect is a joke
zombies  yea there are zombies but if you hop on top of a box youre good
base builder  if you want to consider the plot of land with a tent a true base then sureit s base builder
open world survival craft  not even close

and that is just based on the tags

the graphics are absolute trash go back and watch the original trailer from two years ago to see what we were promised this early access release doesnt look anywhere close to what was promoted originally

good luck with getting into a server i spent more time trying to join today than i did actually playing the game

refunded after 15 hours




#####

first ever game i refunded

#####

finger weg der reinste betrug und das entwicklerstudio ist dicht danke an den steam support für die schnelle abwickelung der retoure

#####

dont buy this game 
its utter garbage and a complete scam falsely advertised as mmo when its nothing more than a very very bad attempt at an extraction shooter that lets you pick a class that grants you miniscule benefits compared to other classes

the in game graphics are alright what is to be expected from a ue5 title so no credit to the devs

the gameplay is lackluster at best the ui looks like a mobile game you cannot search for servers there are no filters you cant even team up with your friends before youre on the same server
the servers not working on release was expected so no negative score for that
but the rest of the game is garbage at best

to be completely fair about it there is the bare minimum of a gameplay loop you can do missions you can kill zombies you can fight players but nothing feels fun nothing is engaging there is absolutely nothing this game does better than any of the games it tries to mimic 

in fact it does everything worse the guns the only way of fighting feel like dogpoo 3 hits in the head of a basic zombie with a 762mm gun
the quests are a joke there is exactly one type of quest and it is go find 123 of xyz that is it there is nothing
there is housing you can place down objects in your own tent or shack but why should you there is zero benefit to doing this it is not fun and it looks like crap

i see zero potential for improvement this game does a poor attempt at duplicating systems from other games and throwing it all together
gameplay wise id give it a 210 for it technical being functional and for 5 or even 10 given the servers work it may be fun for a single evening with your friends but thats the maximum potential this game has

its a bad attempt to copy off the success of tarkovdayzthe division and many more ripping off systems and throwing the shit they created at a wall to see what sticks
the game is what you would expect if a 6yearold tells you wouldnt it be cool if luke skywalker would fight harry potter on the back of the enterprise

it is throwing things it thinks are fun together resulting in an amalgamation of poorly developed systems which looked upon individually are bad resulting in a weird poo puddle that stinks

if you ask me the worst thing about the game is that there is absolutely nothing in the game that feels like a novel idea the devs had everything from the setting to the design to the gameplay is a idea stolen from something we have seen before

dont buy it and refund it while you can


#####

no servers cant connect watch some streams nothing like the game is supposed to be that was presented the last few years of production refunded no servers cant play streams show the sorry game play bugs galore and unplayable 

dont waste your money

#####

1010 for scamming people

#####

ok let me crack my knuckles because im about to cook

the day before a refund this game makes you yearn for the day before you ever purchased it to start we need to address the elephant  or rather the herd of elephants  in the room the day before is the epitome of a scam with its notsosubtle attempts to swindle players out of their hardearned cash it seems the developers made it their mission to grab your wallet and run for the hills

storyline if one were to describe the plot one would have to resort to a case of mistaken identity the only mystery to solve is why you ever thought this game would be remotely enjoyable the narrative unfolds like a bad hangover pieced together haphazardly like someone dropped a deck of cards from a great height the developers aka volunteers must have had a day before mentality while crafting this disaster

graphics its alright

gameplay where do i even begin the day before offers an innovative experience in gaming incompetence the controls seem to be playing their own twisted version of simon says making your character zigzag aimlessly through the game world the combat mechanics are akin to playing tag with a caffeinated chihuahua where one missed click could accidentally rob you of hours of progress  or in this case minutes wasted on characters you couldnt care less about

bugs and glitches if this game were a biological experiment it would be the perfect breeding ground for digital cockroaches the incessant bugs and glitches infest the day before like a plague leaving you stranded in a digital wasteland every corner hides the potential for an unintentional moonwalk or a sudden nosedive through the terrain providing endless hilarity for the developers and tears for the players

conclusion in all seriousness the day before is undoubtedly a catastrophic failure and asset flip it lacks an entertaining story enjoyable gameplay and integrity its a masterclass in boring you to death and deception its a game that promises the world but delivers an ugly clump of mediocrity

so dear reader let this be a cautionary warning a beacon of hope among the sea of gaming choices avoid the day before like your life depends on it because this game is less a day before and more a lifetime of regret hold onto your wallets and say a prayer for your sanity  this is one refund youll be begging for

#####

i have never actually written a poor review for a game before because most of the time i feel like people are just so critical that its ridiculous however this company absolutely lied and showed us a brand new lambo but sold us a pontiac fiero

this game as it sits is worth maybe 1020 and anything more than that you are being ripped off imo i hope they are able to do something to make it better but i unfortunately dont see them being able to since this is the product that took them 5 years to put out

#####

when i finally got to join a server i just fell trough the floor unplayable

#####

i really wanted this game to be good at the very least playable the servers were full and if there is high volume on a server forget it you will be  trying to log in for a while they promised an mmo it is not an mmo they showed an amazing video of supposed game play it is not that game play they claim 5 years of development sweat and tears i would also dispute that claim

#####

 not a open world mmo 
 feel wired to play 
 no fucking loot 
 no fucking zombies 
 empty city 

not your time worth

#####

the worst game ever

#####

just so you know youre able to get a refund even though youve played more than 2 hours google more than 2 hours the day before and a reddit will pop up with helpful instructions

#####

the game is not a free roam open world mmo like depicted where you are in a persistent world its a bare bones extraction shooter 

plz save your monies

#####

if the division and tarkov had a baby during the chernobyl incident

#####

this is not a real game this is a scam

#####

day before is a prime example of a poorly executed game that fails to live up to its promises with lackluster graphics frustrating gameplay and a myriad of technical issues its safe to say that this game should be avoided at all costs save your time and money for a title that actually delivers on its advertised potential

#####

so i will start with this no game is great on day one we get that however you guys have been working on this for years and it looks like honestly it was thrown together in maybe 6 months we were all very much looking forward to an open world mmo survival that you announced this as but it somehow ended up being a loot extraction game with missions always paying out the same btw you cant call it open world with only 3 real instances to interact which are in the community the plot of land you get and the city the looting is done in from what you advertised first with this to what this is now is 100 not the same thing its cool things change however i really hope you guys step up with the updates and grind yourselves to the bone to get some things working on this with content and patches because if not i would strongly suggest never working in the gaming industry again
this has been such a disappointment but i will stick around and keep playing in hopes that you guys give a shit and want to make a game that will be something special and seriously add more zombies every run id see like maybe 5 but they would take 5 or 6 shots to the face to drop add in hordes make headshots do something  there see take that and work on it and then go from there

#####

absolutely joke  piece of garbage

#####

scam boring no content refunded 
no vault can get stuck behind a fence
spent almost 2 hours in ran into 3 zombies

#####

it is 100 an extraction looter shooter or divison with zombies crap 
and where is the open world mmo for these many years the map is too small and so on really a shame

#####

im gay

#####

the hopes were high the anticipation was overwhelming the execution was severely lacking
at least the refund button worked no need to say much more read the other 7k  negative reviews


#####

bad  game

#####












tdb

#####

please add edging

thanks

#####

this is one of the worst gaming scams of all time the devs of this game need to be stopped and put in jail for misleading all of us and stealing our well earned money i hope this is not gonna be the start of a new trend this need to be stopped asap

#####

every time i start the game i have to remake my character and do the tutorial every single time

#####

you will spend 70 minutes waiting to get into a server 20 minutes limping through the tutorial 15 minutes in a match 10 minutes figuring out what button is melee 4 minutes hating yourself because there is no such button and will be left with 1 minute to altf4 and refund  the most exhilarating part of the game

#####

do not buy refund if you can they abandoned it after 4 days devs are scammers 

i wanted this game to succeed i am having fun with it but i have to say its a cash grab as bad as i wanted to believe otherwise i love the city layout and hoped they were going to prove everyone wrong but thats not going to happen
steam should refund every dime the game needs to be reported as a scam and the company need to be sued 
i hope someone gets the rights to this and makes it great

#####

biggest long con in the history of steam
marketed as something incredible which the open world survival community so desperately wanted to be true
sold as a buggy unplayable fake item riddled extraction shooter with absolutely no heart and soul
the dev team behind this game should be banned from selling anything on steam in the future under the pretences of setting the bar at an all time high for scamming devs looking to make that one big payday 
completely disgraceful in every sense of the word
boycott anything this dev team makes in the future they dissolved the company fntastic and now dev under the name of eight points

steer well clear of everything these scum bags create

#####

this games more broken than a promise on valentines day it claims to be an mmo but its just a crashandburn extraction disaster its like ordering a pizza and getting a pancake  disappointing and not what you signed up for the only thing massive here is the letdown save your money for a game that wont ghost you midplay

refunded it only after achieving highest hours in the game

#####

as dwayne the cock johnson said its the biggest piece of dogsht

#####

#####

trash

#####

 we all live in a community we help it grow by completing tasks in the city  we do that by killing each other while were in the city completing tasks for our same community make that make sense

#####

scam

#####

sadly the game was a scam i was looking forward to it being an actual game instead we got a mobile extraction shooter at best and poorly optimized at that

#####

this game should be taken off steam for blatant false advertising the description of the game says openworld mmo it is not even close to that its just an extraction shooter game should be delisted and publisher blacklisted

#####

feels like another warz  infestation vaporware scam

the foundation could be decent if they continue to patch and fix but only time will tell if it gets abandoned or not

aaaaaaand its abandoned rip

#####

i wont sugarcoat it the fake after game is a complete letdown the videos promised a thrilling experience but the actual game is nothing like it the map is too small the ai zombies are lackluster and the missions are downright boring im telling you dont waste your money on this game its not even close to being worth it if you want to play a game that truly lives up to its hype look elsewhere save your money for something that wont leave you feeling ripped off

#####

cant recommend paying that price for a game in this condition  check again in 1 year 

the game is so broken its not playable as intended
its an extraction shooter in a server with 32 player  not a survival mmo 
50 of all server are filled with people duping gear on day 1
talking about servers  its desync fest

the pr team for this dev team is nonexistent  you get some information on their locked discord through their volunteer discord mods that have no clue whats up either





#####

speech organs

#####

refund

#####

how is this an mmo the map is small af and for a pvp extraction shooter the pvp is god awful

#####

#####

i mean these guys misspelled fantastic its our own fault really

#####

i have been excited for a game like this to spice things up the servers yes they are bad but i still had my hopes for the story and looting i have a decent pc and this game runs very poorly there are 12 stores on a street that is lootable which is surprising to be an open world which is only a survive and extract game which was a huge letdown i wanted this game to be good

#####

this is an open world game

funny how the game is called the day before

dev team always has huge issue the day before
dev team takes off steam day before due to trademark issue
dev team apologizes the day before early access of the day before i see why the apology on this early release


honest review right here and i didnt even get in gameplay just the screen to create character in discord the entire time their whole dev team is an absolute joke

1 the labeled this game as open world suvival mmo walk anywhere in stores etc its not its an extraction shooter just go play tarkov
2 dont spend 3999 period if you do refund our not getting in
3 price should be free if devs want testers cause there is nothign to test
4 servers are mmo its just 32 players per server this is not an mmo at all
5 very very very few servers and ever single one of them is full being on 32 players

riddle me this nonfntastic you literally have a wishlist count on the game your gonna release and you only have few 32 person servers going this is a cash grab just refund and leave steam wise word dont let these developers ever come back

this was the most wise decision of my life refunding this game at 40 and going to buy a 12 pack of beer ribeye steak and we and the homies are gonna grill and drink beer and talk about how bad these devs are and play a simple more fun game thats probly free

again do not buy waste and the devs will lie to you


#####

division 2 is 900 as of writing
new york city within a real mmo world filled with clans bosses and pois filled with ai

3999 for a blocked off city and 25 player limit on a small map is definitely not worth it money wise
this game no doubt can become a great game with updates but as of writing its not smart in this economy

hope to revisit the game in the future



#####

it has great potential but nowhere near ready borderline not even ready for early access definitely not worth 60 aud the duplication glitch which is still not fixed took the very limited gameplay loop away from everyone the hackers have also already started a real shame hopefully they stick with it and i will definitely come back it is not an mmo at all you go into raids its like day z tarkov and the division had a munted love child all this is not to mention the poor optimisation random frame rate drops massive server lag game breaking bugs the list goes on

#####

released 5 days before shut down

#####

not an mmo or survival as advertised its an extraction shooter missing basic functionality even for early access not worth a5850

#####

i dont even know where to start with this one i took it personal
 the game wasnt what it was originally advertised to be
 the game barely worked and had huge performance issues
 within 3 hours of launch there was a duplication glitch that everybody was using so all fights were top tiered weapons and armors or getting ran over by sports cars going 180
 there was about 8 weapons and 8 armors that all offered basically the same attack and defence
 the devs announced major updates to then not even 12 hours later announce the closing of their studio

redeeming qualities
 it was a game
 pvp was fun and the ttk was just right

i had high hopes for this game constantly telling my friends and viewers how much of a success i thought it would be for over 3 years

this is honestly the most disgusting thing ive ever witnessed in 20 years of gaming and it breaks my heart

i will never trust a developer who promises all of the perfect things for a game ever again

f fntastic

#####

the biggest scam in gaminghistory

#####

zombie looter shooter with no zombies or loot

#####

lord gabe loves you 3 3 3 3 3 3

#####

with 12 hours on game i can make a legit review and tell you the facts

fact one  38000 players yesterday 8700 players day 2 nuff said

#####

dont waste your time game is unplayable you are constantly skipping frames the combat mechanics are bad

#####

i can not remember if i have ever posted a public review of a game on steam  i generally just buy try  and move on if i feel it is a waste of my discretionary time ie not fun  this particular game  at this particular time  accurately reflects the danger and risk of over promising and under delivering  in my opinion this is not a open world mmo survival as described on steam  but a very weak and incomplete attempt at an extraction shooter

#####

the game had so much potential but almost everything shown in all of the trailers was fake

30 hrs sunk 20 hrs of which i  semi enjoyed the last 10 hours i was actively finding and documenting bugs and replications in an attempt to help the game become what i have been desiring so desperately since the arma 2 epoch days

refund the game whilst you can and under no circumstances purchase this game
the devs pulled a bait and switch the game is no longer in development and the company ran with the money

#####

ok so i tried this game was very hyped af and yes it turned out to be disappointing sorry to say this game aint worth even 13 bucks straight out dont buy it animations are trash servers are garbage got kicked 5 times before entering one xd bullets dont connect properly same zombie models with clunky animation overall its a 210 just ignore it

#####

game needs time might have needed an alpha drop to get feedback before an actual release its got potential but needs much more open world and no community safe locations if the devs read this foundation is there but give it more dayz and less tarkov let the game come to life with the community also no melee in a zombie survival is like a sandwich with no bread ill come back to this in a couple months if i see progress

#####

got a refund

#####

ive been waiting for this game for about 3 years the alpha is finally released i load up the game and make my character with a character creator from 2010 i load into woodberry and started playing the intro to fallout new vegas somehow my character falls through the ground and immediately dies i am given a choice to respawn in woodberry or to go to my plot which i have no idea what that is yet i choose to respawn in woodberry i spawn in the middle of the main area with the objective of talking to the doctor again i try to go to talk to him to actually start playing this 1010 blockbuster game the door to get to him is locked i go back to the main menu and delete this character thankfully it took me less than 30 seconds to recreate my character because the character creator barely has any customization i load into goodsprings again this time i am pushed out of the map once again and begin to fall infinitely however i realize that this happens now because other players are spawning in this same location and i believe pushing me out of the map i quit to the main menu and join again i can actually play this game the game is not optimized at all i changed from 2k to 1080p resolution and had the exact performance dlss does nothing i talk to the people in woodberry to learn their roles and whatever i open my gps to get my first task i tried to accept all 3 of them so i can do them all and come back for more rewards at once you can only do 1 task at a time i leave woodberry and go to fortune city i dont know why its called that because everything about it is pretty unfortunate i loot some vehicles and stuff along the way and then experience my first combat encounter its basically just the same combat as dayz except this is way cooler because the infected can take several shots of 762x39 before they die i finally reach my destination for the task which is to collect radios for eddard i see another zombie and take my first shot at its head at anywhere from 12  34 fps the game crashes i requested the refund with a solid hour of play time this is exactly the way everyone anticipated it to be all is well

#####

made the day before release

#####

5 years in the making and this is what we got shouldnt have bought this but wanted to try it everyone who bought this game should get their money back since there is no support now

#####

this might just be the worst game i have ever played going into this expecting maybe a dayz competitor but getting tarkovs  2nd cousin that got dropped on its head and rolled down a flight of stairs these developers should be ashamed of themselves

#####

no melee
no vaultingclambering 
very empty feeling lack of zombies
animations are very janky
fps spikesdrops i have a 13900k a 4080 and 32gb of ram
the camp is just assets to look at and place so far 
gun play feels and sounds awful
no feedback when shooting 
no voip
the loot pool sucks
bugs on the alarms 
not an open world mmo  more an extraction shooter with some zombies 

theres nothing new here  early access in no excuse ive played more immersive roblox games

whos buying this over games like deadside scum dayz

needs a lot of updating to even get this in a playable state  the only thing fantastic about this game is the way it looks

#####

this game is a straight scam there is hardly anything survival or mmo about it this isnt just early access day 1 issues waiting ahead but a product that isnt what was advertised at all i hardly ever leave reviews and ive dealt with a ton of bad gameslaunches but this game is so bad i legit feel like i was stuck up without a pistol as the saying goes im hoping i get my refund 

save your money and run far away from this only an allstar dev team millions of dollars and another 2 years could save this game it is not a mmo and it is not even an open world survival game cod warzone is more of an open world game than this this is a rushed extraction shooter that fails to be 5 of the game that tarkov is on the other hand it also fails to be 10 of the survival online experience that dayz or many others like it already offer save your money and go play project zomboid with some friends at least there you wont spend 5 hours failing to join them like i just did

#####

the ui broke the second i logged in then couldnt connect to a server when i finally got into a server i fell through the map and died do not play this game

#####

4 days in and the developing company already shut down so if you are on the fence about this game that is all the info you should need

#####

i had no expectations and still felt disappointed with everything the game has to offer putting aside server and capacity issues the gunplay felt awful with the laughable impact of firing bullets that i witnessed when shooting enemies and how staggering enemies took a couple seconds to trigger the gunplay just felt so jarring and clunky theres no mantling no maneuverability no melee options making the survivability extremely barebones against other players and zombies the gameplay loop seems undercooked even if we can generously call this early access the world felt abhorrently lifeless for something advertised as a uniquely reimagined journey within a postapocalyptic openworld mmo falsely advertising a game that in reality is an extraction shooter with some survival elements and not an openworld mmo is just blatantly rude of them to do and still advertise as at the time of this review 

overall i do not recommend this game to anyone in its current state its baffling they are selling this for the price it is

#####

scam

#####

010

#####

studio is shutting down basically dropped the game knowing it was bugged just to make some money to pay debts and close shop

#####

this is not a open world mmo this is a small area extraction shooter the devs deleted all the old videos showing the open world elements the city is dead and there are barley any open buildings there are no survival elements in the game

turns out it is a real game

kind of wish it wasnt

#####

if the day before has a million fans then i am one of them if the day before  has ten fans then i am one of them if the day before has only one fan then that is me if the day before has no fans then that means i am no longer on earth if the world is against the day before then i am against the world

nobody read the reviews so i will just say i am gay
30 hours refund accepted

#####

scam

#####

scam

#####

its a scam as the entire internet expected there is a reason they didnt show anything about this ever they tried to hide this

#####

dont buy it otherwise you contribute to the anticonsumer habits that publishers have nowadays in my case its the day after refunded

#####

the game works and can be fun with the right audience but its definitely a lowbudget indie dayzlike game their only major error was trying to sell this as a aaa title and im sure theyll pay the price for it somehow

#####

will always remember  teh great scam

#####

i waited 2 years for this crap lmao

#####

this game is horse sh1t

#####

the scam before

#####

could be a mobile game
