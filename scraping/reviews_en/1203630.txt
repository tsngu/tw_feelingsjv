dont worry about other reviews saying the game is short while the total playtime is only 45 hours it feels much longer than that because theres absolutely no padding theres no backtracking grinding or pointless side quests and so you get a very dense high quality experience honestly this game has a larger quantity of bosses 11 and enemy types over 50 than games that are four times as long

#####

everyone in their reviews are comparing this to sotn but how different is it exactly im going to double down on the whole theme of sotn vs record of lodoss war rolw and give you an idea of how it stacks up against that feeling of nostalgia since i was a big fan of sotn too

b tldr b  its great buy it its more complex than sotn but the feeling of exploration is there with a bit of a puzzle element and the combat is tight mechanics of the game are wellimplemented very creative and everything feels like itll give your brain a squeeze plus theres lots of weapons to use and collect for you hoarders and challenging and varied enemies to fight against if you dont like lots of things going on during combat this might put you off but it should really be a nonissue however one note it is a short game maybe 78 hours if youre very fast but easily more if you play without any hurry then again if youre really dedicated you could finish sotn in one day too

rolw sotn comparison 
note this comparison may seem a bit negative but when you compare anything to sotn very few things will excel it see below for more nuanced views

b  b lots of options and flexibility for engaging in combat eg angle of attacks range slide magic i relatively simple left and right weapons spells transformation most of which are unnecessary to master except the nowwellknown doubleattack when jumping or landing i

b  b you need to keep those complexities in mind or you do no damage i you could get by quite easily with standard damage no such thing for rolw i

b  b but it does mean that it rewards skillful play i sotn is mostly basic maneuvering skill i

b  b lots of weapons i sotn really has far more i

b  b a variety of move sets and you can see the design change for most i might actually have fewer i

b  b not many equipment types limited to melee and ranged weapons i sotn has 2 weapons head chest cape and two rings i

b  b fluid slick and absolutely updated animations i sotn still looks very good though dated but cant really compare because rolws is just so smooth i

b  b map aesthetics are gorgeous i sotn though with dated graphics does feel like the foreground and background are better designed and they tell a story i

b  b maps can be a bit tight and not as much variety theres also no discernible separation between the areas i sotn has huge rooms with high and grand ceilings for some cramped spaces for others its also got a somewhat spaced out layout so you can tell which parts of the maps are what good metroidvanias tend to do that as well vigil the longest night and hollow knight are two that come to mind i

b  b huge enemy variety i just based on permap basis overall sotn has far more i

b  b theme for the map and bgm doesnt gel as well as sotns i think of the library and the royal chapel theyre absolutely haunting i

b  b bgm is good but not entirely noteworthy

b  b sound design is good with satisfying swing hit fall and kill sounds i but does not have the variety that sotn has think of the deathcries of all the enemies  i

b  b relatively short i sotns reverse castle easily gives dozens of hours for completionists i

b  b is out on steam why is sotn still not on steam konami why

h1 gameplay h1

naturally this will be the largest part of the review since i think it is what a game is primarily about
one huge departure from sotn in terms of gameplay is the complexity of combat itself if youve just come from playing sotn it will immediately feel like theres a whole lot more going into the game here are some additions theyve made

1 ability to swing at an angle
2 access to a bow you can aim
3 easytoaccess magic
4 elemental resistancesweaknesses being far more prominent

deedlit unlike alucard has the ability to actually swing at extreme angles whether jumping or standing still this lends itself to far more flexibility but it also makes moving a little more complex since if you want to attack at a diagonal angle you need to be careful of not accidentally moving into your enemy 

the other huge added complexity is with the elements system if you switch to the wrong element you cant do damage to the enemy but if the enemy projectile is the same element as you are you recover mana and dont get damage different elements also give you different abilities ie hovering or invincible slide in this way rolw is far more punishing than sotn if you dont think about what youre using 

that being said because of the way the element system works and how you can gain mana from absorbing enemy attacks you can use your bow and spells more often switching between spells is pretty easy but it gets crowded eventually since it shares a menu with items

but there is one complication element levels i wont go into details but if you get damaged this level goes down and your damage drops drastically forcing you to be more careful your spells will thankfully do the same amount of damage regardless of that level but it really becomes a struggle and can be quite discouraging to get damaged

there is something that needs exceptional note here the enemy variety this is the one thing that matches sotn so well and depending on how many more stages there are might even exceed it it may be hard for deedlit to compete with sotn in terms of sheer enemy variety but for the maps released its doing very well you do meet the same enemies quite a few times over a few maps but before you know it youll have something new to challenge you again very nice level design is great too challenging a bit of a puzzle and eventually as you get more tools gives you options on how to approach your battles

combat summary so combat could be a bit of a neutral if you enjoy something more cerebral than sotn then this is for you if not then you might suffer a little and not enjoy it as much sotn was great because there wasnt too much going on and your equipment build and basic movement skills would be enough to carry you to the end of the game deedlit requires much much more

h1 bgm h1
the sotn soundtrack might be my favorite of all games and sadly deedlit is unable to dethrone the king the bgm itself is very good but lacks the thematic tiein to the level that sotn had which made it so impactful its very serviceable but it wont be walkingintothelibrarywithbaroqueharpsichord levels of goodness individually they are all good some are even memorable but if you come from sotn you may not find that this games soundtrack will scratch that itch personally i find that this might be the weakest part of the game but its a very subjective thing and perhaps it just needs time to grow on a person

h1 audio h1
but that leads straight into sound design the sound for this game is pretty juicy it has nice woosh when you swing booming and snappy explosions when you kill stuff and the little details of foot steps when you land gusts of wind when you hover all sound great however i cant help but feel it doesnt quite have the same variety of sounds as sotn did when you killed things bloody zombies gurgle and spit blood medusa heads disappear in a puff armours roar and fall to the ground with a few drawnout explosions marionettes giggled as they moved and crystal maidens screamed as they shattered in pieces it was a cacophany of screeching things in sotn and deedlit doesnt quite live up to that that being said its by no means mediocre and its still an excellent example of sounds that feel good

if you like metroidvania games get this game this is one of the best games i have played in a while of this genre there is so much to do and see here team ladybug did not hold back with this one making it feel like a spiritual successor to symphony of the night for anyone who had the honor of experiencing that game in its prime

swinging your blades and magic around in this game feels so smooth of course the smooth combat is made even more impressive by the fact that there is a variety of weapons items to find unlike anything in symphony of the night they did add an interesting element switching mechanic in deedlit and a ranged attack through the use of a bow these tools feel absolutely fantastic nothing in deedlit feels like it is too overpowered or too underpowered all of the options given to the player allow you to even alter difficulty to your liking through the equipment which is a warm welcome

although the equipment you find is great it is not the only tool in your arsenal you will also gain abilities in the form of magic spells you can use against your foes there are a good variety of spells that all are really unique and useful in their own ways really allowing for some expressive playstyle for the player also like everything else in deedlit your magic is not going to break the game by being too strong but on the contrary will be found to be just right in its application magic is very useful without being broken

nailing the fluidity of combat was not all they did right when developing this game these developers really knew what they were doing with balance as well all of the enemies and bosses in this adventure all feel really well made by giving the player a real varied challenge without being too harsh each boss really has their own personality that comes out with their fighting mechanics which makes each of them a joy to learn to overcome

to be honest this is one of those titles i could sit and gush over for hours because of how good it is after my adventure through the wonder labyrinth began it was insanely hard to put it down until the credits were rolling even now honestly i have a strong desire to play through again from the start

do yourself a favor and invest in not only this game but this team this group of people really know what they are doing

#####

okay so i was mixed on if i should recommend or not

in short this game is a demo right now
its an amazing demo and a beautiful homage to sotn
the art is true to lodoss as well as castlevania and the gameplay is great

but its 45 minutes long if you want to support the game by all means do and hopefully it gets completed sooner rather than later but 13 is pretty expensive for 45 minutes of fun so it may not be the best investment for some

#####

its normal to immediately compare this to the legendary symphony of the night as a fan of that title this game feels like a redesign on a tried and true masterpiece and it feels like its been successfully improved and polished all elements present that are added to the classic formula play well so far and their implementation feels natural to this games overall design

this 2d explorationbased actionadventure rpg encapsulates what you might expect from an adventure starring deedlit as the elf you get to utilize elemental spirits to advance through areas of the game these spirits affect your attacks defense and your traversal by not getting hit you can charge your magic to help recover health which is a nice way to deal with the lack of health pickups you can buy potions or visit marfa statues alternatively your bow also becomes a unique puzzle solving tool using ricochet shots or firing from hovering vantage points to advance aside from that its kill the monsters get the weapons and upgrades and keep exploring

one of this games subtle strengths lies in the onscreen displays the developers with good design choices have successfully reduced the number of menu screens without compromising their functionality enemy health weaknesses and strengths to elemental attributes are all displayed as you fight them so a bestiary isnt necessary to plan your attack or grind deedlits cape and healthmagic bar change color to further indicate what spirit youre using which is a helpful visual aid from your pause screen you immediately have access to the map while having access to the equip screen normally you would have separate menus to access each but the combined display is thoughtfully constructed and keeps the game moving

that said its a record of lodoss war title if you arent familiar with the series by now you wont immediately recognize all of the characters that appear but that shouldnt take away from enjoying the game on its own and might even encourage you to dive into the world of lodoss if the game stopped to tell you everything it would change the pacing in a bad way and im glad they arent trying to hold the audiences hand with respect to lore this game is moderate to fast paced so it makes sense that it would expect you to be in the know for a series as old as lodoss

finally a lot of the atmospherelevel design is beautifully animated and i particularly like the goddess of marfa save statues and how the water shifts as you hover over it using sylph deedlits animations are fantastic and im glad to see so much thought put into all the sprite animations this lodoss themed metroidvania has the potential to be big and i want to see it and the developers go places i know were still in early access this game isnt finished yet and it may be wishful thinking but maybe they can pay homage to the slayers someday in a similar fashion until then

i shall defend the peace of lodoss with my life

#####

so i am going to recommend this game but it has a few caveats which i will try to word in this review  
  
first the good things
 great musicapart from 1 or 2 tracks that are a bit meh but still not horrible
 amazing pixel art
 the combat feels smooth and clean very responsive deedlit always did exactly what i wanted her to do when i wanted her to
 the last bossof the full game was quite fun i enjoyed the fact i had to actually play well t and the elemental switching i had to do to beat it this was the first time in the game i used a single potion to save my life cause i was so close to beating it and i didnt want to start over

thats about where the good points end

the bad points
 its insanely short my playtime of 5 hours includes roughly 3045 minutes of afk time where i forgot to turn off the game and i beat the full game in that time i didnt go back after beating the game to find all the hidden rooms and the likes

 its so easy you could probably beat this game with your eyes closed none of the bosses really offer a challenge spamming attack and occasionally dodging out of the way of an attack will win you a fight in no time if you want to win faster you spam magic and just melt a boss

 the vast array of weapons you have are all incredibly bland they have some fun flavor texts that make you think whoa this weapon sounds awesome i wonder what it does only to find out its just another weapon you have probably already swung before with a different look and increased stats this time 

 the powers you get are incredibly underused i never felt like i needed specific power to beat a boss the first boss in the game sets the stage a bit where you have to float with wind and dodge an attack which was quite fun thats the last time you have to use that in a boss fight although there is 1 exception to this rule see good points

 the visual clarity in boss fights is bhorribleb with all the screen shake and effects going around and the fact you fight a lot of humanoid bosses so if you are hitting the boss with melee you get this effect over the boss so you cant see what the boss is doingat all

now this next one is a personal issue of mine that not everyone might have
there is a few boss fights where the background changes to this green tube that you are moving through and that effect is absolute garbage it triggered my motion sickness like no tomorrow and it was just the worst effect ever for an action game boss fight

now you might be wondering why i would still recommend this game despite so many negative points vs only a few good points i still had fun playing the game and i bought it for 8 euroswhich was still too much for the playtime i got out of it but not for the fun i got out of it
i cannot recommend this game for full price ever wait for a sale to around 58 and its good enough to blow an evening or 2 on 

if you want a better game by this dev team buy their touhou game touhou luna nights its cheaper longer and has far more fun and engaging boss fightsi played this on game pass thats why its not in my steam library

#####

very short playtime but just to put out an initial review for anyone on the fence  will update

get this game  i dont know how to say this because i know i wouldnt believe anyone saying it  and im just going by how this game feels plays and looks initially if it falls apart later i wouldnt know

sotn has easily been on my top 10 list for over 20 years  this is better than sotn  this is how bloodstained should have felt  you know how you loved bloodstained but a little bit of your love for it was because you knew you had to because you had waited 20 freaking years  this is like that but without the part where you have to talk yourself into liking it

this is fucking art  someone still knows how to make video games

edit
the above was after 30 minutes now ive completed all the early release content 90 minutes as of march 14th

not a lot to add at this point but do i stand by my initial amazement of this game yes i do  

difficulty is dialed in perfectly nothing will ever make you rage quit  yet there is no enemy you can afford to fall asleep on

the game play itself is what stands out the most  smooth  addictive  just fun to play

and of course the graphic art style is well done if you cant tell by the video it is

#####

okay first of all i have almost 0 knowledge of record of lodoss war and somehow i still manage to enjoy the game although story might be little confusing for a first timer like me since youre not familiar with anything the characters the settings and other things but it wont ruin your experience trust me

this game has a very important feature in a metroidvania game something that made me love metroidvania in the first place which is weapon diversity this game allows you to play with different type of melee weapons such as swords clubs spears and more
i dont really want to just stick with a whip or a piko hammer or a bunch of knives the entire game dont get me wrong i dont dislike those kinda games but i like playing with different type of weapons way more
aria of sorrow is the one that introduced me to castlevaniametroidvania its just always fun to find a new weapon and using them even if they probably are not better than your current weapon
same thing with symphony of the night dawn of sorrow portrait of ruin and order of ecclesia
but this is just my personal preference
not to mention this game also features backdash another great feature

this game also has very fun mechanics like the bow physics youve already seen it from the trailer its pretty cool and the 2 spirits that reminds me of outland remember that game
its such a cool feature especially in boss fights
speaking of boss fights difficultywise theyre pretty fair not too easy not too hard you just have to be careful and swap spirits at the right time if necessary

as you can see this game is beautiful graphically especially if youre a fan of pixel graphics like me so much details put into this i mean if youve already seen how these guys made that touhou luna night you wouldnt be surprised how amazing this game looks

soundtrackwise i think they have great soundtrack cant really say much about it honestly people have their own taste in music

so i think ive said everything that i wanted to say about the game
now should you get this game well it depends the game is still in early access and im not sure how long the game is going to be knowing team ladybug that seems to be making only short games 24 hours i dont think theyd make this a lets say 1020 hours long game although it would be great if they do
but id say keep your expectations low right now there are only 2 chapters and i finished them all in 2 hours some people might finished them sooner
if you dont mind playing short games and just want a fun metroidvania experience then go for it
but if you want a long playtime metroidvania then you might need to wait until the game releases

thats all i gotta say for now might update this review when new game updates comes out

#####

after waiting for the full game for a whole year here are my
h1final thoughtsh1
uill be keeping my original early access review here just because i think it was useful for some players who were getting into this and because some of the things i went through before are still relevant to what we have in the final productu here are my brief thoughts after finishing the game

ive grown quite fond of this and the lodoss franchise over the past year waiting for the final games release i even took part in the drawing contest for the games steam banner bought it very early on since it came out just after i finished my playthrough of touhou luna nights which became one of my absolute favourite metroidvanias ive played in recent years so how does this one compare

uerm i really hate to but i have to be frank it was ijust oki didnt really live up to the hypeu

graphicwise ibrillianti way better than luna nights but the core experience was simply average at best the level design was kinda clunky and the navigation wasnt always a pleasant thing to figure out the music was not so memorable the challeging boss fights from the first early access version are still missing since the stage 2 update the gimmicks got old pretty quickly and never got any significant twist in variety during the course of the playthrough anyone remember using the slide move more than twice 
it was super short too  which wasnt a problem in luna nights due to the perfect gameplay mechanics but here it was a major letdown to me

its still a beautiful looking game and a fun little metroidvania for the most part it just didnt end up the way i thought it would left a lot to be desired and simply felt like a not well made end product with most of its qualities being all over the place i guess  anyways i still think it deserves a positive rating for the things it does right and i hope it can be a doorway to the lodoss franchise to other people just like it was for me

original stage 1 early access review
h3a great promising metroidvania based on a lovely seriesh3

and wow what a little big surprise and a promising one
bdeedlit in wonder labyrinthb is another metroidvania made by team ladybug who were also responsible for awesome titles like bshin megami tensei synchronicity prologueb and btouhou luna nightsb all made in the same engine and like them this one is also a kind of a fan game on steroids it was inspired by bthe record of lodoss warb a traditional tabletop rpg system that is quite known in japan and amongst other things spawned some small and excellent animated series in the 90s from which this game takes great influence in its narrative specially by depicting some of the relationships between characters it is not obligatory for you to know the animes story beforehand since the focus here is clearly on the gameplay department but i feel that doing so will make some little details in the storytelling more enjoyable

that being said id like to emphasize this game is at this moment ionlyi a bpromisingb surprise since its still in its early development stage and what we have here at early access is only the first area of the map with only two boss fights spoilerof course as of the original writing of this review team ladybug is gradually releasing more and more bits of the game as the early access goes onspoiler but if im coming here to give my positive rating is not only because im already acquainted with the developers works but also to make clear that you can feel through this wee 1 hour of gameplay how amazing it truly is and will be and i say get it now and guarantee your copy of the final game asap

in this game we control deedlit an elf girl that suddenly awakes in a mysterious place and have to find the way out of there by herself we are then presented to an extremely fluid and free gameplay beautiful animations very reminiscing of icastlevania symphony of the nighti and a very captivating main character deed starts only with her sword but soon becomes able to wield different kinds of weapons also having secondary access to her bow which is greatly used for puzzle segments and ranged attacks against some enemies youll find safer to stay far away from like in the anime deed is capable of controlling fairies which act like some sort of nature spirits that grant her not only different progressionmovement abilities but also give her elemental protection for example if i have salamander equipped i wont be hurt by firebased attacks as you defeat enemies and break certain objects youll also collect blue cubes that can regenerate deeds hp after a certain amount and red cubes which can be stacked up to three levels increasing deeds attack power  but if you are hit by some enemy you lose some of these cubes and your attack weakens again which i found to be a great incentive for the player to really git gud and be constantly aware of the environment critically analyzing everything
right now as i said the game delivers only two boss fights but they work really well to show the amount of challenge that the game will provide in the future the fights are quite challenging and reward the player for their quick reflexes and the aforementioned critical thinking

well my critique until now only consisted of positive stuff but i wanted to point out some aspects that in my opinion leave a bit more to desire even with the game running on the same engine as the earlier team ladybugs games i think it feels a little bit itooi similar to them in many aspects i believe it would be wise to think about the possibility of changing some sound effects and the font used in the games menus
i think this may be more or less a thing about the identity behind the games made by them but i also think that these sound and visual effects like the font make the game kind of too much gamey and i believe that a work based on the record of lodoss war would be greatly benefited by a different treatment
ah and i also think that the backdash animation should be more detailed as well

for now this is it it is a little game that is already telling us it will be a great one im glad to have picked it up right now and for being part of this step in the early access thing i leave here at least for now my absolute recommendation 

ah and a little message for you beautiful folks at team ladybug bpleaseb i beg you can you make this game at leat twice as bigger as touhou luna nights bpleaseb it was one of the best metroidvanias i played but it was so short please pretty please 

#####

this is yet another pixel art metroidvania from krobonteam ladybug this developer usually works out a deal with an ip holder and makes a short but bombastic metroidvania with great art and music so far theyve made urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvexvq01fqwjkshin megami tensei synchronicity prologueurl urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtjupcb_midwkonosuba the resurrection of beldiaurl urlstoresteampoweredcomapp851100touhou luna nightsurl and now this this game is very similar to touhou luna nights in particular just with a coat of record of lodoss war paint and a different gameplay gimmick urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp253750ikarugaikarugaurl like polarity switching instead of time stopping even the ui and many animations are very similar the progression is likewise largely gated by color coded doorskeys instead of relying on abilities

another obvious inspiration is bcastlevania symphony of the nightb many of deedlits animations are directly patterned over alucard in particular her walk cycle and how she swings swords and all the cloak stuff and just like in castlevania you get a large selection of weapons such as longswords greatswords clubs spears daggers boomerangs etc and then your second weapon slot is the bow resulting in a gameplay loop similar to urlstoresteampoweredcomapp428550momodora reverie under the moonlighturl however unlike momodora your bow shots cannot be charged you can aim updown instead and theres also a ricochet mechanic allowing for some simple puzzles the third and last gear slot is for spells they arent terribly interesting and youll probably end up spamming the very first spell for the whole game as it has great tracking and a very good damage output to mana usage ratio

if youve never played ikaruga the polarity thing is basically switching between two elements bluewind and orangefire in this case to guard against projectiles and target enemy weaknesses other games that used a similar mechanic are urlstoresteampoweredcomapp305050outlandurl and urlstoresteampoweredcomapp220440dmc devil may cryurl off the top of my head it adds decent variety and spells and some bows can override it with other elements if you dont feel like switching all the time

now for the bad stuff
 the game is very short only a little over 5 hours if you dont farm enemy drops and theres no side content whatsoever no optional quests or secret bosses
 very little challenge enemies are very passive 95 of the time you can kill them before they do anything at all bosses arent that well designed either their patterns are all over the place and they attack with little telegraphing but you deal so much damage it doesnt really matter
 the story is largely nonsensical and just an excuse to give spotlight to as many licensed characters as possible if youre not a hardcore fan of record of lodoss war it will make very little sense as the game doesnt bother introducing anyone

but even so i still feel the game is worth playing its beautiful fast paced and very polished if you want more of touhou luna nights or just enjoy krobons work in general then this is a nobrainer

h1 introduction h1
record of lodoss wardeedlit in wonder labyrinth is a 2d style metroidvania game based on record of the lodoss war while it is short in its current state it is a game that shows a lot of promise and leaves the player wanting more it features dual mechanics that allow the player to switch types of spirits on the fly to negate damage move through the terrain and more

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2023354757

the music in the game is enjoyable to hear and its gameplay is addictive a lot of fun to play players can get different weapons and swap through them so the game offers a lot of adaptability on the player part knowing how to deal with a situation will either reward you or make it easier to deal with it

with its story being enveloped in mystery and the current state of the game there is not a lot to say about it you wake up in a forest and must wander the world to discover what happened and why are you there the game has a lot of quality into it and if further upgrades manage to keep that quality intact the game will be a gem for sure

h1 gameplay h1
the gameplay in deedlit in wonder labyrinth is well done i love how they use the dual mechanic in most aspects of the game this is a mechanic that i had previously seen in ikaruga and it keeps the game fresh in this game it is used to explore the world and deal with enemies but also put the players reaction to the test as bosses will alternate between both types of attacks and change their patterns  as of now these two types are known as wind and fire wind allows you to float in the air which is very useful for exploring the map and getting to inaccessible areas fire in contrast is more about increasing your damage

these types revolve around the spirits beings that will assist deelit in her adventure in many ways they have levels from 1 to 3 and when they reach lv 3 they can regenerate deedlit hp this is good because it allows the player to keep exploring without sidetracking to a checkpoint but at the same time it can make the difficulty trivial when it comes to exploring if it is not taken care of properly  deedlit can level up as well and to my knowledge there is not a set limit so far leveling itself doesnt grant abilities but does increase her hp and stats defeating enemies can make them drop their weapons which deedlit can then use or sell

weapons are an important part of the game as they can offer better solutions to problems for example some enemies are disguised as doors while you could just slice them with your rapier the game does give you the option to use a halberd with a longer reach thus making it easier to deal with them it doesnt force it but adds a layer of gameplay in which knowing how to properly use your arsenal can have an effect on how you approach different encounters

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2023356181

i would like to see the developer push this aspect more do not force players to use certain weapons but do give them more reason to use different ones during the game

regarding the bosses which so far are two they are great the first one is more of an introduction to what these encounters could play as while the second one is more of a challenge the only weakness i had found here is that they are particularly weak to magic the player can just spend all their mana into magic defeat them with no effort and then go back to the checkpoints to regenerate it i think a good fix would be to make bosses more resistant to it or make mana consumption even higher

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2023355403

apart from that facing them in melee with no magic is pretty fun they have patterns that evolve as their hp gets lower and is all about reaction and timing know when to dodge and when to strike to face them off they are a spectacle to fight as they move through the screen quickly and force the player to learn the fight to beat them

h1 notes h1
the game runs flawlessly on a gtx 1060 and the requirements are pretty low most if not all machines will be able to run this without an issue the blurring effect can be a bit annoying at times so maybe there could be a better way to deliver that into the game it is not too bad as you can get used to it but the first few times and sometimes it can be a bit bothersome 

h1 conclusion h1
the game has potential my greatest let down is that it is too short and i find myself wanting much more if you buy the game now do head the first line of this review it is very short but shows a lot of promise

#####

wow team ladybug is quickly becoming one of my favorite metroidvania developers  having finished touhou i decided to give this a try next as much as i enjoyed touhou they improved upon almost every aspect of game play the movement is much more fluid and precise  the sprites are large and amazingly detailed and i absolutely love the music and sound effects very retro inspired  i definitely got sotn and bloodstained vibes off this

as others have said this game is also on the shorter side like touhou however there is so much content packed into it you almost dont notice  tons of spells swords bows and new abilities to discover and many bosses  if youre a fan of boss battles in metroidvanias then deedlit in wonder labyrinth will not disappoint while not as difficult as some of the latter bosses in touhou they are still challenging so be prepared to die a few times before mastering their patterns

besides the length of the game i really cant find much wrong with it i enjoyed it all around although i have never seen the anime its based upon im sure this would be an additional treat for fans as there are lots of cameos from different characters however the game definitely stands on its own and doesnt require knowledge of the series again kudos to the developers for a job well done

#####

dont let the negative review fool you this is a solid game i just would not recommend it generally

likely my own fault for not doing research but if youre looking for a big metroidvania to sink your teeth into look elsewhere this game is well made and clearly a dedicated love letter to the genre but its quite short ive completed the game in about 4 and a half hours and im not particularly compelled to play any more  and this is while backtracking and making sure i went to all of the nonhidden rooms at the very least

nothing inherently wrong with that just know what youre getting into when you by this game the gameplay is solid but theres quite little depth as far as equipment and stats like there is in many other metroidvanias you get two weapons and thats it and generally theres not much reason to use anything except whatever gives you the highest damage number  which the game tends to hand you an upgrade on a silver platter every area 

the game is quite linear for a metroidvania backtracking is only necessary for additional bonus upgrades all progression items will be found in the area where you need them again nothing wrong with that and i see the appeal from an accessability standpoint again just wanting to clarify that if youre looking for a truly classic metroidvania experience this game is not what you want

it can also be a bit difficult to trudge through sometimes because the story is told in a very uncompelling way all of the characters speak only in riddles and then run off and it only makes sense at the very very end it is a good story in the end and in hindsight i can appreciate the storytelling but finding a reason to stay invested during the actual game can be very difficult

again i cannot stress enough that i do think this is a good game  just quite difficult to reccomend its a bit too simple for hardcore metroidvania fans but a bit too complex for anyone new at least from my perspective if you want
a short digestable metroidvania
not needing to think too much about equipment optimization
not needing to worry if you missed an important progression item
a story that youre comfortable sitting through lulls in exchange for a satisfying payoff
then i think you would absolutely love this game for me personally i really find myself wanting more out of it though if you want solid reasons to explore the whole castle diverse upgrades and incentives to replay the game look elsewhere the beautiful spritework and animations just dont do enough to make up for it for me 

also it has one of the most egregiously boring boss gauntlets at the end of the game ive ever had the displeasure of sitting through not a great look coming in right before the finale but it is what it is

#####

lets compare two games clearly inspired by castlevania symphony of the night

a bloodstained rotn rotn for short
b deedlit in wl wl for short

symphony of the night is for sure in my top 15 games of all time without a single doubt

now rotn in my honest opinion was the wrong route to take after sotn instead of perfecting the gameplay refining the flaws improving on the presentation they instead highlighted the negatives the presentation has no style which will absolutely age horribly in a couple of years it already looks worse than sotn it is featurecrept up the butt with craftinggrindingloooooooooooooooong rooms with slow gameplay and a story that is so laughably predictable and boring that its biggest sin is the games emphasis on it

now i enjoyed rotn i am mainly highlighting the stuff i didnt like in that game because i felt like it was such unnecessary stuff to add in a game like sotn 20 or so years to theorycraft a great sequel and instead the game feels like a step back

now wl where do i begin lets tackle its weakness first wl is short really really short compared to sotn and especially rotn you are going to breeze through this game but that is a potential weakness for you not for me fam

the pacing of this game is so tight that you will enjoy every single second of it comparing it to rotn this game is a 4th of its length if even that but in rotn you will be counting the hours you have until finally getting it overwith while rotn overstays its welcome by a long mile this game shows that shorter experiences can have a far better impact on the player

now that we got the weakness out of the way let me speedrun of the positives for you

1 the music is fantastic
2 the visuals are stunning and stylized compared to rotn this game will not age a day decades from now
3 the story is intriguing yet not intrusive  the presentation is laid out quite quickly and it does not kill the pace of the game in the slightest
4 the map is very straightforward and a lot of the mental map is diminished as the ingame map highlights doors that are locked for you
5 the gameplay is very similar to sotn and rotn but they added 8 directional attacks god bless

just pick this game up

#####

warning  if youre photosensitive stay away  there are a number of flashing cutscenes and transition effects that cannot be turned off or disabled  at the end is a series of flashes that are painful to watch even without being photosensitive

another very solid metroidvanialite from team ladybug who made the wonderful touhou luna nights a few years ago  like their previous game this is a lite form of the genre where you have the game broken up into stages while still being interconnected and it is much more linear than some of the other examples of the genre  each stage after the first contains one major progression ability two bosses and a scattering of other upgrades spells and weapons lying around

movement and combat feel amazing it is super fluid and satisfying to move around  the different abilities mesh well and can be used for both platforming and combat segments  there is a lot of enemy variety in each stage and bosses for the most part are well designed and distinctive  a few of the late midgame bosses feel a bit samey but the quality of the others greatly outweights it  there is a late game boss rush which is intense and extremely fun

like touhou luna nights there is a bit of bullet hell inspiration in the boss fights  this time the inspiration is the game ikaruga  shortly into the game youll gain the ability to switch between wind and fire attunements  while in fire attunement fire attacks will regenerate your mp instead of doing damage  likewise for wind  switching attunements is a key method of progression and surviving boss fights with one of the chapter 2 bosses being the peak of this mechanic

the artwork works well the sprites are beautifully done and well animated and aside from the flashing the visual effects are good  there are a lot of sounds reused from luna nights though most of them work well here  the level 3 sound clip makes me feel like its on and is very satisfying even if a bit repetitive  music is good but not quite as memorable as luna nights soundtrack

strongly recommended to anyone who likes the more vania side of metroidvania and dont mind the slightly more linear structure

#####

this is my favourite game of 2020

ah yes boomer anime and castlevania sign me up
jokes aside this game is not only polished to an insane level but it plays very well to be honest i think i enjoyed it even more than bloodstained and sotn especially in regards to boss battles

the main feature of wonder labyrinth is its primary game mechanic where youre constantly switching between two elemental familiars who you are constantly levelling up to a maximum of 3 over and over these familiars will impact the damage you deal and the damage you take if you have the water familiar you wont be able to pierce a water enemy as with fire but a water familiar would allow you to damage a fire enemy and vice versa its super simple but adds an array of depth to the already tried and tested metroidvania formula its akin to the shards from bloodstained or the glyphs in ecclesia but theres only two instead of finding the best utility for the wide range its about mastering the exact two

this quality over quantity aspect adds a lot more depth than first expected with an 18 aud purchase and about two stages i really wasnt expecting much but holy shit man just how much fun this main mechanic is really does pay for the entire game

in addition ranged combat is slightly tweaked now used for various arrow puzzles which can be pretty fun and rewarding
the melee combat is also quite familiar however as stated prior its the addition of familiars that gives it fresh air no matter how much castlevania youve played

the game is quite short as of now but its a wonderful experience bound to get better one of my main issues and one ive heard from many is that sotns bosses are just way too easy for the most part pretty happy to say that even when youre cheesing it out here the familiar mechanic is designed to always keep you on your toes theres no shield rod spam you have to play smart and play well the final boss was incredibly tense even if it wasnt because of constantly being on the brink of death but its that if i made one mistake in my familiar switching id be punished to shit the difficulty is far from artificial you arent scared of the fact that you have taken damage from something you couldnt help youre scared to screw up on your own and take that damage again its just how amazing the main mechanic is that causes all of this

of note i played this game on an xbox 360 and ps4 controller it was pretty solid for both 360 i believe was supported from the get go but it took me a bit of mapping for the ps4 

if youre a fan of lodoss war buy it game pays incredible respect
if youre a fan of metroidvanias buy it
if you just like really nice polished video games in general buy it its short right now but itll only get better



#####

its symphony of the night with the polarity system from ikaruga if that sounds interesting to you then you wont regret giving this metroidvania a try

#####

a very well put together metroidvania everything ran  played smooth you can definitely tell someone at the studio actually cared about record of lodoss war and it shows if youve ever read any of the books or have seen the og anime or just love well done metroidvanias play it you wont be sorry

#####

the game plays largely like a standard metroidvania with 2d platforming and stat management being of primary importance you leap from place to place killing enemies solving puzzles and progressing the story along the way youll obtain various weapons some dropped by enemies and others obtained from allies and altars youll also encounter magical spirits like sylphs salamanders and will o wisps all of which augment deedlits skillset sylph for example allows deedlit to jump higher float over water and otherwise become lightofbody meanwhile salamander grants you the power to blow up explosives and walk through fiery hazards in some cases youll even need to switch between several spirits in order to pass through obstacles such as intertwining elemental chains that demand you swap wind for fire on the fly

deedlit in wonder labyrinth captures the spirit of 1990sera sidescrolling action while tweaking the formula just enough to feel unique the games linearity and map design is a bit disappointing as is the lack of unlockable content but wonder labyrinth has solid gameplay and gorgeous visuals that are well worth checking out if youre a genre fan

#####

more like a tech demo of really really wonderful pixel graphics and animations rather than actual game the exploration in this mertroidvania is next to nonexistent the boss order is set in stone no optional ones or changing the order you follow linear path with some branches that hide upgrades fight the boss move to the next linear path with branches
normal game is incredibly easy due to constant hp regen and magic spam personally i think i died like 5 times in total most of the bosses including final one were killed on first try
100 all achievements took about 6 hours so dont get this game unless on heavy sale at least 50 andor you are big fan of the source material
i still recommend it because i miss times in video games where enemies frikkin explode on death like in old nessnes era konami games and this game reminded me of how fun that is

#####

when the fuck is konami going to realize this is what we want of a castlevania game its a refresher to play a good metroidvania style game 1010

#####

record of lodos war was the first anime i ever watched and as such has a special place in my heart and this game brought me back right were it all started for me the nostalgic feeling and my love for deedlit as a character she was my first anime crush p was the reason i bought this game and it was worth it sadly it was short and realy easy but it was great and in my opinion a perfect ending for the story of parn and the anime i loved as a child

#####

a stellar metroidvania reminiscent of icastlevania symphony of the nighti with a polarityswitching mechanic similar to games such as iikarugai and especially isilhouette miragei its the kind of game that simply feels addicting to play

newcomers to the series probably wont get much out of the story or characters but oldschool irecord of lodoss wari fans will definitely have some heartstrings tugged by the time the credits start rolling

highly recommended

why the fuck do i always have to write a review cant i just recommend a game without having to write something

#####

its like castlevania symphony of the night but instead of playing as a handsome femboy vapmire you play as cute elf girl instead

#####

symphony of the night at home

#####

overall i found this metroidvania to be solid i dont have anything special to say about it so ill highlight a few things i liked and didnt like during my playthrough

lets start with the positive aspects one of the enjoyable features is the ability to switch between fire and wind affinity to exploit enemy weaknesses its even more fun because you become immune to the element youre currently attuned to the only downside is that the game only offers two elemental forms so if you come across an enemy weak to the earth element you better hope youve already found the earth spell otherwise youll have to make do with water or fire on top of that the pixel art is simply stunning and the games environments and characters are visually appealing

another cool thing about the game is the unique healing mechanic it rewards you for avoiding damage for a while which coincides with the main way to heal i havent seen this kind of mechanic in many other games and i think more games should try something similar if you hit or kill enemies enough you gain experience points for the element you didnt use when that element reaches level 3 the maximum you slowly regenerate hp when using it but if you get hit the element youre using loses one level essentially youre rewarded with some passive healing for playing well

now lets talk about the aspects that didnt sit well with me some of the challenges and achievements felt poorly designed for example the bow challenge didnt actually reward me for aiming well it was more about memorizing patterns and finding the best shooting angles as the targets and obstacles always had the exact same movement patterns additionally the achievement to acquire all weapons required me to own all weapons at the same time so i had to farm money and buy back some i sold thinking i just needed a full weapon log it became more annoying than fun to farm weapons from enemies and it took a while due to the reliance on lucky drops

lastly i must mention that the game is quite short my total playtime was around 7 hours but i estimate that the actual gameplay was closer to 4 hours the remaining 3 hours were spent farming weapons doing the archery range and similar activities i only played the boss rush mode once achieved an s rank and didnt feel the need to revisit it considering the price of 1679 i found the amount of content to be lacking compared to other games like hollow knight which is priced at 15 and offers a much longer and more fulfilling experience

to sum it up if youre looking for a decent metroidvania game that can scratch that itch after playing toptier titles like hollow knight blasphemous or bloodstained this game might do the trick it has its positives like the elemental mechanics and gorgeous pixel art but it also has flaws such as poorly designed challenges and a relatively short gameplay length

#####

let me keep it short

for old lodoss fans who know the classic anime series about parn deedlit and their party its going to be a trip down memory lane  but a very well made one lots of references to old events etc there are even some hints at the manga series chronicles of flaim

the story is simple but very well made but it takes a long time in order to make sense unexpectedly touching and emotional storytelling

now about the gameplay aspects
its a classic metroidvania its not a copy of castlevania symphony of the night although naturally it has many similiarities due to being a game of the same genre

 rather big map
 many weapons that can be categorized in big 180 weapons classic mid range swordsspears and short ranged weapons they feel mostly the same
 very intuitive and unique magic battle system
deedlit switches between fire and wind magic making her immune against attacks of the same element this element switching is used for platforming parts but naturally also fights and naturally boss fights
 beautiful sprite graphics and animations
 very lodossish soundtrack there are no headbangers like in symphony of the night but the music fits the game very well
 about 56 hours of playtime if you really want to find most goodies


overall i would wholeheartedly recommend to lodoss fans metroidvania fans should definitely give it a try too
i really wouldnt mind playing more well made metroidvania and especially lodoss games of this quality level d

#####

very short but very sweet game great style and graphics nice character design and animations fluid and intuitive gameplay and smooth controls vast selection of weapons magic and skills are keeping gameplay very interesting closer to the end it becomes much harder but not impossible story is kinda there but i think if you watched original anime you may have your moment i personally didnt watch anime so cant say for sure but after this game im sure gonna d if you want fast and cool metroidvania definitely buy this game

#####

hey  you got your ikaruga in my symphony of the night

record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a fun little game very obviously inspired by castlevania symphony of the night but throwing in enough new material to not be original but at least not feel stale

if youre familiar with metroidvanias as a genre there isnt much to add in terms of the gameplay here  its a bit more linear than most with the whole castle being traversable but still clearly divided into stages even with a scene transition preceding each one  what sets it apart is deedlits spirits  she can switch between sylph and salamander with some enemies being weaker to one than the other and deedlit herself being able to absorb attacks of the element shes currently attuned to  absorbing attacks helps to refill mp which regenerates anyway but absorption refills it much faster

storywise youre likely to get a lot more out of it if youre already familiar with the record of lodoss war story and characters  while its very clear that the main character is dealing with loss and an inability to accept that loss youll feel a lot more for her if you know just who deedlit parn ghim etoh slayn woodchuck and all of the other characters are

dont expect the game to take a long time to complete  my first playthrough visiting every corner of the map took me under 8 hours  but it was an enjoyable experience and id recommend it if you want a more easygoing metroidvania adventure

#####

after playing the surprisingly large amount that is currently in the early access game about two chapters of content i can positively say this game shows a large amount of promise it screams that late 90s early 2000 castlevania vibe from the gameplay feel to the graphic sound design to even the start screen the moment you start the game if you grew up with symphony of the night to dawn of sorrow you will quickly feel at home this game not only capturing but enhancing and polishing what the before mentioned games set as a precedent outside of the similarities however this game adds quite a bit of fun to the mix giving your character more mobility and options in how puzzles and platforming are completed with its spirit power ups 

overall i would say that for an early access game at the time of this review record of lodoss wardeedlit in wonder labyrinth shows a large amount of polish and attention to detail to the level that if not made aware of its current incompletion  you would feel that it is already a finished game  a honestly refreshing change of pace in comparison to most early access titles on steam

i would highly recommend this to not only people who have played games similar to this one but also people new to the game style this game pays careful attention to its difficulty finding a great balance for new players to get to grips and for older players to jump right into the fun 

in lieu of giving an arbitrary rating i think ill simply say that i am going to be paying as close close attention to the goings on of this game as i can and as soon as this game hits its completion i will be jumping straight back into its wonderful fantasy world

#####

a new quality bar for metroidvania games

#####

a certain ps1 platformer but youre playing as a debatably prettier elf girl instead of backwards dracula

real talk though this game is scratching a lot of itches and it pains me that it only has maybe an hours worth of content everyones going to compare it to symphony of the night but i think thats only one of many inspirations outside of the obvious record of lodoss war it has little sprinklings of games like cave story outland metroid and hollow knight as well and those are the icing on top of this admittedly familiar cake the combat and puzzles are simple but really well implemented the bosses are great too and it turned me on to a great anime series from the 90s that i had zero idea about until now imagine that you never heard of dragon ball until seeing the release of dbz kakarot thats how i feel

i legitimately cannot wait for more a introduction i hope the whole game is this good as it with bloodstaineds level of content is approaching the perfect metroidvania

#####

i really loved this game everything about it the graphics music gameplay
the difficulty was just right not too hard really but just enough to be engaging and enjoyable

100 recommend if you enjoy metroidvania games

#####

im partial to elf ladies and i like oldfashioned metroidvanias so of course i enjoyed this one a lot

#####

im a fan of both record of lodoss war anime and sotn this game delivers to fans of either

#####

very fun game symphony of the night gameplay with a twist of one of my all time favorite anime cant like it enough

#####

very reminiscent of symphony of the night in the best of ways solid metroidvania title 1010 would recommend

#####

pros
awesome pixelart
castlevania sotn alucard sprite animations
delightfully retro sound
boss fights play and look awesome 
ikarugastyle element change for immunity
mix of longrange melee and special attacks
variety of weapons 
easy but stylish bow puzzles
the game is lightweight 100mb due to being a demo

cons
short its a demo basically little less than 1 hour
some enemies lack windup animation before attack
a lot of weak enemies that are more annoying than challenging
lacks innovation aside from the bow 
almost a reskin of sotn
no secrets

bottom line
buy only if you really dig the stylesotnlodoss wardeedlit this is a demo
should be free and advertised as a demo 
will recommend due to polish and the fact it i had fun and shows much promise

#####

great metroidvania but a little bit on the shorter side
if you liked castlevania sotn this game might be for you

what i liked
great artstylepixel gfx
combat is tight
spell system
element system

what i didnt like
the characters are well established in some animemanga
 i guess so they arent fleshed out for you at all if you are coming to this without knowing it
story would be much more interesting if youd know the source material


combat can be hard at times but there are ways to cheese the game
if you think the game is too hard just buy a 2 handed great sword that has a much greater reach even if it has lower atk and just buy potionsmp crystals at first i thought i needed to save my money for weapons later on but it turned out that it wasnt that important

all in all an enjoyable experience

#####

criminally underrated metroidvania banger music fantastic art and really cool boss fights the sheer variety of enemies kept me engaged the entire game the elemental and bow mechanics make this game worth playing

#####

it scratches the symphony of the night itch

#####

i am a longtime fan of record of lodoss war my father owning the box set dvd of the series and i am new to metroidvania games metroid samus returns being my introduction to the style just over two years ago if you are a fan of either i think that this game is a very promising grab its charming and very well detailed artistically the game play feels good though i had to change my keybinding around who cares they gave us the option for a reason with bosses being sort of hard at the start as you familiarize yourself with the spirit mechanics but definitely becoming easier and easier the further you get into the game this game took me 25 hours to finish as it is early access and only 2 stages but i enjoyed every second of it even as i was lost in the labyrinth desperately wishing there was a double jump mechanic in the game before finding the power up in a nook i had ignored and then rushing down the end of the game honestly my only gripe is that as it stands the final boss experience was super underwhelming for those who have watched record of lodoss war youll get it for those who have not you probably will still get it but not the same way yknow 

tldr this game is super good and i think people should give it a shot but it is a 13 dollar demo right now grab it while its hot or wait for it to fully release in a few months and grab it then but dont pass it up if youre interested itll be worth every penny

#####

very tight controls plays like an updated version of sotn and even though there are only 4 levels made currently im still not finished at 32 hours very worth the purchase

#####

finally a legit pixelvania game it is a breath of fresh air seeing as how everyone else is using those weird rotational based 2d characters instead of classic pixel art

#####

overall b
normally in reviews i like to start with a bit of a preamble but since this game is so obscure and my review might affect someone buying decision this game is really good it is a fantastically constructed metroidvania though leaning far more on the castlevania side whose short length and relatively easy difficulty makes it a great choice for those wanting to get into the genre with fantastic visuals and surprisingly catchy music there is little not to recommend about the gameother than the absolutely horrendous name which i have to look up every time i want to mention it to someone 
	
with that out of the way lets talk about the game in more detail firstly this game takes heavy inspiration from symphony of the night and all of its bastard children in terms of aesthetic direction and general game feel despite this record of lodoss war has enough fresh ideas to keep things interesting most notably it features two swappable spirits one red the other blue to change some basic properties about the main character and absorb incoming attacks of the same type the red spirit controls fire and the blue wind some enemies are weak to one or might resist the other so switching becomes important or it would but despite every enemy in the game having some amount of elemental weakness having attacks of any other type than fire and wind is uncommon the only good way to get attacks of all the element types is to hunt down the optional magic spells for the record magic is absurdly overpoweredespecially against bosses having the right spell can almost invalidate the bosses in the game and break any remaining difficulty the element system overall is woefully underutilized since changing your attacks element isnt easy for large sections of the game it also uses the faces of a die to represent weakness and resistance for no good reason maybe dice play a big part in the franchise but i cant be bothered to go down a wikipedia rabbit hole right now
	
this is not a challenging game if you play games mainly to overcome trials this simply isnt the game for you the joy of this game comes from how enjoyable moving about the world is and the very tangible sense of progression new more powerful weapons get handed down frequently and the primal joy of seeing number go up feels great when exploring the world the locals are different enough to give a sense of progression but they fall back on typical location tropes 
	
overall the game grabbed me and hooked me in until the end it is a thoroughly enjoyable game with wonderful visuals if you like metroidvanias you should absolutely give it a shot while i dont think this game will be on my mind in a month the short time it had my attention it did so fully 


#####

this was a pretty decent metroidvania but hard to recommend as there are plenty of better games in the genre for one the game is pretty linear in design for a mv backtracking to earlier areas just nets you a new spell or healthmp upgrade at best you wont discover big new areas by teleporting to earlier stages 

the games flow is pretty tight because of this but i got tired of the games central mechanic pretty fast which is the ikarugastyle blueorange dynamic where you absorb damage if you switch to the correct color in time in reverse you can only damage certain enemiesbosses if you switch to the right color im not a fan of that and the entire game kind of revolves around it so the game never fully clicked for me even tho i can see why it would for many

#####

the game already show great potential great pixelart and animations nice soundtrack and smooth gameplay so far specially changing between familiars to overcome obstacles and foes really looking forward to the full release

#####

first off i would say this is the best metroidvania ive ever played ive cleared this twice now gathering all of the secret rooms and taking in every aspect of this game i grew up playing return of samus and have done dozens of 100 clears of super metroid as well as spent 100s of hours playing sotn deedlit in wonder labyrinth is very much a polished sotn with a unique take on movement and abilities i love it and cannot wait to get my hands on stage 3 and beyond the game so far is short sure but its so fun if you are into metroidvanias get this game

#####

okay story time a couple of decades ago i was a writer for a dreamcast games review site and magazine  the record of lodoss war videogame had come out and as an anime fan and reviewer i was given the task of reviewing it  i shot it down because it felt like a generic game with a lodoss skin on it  i got savaged for that review

i think two decades later ive been vindicated  this in my opinion is what a lodoss game should be a metroidvania adventure reflecting both the feel of the genre and lodoss as it truly should be  diwl is definitely a game to get if you are a fan of either and if youre a fan of both you have no reason to skip this especially as you watch this grow

now if i could just go back in time and hold this up as the example of what i meant

#####

know nothing of the anime but will certainly check it out at some point as for the game i really enjoyed it and i can already tell that from pirotesss sprite i will end up being a huge simp for her

#####

decent metroidvania game but lacking in content game modes and is easy to completely breeze through in 5 hours if youre used to this kind of game there are no difficulty modes and after beating the game you unlock a boss rush time attack mode

the graphics and music are excellent and control is solid has pretty fun boss fights and a polarity mechanic ala ikarugaoutland that functions well there are some very basic puzzles sprinkled throughout using only a couple gameplay mechanics these environmental puzzles never surprised me and kind of felt like a chore instead of something engaging

as a weak point the environments and level design feel a bit soullesspredictable and the world map doesnt convey a feeling of a cohesive whole progression is extremely linear  obvious kind of like metroid dread except more so you generally proceed to the next set of colorcoded doors that you unlocked with one or two exceptions 
these things make me question why this needed to be a metroidvania instead of a straightforward stagebased game like rondo of blood with more focused level design the game even refers to large areas as levels so maybe the direction was different at some point during development on top of that the stores around the map have mostly useless weapons by the time you have money for them money  healthmana upgrades dont feel significant

the game has a nice amount of control and graphics options for the user the menus and general ui are really smooth

im not familiar with the lodoss series but i got the impression this game doesnt really add much to the story  world its a tiny side story where perhaps only the opening and ending have any significance

lightly recommended if the game is on sale or you have interest in the lodoss series the game is a decent if super straightforward castlevania sotn clone with excellent presentation just dont expect it to have a lot of content a real sense of exploration or be a challenging action game
i wouldnt recommend this game at base price there is a lot of competition in the genre and at this price point you could most likely get another game with more fleshed out level design  content similarly for games with more rewarding action exploration or story experiences 

whats here is pretty good but nothing stands out apart from the clean presentation the level design and lack of difficulty modes is a main sticking point for me im all for short games if theyre tightly designed and encourage replaying
the movement mechanics are so typical that i dont feel incentivized to do a challengespeed run through the game after getting a hang of its mechanics itd be like any classic metroidvania since sotn except probably even less going on in movement the boss rush mode thats implemented does make sense but its a small bonus

#####

my goodness i had high hopes for this game before but this this
its freaking perfect with beautiful pixel graphics and smooth controls 
i know i know early access  but go get it anyway its worth it

#####

cortito pero bonito uno de los metroidvanias independientes más lindos de los últimos años gráficos preciosos con mucho detalle puesto en la animación música que no destaca pero que queda bien historia emotiva y más que nada jugabilidad frenética cambiando de poderes todo el tiempo muy muy muy bueno

#####

really good
this game is my first adventure game when i still didnt play each from adventure games in long time
i like this game and find interesting about it similar to the games of castlevania unfortunately the adventure game with 2d costs so expensive negative for me but 20 from the sale is fine
im happy playing with my ps4 controller is perfect just hard for first time but will be fine for me

its not done yet i like to keep playing 
i know this is the name from anime and manga pretty older 

#####

out of all the metroidvanias ive played in the last couple of decades and ive played a lot this one might be the most symphonyofthenightiest cant wait to play the rest of the game

wonder labyrinth really caught me off guard with how excellent it is very tight controls satisfying weapons very good enemy variety a surprisingly emotional story that subverted my expectations and some of the best pixel art ive seen in a while i stopped playing part way through to watch the original 1990 anime and it enhanced the experience even more for me though you can probably piece together the backstory even if you havent seen it
as a seasoned enjoyer of metroidvanias since i was a child wonder labyrinth is top tier in the genre

#####

if you are a fan of record of lodoss war and metroidvania just get this game you dont need to know more you want this game 

if you are just fan of metroidvania and dont know much about one of the best anime ever created id say that while wonder labyrinth isnt the best metroidvania out there it does everything proper it also got some nice original mechanics

one of them is the spirit system where you can switch between two elemental buff to exploit weaknesses on monsters each spirit can reach up to level 3 which boost the damage considerably and allow you to regenerate health however if you get it the spirit will go down one level it is very useful and interesting to play it

there are tons of spell and weapons and if you played games like symphony of the night most of them will feel familiar

so all and all gameplay wise it isnt the best but its a good one just get it also the art is very pretty especially the characters

finally if you are unaware of lodoss war its time for you to go watch it you wont regret it plus the game story would not make much sense to you without so just go give yourself a treat and watch it

around 8h of good metroidvania fun

1010
tldr  awesome game had a great time clearing it no complaints this is going on my fav game list would def recommend 

player sprite  very smooth and silky very reminiscent of alucard in castlevania sotn

combat  i was unsure at first since i hate it when games make you lose your powered up state when you take a hit but after i understood you have 2 power states that you ebbflow between if you take a hit i was totally into i love the dual element system in this i wish more games had this combat mechanic

difficulty  bosses are a good challenge and the difficulty curve as you progress thru the game is prefect
as long as you stay calm and remember all the battle mechanicstools youll be fine after a few solid tries 

story  good i was touched by the ending cried a little i never watched the original anime but that didnt make it any harder to follow i actually want to try and watch it now after beating this

overall  great experience no technical issues or bugs would definitely recommend if you like metroidvanias or like the original anime 

side note  ill mention this on the separately since i dont really fault the developers for this there are many colorcoded doors that you unlock on the map as your progress and i have partial color blindness so it was difficult at times to tell which doors to revisit i ended up spending time revisiting them all until i found the right one it wouldve been great if the devs couldve assigned a unique symbol in addition to the colors for the various doors probably wouldve helped me a bit again this is mostly my deficiency so wont blame the devs awesome game otherwise very satisfied

#####

great game play  took me 32 hours to get through the 4 stages  i am a bit worried about the length if it is supposed to be finished this spring

#####

very good spin on classic castlevania symphony of the night mechanics if you liked that youll like this at the current writing of this review the game says im at 61 map completion that means i should hit 100 around 6 hours at my current pace this might mean the game is kind of short

deedlit can equip a melee weapon and a bow there are a few different types of melee weapons and the majority feel the same to use all that really changes for most of them is their speed and damage there are some that are different like the twohanded swords and a boomerang i found at one point which was really fun to use the bows are mostly just upgrades of one another although some have extra effects such as shooting multiple arrows at once

theres an element switching mechanic reminiscent of ikaruga a shoot em up between air and fire and some enemies are weakresistant to various elements you also gain the resistance to whatever element you are currently using so if say an enemy shoots a fireball at you while you have the fire spirit swapped in you will absorb the damage

a bit more linear than other action adventure games ive played like this but im having tons of fun and i feel like the game was worth what i payed

#####

oldschool little metrovania style game set in new frame and ideas of gameplay this game draws a lot if inspiration from symphony of the night 32 bit sprite colours looks very beautiful in this labyrinth exploration game the music reminds you of early days 90s rpg games tons of weapons with newly implemented bow gun this makes game more agile and modified new spirit system made games combat even more unique and fun really enjoyed the game

#####

excellent metroidvania by the makers of touhou luna nights  a bit short but the innovative mechanics and overall beauty make up for it

dont forget to watch the anime including welcome to lodoss island

#####

it puzzles me how this game has such a high review score

tldr a short mediocre metroidvania game its not necessarily bad but it is boring to explore and does not really do anything interesting with the formula nor does it execute it particularly well looks great though

lets get good things out of the way
 the game is gorgeous amazing art great animations decent backgrounds
 music is kinda good but more on that later
 some game mechanics are genuinely good ikaruga style of switching element is great
 despite its shortcomings does not outstay its welcome  it is short enough to stay mildly enjoyable

now the reasons why i dont really recommend this game

the first and most important thing the thing i love the genre for sense of wonder and exploration it is just not present here the map is uninspired and boring to explore the variety of layouts is lacking a lot of similar rooms with the same backgrounds exploration is surprisingly unrewarding there is barely any point to it

combat is its there its present and functional most enemies take a lot of time to wind up their attacks so for the most part you can destroy them before they even do anything any damage you take throws you away across half of the screen staggers galore and after getting hit multiple times you get staggered for even longer as a result a single hit can easily result in game over some of the attacks are almost impossible to avoid so it makes sense to make the wind up longer it doesnt make the game any more exciting though bosses are a pleasant exception but they are few and far between as you would expect

story makes so little sense it seems intentional it is either very dependent on the player being aware of the setting characters and lore or the translation is bad most of the time i was as confused as the protagonist ending barely gives any answers

music just plays on the loop while you explore an area its generally not that bad but gets old eventually theres too much of it and the variety is lacking

the game is rather short but considering all the shortcomings its really not a bad thing it barely outstays its welcome 3 hours give or take are enough to complete it without obsessing too much about 100 it

#####

phenomenal metroidvania title that is a love letter to fans of the genre and lodoss both
ive played a ton of metroidvanias and can safely say this is up there with the greats
gameplay is airtight art style is beautiful and the story is minimalistic but well written and very touching
if any of these things appeal to you play this

#####

felt a little short despite map completion but partly because i didnt get lost and i didnt die much

im not very familiar with record of lodoss war i think ive only ever seen two episodes of the anime as it turns out familiarity with the series isnt very important every cutscene or bit of dialogue fairly quickly establishes deedlits attitude toward a given character so you get up to speed pretty fast

the central gameplay hook is deedlits ability to toggle between two elements very early in the game you unlock a wind state and a fire state and can swap between them at will this serves multiple functions immunity to damage from the matching element you actually gain mp in addition to blocking the damage the ability to infuse your weapon attacks with elemental damage useful against many enemies and mobility bonuses it gives certain parts of the game a bit of an ikaruga feel

as you defeat enemies or in the case of bosses simply land hits youll fill up a gauge which applies to your backburner element each element has a separate gauge powering it up and encouraging you to swap when you swap to an element with a maxed gauge youll get a slow refill on your health getting hit will reduce the gauge on your current element this feature massively improves survivability and makes the search for the next save point much less scary i was little thrown off in the early game as i had to get used to whether announcements about my level increasing pertained to my element gauge or my characters xp level which is a thing in this game

in addition to fire and wind there are five other elements represented water wood stone light and dark and each enemy in the game has varying weaknesses and resistances which will be displayed on screen when you attack in the majority of cases one or both of your elemental states will be reasonably effective but if you want to exploit a weakness that isnt fire or wind there are spells to discover as well as a few elemental weapons

you have two separate weapon attacks a melee weapon or in some cases a boomerang and a bow attack the bow requires a little bit of mp to use but it can be aimed before you release the button there are several doors that require trick shots to open and theres a pretty fun minigame designed to train your bow skills although i wish there was more variety in the training you can get new weapons by finding them in scripted locations on the map occasional enemy loot drops or by buying them from a vendor npc who pops up in several locations

ive never been a big fan of loading a metroidvania up with dozens of different lootablesalable weapons with different patterns or effective ranges and planned obsolescence via an attack stat i usually find one that i really like and stick with it only replacing it with a higherstat model of the same type in this game i prefer the swords with a big overhead swing because of the number of flyingoverhead enemies and the amount of climbing

one of the first things i noticed was the weird button configuration jumping is mapped to the east button and melee attack is mapped to the south button this felt clumsy to me at first and took a lot of getting usedto you can remap the controls but i decided to trust them but eventually it made sense as you use the north button for your bow and you can jump while aiming over the course of the game i did have several misjumps or accidental magic casts due to muscle memory but overall it wasnt too bad

the boss fights were hitormiss for me every boss room is essentially the same size but nearly all of the bosses themselves fit into two categories gigantic boss that mostly stands still but shoots at you or personsized boss who can outrun you and control the space and will charge at you fling stuff at you and generally fill the arena with chaotic crap 

the game is fairly generous with fasttravel points considering the size of the map itself and youre not really forced to backtrack much the map is pretty straightforward with where to go there are colorcoded locked doors and after the first few areas are filled in its usually pretty clear whether exploring in a given direction will lead to progress or itemsupgrades 

the pixel art and animations in this game are absolutely stellar idle animations knockback lighting environments deedlits twirl when she gets doublejump just chef kiss
the music is exciting and wellmade but doesnt really stick with you after you exit the game

zebra  10

#####

i absolutely adored touhou luna nights so i was all in after discovering another team ladybug metroidvania sadly tln is a better game in just about every way but rolw is still worth playing

starting with the positives the pixel art is done to a very good level  the animations are spectacular theres nothing truly memorable about the game aesthetically but the art is clean  never interferes with the gameplay in a negative manner

the gameplay is snappy  fluid with the two element system making for some interesting gameplay moments theres plenty of weaponry to find but the majority are simple statsticks with nothing really noteworthy about them spells are passable  mostly just seem to exist as hard counters to certain bosses none of them feel particularly meaningful to push outside of those few scenarios 

game difficulty is very low without some sort of selfimposed challenge i found several bosses to be comfortable oneshots  while it wasnt comfortable even the last boss died first attempt without the use of any potions a no magic replay might be an option  would undoubtedly offer a very tough challenge for those who fancied it but if youre the kind of person who just wants to get through the game as fast as possible using the tools at your disposal you might find yourself done in 4 hours

overall its not a bad game its just nowhere near the quality of ladybugs previous title tln  my overwhelming feeling having finished it is wondering what couldve been if the game just had that little bit more going on both mechanically  lengthwise id still recommend playing it if youve finished tln  find yourself wanting more but if youre yet to play anything by ladybug certainly start there first

#####

i greatly enjoyed this game but i guess thats not surprising given my love of both symphony of the night and record of lodoss war mangaanime  even without that nostalgia however i still feel like this short but sweet game stands on its own

my biggest knock against it is linearity  while they are interconnected into one map the game has bespoke stages  each area is completed in order and i didnt really feel like i was exploring a cohesive environment you can backtrack to other areas once you get abilitiesunlocks for weapons spells and some upgrades but its all optional  you can basically complete the game quickly going from stage to stage  some people complain about backtracking and exploring but for me it is a hallmark of the genre

thats really my only gripe with deedlit in wonder labyrinth  the pixel art is lovely  the soundtrack is really freaking good  i didnt find the length disappointing  i think it lasts just long enough to not overstay its welcome  being able to complete a game in a few sittings these days is a boon to me  i got full map completion in about 8 hours the quality of play for those 8 hours was consistently good so i felt good about my 20 spent  i really like this trend of short metroidvanias like this carrion momodora reverie under the moonlight timespinner and dandara

#####

a short and sweet metroidvania based off the 90s fantasy anime series players of symphony of the night will feel right at home and there are plenty of weapons and upgrades to collect the graphics are painstakingly detailed and deedlit looks amazing in motion definitely a game genre fans should add to their collection

#####

like symphony of the night but better im serious

#####

ideedlit in wonder labyrinthi is a decent lodossthemed action platformer at its core the game gets everything right movement feels nice combat is wellbalanced with interesting elemental mechanics and the boss encounters offer bit of moderate challenge the oldfashioned pixel graphics are quite nice with good animation work on the lead character and decent diversity in the environments and antagonists even the story is an intriguing take on the lodoss universe with many references to the series and a fulfilling conclusion

the main issue is that the whole thing seems to lack scope and ambition despite the metroidvania tag the game is essentially linear in nature rather short 57 hours and generally on the easier side with few secrets and virtually no side activites or sublplots as such it doesnt feel overpriced but sure leaves you wanting more and makes you wonder what the studio could do on a higher budget id love to see a more ambitious sequel in the future

#####

if you are looking for a metroidvania which is heavily inspired by sotn then consider this one you will undoubtedly have a wonderfull time with this game

it is short but i dont think this is a bad thing every minute spend with this game is quality and the game doesnt overstay its welcome

the movement is fluent gameplay is very similar to sotn but with more flow to it
ost is amazing as is the art

story is simple yet intriguing

heavily recommending this one

#####

strike while this game currently as of january 21 2021 is in early access this has been fantastic strike

as of april 1 2021 i have played the final release of the game to the ending i still think the game is fantastic albeit a bit short that a seasoned player may be able to complete the game in maybe 6  10 hours i am still confident i would recommend this to any metroidvania fans who want a little bit of a lite skill challenge

this is yet again another metroidvania from team ladybug that takes a lot of inspiration from symphony of the night but wrapped around the universe of record of lodoss war with deedlit as your protagonist

the music is well composed and gets you pumped to adventure around or prepared for a showdown with a boss

the pixel art is crisp well animated and silky smooth at 60 fps

the combat is unique that its rooted in symphony of the night but also theres an element of ikaruga too with the sylph and salamander spirits some enemies will respectively take more damage depending on what youre aligned with and deedlit can absorb matching projectiles to drain them for mp to use for devastating magic some boss fights will even have you doing some wild ikaruga style elemental spirit swapping madness too

if you are looking for a unique metroidvania game based in the universe of a very beloved 90s era anime do not pass this up if i didnt buy this in early access i still think the full price would be more than worth it

#####

another amazing game from team ladybug this time more in the vein of castlevania from the animations to the weapon system  the game is a blast to play absolutely gorgeous and surprisingly enough the story was more then i expected too  definitely a must for any fans of metroidvanias or the record of lodess war

#####

developed by the same people from touhou luna nights we should expects updates every 4 to 5 months right now this game feels a lot like a demo however with a lot of potential might wanna buy it now before the price rises

#####

really solid and fun

if you enjoy the metroid and castlevania symphony of the night combination then definitely give this one a try

you do not need to have watched the anime to follow along but it does help add context and emotional attachment to certain scenes

plays wonderfully in the steam deck

#####

short but pretty fun especially for lodoss fans

#####

so far so good  its sotn without a defensive gear system when it comes to equipment  i was wishing it did and i hope they can somehow input that for the final game even though i doubt they will  the floating option needs to be a bit more responsive overall very enjoyable metroidvania  only thing that sucks is waiting for the final product  this has a lot of potential

#####

captures the elegance in symphony of the night not a lot of metroidvanias do the feeling of controlling deedlit is amazing with awesome animations short and to the point i havent read record of lodoss war and i feel somehow that was a positive everything felt much more mysterious awesome atmosphere and music too luna night music was better though  but i just love touhou music i felt the environment and level design was better than luna nights though and everything is gorgeous

#####

a beautiful love letter to lodoss war and castlevania with their own game design spin too
deedlit is back and dealing with creatures from the lodoss world while having the prettiest sprites in the entirety of this platform

a must play if you like tough 2d bosses and metroidvaniaing
buscaçãozinha honesto

#####

short and sweet feels like a mix of symphony of the night and ikaruga nothing groundbreaking but the combat is satisfying platforming is fun the pixelart is great and its fun to explore
i want to nibble on deeds ears

#####

 as metroidvania style games go record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth checks all the right boxes the game feels very much like what one would expect from the genre lots of upgrades that make previous areas more accessible a need to revisit those areas challenging but fair boss encounters and so on

 because  rolw deedlit in wonder labyrinth is so similar to other games in the genre it would be easy to write it off as just another metroidvania that steals heavily from the titles it emulates what saves it from such an unkind fate is the interesting mechanic of switching between wind and fire elements
 while elemental switching is nothing new rolw deedlit in wonder labyrinth does a good job of implementing the feature in ways that are both interesting and intuitive for example i had some trouble with an early boss before realizing the attack that kept hitting me was actually unavoidable there was a trick to negating damage from the attack that is tied to the elemental shift ability once i figured it out the fight was maybe a little too easy but still very enjoyable
 being too easy is perhaps the one thing holding this title back from feeling like a true successor to symphony of the night which i have seen it compared to often while the elemental switching mechanic is excellent and makes for some really great feeling battles once mastered it does tend to make some encounters very easy of the bosses i faced in my play through only 2 required more than one attempt

 the art direction and graphical style here are well realized and beautiful if a little uninspired the sprites are highly detailed and colorful with a modern look while still envoking the feeling of classic 1632 bit era games they are also well animated with great timings and crisp responses from deedlit herself 
 the music and sound design feel like they were lifted straight from earlier games everything from attacks landing to magical effects feel familiar and welcome the music is far above average here too flirting with greatness even i look forward to the full release and what i hope will be a variety of compositions with even higher quality 

 another point worth noting is that the game is not yet complete and so far there is less than 2 hours of content something i did not realize when i purchased the game despite the unfinished state and easy boss encounters i would still recommend picking up rolw deedlit in wonder labyrinth on sale as someone who has a massive back log of games i am willing to let it join the rest until it is complete since what is here already is solid

 if you are unfamiliar with the source material record of lodoss war you may have a hard time understanding interactions between some characters and can stop reading now if you are a fan of the original anime series record of lodoss war you will want to keep reading

 as someone who loves the original lodoss war anime series i was hooked the moment i saw a character in a game who looked like deedlit then when i realized it is deedlit i bought the game i was expecting the worst to be honest i am glad i was wrong but the story here is far from complete so far it seems to be about deedlit traversing some other realm of reality or something on the one hand it is great to see the cast back from the original series but on the other they seem off i am guessing this will be explained later but for now just be aware that the old gang is represented here but they do not seem like themselves still running into old allies and enemies sure felt great and the game is clearly made for people who are familiar with the characters as they make no attempt to inform new players about the relationships between them  
 with some characters appearing here who really probably should not be it is clear that the story takes place after the first series but beyond that it is anyones guess and i look forward to seeing where it goes    



#####

imagine castlevania with ikaruga good idea but the game may be too easy different from ikaruga you absorb life instead of burst energy therefore you dont need potion once you are familiar with the enemies attack patterns you will be almost undefeatable this is especially the case in boss fights they always act in the same order

#####

i am going to give this a not recommendation though i wished there was a neutral option on steam 

being a fan of record of lodoss war is what attracted me to this but was a major let down what the game really amounts to is just castlevania symphony of the night with a record of lodoss war coat of paint in short it feels like you are paying for a mod rather than a full game most of the animations sprites etc appear exactly like symphony of the night with either a different color pallet or slight change to it game play mechanics are exactly like symphony of the night from how weapons function to the slide mechanic and even given you marias slide kick

as to a story it doesnt exist the game is about a personal revelation to deedlit and was easy to figure out within 30 minutes of the game

if you must buy this then get it as cheap as possible if you are wanting a metroidvaina style of game if you are wanting something that has an addition to the record of loddos war story skip this then as you will not get it

#####

i really enjoyed this game but i cannot in good faith give it a blanket recommendation as a long time fan of both the anime series lodoss war and the metroidvania genre i was the target audience of deedlit in wonder labyrinth and i was ultimately disappointed by it

the graphics are great featuring large beautifully made sprites with a lot of frames of fluid animation the music is evocative and driving nothing that will stick in your mind but keeping you in the moment the controls handle well and are properly customizable the story was confusing to a point but ultimately resolved well and was probably simple enough that even those who arent fans of the anime could enjoy it i think my confusion was mostly trying to place it in the existing lodoss story

switching between the fire and wind spirit the primary mechanic in the game was probably its strongest attribute and i would have loved to see it expanded much like ikaruga the idea is that your fire spirit absorbs fire attacks but also causes you to attack with fire so you have to keep switching to balance your offense and defense based on the enemies and obstacles around you the aspects that utilized this mechanic well were definitely my favorite parts of the game and i wish they had been expanded on

the metroidvania elements are where it starts to come up short the map is very small made worse by the extremely compact layout the large sprites and mostly unremarkable hallways make a lot of the screens go by quickly as well the design changes between the six stages werent terribly remarkable and the last stage was basically a set piece for the story with two boss fights with no meat to it no enemies no obstacles no puzzles

the rest of the game is similarly lacking in diverse and memorable the enemy sprites are great drawn straight out of the animemanga but the roster isnt especially robust even less so when you take palette swaps and other small changes into account the main collectibles in the game are weapons and spells that dont make the game play that differently so going back to find a secret room often left me with an underpowered weapon or a spell i might cast once or twice

the main premise of a metroidvania is the idea of gating off areas to encourage exploration and backtracking most of the areas of this game were gated off with colored doors or keys the few powers that were present included the omnipresent doublejump and waterbreathing along with a slide that felt like it could have been a core mechanic the way that the game handled its super jump was probably my favorite feature especially combined with the air spirits levitation ability

in the end i feel like this game would have benefited from more focus being put on the platforming rather than releasing a short watered down symphony of the night i would have loved to see more flavor and length to each stage more creative uses of the core mechanics and more challenging jumps puzzles and bosses i enjoyed the game while i was playing it but i wish there was more of it both in terms of length and depth

#####

good metroidvania but im downrating because this needs an epilepsy warning  theres a scene at the end that rapidly flashes darkbright colors and theres no mention of something like that happening when you load the game  will revise if devs ever address this

#####

best in the metroidvania genre ive played in a long time

#####

if you are old enough to remember the record of lodoss war  then you dont even need to think just get this game and sail through the nostalgia ocean once more 100 recommended for the title admirers

as for those who have no attachments to the franchise and just looking for a good metroidvania i can still recommend the game as long as you understand that this is a good but not the best metroidvania on the market its better than average sure but its not on the same level as ori or  the hollow knight

the only aspect that is definitely an stier about this game is bosses every single boss fight is beautiful memorable exciting and easy enough which is great for those of us who dont have the teens reaction speed anymore on average most bosses will take 13 attempts from an ordinary gamer the last one is a bch tho stock fully on hp and mana potions before engaging him

everything else is between an a to c tiers

enemy variety  atier many different opponents to play with you wont get bored with them

weapon variety  btier while there are many different weapons the truly unique ones are sparse while the rest have the same patterns and move sets

labyrinth layout  ctier well you have seen a similar layout countless times in like 90 of metroidvania games not much to talk about here 

music  between a and b tiers depending on your tastes each zone has its own melody and iv liked most of them

movement  btier mostly fluid and responsible but the dash works only backwards and is kinda unreliable while the forward one needs a flame spirit to be present and 2 buttons combo instead of 1 button i did not understand the devs reasoning behind that and in the end finished the game practically ignoring it

play time  between 6 to 8 hours depending on how fast you are for me personally this is definitely an stier i prefer shorter games rather than artificially inflated ones but for those who measure a games worth by length that would be ctier i guess

so in overall id say the game sits somewhere between an a or b tiers depending on the personal tastes
with a very reasonable price its definitely worth a buy in my opinion and even more so during the sale

#####

 good health recovery mechanics
 rewards both offensive and defensive play as a singular and intermingled playstyle
 more metroidvania should have this system
 minimal but funny character development imo

#####

i like that she looks like alucard

#####

this game has the potential of being of the best in this genre
ive played and reached the end of the early accessi was surprised and a bit sadbut then a feeling of joy just thinking about what this game will look like when its going to be finished

i cant wait

do i recommend this game hell yeah

everything feels right
the music the graphic
metroidvania mixed with record of lodoss war its a win win scenario
think about it 

#####

its a new record of lodoss war game in 2021 and its a metroidvania and its good my brain is melting time to boot up those vhs cassettes

#####

record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a metroidvania based on the ancient anime and novels of the same name you may be wondering whether you need to be familiar with the source materials to enjoy this and the answer is not really youll have absolutely no clue who anyone is or what on earth theyre talking about but its a metroidvania  these arent really games that benefit from an in depth plot and you can mostly just skip past it dont be tempted to read the novels or watch the anime  even when i watched it over 20 years ago it was painfully generic and the novels were literally some guys dd campaign with the serial numbers filed off 

in terms of how it plays were basically looking at symphony of the night again the main twist in the formula is an ikaruga style colour switch between wind and fire  being in one element will allow you to absorb attacks of the same type and changing on the fly is required to survive the games many boss fights if youre familiar with touhou lunar nights this is very similar though deedlit never reaches the utter bullet hell chaos of that game however the boss fights are still rather messy affairs that i sometimes beat basically by accident by mashing the attack button and spamming magic while a thousand projectiles filled the screen

despite the chaotic boss fights deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a pretty sterling example of the genre being extremely pretty well designed and paced it is a rather short game taking me around 6 hours to 100 while only having to consult a guide once for a particular item the only developer troll in the game needing the player to jump on a particular floor panel 50 times  why this means that the map is compact pace is very brisk and theres no time to get bored while i wouldnt put it up there with the absolute best in the genre if you fancy something pretty and fun that you can complete in a couple of evenings id say its hard to go too far wrong with deedlit in wonder labyrinth


#####

i barely recommend this first half of the game was very good not really much exploration to be had but the game feels great to play etc it can be difficult to determine which mode fire or wind you are in which i find frustrating when it is necessary to avoid certain boss attacks what bugged me the most was bosses started feeling very samey everything after the first half is a two phase fight a few of the bosses start with the same enemy first phase and transform in to the real boss second phase by the end i had gathered so much money that i could buy healing potions to basically brute force the bosses weapons dont feel that balanced to me in that the weapon hit box played a much bigger role than any other stats sure this weapon is faster does more damage etc but the large weapons basically attack in a quarter circle hitting stuff abovebehind you and in frontbelow you all the bosses are fair but do so much damage per hit that they can feel unfair at first until you pick apart their rather simple attack patterns overall fun but if the game had presented any sort of resistancechallenge to me i think i would have put it down

#####

very polished gameplay but be warned incredibly early access in terms of length see my total playtime for 100 completion of the current mapbosses  nothing too difficult at the moment either though id expect that to go up with the longer content

this game is well on its way to being a damn masterpiece  its not done yet so im a little afraid to advance too far ahead but already its like all the best of what made symphony of the night a timeless classic mixed with some modern sensibility and a dash of ikaruga  im getting some serious dreamcast vibes actually  considering the dreamcast had a lodoss game that i never got around to playing and my mention of ikaruga if this game had hit 20 years ago as a dreamcast exclusive segas last console probably would have won the console wars back then
the smooth animations the tight and responsive controls the beautiful pixel art graphics just everything about this game so far oozes charm quality and love  you know how your grandmas spaghetti tastes so much better than every other spaghetti youve eaten  if you ask grandma what the secret ingredient is she will tell you love  the same thing applies here  wonder labyrinth is the grandmas spaghetti of metroidvanias and the secret ingredient is the love and passion that the developers are pouring into it every day as they continue to develop it

#####

having seen record of lodoss war the gray witch and record of lodoss war chronicle of the heroic knight i was excited to find out that there was a rolw video game for the pc 

it reminds me a bit of metroid in some ways and of castlevania in others probably why they call games like this metroidvania games  i have played several games in both franchises and have to say that i like this game better it is more interesting to me because i know something about the characters and story beyond the game i find it quite a bit easier than those games but i dont think of that as a negative thing it is not too simple for me i can make progress but when i come across something new it does take a few tries before i figure it out 

the graphics are retro  looking a bit like something that would have been new in the playstation 2 era they arent so pixelated that you cant tell what you are looking at but the edges of things arent super smooth either the animations are fairly smooth and detailed characters have several animations though perhaps not as many as youd see in a modern style game plenty for a game like this anyway 

i like that you can fire upwards as well as side to side even at upwards diagonals if you can manage it without unintentionally moving forward oddly enough you cant fire downward but you can at least crouch and fire i keep forgetting that you cant fire downward or down diagonally it is less limited than mega man at least also the enemies that ive encountered so far do not attack me from directions that i cant fire very often that makes the limited character attack range a bit easier to deal with 

you start off with deedlits iconic rapier but if you find other weapons you can access them in an inventory menu its a bit harder than it needs to be to use the menu but you get used to it after a bit at least the action pauses when you open the menu so you dont have to try to manipulate it quickly you even get her bow but not from killing enemies you have to find it once you get it certain enemies that were quite hard to attack with melee weapons are easier to deal with you dont run out of arrows but you cant use the bot constantly due to the magic of it depleting your mana meter like your spells do 

the spell system is rather interesting different from most games its kind of hard to explain but you eventually have two different magic meters and fill them up by defeating enemies thats not whats so unique though what is is that when you fill up the meters switching from one type of magic to the other fills up your health bar again this is a good thing because so far as i can tell there arent any health potions laying about in this game 

the games look music and ways that deedlit behaves are pretty true to the anime films and the manga books the biggest difference is that deedlit doesnt have to rest after using magic like she does in the books and films but that makes sense in an arcade style game that is about action rather than role playing 

it is not a deep lore driven rpg even though it is based on a japanese role playing game but what bits of lore are in it seem true to the source material it is not turnbased but there are plenty of places in the levels ive gotten to where you arent attacked all of the time so you can take a finger break without having to pause the game 

it would be nice to have a turnbased rpg based on record of lodoss war as it is a very interesting game and story world so a final fantasy or dragon quest style game about it would be fantastic this game here is not a bad one but one shouldnt expect it to be anything like final fantasy

#####

short but enjoyable metroidvania that serves as a sort of interquel between the classic record of lodoss war and the new manga all of the characters are lovingly animated with designs and move sets straight out of the anime i have to say though it is very short my play time of about 14 hours was to 100 the game including a little bit of farming for weapons and messing around on boss rush mode still i would heartily recommend it to fans of rolw or metroidvanias in general

#####

this game raisen my memory of these games on list successfully
castlevania seriesof course
megaman x5

#####

loving this game so far but also i beat whats in it in 44 minutes or so

but man is it already super good cant wait til its done looking forward to it

#####

only a weak recommendation from me there are a lot of better games in the genre such as hollow knight or bloodstained some pros and cons of deedlit in wonder labyrinth

 gorgeous pixel art graphics
 fast levelling
 not too long

 some puzzles are annoying
 multistage bosses are tiring and tedious to lose to

this game is a solid metroidvania that takes many probably a bit too many cues from previous games of a similar ilk yet struggles to establish an identity of its own it has a strong beginning with offering you fluid control combat and aesthetic reminiscent of the beloved symphony of the night with an ikarugaesque polarity element to encounters and traversal the game looks and feels very good the music is nice on the ears and the idea of the fire and wind spirits is very interesting unfortunately it doesnt offer anything too diverse as the game progresses exploration isnt as intricate as other metroidvanias the puzzles are minimal and are often rather finicky when involving the bow and enemy encounters dont leave too much of an impact that last point is both bad and good because this game very much intends on acting as a power fantasy starting strong and only getting stronger as you progress that feeling is very much achieved but the variety of movement abilities and spells can feel a bit lacking the bosses are generally very good and actually do feel like a decent challenge compared to the enemies the story is rather lacking overall i was not aware of the record of lodoss war franchise before getting this game but you honestly dont need much prior knowledge to play this game while the premise and ending are decent it does little to establish or flesh out its characters likely assuming you already know who they are so they dont bother this might sound contradictory to what i said previous but considering the story isnt presented like a major focus to the game here it all mostly boils down to callbacks and fanservice at the end of it all in all id say the game is fun to play but not very impactful on the whole

#####

really scratches that sotn itch

#####

good but very very short

the game plays between a polished up isymphony of the nighti with some stripped elements a little bit of iikarugai and a pinch of modern game design

the game explores story elements of irecord of lodoss wari something ive never readseen but what was here was serviceable asis deedlit a high elf awakens in a familiar but strange location with the games length any additional exposition borders on spoiling the game

the rpg elements leveling and equipment are very stripped down to focus on the gameplay which is very good and rewards skilled gameplay but can be a little easy the combatcentric metroidvania game focuses on melee archery spells and some movement abilities while occasionally throwing in a few archery puzzles and locked doors theres not many items or equipment as similar titles but theres enough variety and versatility in the deedlits repertoire that it never really feels like armor and other equipment items are missing from the game

in addition to playing great it just looks real nice and sounds good to boot boss fights are really interesting though as previously stated the games not particularly difficult to a skilled player which is just as easily a pro as it is a con for some people

i enjoyed it but the games over in about 5 hours or less 100 by the way without a guide entertaining for sure but theres minimal replayability for a metroidvania which was a little surprising if youre new to metroidvanias though this is probably a good place to start as a lowstress trial into the genre

#####

as a fan of the comics and original anime of record of lodoss war i really enjoyed this game since you can see the old characters and deedlit is a great main character the visuals and soundtrack have a pleasant sotn vibe although the game is smaller in scale 

it would be great to be able to play as parn after finishing the game spoilerand getting his swordspoiler

as a reference to get a s rating in boss rush i had level 70 used the weapons vampire and indra bow  and finished it in 54198 so i guess that you need to finish in less than 6 minutes to get a s ratiing

#####

i loved the rolw  really hope to see this progress i was getting into it and it suddenly ended  i was recently going back through the rolw game on dreamcast so i knew i was throwing money at this as soon as i saw it in my suggestions

people arent kidding about that 90 minutes though i look forward to the rest of the game but folks should be aware they are buying about a demos worth of content for the time being  i am completely okay with that and anticipate what comes next

sure wish someone would bring that dreamcast game over to steam that would be amazing

#####

i really enjoyed it and really wished it was longer and had more depth to it definitely worth it despite its very short length

#####

game is never actually fun at any point it either feels too easy or too frustratingly hard 

no point in switching in any of the thousands of weapons you find just pick the most damaging one you have at the time and youll have little resistance

story is unoriginal and lazy you know exactly what is going on within 510 minutes of playtime but the game presents it as some mindblowing revelation

i love the visuals and the fluidity of the animation 1010 but its not enough to pick up the slack

i would not buy it again

#####

while not as good as their last outing with touhou wonder labyrinth has a strong combat system via the high emphasis on positioning and use of all facets of the jane of all trades master of all that deedlit rocks

plus it sports a great prog soundtrack

#####

thoroughly enjoyable great use of the record of lodoss war license and id love to play a sequel if one is made

#####

game looks good controls are good like the way it is set up
had a fun time playing it
like the story

spoiler
feel sad for deedlit having ptsd
but she is getting over it in the game
i really like the story even if it makes me sad
spoiler

#####

i didnt know this was a franchise b and thats a good thing b

ever so often i find an interesting passionate well made game that catches my attention but when trying to play it i get caught on a massive barrier of entry preestablished lore which pushes me away as it makes me feel confused and lost to what is happening

this game is not that it stands by itself no previous knowledge required and could be considered an entry point as the intrigue of what is happening pulls you to wanting to know more 

as someone with no knowledge of the world of lodoss the games comes across as a psychological horror as you do not know whether what you see are memories hallucinations spoiler or something darker spoiler the way characters are introduced makes deed seem delirious but is extremely well crafted

not to mention what all other reviews mentioned the game play is smooth the hud and menus sleek gameplay mechanics intelligent and art beautiful

if you like castlevanias this game is for you even if you dont like it you might enjoy this game just keep in mind as of the writing of this review it ends at the 4th act while it seems they are planing for 6 acts

#####

as someone who has been called a connoisseur of metroidvania games a title that makes me want to put my head through a wall i have to say i quite enjoyed deedlit in wonder labyrinth  i think in terms of style and control this is the closest a game has ever gotten to emulating the legendary castlevania symphony of the night the game is absolutely gorgeous and brought me similar feelings to when i first booed up sotn back in the late 90s deedlit feels lovingly inspired by alucards gorgeous animations and the control has been slightly expanded upon on with the introduction of being able to attack in 8 directions much like in super castlevania iv despite this deedlit feels ever so slightly stiffer than alucard ever was animation canceling through jump attacks is nowhere to be found in the game which can lead to frustrating situations of feeling like the game isnt responding to your controls this is most likely to be seen when youre trying to come down from a jump mid attack and then slide deedlit will just proceed to jump back up into whatever you were trying to avoid with glee or even worse stand perfectly still and get walloped just as hard theres also no way to increase your speed in the game as far as i know movement enhancing tech like back dash canceling shinesparking or even just a sprint button of some sort is nowhere to be found this leads to deedlit feeling quite slow and makes any form of backtracking feel more tedious than it should be the best form of movement is the super jump i would be lying if i said it wasnt thrilling to shoot up through the air it is heavily underutilized and only provides extreme vertical gain good for some of the tower rooms but not practical for the quick room to room sprinting you may be doing to find that last one percent spoilersmall hint here jump a lotspoiler not that the absence of any of this adds much to the games difficulty every enemy encounter boss or not in the game can easily be facetanked without a second thought due to how easily you can damage race most enemies save points are extremely plentiful and are around every corner being able to heal by swapping to a tier 3 elemental style feels ridiculous and i never once felt like my life was in danger i did not die a single time during my play time and any resets came from my own personal challenge beating all the bosses without taking a single hit this challenge is something i would recommend if you are to pick wonder labyrinth up by the way otherwise you will blitz through the game from 3 to 6 hours easily regardless while being ultimately less engaging shorter stiffer and easier than sotn in every aspect this game was still a fun and worthwhile expenditure of my time i would say its price tag currently is justifiable if you love these style of games but you probably already own it if you do otherwise wait for a sale i dont think youll find yourself disappointed

wonder labyrinth is a refreshing yet familiar moderately casual metroidvania the sprite combat system is interesting and gives you a bit of challenge during combat and lets you pause to think for environmental puzzles wl rewards you for paying attention as it really pays off especially with boss fights when you keep your eyes open to enemy strengths and weaknesses

 wl is generally a forgiving game i love that wl is not a grindfest like bloodstained ritual of the night because you can focus on gameplay another nifty thing about wl is you can skip the shop and worrying about credits because the weapons you find through exploration are more than adequate while upgrades are limited and simple the gameplay mechanics like hp healing when your attach meter is full allows for worryfree exploration in most areas there were only a few after midgame where i started sweating looking for a save point 

even then most areas on the map are forgiving enough that you can just switch rooms back and forth and farm to build up your attach meter to regenerate hp mapwise i was able to get 99 completion playing on my own without online resources so this is a pretty accessible title boss fights can usually be finished in two or three tries most require pattern recognition while some are first time goes that allow you to face tank if youre equipped with the right spells and recovery items enemies are generally pretty easy to defeat once you figure them out and somewhat repetitive but thankfully you can run through most of them when backtracking which is much appreciated compared to some titles 

plotwise its nothing to write home about but again the focus is on gameplay its a fun relatively quick jaunt that rewards you for being a player rather than farmer slogging through half an hour to get a spell like in other games pricewise i paid about 16 and its a bit more compared to similar titles when on sale but i think its fair especially if it encourages them to make more titles like this

#####

caveat

first off i know this game is early access i recommend it to other people with the stipulation that it is less than an hour of play if you rush to the end i believe the devs will deliver and i want to encourage them to finish the project it is not a complete game by any means but it shows an incredible amount of promise 

first impressions 

i spent an hour exploring this game and i have to say the game is gorgeous the combat is smooth the puzzles are fun if this game opens up to a full 10 hours or more it will be one hell of an entry in the metroidvania genre that said some elements of the game are a bit annoying but largely superficial the afterimage that deedlit and some enemies give off seems to be far too busy and makes it hard to track some movements likewise i occasionally struggled to hit smaller enemies because deedlits attacks are pokes no sweeps available 

under the surface

the ability to switch between attack types is integral to exploration and has a lot of play in combat that ranges from avoiding attacks and hazards in environment think undertale colorcoded attacks to being able to deal damage to enemies and destroy certain objects there are a lot of movement options early on and while a couple of them are not immediately explained a few seconds of mashing buttons and looking at the configuration at the start will clue you in i was able to reconfigured my buttons to fit my style of play note im playing with a ps4 dualshock and i believe the game has controller support already built in for xbox controllers as the button layouts are in abxy with color coding

conclusion 

still a lot of game to build and more story to flesh out im excited to see what comes

#####

b pretty solid metroidvania with an ikarugastyle elemental swap gimmick b

art and animations are beautiful musics fine but probably wont stick with you
story is adequate record of lodoss war fans will see plenty of characters they recognize
some secrets and extra challenges to find
somewhat short 6 hours without a ton of replay value though a thirdparty randomizer is available
not a lot of combat variety or memorable locations when compared to ds castlevanias 
later boss fights can be a little difficult if you dont abuse magic spells
some achievements will take a little grinding

710 its fine

#####

while not as long as some of the heavy hitters in the metroidvania genre or as challenging as team ladybugs touhou luna nights this game is still a beautiful adventure worth undertaking especially for any fans of record of lodoss war and castlevania symphony of the night   if you enjoy either of those you owe it to yourself to give this game a look

#####

so as a huge fan of symphony of the night i would highly recommend this game since it follows pretty much the same path graphics wise and gameplay wise with a lot of new mechanics which makes this game worthy honestly with only 4 stages unlocked record of lodoss war is on its way of being a masterpiece

#####

disclaimer i did not finish this game i got about 3 bosses in before deciding nah this aint it chief ill also admit to this being more a list of complaints than a coherent review that i typed into a word document and proofread before posting i find more and more often that action adventure games forget the adventure half of the genre and just sort of string you along on a set course while giving you tools that will open paths you found earlier but couldnt do anything with to me that isnt exploration its a parent saying nuhuhuh cant play with your toys until you finish your homework im not saying that its a bad thing in and of itself im not even trying to say this is a bad game what this is is a game that fails to execute the idea of an adventure because youre always sure where to go because theres only 1 path forward and any branching paths are fleeting side trips at best that will give you some boring weapon that just changes your stats 

maybe youll get a spell but you already have a bow and arrow thats waaaay better in most cases you wanna know what i think would have bee been interesting as a first spell in a game where the mc is an elf with a rapier and a bow a charged attack lock me in place but give me an attack with some punch when it lands not kinda pretty looking basic homing projectiles that really arent worth the mp you spend casting them

on the subject of combat its basic again not an inherently bad thing but the game isnt structured in a matter where the basic combat can be pushed to its limits you can stab in 8 directions you can shoot in a wide angle hell you can float above the heads of melee enemies to just completely trivialize them theres an element system that levels up as you hit enemies that caps at level 3 and at that cap not only are you dealing more damage but youre also regenerating health this is a system that should encourage risky play to get in on enemies give em a good stabbing it is instead a system that punishes any mistake with a drastic decrease to your dps and a lockout of your most consistent method of healing there were health potions available for purchase i didnt want to farm the money to buy them because the moment to moment gameplay wasnt very interesting to me

the movement is smooth you turn on a dime youve a nice jump arc and you can attack and move independently theres also a backdash there is nothing interesting about the backdash you will not use it unless youre speedrunning this game something sort of new this game has that sotn doesnt is the ability to freely float through the air up to your jump height there is nothing interesting done with this ability you will use it to float on bodies of water and cheese melee enemies you get a slide that turns into an evasive maneuver while in fire mode full invincibility until you land games play spaces are tight so expect to run into walls or spikes or whatever for trying theres enemies bosses too only one of the bosses were interesting to fight the normal enemies just get trashed by overwhelming freedom of movement melee enemies wont try to swat you out of the air or jump for you or anything cool even if they could itd feel like bullshit because of the tight corridors

so in short this games mediocrity has made me lose faith in it getting better later the devs showcased their lack of understanding of what an adventure is as well as failing to capture my interest with moment to moment gameplay this is a decently cooked steak with no spices and no side dishes

#####

update ive now completed the full version of the game my thoughts are much the same as below in summary deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a great actionplatformermetroidvania and one that doesnt overstay its welcome at about six hours to finish

original early access review ive played through all four of the early access areas and found record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth to be a pretty enjoyable metroidvania though i hesitate to call it that  the game is split up into several areas with relatively little backtracking between them and deedlit doesnt get significant additional traversal abilities after the first section

compared to the teams previous game touhou luna nights rolw diwl is more polished but easier i find the new polarity firewind system less exciting than the grazetimestop mechanic of luna nights but there might be more to it in the full game ill note that im only slightly familiar with the anime series but i imagine fans of it would get a kick out of seeing these characters again

the full game dated march 27 2021 adds two additional areas if theyre about as lengthy as the existing areas id imagine the whole game would take most players around 6 hours to play though

#####

ive rarely seen a game crafted with such love and care as this one charm oozes out from every pore the music is fantastic the art style is wonderful gameplay excellent is an understatement my first session with this game was an hour and a half my second was nearly 11 hours in one sitting i didnt close the game until i got all the achievements its worth every penny full price and more so on discount 1010 love it adore it it makes me happy

ear wiggles

#####

there are only a couple of bosses for now but guys this is sotn on steroids


#####

bmasterpiece 1010b
excellent balance of difficulty a rare metroidvania game that is incredibly comfortable to play
great graphics interesting story unique items and unusual boss fights

#####

pretty close the sotn but id say a tad easier linear and smaller still a good game im hoping the added content from the full game will give us some extra goodies and difficulty

#####

pretty fun castlevania clone that makes you feel like its been ages since you last played something similar to symphony of the night the sprites are very well animated and the music is great platforming and fighting is just what you would expect and a little more because of the element system

#####

record of lodoss war  deedlit in wonder labyrinth without a doubt deliberately follows the traces of castlevania  symphony of the night aka the mother of metroidvanias but proves that its far from being a blatant copy of it its neverbeforeseen combat mechanics dynamic enemies a wide array of weapons banger soundtrack and extraordinary delivery validates further that its a musthave for all metroidvania enjoyers this elite metroidvania is a resounding success

rating s

#####

this game this game oh boy

lovely pixel art and a great ost to boot even if you dont know the series its still a fun game that makes you ponder whats going on and is still a blast if you have been a fan of the series for awhile this feels like a much needed love letter that feels like a great after tale

manly tears for this one

#####

good

#####

mostly of interest to fans of record of lodoss war and symphony of the night a noticeable inspiration right down to deedlits walk animation this is an igavanialite with some lovely pixel art and smooth responsive controls the dungeon and exploration bgm is quite repetitive however and gameplay can get frustrating later on medusa head ptsd kicks in

#####

good sotn port but why does alucard have pointy ears 

#####

ikaruga of the night

loved it never really followed lodoss war very much but only a base level of knowledge of the series is needed to understand the story and even if you dont its still at least an entertaining story

gameplaywise its a fantastic search action symphony of the night super metroid game with an ikarugalike elemental system where you swap between absorbing one of two colors to build a meter

fantastic game highly recommended

#####

positively one of the best symphony of the night clones you can play the story is short and sweet while respecting the lodoss series id say it goes hand over fist to gift you that adnd whimsy that most games dont offer despite sharing that inspiration 

like the anime it captures the fantasy without drowning you in the dark and depressing even when most of the game takes place in caves and catacombs youre never tired of the aesthetic the boss fights are challenging but not obnoxious the metroidvania doesnt make you feel lost and the backtracking rarely feels like a chore

this may have some very clear inspirations but its clearly a labor of love by the developers

#####

this is a typical postmetroid game precisely in the igavania subgenre its very concise though the runtime is not that long and there are no three or more surprise twist world swaps doubling or tripling the game size there are no premature endings and the game doesnt ask you to find a walkthrough just to see how to get half of the content hidden behind a moon logic secret

the gameplay is perfectly fine but there are a lot of things present only as token mechanics ledgedropping introduced on the second screen is never used again the store is useless the best things it sells are medkits and energy drinks none of these weapons can compete with basic things you will find essentially right outside the store there are very few locations and almost all of them are in inconvenient places so you will rarely see the shopkeeper anyway also the prices of shopweapons are so high you cant even grind enemies at any reasonable pace so basically the store is only for medkits if you are not very good at the game i ever went shopping for them only for a couple of specifically spammy bosses including the final one the archery is pointless without a proper mouse aim you cant properly hit anything that is not directly in front of you you can enter the aim mode but its so bad and inconvenient you should forget about shooting on the move or trying to catch a moving target the damage is so pathetic its not worth it but the bow is still used pretty often for the puzzles mostly its okay but any bowpuzzle involving movement is rather irritating the spent ammo is directly subtracted from your mana and you can run out of it by trying to solve a crucial moving puzzle the archery minigame highlights all that is bad with not having a proper mouse aim but thankfully it runs on pure maths this very same semi6directional semiaim makes most melee weapons very situational so in general i only used the swords with halfcircle swing arcs hitting flyers with the diagonal directional weapons strikes that make you walk is really hard and there are a lot of flyers on top of it the official microsoft gamepad is quite bad at diagonals also the attack direction is sticky if you are striking to the right you cant just turn around and start striking to the left you have to perform a full stop and let the elf chill the necessity rarely arises but when it does its irritating

the game heavily relies on magic once you learn how to read the resists on enemy life bars its much easier to just spam something effective instead of trying to catch the pesky parasites with your lowdamage sword i wiped the floor with the boss rush room yet if someone didnt master the elements that can be quite challenging but generally if you stumble upon a boss being cancer you can bring 10 life potions with you the gui for healing is a part of the crooked spellwheel which is cancer but with 500 additional hp even the really tough spots are manageable though you might have to grind pennies a lot if you cant master any boss at the beginning of the game starting with the fourth stage even common rooms start to be assembled in a really challenging way and generic enemies start to spam attacks filling half of the screen with projectiles later stages are quite challenging even with the maxout hp bar the last area has only one nonboss savepoint and its very far from the previous one still its doable due to the colourcoding mechanic making half of the enemies immune to your realtime strikes is generally not that good of an idea especially when mixing both types in one fight but in this game the right colour makes you as well immune to some attacks and if you max out the blue or the orange spirit it will start to regenerate your health so by playing slowly keeping one colour as sacrificial and the other one as emergency healing between fights you can break through endgame corridors filled with dragons and dinosaurs shadow stalkers are still cancer and a waste of time though and the levelling system where you dont make any decisions is utterly superfluous though if you are absolutely bad at the game you can grind easytokill enemies for weeks to hit the levelcap of 99 and have more raw damage for the part you are stuck on

the animations are quite good but the faux pixelart is irritating its a mix of pixelbuilt elements with just lowres jarring traditional jpegs and unfitting visual effects of different resolution its like those old ps1 non3d graphics which are not here nor there you dont have to have stupid lowres graphics to have a good game bloodstained is a great game without making you feel like a caveman and the eye and fonts from the menu and cutscenes are the worst the music is really screwed up too it sounds like it was speedup 30 for some reason i really thought its something wrong on my end even the sounds of the protagonist are borked she sounds like a dude trying to pitch up his voice in post

storywise she is journeying in some metaphysical purgatory or something trying to escape her cycles of guilt the writing is abrupt and cryptic somehow the guy is dead and she has to learn to forgive herself but the last thing i saw is them both lovebirds riding into the sunset
bи тут котёнок проснулсяb
it doesnt matter the plot is redundant in this game just as the whole setting you can reskin it to any other ip and it will be the same game there are no breakthrough innovative mechanics its just a solid game in itself even despite the flaws and its the best game of the year because this is the first game released this year that is worth anything as for me it is worth the full price

#####

from the anime series that was basically an add campaign and all the better for it comes a sidestory starring the elf deedlit mysterious circumstances bring her to a megadungeon alone ever unsettling as fragments of her past come forth without warning what has happened and why is this oldschool gish here only for you to find out

the tale plays like an igavania game boiled down to its essentials but with its own style various weapons are at deedlits disposal and secret spirit magic spells can grant her advantages with the elemental rockpaperscissors of enemy weaknesses however two elements are integral to her  fire and wind manifest as familiars who let her absorb their elements understanding which of these two spirits to have out when will be integral to survival  both to regain mp for spells and to regenerate hp when a spirit is at full strength

mastering this game relies on being skillful with melee weapons using your bow to fight from afar and solve mechanical puzzles casting spells and understanding what magic to use when you know as any elf is wont to do traversing the environs is treacherous and boss fights are brutal forcing you to think on your feet and use all at your disposal 

deedlits max hp and mp are relatively static and returning to shops for consumables isnt reliable luckily restarting from save points is quick and boss rooms are preceded by a means to power up your familiars to be at full strength beforehand expect to replay most boss fights at least once to master their attack patterns and as with any igavania backtracking with new traversal skills and unlocking certain colored gates in the labyrinth will serve you well

the translation isnt perfect but its still legible and feels like oldschool jrpgs youd grown up with you know the ones as someone who has only seen a few episodes of the lodoss war anime the big reveals caught me offguard but proved satisfying by the end nevertheless if youre an outsider to the series the game does well enough to present its story without holding your hard im sure lodoss war fans will adore the shoutouts that flew over my head much more

if youre looking for a shortandsweet challenging metroidvania that innovates on the genres design youve come to the right table the dm may not go easy on you but the brave will see their skills reward them and enjoy the wonders within this labyrinth

#####

one of the best castelvania style games out there    excellent game

#####

a must for symphony of the night fans
beautiful art music and nice gameplay

the game has serious issues with reaction to jump and changing side

#####

the good very nice 2d pixel art and animation with bigger sprites than the norm banger of a soundtrack smooth intuitive controls and all based on classic swords n sorcery anime megahit record of lodoss war the bow and arrow mechanics are pretty spiffy and im having fun with the puzzles involving it

the bad wouldve liked more weapon variety that mattered and playable characters to spice things up having to redo some rooms that need the bow to proceed get a bit annoying as well at times especially late into the game

the ugly getting chainstunned by lightning sceenshake can get pretty crazy making it hard to tell whats going on

#####

very neat 8hlong symphony of the nightlike with amazing team ladybug pixel art 
my only issue with the game is that boss fights are a visual mess but most of them can be outdamaged if you use the correct spell and manage your elements well enough to not get blasted by their magic attacks too much

#####

the nostalgia alone is worth it with this game its awesome it truly is but this is only like 45 min possibly 60 min of game play right here so realizxe you are  only buying a demo at this time

#####

wow so many recommendations for this game so many positive takes but to be honest i think most of the reviews have been a bit misleading a tldr follows at the bottom if you want to skip the paragraphs below so here are my main impressions of the game 

b1 edit its out of early accessb

edit im updating this review to reflect the final state of the game anything i add is prefaced by edit like this line is 

b2 the good stuffb

the good elements of this game can be summarized succinctly its a very pretty game the controls are responsive and feel good and the element switching mechanic is enjoyable and quite strong often used effectively in boss fights if you want a fairly linear metroidvania experience one that isnt particularly challenging and looks nice then this game can scratch that itch

the bosses are entertaining fights that for the most part test your ability to use the core mechanics 

b3 the bad stuffb

bi enemy design sucksb

the bad parts of the game currently outweigh the good parts to start with enemy ai and behaviors are atrocious most of the enemies if youre quick can be killed without ever being able to attack melee enemies march straight toward you take long periods of time to wind up and generally are not threatening  there is one room that stands out to me a fairly long room with mummies and scorpions in it to get through this room it is sufficient to walk forward spam the attack button and crouch occasionally

edit in the additional zones added with the full release the enemies are slightly more challenging but theyre still pretty easy to kill 

if you compare the game to hollow knight its evident that hk has greater varieties of enemies more intelligent and challenging behaviors and so on to be honest even momodora reverie under moonlight is more challenging than this game 

bii environments are boringthere is no real explorationb

edit i think nothing has changed below tdlr no environmental storytelling no interesting environments etc

next up are the environments there is little environmental storytelling going on at this point i would say the environment does not compliment the story gating is handled in an artificial way where you simply find a switch and jump on it to unlock all locked doors of a given color in other places gating is handled by blocking progress if you lack the requisite ability usually double jump and the windair sprite which lets you fly but there are no viable alternative paths through the levels ultimately to progress you need to have a certain ability or find a certain switch again comparing this to hollow knight where you can avoid virtually all the gates if you know what youre doing this game really locks you in to the critical path 

i will mention briefly that the game does allow you to go down the wrong path sometimes but you always end up hardblocked from continuing which means you must go back to the side path that leads to the item you need to continue likewise the game spreads certain objectives across the map requiring backtracking but this clearly is a clearly artificial way to create the vague impression of openness 

the result is that the game is noticeably and distractingly linear and not really interconnected in any fun way i would say exploration is not rewarding or rewarded becauseaside from a small smattering of hidden roomsyoull visit everything and never stumble upon hidden things i hate to compare to hollow knight again but hk has areas like the queens garden that youll only find if you bother exploring beyond the critical path this game has nothing to discover 

biii the story is badb

edit apparently the story is supposed to lead into diadem of the covenant books whichafaikarent even available in english it doesnt even matter you wont get to know the characters or understand them and the dialogue is pointedly ambiguous philosophical drivel another reviewer accurately described it 

the story is clearly shoehorned in and nothing makes sense or is justified why does abram have the magical orb the macguffin i dont know and i doubt anyone does because you arent told and theres nothing that tells you or even remotely suggests why it might be why does ghim speak in riddles i suppose theres a vague suggestion your in a spirit realm but thats it why are mummies and scorpions in some parts of the map but not in others surely there should be a reason but there isnt because the world and story have not been integrated in a way that diagetically justifies the existence of these places or the things inhabiting them

to put it another way and to use a technical term the game is positively bursting with ludonarrative dissonance the story is barebones garbage 

biv the lodoss ip isnt well usedb

this is just a personal complaint the game isnt using the lodoss ip very well allow me to indulge in a simple fantasy the game could have incorporated all the main characters as playable giving each of them unique advantages and disadvantages eg perhaps it would be better to play deedlit for one section parn for another etc and the game could have been a metroidvania that had you retrace the steps of the original story or any story for that matter but in metroidvaniaesque context imagine a midgame showdown with beld a later fight with ashram various battles again karla all working up to a final showdown with wagnard or something to that effect 

instead the game seems content to squander the lore and world of lodoss you could strip lodoss from the game entirely and it would make no difference 



btldrb 

pros the game is pretty has fun bosses and some interesting and wellimplemented mechanics

cons most enemies are not even remotely interesting or challenging the story is vapid and thin the environment is mediocre in terms of design storytelling and logical integration the lodoss ip could be stripped from the game without losing anything altogether these negatives outweigh the positives for me

edit altogether i enjoyed the combat and bosses in an action platformer at least i dont have to use my brain while playing kind of way but none of the issues were fixed in the final release and the game remains and aggressively mediocre example of the genre

#####

im on the fence with whether u should pick this up so heres the take if u played and enjoyed tohou luna nights then hands down get it if ur looking for a full metroidvannia experience then wishlist it and wait till the full release after 2 bosses i was hit with the path is yet not finished cutscene i shouldve seen it coming tho with the file size being only 52mbs xd so there ya have it is it a promising metroidvannia you bet are you willing to invest early on probably will you get more than 3hrs worth not a chance i love this genre so even tho ive bought it ill wait till full release when i play it again but yea the animation sotn feel theyre all there

#####

i finished it in 45min so if you buy this early access it is certainly not for its life but to send to the developers and the publishers a message you love the game or you hate it i personally love it

gameplay metroid  original game mechanics

1 the map is not generated randomly which feels great imo

2 enemies drop only useful items weapons only at this point there isnt much loot and this is great because i personally hate to have to sort my inventory i prefer to focus on the action

3 you have 2 elements fire and water you can only equip one at once both add extra damage of the element to your attack and protect you from that element this feels very much like space shooters where you have to switch constantly between the 2 to avoid damage and to attack

4 on top of that the water element allows you to jump higher in the air and stay in the air this is particularly interesting with bosses where you need to use the right element to dodge the attack

5 when you dont use an element it recharges if you switch back it will replenish your health thats how you heal during exploration and during combat this is very interesting because the game is challenging and this mechanic makes the game not punishing

6 your character can do melee attacks in every direction just like super castlenania 4 for example

7 you have a bow and you dont need a stick to control it the bow is mainly used to solve small puzzles it can also be used to initiate a combat at distance

8 this the engine of luna night the game is pixel perfect and feel perfect and fast

my impressions

i played luna nights and i really didnt like it i found the music stressful and the combat mechanic a bit complicated here the combat mechanics are also original but they are simpler to learn i had a blast with this game and i would love to see its full release in the future the boss fights are super intense i love it the most i think

feedback for the developers

the only negative point i have at the moment is that even though the graphics are amazing the background feels repetitive and sometimes im just not sure where i am on the map the messenger also has a repetitive background but the map is more linear so i always feel like i know exactly where i am here it feels a bit like a maze

#####

this game is fantastic but desperately needs a massive loot injection the art is so good it seems a shame the game isnt more involved in terms of character or attire customization like with armorsaccessoriesresistancesetc as it relies so heavily on the sylph mechanics for most of that other than that the art and animation is perfection the music is very good as well but the game feels a bit shallow due to lack of lootequipment and the aimlessnessvagueness of the plot and characters at least as far as ive played if those issues were fixed wed have in my mind the perfect game

#####

a great short metroidvania thats perfect for a weekend  gorgeous pixel art and musicsound design and very reminiscent of castlevania just look at the walking animation alone  the system also has a neat windfire system thats basically like ikarugas blackwhite system though most of the lesser enemies dont use it until later in the game  its mostly seen in the boss fights

id say there are two main issues  one some boss fights might be a visual overload as you try to pay attention to the fire  wind projectiles while so much else is going on  second is how easy you can mow down some enemieseven close to the end until maybe the last big areawithout even seeing them attack

#####

early acess review just finished the early access version i want more

finished release i have just finished my first play through of the game while also still planning to stream the full game over the next couple of weeks months loved it while its not as advanced as some castlevania games it still scratches that itch and i often find looking for things in more advanced cv games can take way too long so honestly it lands just in the right spot for me and the fact that the ending ties into the recent book has me interested in possibly checking it out but for now very good time filler solid metroidvania for people that like that style of game

#####

beautiful pixel art and a rock solid foundation from devs who have already proven they can deliver a fantastic metroidvania gives me great hopes for this game that said i cannot in good conscious recommend buying it as of this writing as it is barely an hour long demo

i would however still encourage anyone interested in supporting the devs or wanting to participate in the games development by giving feedback to buy and i will update this review when the game receives a content update and i have complete confidence this game will some day be amazing

update

well a few months later and here we are i said i would update my review when new content is out and im a man of my word

this update while still not making the game enormous is incredible there are a few minor qol changes throughout the original area but the new map area is chefs kiss the bosses are exhilarating to fight and the gambling minigame is a nice distraction

with this update i can now easily recommend this game especially if the remaining updates are even a fraction as good as this one was

#####

i completed 100 of the achievements and highly recommend this game  this game was clearly inspired by casltevania symphony of the night and would be considered smaller in scope  the combat is enjoyable  the color matching mechanic is quite refreshing  and the grinding achievements arent outrageous  the story is the weakest element here  i didnt really understand what was going on until the end but by then i was far beyond caring about the characters  the game play loop was on point and thats what makes this game worth your money

#####

very heavy symphony of the night vibes from the character echo to combat music is grade a as well do yourself a favor and pick this game up

#####

japanese studio team ladybug delivers a masterpiece record of lodoss wardeedlit in wonder labyrinth is a cleverly designed metroidvania

visually the game delivers stunning pixel art and excellent animations in fact deedlit movements are delightful it feels wonderful to see her in action the amount of different enemies is also welcome for a short game it delivers a bestiary that puts other games to shame

the soundtrack is also another point worth mentioning the action is usually mixed with rocking tunes and the occasional atmospheric tune it blends with the game perfectly pushing you forward each room

last but not least the game offers a fair challenge but it is not a walk in the park either actually i felt it did not overstay its welcome which is something that can really leave a sour taste in your mouth

all things considered this is another gem from tl that has quickly became one of my favourite metroidvanias ever

#####

extremely excited to see this game grow and mature as whats there so far is a masterpiece

nostalgia galore as memories of playing castlevania sotn and watching record of the lodoss war as a teen barraged me as i played through whats available so far of this game the character controls beautifully and the aesthetic definitely fits as does the music well designed and has a solid foundation to keep building on so i hope they make one epic game

i only managed to glitch myself offscreen once but i had to exit and lost everything i had just done

dropped 3hrs in and i cant wait for the next update and stage 3 etc

#####

great aesthetics and animation wasted on such a subpar and short game so many bosses as well i wanted to like it but it was really kind of average so many other metroidvanias are out there that are far superior and worth checking out instead of this

#####

from what ive seen this game is fantastic despite what little content there is while a lot of things still need to be polished theres a ton of potential with this title it not only copies sotn but it makes new mechanics and runs with them 

however i cant currently recommend buying this in early access there is at best 45 mins worth of content in what is essentially a demo for 1299 unless youre a huge fan of record of lodoss war or deedlit herself wait until the final game is released i look forward when the full game is released

#####

now that it is well and truly finished this game comes recommended by me as of all the things it could be a fascinating hybrid between symphony of the night and ikaruga managing the spirits lends an interesting sort of strategy to boss fights has a killer soundtrack as well that is also worth buying it wont last you a long while as i cleared the game with about 5 hours logged on steam but now that theyve patched in some achievements im ready to do a second playthrough

about the only castlevania staple i feel this is missing is having an unlockable second player character itd be kind of funny to play it through as parn or pirotess given how the story goes normally

#####

im not sure on if i would recommend the game for the price its at but at the same time its a good game it does its mechanic well and i had quite a bit of fun but for 20ish dollars its not worth the price vs time investment as there are many other metroidvanias that go a lot longer and are quite enjoyable during it all unlike 9 years of shadows it does the element idea well but it almost feels like a showcase for what could have been a much more indepth system

#####

this game really does a good job of capturing some of the castlevania magic while also adding to the formula instead of only copying it while the core of the game is similar to castlevania there is an element system with enemy weaknesses that you can take advantage of with elemental magic attacks there are also two element modes you can be in which changes your damage type as well as the type you are resistant against including environmental barriers the game works similar to the older game outland with these two modes and using them to quickly change modes while platforming to get through hazard walls

this game really captured me and had me playing most of the game in one sitting which doesnt happen often i finished the game 100 the next day

the game is based on the property of a very old anime but knowledge of this isnt required for the game to be great there isnt a ton to the story here in the game whether you know the anime or not it mostly nods to characters from the anime the anime itself is also worth watching and has a strong dd vibe playing out like a dd campaign

#####

excelente jogo
recomendo pra quem jogou e gostou de castlevania sotn

#####

hidden gem good music and art style amazing vibe playing the game

#####

streamlined sotn formula perfectly executed this is a game i come back to and dont put down till i realize hours have passed 

#####

deed

#####

early access review short but extremely sweet this demo is pretty much everything i could ask for in a metroidvania there are a ton of interesting gameplay mechanics and you really need to utilize them all but it never feels overwhelming its absolutely gorgeous and a ton of fun my only concern is it took me about 45 minutes to class and this is supposed to be the first stage of 6 making this a potentially very short game still if it maintains this level of quality itll easily be worth the 12 price point

#####

its been a long time since i enjoyed a metroidvania game it was way back during castlevania sotn and i couldnt find the same vibe until this game 

it really makes me want to watch the anime and read the manga now this is how much im invested in the lore of the game and the characters that are in it 

if you share this sentiment with me i definitely recommend this gem

#####

this seems like it will be a short game but there is so much for franchise fans the pixel art is amazing the combat is fun and the story is interesting i think i might have it beat in around 10 hours but thats fine for me this game is great

#####

i highly recommend this metroidvania for the following reasons
 unique and fun combat mechanics
 the map is extremely diverse so it has a lot to explore and many enemies to face
 the art is really good
 the bosses and boss rush are really fun to do
 doing all the achievements i just need to warn everyone that to get s in the archery training area is hell lol

#####

there are not enough words to fully describe my appreciation for what the developers have created in this game but i am compelled to try

i have fond memories of the record of lodoss war or lodosstou senki for those whose interest is piqued by this game and while the dialogue of this game is somewhat sparse they encapsulated each of the characters rather well  which is amusing in retrospect as each of these characters is a dd archetype from the old days feeding into what the record of lodoss war is at heart but thats a tangent nobody asked for

visually this is some of the best pixel art i have ever seen and was very clearly a labor of love  animations are extremely fluid and i cannot begin to imagine how much time went into them

musically the game is a gem  i really cant think of a track i dont enjoy

this is a reasonably short metroidvania with a strong emphasis on vania that doesnt outstay its welcome  tying into the fluid animations combat can be something of a spectacle and somewhat rarely you can lose track of where you are  increases in mobility are well thought out and backtracking is minimal provided you found all the warp points your first time through a region

interesting mechanics that take some getting used to its almost like a hybrid of symphony of the night and ikaruga  all of it works really well once you get the hang of it

as a fan of lodosstou senki i am extremely grateful to the developers for creating this game  i know you thanked us at the end for playing it but thank you for making it

#####

this game is a mix of castlevania and ikarugayou can change your characters element to deflect incoming bullets of the same type  its primarily focused on action and a little exploring  you never have to do any grinding farming enemies sidequests or backtracking  i feel the difficulty was just right where i did not use any potions  

if you want the game to be a casual experience you can stockpile potions from the shop

gameplay is great and made me strategize between long range and close range combat  bosses were impressive as well as your characters own abilitiesweapons

there are no additional difficulties but after you beat it you can tweak the games settings on a new playthrough to make it harder  you get to set things like no more leveling up start with all items die in 1 hit

#####

this is a good game at first i was skeptical of how they  would write the story of this one and it was really confusing but at the end i was left in some tears after revisiting some good fond memories 

the game plays pretty good big recommend

#####

record of lodoss war wonder labyrinth is by far one of my top games of the year but not without its faults  i love so much about this game and fun fact masahiro sakurai has even played it and loves it

h1 story  about spoiler freeh1

in wonder labyrinth you play as an elf girl who wakes up in a labyrinth whos goal is to simply just escape  upon further exploration you find friends and enemies from your past both of which are there to help and hurt you  the game doesnt seem to be as ambitious or fleshed out as sotn hollowknight metroid dread or other metroidvanias in its catagory but its still a must play nonetheless

the game takes huge inspiration from castlevania symphony of the night going as far as to have deedlit the main character replicate the exact running animation of alucard from sotn  the graphics are also almost an exact recreation  swords leveling map design boss fights and even the ui are glorious recreation of sotn right down to the same back dash of alucard  the game seems to be an intentional tribute to sotn and not a knockoff  the graphicspixel art are beautiful 

i havent watched the anime or read the manga but that didnt dampen my playthrough at all  ill admit i didnt know or care about the characters upon first seeing them but toward the end i felt connected to each one as if ive been a fan from day one  i do have an interest in checking out the mangaanime after this playthrough

you do not need to know the source material to enjoy this game

h1 small nit picks h1

small complaints i did have with the game is that you as a character are grossly overpowered  youre an elf girl who has access to a sword and bow but you can also fly use magic become invincible slide double jump and even extend your double jump and regenerate health and you gain all of these powers within the first 5 minutes of the game and a handful of weapons in which seems like the first 3 rooms  you also meet the shopkeeper in the first 5 minutes of the game which was hours in sotn when compared to it 

the bosses also seem to be too easy as well as just spamming the sword attack seems to win the fight majority of the time  further through the game you even obtain a magic spell called shade which allows you to become invincible for about 5 seconds all of which you can still attack  using this spell i was able to beat bosses without a challenge   i also wish the map was more fleshed out with more exploring similar to that of sotn  far too many times the game seemed to finish a boss fight only to give me the exact weapon i need to enter another boss fight 3 rooms later  the game is a metroidvania but at times it seems very linear with no places to get lost or explore  the game tends to give you exactly what you need when you need it

there are small gimmicks such as switching from your attacks from wind to fire and some enemiesbosses being immune to one or the other but majority of the time i just used this elemental switch to regenerate health in the heat of battle


h1 music h1

the music in wonder labyrinth surprised me  a few times i had to pause and turn up the music as it immersed me with the story and characters  heres a track below that plays after you run through the labyrinth in desperate search of someone in one of the later levels

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxy9tfinmru

for an anime i knew nothing about and characters i could of cared less about  record of lodoss war wonder labyrinth is a 8510 for me  i will be checking out the anime and manga on this one  and i definitely will be playing it again

#####

deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a fun metroidvania title with very clear pros and cons it is a game that some are destined to love but everyone else will find themselves unimpressed

the positives

the gameplay is simple and fun there are no complicated weaponmagicplatforming systems which makes diw accessible to even nonhardcore players
exploration is enjoyable and works organically in the game i never felt like i was wasting time not knowing what to do or where to find what i was looking for
the spirit system is a clever mechanic with a lot of potential
there is a decent variety of enemies most of them with their own unique set of moves
controls are exactly the way they need to be movement feels smooth and there were only a handful of times when deedlit did not immediately do what i wanted her to
visually the game is a joy to watch and it is bound to age amazingly i cannot imagine a better pixelated version of lodoss
what i said about the visuals is also true for the music excellent work
i cannot overstate how happy i was to see record of lodoss war being brought back to the light nostalgia is a absolutely a factor that helped me love this game to an extent that i otherwise may not have i wish the future will bring us more games from the lodoss universe and maybe even from other titles of the same era id love a game for vampire princess miyu guyver or arslan

the negatives

diw is extremely short and there are no extra modes or rewards so other than enjoying the game again from the start there is no incentive in replaying i get that this is an indie project but i think it needs a few more additions
even worse diw provides next to no challenge i am far from being a seasoned metroidvania player but at almost no time did i feel like i had to signifantly up  my game to progress an easyhard mode would help spice things up a bit
there are many weapons but less than a quarter of them feel distinct in some way

overall deedlit in wonderlabyrinth is a title made for metroidvania fans who want a relaxing time and oldschool lodossanime fans anyone else will probably find it underwhelming i for one i am happy to have played it and want more

#####

early access experience

even though im not familiar with record of lodoss war characters or story this game hooked me with its amazing experience
it takes from 2 to 3 hours to beat the first two stages but i enjoyed every second of deedlit in wonder labyrinth 

i like the idea of spirits and how the game wants you to swap between them in different situations especially in boss fights which were perfect with fair difficulty also the high diversity in enemies and their movements the beauty of pixel art the pretty cool gameplay with good mechanics and the stunning soundtracks 
 
im looking forward to playing the whole game asap

#####

this is a great homage to castlevania symphony on the night the graphics the animation the playstyle and control are all spot on there is a definite love and appreciation for record of lodoss war here though you need not be familiar with the series to appreciate this game even at this unfinished stage its easy to tell this game will be a treat for those looking to recapture that feeling of tackling sotn for the first time



#####

amazing creative beautiful this game is for big fans of castlevania 3
loved it enjoyed by playing it

d

#####

the only metroidvania game that leaves me wanting more
feels just like sotn

#####

an expensive but very fulfilling demo i was fortunate to be gifted it by a friend the game starts of quickly lets you explore its mechanics the flow is extremely fun and wellpaced and every animation and button feels extremely satisfying

its definitely a moment where im excitedly waiting for the next demo iteration or full release of the game this was extremely good and i feel it hits the sotnsuccessor notes better than say bloodstained within an hourlong demo 

if you want to be excited for a sotn game coming out in the future and are willing to spend some money to support a quality demo this is absolutely recommended

#####

its just perfect for me if you know the original mangaanime youll see what im talking about so much love for its source material so well presented storywise with its feet on the ground just as i like it some mechanics that weve seen in other games very well implemented with a lot of tributes and no matter how crazy it gets gameplaystorywise in the end it all makes perfect sense i loved it so much i fininshed in 1 sitting 

from here my original reviewfirst impression when the game was in early acces

i just  started it today and i finished it in 1 sitting with 100 of the map complete thats how much i liked it if you know the original mangaanime this game is filled with so much love and respect for it characters i didnt expect to see at all appear here the way the story is presented with its feet on the ground

from here when game was early access review this is amazing i just discovered that this exists a moment ago and ive already bought it and played it a fusion of symphony of the night style and feel and one of my favorite animes ever 

passed the hype and the emotion the game actually plays amazing and ive seen clever mechanics there with the spirits the bow

ive never thought it that way but overlaping alucard to deedlith actually fits they have both similar body structure and outfit height hair sword shoulder armor cape and this elegantetherial feel so it really looks good

it left me with such good vibes i stopped playing because i want the full experience cant wait

#####

tldr not a bad game but definitely not a good enough experience to recommend to others

metroidvania is among my favorite genre of games so i was very excited when i stumbled across this one the graphics and aesthetics seemed nice and reviews were positive so why not however this games rating seems to be far higher than it has earned it wasnt bad necessarily it is clear that the developers put a lot of love into the game that said when held up against its compatriots in the genre it falls extremely short this is my first real review so ill follow the format starting with pros and cons but first a quick warning

hrhr
bthis game has a few sequences in it one of the final cutscenes in particular that would be extremely problematic for epileptic players i did not see any warning of this in game so i wanted to point it out here id stay away if you suffer from epilepsyb

hrhr
buprosub
 great aesthetics the characters all look and move beautifully and the environments are easy on the eyes
 the spirit mechanic is interesting and seems to be pretty unique swapping elements as the situation requires to pass gates perform platforming and defeat enemies was mostly intuitive and felt fun additionally having to switch back and forth between the two in order to keep their power up and regain hp in the event you took damage was a clever way to require the use of both and did not feel intrusive it added a nice element of thought and swapping out became second nature quickly
 varied trash enemies that matched their environments well added to the atmosphere
 controls on the whole were quite tight and responsive the character typically did exactly what you expected it to do the only minor issue i had was spoilerwith the high jump acquired later on it seemed in my opinion to be pretty sensitive if your input was not mostly directed upwards the height would not be appliedspoiler

hrhr
buconsub
 combat was lackluster typically you would only really use one weapon and one spell most of the missioncritical enemies have a weakness to light so just spamming will o wisp will do some serious heavy lifting most enemies are too weak to pose much of a challenge and will die before they even manage to get an attack off
 exploration was just not there despite the apparent size of the map rooms felt very similar and the game ended up being quite linear there wasnt even much in the way of backtracking for secrets now to give the benefit of the doubt i did not go for 100 i was disappointed with the game which killed my desire to seek out every secret that said i was able to reveal 95 of the map without much other than just moving forward every new movement option was only used in a small number of places after it was acquired as well so acquiring a new item was less look at all this great new stuff i can go explore and more ugh i can finally move forward so many doors could just as easily have been replaced with some form of movement trick acquired at a similar time if the rooms had been given more variety and it would have felt better instead we got the feeling of playing super mario world 2 and hitting switch palaces only they were required to progress the game
 boss fights were mostly boring and extremely easy typically the strategy would involve identifying a blind spot pretty much every boss had one and spamming from within it this is probably my biggest source of disappointment because the bosses all looked great but they were all bark and no bite spoilers for later fights here spoileradditionally forcing the player to boss rush every fight in the game up until a certain point and calling that a boss fight is disingenuous at best seemed like the developers were padding for time here especially considering both the dark elf and witch are fought twice already beforehand it wasnt even particularly challenging since again none of the bosses are but if you slipped up and got stunlocked it was back to square one which never feels goodspoiler
 the story was confusing and that is being polite the resolution is not satisfying either perhaps if i had more knowledge of the source material going in i may have had a better time here but i felt no attachment to any of the characters or their plight from the context given in the game
 the game falls into some of the pitfalls of its older predecessors you can argue that it is trying to be as faithful to the genre as possible but improvements have been made for a reason plenty of blind jumps and enemies placed just out of sight to tax you sure youll remember they are there the next time but their placement added nothing but frustration additionally many games have adopted a save wherever spawn at checkpoint style and for good reason it makes deaths less frustrating as well as making it easier to pick the game up and put it down whenever you choose this game was not designed with that in mind then later on you will encounter a fast travel room right near a save room this will make later encounters a lot easier since every fast travel room becomes effectively a save room which does not feel like the way the game was intended to be played when games like this mistake frustration for challenge it makes players more likely to use firstorder optimal strategies rather than taking their time and exploring which drives playtime down
 the bow mechanics were clunky at best and more importantly added nothing to the game the gears were not creative they just broke flow the developers did a great job with the feel and flow of the spirit system and could have just as easily made use of it in puzzles blow a fan or light a fire to get things moving it would have felt nicer to work with while leveraging probably the best mechanic the game brought instead the clunky aiming of the bow and the somewhat janky design of some of the puzzles looking at you pendulumsack doors added nothing except a momentary immersionbreaking gap in gameplay

hrhr
all of the above contributed to a disappointing experience on top of all of that the game was short now i did not go for 100 ill give the benefit of the doubt and say that i only experienced half of the secrets the game had to offer though with 95 map completion that seems generous even accounting for that id only be getting 10 hours of gameplay comparing that to similar titles at this price point and can get more than twice that amount in some cases before even reaching an ending personally i find that a good benchmark for whether i am happy with the purchase of a game is whether i get about an hour of playtime per dollar spent and i couldnt get there if i tried short of spamming boss rush again and again not reaching this doesnt mean the game is a bad purchase it just means that it needs to make up for its length with much more impressive gameplay to compensate and that is where this game falls short in many ways

in closing the devs definitely tried their best and a lot of love was put into the game however the ratings and reviews seem to paint a picture of a masterpiece of the genre and this game is just not that its not bad and i cannot stress that enough but it is certainly not good enough for me to recommend as a huge fan of its genre for those that love these games like i do there are plenty of other better options out there at this price point to try

#####

recalls symphony of the night in playstyle but a shorter lighter tribute game  great game with solid fun mechanics and a definite treat for fans of lodoss

#####

this is a great castlevania metroid style game great range of enemies good controls and excellent music

#####

celebrating 30 years of this beloved franchise with an excellent metroidvania game was unexpected but very welcomed i think this is a mustplay for rolw fans its simply fantastic

#####

its ok but generally just not very interesting feels like developer followed the manual well but didnt bring anything really new or interesting to the table by all means you wont regret it if you need a short metroidvania in your life to scratch that very specific itch but you can probably find many games in the genre that pack a bigger punch

#####

still the best 90s anime elf

#####

short and sweet excellent sprite work music and gameplay story is a bit hard to follow though ive never seen the anime this is based on i imagine if i had it would have helped

#####

great metroidvania and an awesome lodoss war hook  after seeing all of those familiar faces beating it was sad as i wont see any more of them
short and sweet game recommended for any fan of the genre

#####

looking for a perfect metroidvania look no further filled with some innovations this game has caught me the same way castlevania  sotn has

#####

pretty fine game as it is but theres still be room for improvements
 aiming updown with the bow is kinda weird while flying since updown also controls altitude its like a kid moving their bodyarms while playing with a gamepad
 there are invisible barriers blocking you from flying to certain places
 all weapons have the same attack pattern but with some slightly different animations pokepokepokepoke
 attacks dont feel to have any weight to them at all maybe adding hitstops to make them more impacting it feels like slicing butter
 pause menu doesnt let you navigate the map might be an issue when it gets bigger
 cant change config after starting the game either the one with screen size audio and language can only change keybindings
 it could use some more exciting music and some crazy stuff like in luna nights but im sure well get those points at the ikarugastyle elements mechanics

#####

damn this is legit
i dunno what to say obviously it looks and sounds and feels a lot like castlevania symphony of the night however the controls of this game are way more fluent im kinda shocked by how much fun this game is by the time im writing this review ive barely scratched its surface but ive got a really good feeling this is gonna be one hell of a ride

edit i just finished the game it was awesome and feels very nostalgic 

#####

i know i know its early access
and i know its another metroidvania clone

but heres the thing i havent played a metroidvaniatype game since well super metroid and castlevania ii i find them often full of frustrating challenges that inevetiably send you searching the internet for a walkthrough

this game used color and onscreen cues to give enough clues for the more casual player me to actually enjoy the experience

plus its deedlit and i adore her so maybe im just a little biased

anyway its a great game that i will eagerly watch for updates

#####

amazing game but early access kills this for me

currently 4 chapters are released i beat all 4 in 71 minutes 
even at this price tag its just not worth it right now

biggest con is the length game is very well polished no bugs or issues its just very short

also it is not hard at all i did not even get close to death even a single time game mechanic has 2 elements and when one is charged it infinitely heals you sooo anytime your in danger just stop switch elements and full heal makes it way way to easy imagine castlevania but if you could pause the game and full heal at any moment 

finish the game remove the heal mechanic and this game will be amazing

#####

as a fan of the record of lodoss war anime and castlevania symphony of the night this game was quite a surprise to see even in its early access stage this already has good gameplay and beautiful art direction with its sprite work it takes what made symphony of the night great and has mechanics of its own

#####

21521 edit amazing fun boss fights with an old xbox game outland feel to thrm buy this game while its in early access

while it was fun and feels rewarding its basically a 13 demo at this point and i can only recommend you watch it 

although i cant recommend it as is its promising and if you dont mind the future investment go for it

91 edit much better get this and store it away until the game is complete or not im not your dad

#####

this is the first review i have ever written on steam and i have had steam since its inception and own hundreds of games i have always loved metroid and own the original super metroid on my snes and still actively play it to this day sotn is also one of my fav games and i also play it to this day i have searched for a game that captures the true sotnmetroid feel for over a decade and finally it is here this wonderful mechanically intricate beautifullydrawn game is it the art the music the feel  it is all here strongly recommend to anyone who is searching for the same  deedlit in wl is the game you are looking for

kudos to the development team for this incredible piece of art i look forward to the full version of this game and to playing this stunning masterpiece to completion thank you for making games like this we need them

#####

competent game with decent fanservice

#####

i first purchased and played record of lodoss war deedlit in wonder labyrinth shortly after its initial release onto early access based on what little i played back then a single chapter i already knew this game was something special having just finished it with 100 map completion for the first time i wanted to share my updated thoughts

at a glance youd think this was a ripoff of castlevania symphony of the night but rolwdiwl does enough to stand out that id argue that a lot of other games could stand to borrow some elements from it in fact i could say that it plays a bit like ikaruga though thatd also be selling the game short this game doesnt mess around in handing out new abilities right from the start as youll receive a limited but versatile hover ability a bow for firing arrows and wind and fire elements to toggle between within the first ten minutes what the game does with the abilities you receive is what makes it feel so unique

theres a lot going on and youll need to mix things up a lot especially during your first attempt at playing through the game dont cheat yourself by grinding for money and stocking up on healing items instead gain an understanding of the wind and fire elements using them to skillfully absorb various attacks while replenishing your health and magic gauges turning the tables during a battle that you maybe didnt start quite so strongly

combat feels incredible in this game especially during boss battles and i have to attribute that to deedlits varied movement options and the fact that  unlike nearly every other player character i can think of in a game of this style  deedlit doesnt stop in her tracks when you attack without jumping she instead trudges forward at a reduced speed and her attack animation changes to exhibit the strain and weight of her attacks

you might think it best to avoid this movement penalty by jumping around like an idiot as you might in other games of this style but no you really dont have much incentive to its actually really refreshing as i found myself playing so much more smoothly and not having to fight against the game mechanics as i would in some of my favorite games within the genre you feel like a force to be reckoned with when controlling deedlit as her abilities are generally a simple button press or hold away and theres little need to even dig around in menus

sure itll seem overwhelming at first but youll eventually find yourself switching between elements to raise each elements level or to restore health based on the situation all while steadily walking forward and poking holes in whatevers in your path maybe you need the increased air control that wind provides you with during jumps maybe you need the invincibility frames of the slide provided by fire

either way youll eventually find yourself switching back and forth to exploit enemies weaknesses with ease thanks to plenty of surfacelevel hud information and welldesigned controls again no need to dig through menus no managing equipment loadouts in menus no wasting time collecting items that make the game less of a chore to play heck theres even a minimap thatll help to reduce how often you need to view the full map

the soundtrack warrants some mention as well the music really drives you forward and i love the fact that it manages to be really intense while also sounding really elegant at times its an interesting mix to say the least

is rolwdiwl perfect certainly not theres definitely some great level design in spots but the game does suffer in plenty of other areas in this regard itd probably make more sense to allow for rightstick aiming with the bow the story isnt particularly interesting the game relies a bit too much on locked doors though the game at least doesnt insist on stuffing keys into your inventory at every turn still this game does so much right that its hard not to want to sing its praises i may not play through this game 100 times like i did with castlevania symphony of the night but i hope it manages to influence future games in the genre

#####

a heartfelt story of love and loss deedlit in wonder labyrinth is made by a small team its scope is smaller  with less items to gather and enemy types to combat nontheless its gameplay is satisfactory and this is where it counts i also really like the 16 bit fantasy pixel art unique to wonder labyrinth is the elemental affinity which reminds me a bit of ikaruga activiate the correct element and deedlit is able to soak damage and magic from the same element consequently shell also do less damage to enemies from the same element id say this is not a hard game besides some though bosses most enemies are slow to react fodder a first 100 map playthrough average player skill will take you roughly 7  9 hours

#####

i will mention things i like in this game and what not
contains some spoilers
upsides
 fast paced gameplay
 combat is pretty fun you have full aim of what youre doing
 lots of bosses compared to luna nights
 convenient speed for speedrunners
 fantastic soundtrack though i didnt like all of them but the 2nd boss theme goes hard
 a beastiary for completition conveniences
 interesting mechanics that also work around the enemies and several bosses
 beatiful graphics 
downsides
 very short specially for a metroidvania
 way too easy the only times youd truly struggle is by the final boss 1st phase or the boss rush before it otherwise a huge downwards spike compared to touhou luna nights though this is good for you casuals
 for normal players the game goes on too fast sometimes youd probably clear the game in 24 hours the only way youd increase this is to find the incredibly difficult to beat enemies one that requires a obscure method to find and one that runs away too fast and you need a special spell to kill it otherwise have fun wasting your time for that
 unlike touhou luna nights leveling up is a joke some players even managed to get to level 99 somehow and being like that possibly shreds anything in the game specially considering how theres no enemy incredibly strong for you at any time though im not sure as i never got to 99 meanwhile in the extra stage in ln you can simply get shredded by reimu regardless of skill
 incredibly linear for a metroidvania all the bosses you fight will always be in order and the only shortcuts there is are just to backtrack to previous areas theres no optional bosses in this game at all which makes trying to 100 it more boring the ending is only altered by a bit if you 100 the map too which i wouldnt bother with trying that

overall this is a rather nice game overall but if you want a more fun experience try luna nights even if it has less bosses or something it depends on your tastes

#####

this game was really great and im glad i took the time to play it
its not the hardest metroidvania ive ever played but sometimes its nice to have a challenge you can handle without hours of skill grind

in particular i liked that you could change elements to absorb attacks and regain health it added a sort of flow to combat i cant really compare with another games in the genre successfully dodging though attacks by shifting elements felt really satisfying 

also apparently this is a port of  dreamcast game which is pretty cool but you would know it by the look alone it would blend in well with modern games like timespinner and axiom verge

if youre worried about not knowing whats going on because youre unfamiliar with lodoss war the game gives you enough context to know why characters matter within the context of the game so you shouldnt be too lost to enjoy it

looking forward to more from this dev team

#####

as someone who had to get a fan dub of this on vhs in the 90s ive craved a proper lodoss game like this forever i really enjoyed the battle system and thought it was a lot of fun deedlit is responsible for my love of anime elf girls and im glad shes finally allowed to be completely in the spotlight here

#####

h1disclaimerh1
i finished the game once before reviewing i played without grinding or using restorative items which could make the game easier

h1tldrh1
it wears symphony of the night on its sleeve but thats not a bad thing if youre gonna copy your homework make sure you copy from the best

it was a great palette cleanser after i didnt like blasphemous i loved it so much that it made me check out the anime game is a bit short but pretty sweet and the only real issue is some jarring difficulty spikes and maybe a bit too much linearity in progression

recommended to any metroidvania fan

h1descriptionh1
i will refer to this game as lodoss war since full title is too much

lodoss war is a metroidvania very similar to the granddaddy of the genre  castlevania symphony of the night down to the longass title

you play as deedlit  an elven warrior who finds herself trapped in the titular labirynth she doesnt have any memory of how she got there or whats her goal but she receives weird sometimes sinister visions that slowly uncover the truth the game does the bare minimum to provide context for the story but im sure knowing the source material would be at least helpful in easing yourself into this one i didnt know anything about it before playing and it didnt really bother me i will say that the game could very much contain spoilers for the original material since its set after the events of record of lodoss war

gameplaywise this is again a copy of symphony of the night you have a jump a backwards dash and an attack button where it differs is how fluid your attacks combo together and that you can attack in more directions although i may just misrimember that symphony had no diagonal or upwarddownward attacks you will also unlock 2 spirits  fire and wind  which you can switch between spirits provide immunity to their damage type as well as provide other abilities like gliding or dodging some of which get unlocked later on you also unlock a bow which you can use to solve puzzles and of course  shoot enemies you also have some magic spells some for damage some for support

a lot of the games bosses and platforming segments rely on quickly switching between your spirits to make use of their abilities and dealing damage whenever you have the chance

the world is divided into several nonlinear levels that usually contain some key items you need to obtain to move on to the next boss

h1prosh1
b responsiveb
controls are snappy you can switch directions quick you can control how high your jumps are switching between spirits and using different abilities works as expected

really this is just fun to play because you feel in control of every move as opposed to something like blasphemous a game i played before this where your character woudlnt react in a busy avalanche of button presses no matter what amount of inputs you throw at deedlit  she has no problem with responding in the way you tell her to

just like a woman should

did the joke land man i hope i havent insulted anyone with this one

its not altogether true though i just said that for the joke some inputs like attacks for some weapons commit you to pretty long animations compared to quicker weapons this may result in having to wait to readjust your orientation or stop you from ducking quickly you could say that this is acceptable due to slower weapons having usually longer reach and higher damage so you need to learn to use them more mindfully

b looks greatb
movement animation is smooth just like in symphon

if i have to say that name again

environments are crisp and nice to look at would love native resolution to be a little higher but thats not a huge problem enemies explode in a satisfying manner and visual detail goes well to form a cohesive whole with the games mechanics you can clearly tell when you kill something or when its immune to your damage etc

b dynamicb
i probably wouldnt mention this if i havent played blasphemous before it but lodoss war is quick most enemies take just a few hits to kill they explode and you move on its satisfying to rush through stages enemies also respawn when you reenter the room so having a quick fighting system was a must and this game delivers especially compared to blasphemous which was slow cumbersome unresponsive and felt like a horrid grind with enemies having far too much hp and being able to do a lot of damage per hit

situation in lodoss war is further helped by the spirit system which powers you up to the point where you regenerate hp if you can deal a lot of hits without getting hit yourself its integral for making good progress or when fighting tough bosses

b takes me backb
to the time where a lot of stuff were simple deedlit is a goodlooking female protagonist who achieves being a strong fighter without sacrificing her feminine beauty the mechanics are similar to other metroidvania titles without much new but also without anything feeling implemented badly

its very easy to like lodoss war for what it is because what it is was already tried and tested before and its not a bad thing that it follows the footsteps of those games

innovation is good but sometimes its good to play something familiar and fun

h1consh1
b a bit shortb
its always nice when the main bad thing i have to say about a game is that i would have liked more of the game to be in the game maps aint big and since its not superdifficult  you will probably finish it quite quick 45h  thats what i got for my first playthrough

b uneven difficultyb
this is a pretty easy game for about 95 of it most bosses i would defeat on first try some i would have to redo 23 times but nothing too tough but then there are just a few bosses that are huge difficulty spikes with very nasty stunlock attacks huge damage and attack patterns that are quite difficult to react to

i feel the game would benefit a lot from an even difficulty curve where you could get eased into the difficult parts gradually instead of having just some bosses be that much of a difference

b linearb
the only nonlinear part of the game comes in form of special items hidden about or behind abilities like doublejump which you unlock during main quest unlike some metroidvanias that have whole areas hidden behind optional key items  this one does not seem to have that

h1lowdownh1
its not cheap for the amount of playtime so you may want to wait for a discount but game itself is quality and if you like metroidvanias  you will enjoy it

id give lodoss war an
h1810h1
its been a nice palette cleanser after slogging through blasphemous which was overdesigned slow cumbersome inconsistent and frankly not fun despite looking great lodoss war is a great example that its more important to focus on making the game play well than making it look nice

#####

now that it has fully released i can wholeheartedly say this is an amazing game it is a solid metraidvania and the fire and wind elements still make a great puzzle element the music is memorable and catchy the controls are on point and the bosses are a great challenge i would recomend this game to anyone who likes video games let alone metroidvanias

#####

much metroid very castlevania wow

#####

a must have game if you like metroidvania style but you must be skilled with 49 hours you can finish

#####

ロードス島戦記 story frame  happy memories  metroid type  ディードリット 

#####

ladybug does it again

fun metroidvanialite and i wasnt expecting an ikaruga like mechanic of swapping to absorb certain attacks

#####

a good one of these

#####

if you need a comfortable reboot of a metroidvania and want a bit more puzzleish solving then this is a good one the platforming is solid although the punishment for getting hit is very castlevania i absolutely love the soundtrack with its early ps1 vibes very clearly stated if you need a break from punishing yourself with dead cells then this is a good pick me up

#####

if youre a fan of record of lodoss wars you will love this if youre a fan of castlevania sotn or bloodstained youll like it although not as polished graphically as a cv game the music is spot on and the controls are also pretty much perfect once you get the hang of floating in air with the sylph cant wait until the rest is released as the red and yellow doors are still locked and ive covered the whole map up to this point including secret walls i do love the lodoss cameos all good stuff here btw dont be surprised of the opening of the game pregame its just the engine the game runs on

#####

really nice looking metroidvania for whose who want to get something shorter in length

#####

if you liked touhou luna nights same developers team ladybug and dont mind the fact that the length of this one is also on the shorter side i would definitely recommend it to any fan of the metroidvania genre stylistically the game is very similar to touhou luna nights in terms of user interface sprites art style and music more symphonic and less upbeat in this one though however when it comes to gameplay and mechanics its very different and probably has more in common with the highly influential castlevania symphony of the night although you utilise and accumulate magic in an entirely different way which i dont want to completely spoil for you but its similar to the elemental switching in bullet hell game ikaruga or the genderflipping in flipwitch bosses are creatively implemented and require you to strategically alternate between abilities spirit powers and thinkreact quickly when doing so exploration is about as creative as in any standard metroidvania in the last 5 years not amazing but good enough overall difficulty is about the same as touhou luna nights challenging moments but not stress inducing like blasphemous controls are fluid and responsive with very little noticeable latency so far this and grime are looking like the contenders for the best metroidvanias of this year 


ps i have actually never seen the anime so i cant speak to how respectful it is to original story or how the fans of it will respond the overall plot seems a little bit vague to me but it would probably make more sense if i knew the backstory for all the characters

#####

 weak level design almost every room has the same layout map feels cramped and it is difficult to spot unexplored paths
 there is almost no incentive to revisit old areas in fact the whole game doesnt feel like an interconnected world but rather a set of levels
 story will make absolutely no sense for people not familiar with source material and even if you do it is barely there
 ui looks nice and stylized but is sometimes difficult to read in the heat of the action
 many areas especially later on are absolutely cramped with enemies and it becomes really tedious rather than fun
 music got tiresome really quick
 most encounters can be trivialized by invisibility spam
 combat is very fast and promotes aggressive gameplay even boss fights can be finished under a minute on the other hand your health can also deplete quickly and you can even be stunned for a few painful seconds
 animation and pixel art is very impressive

overall it is an okay metroidvania worth picking up on sale

#####

the game is a nice blend of castlevaniasymphony of the night and ikaruga that clocks in at around 56 hours i hope they reuse these assets and expand on it to a grander scope like sotn

#####

this game is a fun but simplestraightforward metroidvania the ost is good the artworkdesign is in my opinion good as far as pixel art is concerned and you can tell the developer put a lot of time and effort into their game the only problem with this game is that it is rather short and generally grinding levels is where it takes more time but despite that i say the game is still worth playing if you liked record of lodoss war enjoy metroidvania and you have a few dollars to spare youll most likely enjoy this game

#####

great and brief game that offers the charm and breadth of sotn while improving combat by borrowing tested defensive mechanics from titles like cave story and ikaruga
boss fights are a highlight and theres a lot of em hardly any separation between attacks to dodge and opportunities to attack and always room for several strategies and playstyles with the amount of options available to you
the sprites and effects are incredible and the passion that went into this project is easy to appreciate ladybug has made another absolutely solid work that is worth giving your time and im looking forward to more

beyond here are some minor issuesbug reports for version 1026
bugs
the player can jump high enough to see the tiles run out at the top of narses boss arena with the double jump and even walk outside the level with the higher jump
if falling for with the fire slide for long enough the animation will not loop correctly
accessibility
when afterimages are turned off please disable more afterimage effects like on some bossesenemies and on the players backdash
the bright effect when using warp rooms and especially the flashing lights after beating the final boss seem very dangerous i dont have epilepsy issues normally but these effects still hurt my eyes

#####

the animation in this game is stunning controls are responsive and tight the fairy system seems compelling only had about 30 minutes to play so far but already really loving it

#####

i just finished my first playthrough with 100 map completed feels fairly short its a good game but i wish i waited for a sale

so i havent seen the anime that this is based on and they dont explain anything about who anyone is or what their relationships are the game just assumes you already know by the time i finished the game i still dont really know who these people are theexplanationfor what is going i accurately guessed within the first few minutes which is a bummer because it made me care about what was going on basically not at all oh well who needs a story in a metroidvania game

so you basically play as a gender swapped alucard from sotl but instead of having vampire magic you get elemental magic  many of deedlits moves and controls are exactly the same there are a few new mechanics you get a bow and have two elemental familiars the bow isnt a super big deal you can aim up and down but i mostly just used it to hit switches and open doors

the familiars are a big deal the air elemental lets you hover feather fall add wind damage to your attacks and makes you immune to wind damage the fire elemental adds fire damage and makes you immune to fire damage its nice to be immune to lava or a dragons fire breath they add more damage the more hits you get without taking damage basically a combo system and give health regeneration when full this is how youll get most of your healing and you lose 13 of you combo bar when hit also using fire charges up the air elemental and using wind charges up the fire elemental the total gameplay effect is that youll want to switch elementals a lot to add the right damage regenerate health or block elemental damage sometimes twice in a single jump or every second or two its a neat change but its really easy to lose track in the heat of combat take a few hits get stunned then get killed in most boss fights youll either totally dominate them and never get hit more than twice or youll get hit a third time stun locked and killed while you just stand there watching feels pretty cheap but not awful

the map is set up in exactly the same way as sotl including where they like to hide items metroidvania veterans will easily spot the breakable walls and see where on the map that secret rooms are most likely to be found

#####

i dont recommend this game even i am a fan of record of lodoss war

1 game is too short
2 repeat monster skills  boss skills
3 lack of depth for melee weaponsno combo  similar function
4 imbalance between melee weapons  magicsome bosses are easy to defeat by using willothe wisp but extremely hard by using melee
5 basically no story
6 too expensive for the game quality

the game is more like a doujin game


#####

game is really fun cant wait for it to be completed  one of the better metroidvania the firewind ikaruga aspect is a great mechanic also

#####

great metroidvania the first bosses might feel a bit too easy the latest one too hard unless you use invisibility thats the ultimate boss skill

love the style and gameplay the only issue i have with the story is that it assumes deep knowledge of the franchise the story is perfectly understandable but all the emotional attachment when you see old characters reappear is gone if you dont know the lore already

#####

the outstanding visual style award 2020 looking forward to full release

#####

beautiful but incredibly short definitely a mustplay if you like the anime but will still be appealing if you havent seen record of lodoss war

#####

exciting follow up to symphony of the knight and all the games that inspired them the presentation is beautiful the gameplay feels incredible and overall the game feels tight and focused i was able to sit down and beat this game in one sitting because it was too fun to stop playing

like metroidvanias then buy this game

#####

tldr play this if youre absolutely starved for metroidvanias and have already played luna nights

again i wish there was a neutral rating option because despite being a massive letdown for me its still very enjoyable
im gonna focus on gameplay in this review the controls artstyle and animations are great story and music are okay 

this game borrows ideas and mechanics heavily from team ladybugs previous game touhou luna nights and obviously sotn and yet its somehow way worse than both of these games 
games too short the basic enemies and bosses are way too easy youll spend 90 of the encounters just mashing the attack button the attack has only one animation for each weapon type it isnt 1997 anymore and spamming the skills whenever you can puzzles are as basic as they get and it still suffers from the same problem luna nights had where the devs artificially spike the difficulty by spawning 20 enemies in every room and making you backtrack through it 4 times because thats fun 
the enemy moveset and boss patterns are uninspired and so are the skills mc uses and even though i recognize that the developers mayve been limited by the source material it still isnt an excuse

no achievements as of 10 either or other modes like luna nights had not nearly enough content for the full price compared to other steam games of this type you can easily beat it in about 3h if you dont go looking for all the secret items 

510  disappointing

#####

yep

#####

great game

#####

a simple yet highly enjoyable metroidvania

a bit too easy to be honest but the game is still very fun to play and its pixel art is great

its particularly enjoyable for those who readwatched the record of lodoss wars series back in the day as that gives the game a touch of nostalgia and melancholy that makes the experience that much more powerful

#####

this game is absolutely amazing  im a huge fan of metroidvanias and this tickled every single spot  the mechanics are i cant find the words its just so well made and plays so smoothly  just  play it  buy it  great game

#####

one of the best metroidvania games ive ever played takes a lot of queues from symphony of the night but still manages to create its own identity in a couple of ways this game innovates on the format and does a lot of things a metroidvania should do being able to just run through save points without needing to press up is so convenient and being allowed to attack in 8 directions varies gameplay without needing to have fighting game inputs 

the pixel art is great if not jut as good as symphony of the night or portrait of ruin music is not as striking as i would have liked but the sound design is good 

i hope to see more games like this more 2d metroidvanias because they are so fun and so is this game

#####

this game rocks my socks

#####

 symphony of wonder 
810

wonder labyrinth will be familiar to the fans of metroidvania especially symphony of the night the combat and exploring the labyrinth is a good time but the game is a bit linear and short if comparing to castlevania or hollow knight the difficulty is also a bit too easy for me but that maybe im too used to metroidvania game theres some variety of weapon and bow selection to choose from and from time to time deedlit will earn a new abilities or magic the spirit switching mechanic is fun and kinda remind me of lord of shadow overall its a short and sweet for a 10 metroidvania and if youre a fan of the genre or the anime you should check it out also i double dip this wonderful game for the sweet physical on switch because its that good and deserve more attention

great level design
beautiful sprite work
fun combat
the spirit switching mechanic is fun
great music

too short
and kinda linear
too easy

#####

good

#####

its fantastic but a bit too short i think

#####

this is one of the best games i have ever played even if you are completely unaware of the lodoss series you can still enjoy the game this game is essentially castlevania sotn for the pc with a female protagonist a lot of qol improvements and tons of weapons and spells to keep you occupied and engaged 

personally i prefer this a bit more than bloodstained too many dlcs for my liking i am a sucker for gorgeous pixel art compared to cellshade or 3d models but that could just be me if you like metroid or the castlevania series up until the ds then you need to get this game pronto

#####

deedlit in depression pit has finally reached 10 and its fantastic
a surprisingly large map for a rather short playthrough makes for a perfect pace of not being to long for its own good or too short that it underdelivers just like the best games in the genre absolute must have if you like this kind of game even if youre not familiar with the ovas

#####

good boss fights their awesomethe games areas are interesting pixel art and animation are high class as someone who loves castlevania its a huge a in my opinion

#####

its sotn but with deedlit and it plays as good as it looks while i do recommend it be advised that this is just a demo

#####

this is an extremely polished game and fun to play

#####

a fun quick searchaction game dont let the title put you off you dont need to know what record of lodoss war is to enjoy this cause i dont know what it is but the story is simple enough to know what is happening without prior knowledge this feels like a highly polished doujin game and the people who made it clearly love the metroidvania genre well worth the time

#####

beautifully animated light metroidvania  i have to admit i was surprised to see this come out given how long ago the original source material first released but this ended up being a bit of a gem  the pixel art is exceptional the base controls are really fun to engage with and i enjoyed exploring the map  while the world does support backtracking and exploration the core thrust of the game is fairly linear by metroidvania standards  i think my only real critique is that about halfway through the magic system starts to dominate combat more than i would like but really thats a small quibble  if the trailer looks interesting to you you wont be disappointed



#####

the game is short and sweet right now but thats to be expected for early access  if you enjoyed sotn you will undoubtedly enjoy this  ive been a fan of the franchise since ive heard about it and this was a pleasant addition to it  my only gripe is that the options menu is lacking  there needs to be a way to turn down music and sound effects individually as the music can get pretty loud

#####

the gameplay is great love the audio and visuals as well
the fact they can give you limited flight right away in the early game and still design the levels to be challenging is nothing short of impressive to me

however i have to say that as a fan of lodoss war i keep having major disconnects with this game its wears its castlevania inspirations on its sleeve and just feels like they decided lets take deedlit and the other cast of lodoss and just slap them into a castlevania game complete with the classic gothic horror aesthetic that is iconic to those games  i really think they should have spent more time trying to aim for a more high fantasy look then the gothic castle have the catacomb style levels be dwarven ruins put some elven stuff here and there so on and so forth

#####

early access review proscons at bottom

less than 2 minutes into this game i knew i had found a worthy 2d platform adventure rpg all the memories and impressions of my first time playing super metroid and castlevania sotn came flooding back in all their vibrance it was a new game yet it felt familiar in an way that is intuitive to anyone who has played more than a couple games in the genre
i eagerly awaited each new screen new enemy new artifact and new weapon with curiosity and a sense of adventure i was primed to start contemplating different play styles weapon choices loudouts physical weaponmagic combinations etc i was ready

then i encountered the color swap mechanic or polarity change or whatever the heck people are calling it it is the same mechanic that games like ikaruga use which i never liked to me it made those games seem more like watereddown puzzle games wrapped in a bullethell shootemup skin
my spirit immediately fell why because i wanted a classic game with new twists not old gimmicks imported from other genres i confess however that i may not be able to explain the difference between them all i know is i thought crp this is going to turn into another frenetic comboheavy fighting gamecontrol twitcher fest that is unfriendly to previous gen gamers or gamers who are looking for a more straightforward experience

yeah i am sure many of you are thinking retire grandpa if you cant handle this heat go to pornhub and beat your never mind you get it i will not go into a tirade about how diversity in gamer demographics is good for the industry and how devs should consider the increasing age of gamer demographics but it is something to consider

so i was completely prepared to start hating this game especially after the first boss kicked me face in twice i confess however both of my first attempts were while wholly blotto then i tried umm sober i won by an acceptable margin not too difficult but not a cakewalk i began to think ok maybe i jumped to conclusions about the colorswap mechanic
by the time i finished the demo  and this game is so short it really is only a demo  i was convinced again of its glory

criticism for devs
animation
the backdash animation is confusing it would be nice to know where my character is ending up right now you effectively disappear and reappear behind your former position make the backdash more obvious and traceable otherwise the animations are wonderful

no glossary
i had no idea what the dice mean and cannot figure out what the various stats are purple red yellow what the hell am i looking at
the level thing of each spirit is also a little confusing

spirits
the fire spirit was useless compared to the wind spirit perhaps find a more practical environmental noncombat use give us a reason to keep it selected while adventuring

menus and interface
a bit clumsy for people using a controller
the mini map was too mini either make it more or visible and navigable on screen or relegate it to a separate screen

suggestions for devs
armor
armor and accessories might be a nice addition to make it feel much more realized and substantial

more spirits
if you had not already considered it adding more spirits  each with their advantages  would really allow for customizable gameplay

spells and abilities
same as above

i am sure you have thought of these things but i wanted to endorse their development
best of luck devs you have a potential fantastic game going on here

pros
style
graphics

record of lodoss is a pretty okish game i wish i could rate it meh but honestly it flips more towards not recommended than recommended

the game pales in comparison to touhou  luna nights both in terms of visuals and mechanics its not that the game is uglier  its not  or that it doesnt have cool mechanics of its own but it doesnt come close in terms of how memorable it is

to start off you get strong way too quickly to the point where youre basically breezing through almost every boss at the first encounter even bosses with multiple forms you quickly wonder is there going to be an actual stronger form afterwards only to just end the fight in a nonclimatic way

theres a spirit system in the game where you can control both wind and fire spirits and theyre responsible for about 50 of the gameplay mechanics maybe a bit more you have to change between fire and wind to deal damage to enemies or overcome obstacles but due to the level system where your damage raises and your health regens based on the level of your spirit you can quickly become way overpowered if you learn how to balance between the wind and fire spirit your spirit level is separate from wind and fire and you get exp for a spirit by using the opposite spirit when killing enemies at first it might seem like its harder to improve the spirit you want but it quickly becomes the opposite  you can only get to max level 3 on the spirits and lose a level on the current spirit youre using every time youre hit and using the opposite spirit means that you can get hit as many times as you want provided youre switching between them often enough this is mostly true for bosses that drop the spirit exp like crazy

most of the map looks sameish and being a metroidvania game very remnant of symphony of the night it really pales in comparison its separated into chapters the chapters names are not translated from japanese and i have no idea why the map is interconnected like any metroidvania separating the game into weird chapter change pauses really doesnt make sense specially since nothing is stopping you from just going back the very instant you enter the new chapter area and its not relevant to the story build up or exploration i guess its because of the demo version which only had chapter 1 i believe  but in the full game it really doesnt add up

lastly and i am totally aware that this is a personal problem but i feel like its important enough to mention since most of the people playing this game will face the same issue record of lodoss war is based on an rpg series of the same name that exist almost exclusively in japan  being a game that heavily draws from its lore it becomes really hard to really grasp the importance of the characters being introduced as they are not original or exclusive to this game with the exception of one or two i believe and the story focuses on key points from previous gamesmedia and even though you dont have to know the background of the story it really makes it hard to truly appreciate what you are looking at and sometimes even understanding it at all

that being said i really only recommend this game to people who are really out of options for better metroidvania games as i feel replaying sotn or touhou  luna nights would have been a better use of the time spent playing this game or to people who are already fans of the record of lodoss war series i wish i had a better opinion on this game as it was gifted to me by someone who was important to me but alas it was a dissapointment

#####

this is a really good game i enjoy it a lot but but it lacks of replay value

#####

probably the most beautifully animated pixel art ive ever seen look up a video of it sometime its really gorgeous
the gameplay is also very good estimated playtime 610 hours theres an ikarugalike aspect to the combat thats a fun and unique take on the format

continues with the team ladybug tradition of difficult but incredibly welldesigned and made metroidvanias 
i dont know what else to say if you like metroidvanias this is one and one of the best

#####

as of the time of this review this game has about an hour of gameplay  if you are looking at the trailer video and thinking fond memories of castlevania sotn or like metroidvania games in general youre going to like this  a lot  controls are fluid and intuitive graphics and sound are good  fun gameplay

im not familiar with the source material record of lodoss war but that didnt impact my enjoyment

my only complaint is similar to the others  you will likely finish this in approximately an hour  id agree with other reviews that this is much like an extended demo  for now im okay with that your mileage may vary in that regard  im extremely excited about future updates to this game assuming that updates come at a reasonable pace

#####

a fine metroidvania rpg with lots to offer it is a labyrinth all yours to explore and uncover its secrets it has many weapons that give variety in the feeling of the weapon and movement while striking apart from melee weapons you get bows and magical abilities that create a fun atmosphere in this maze enemies dont have a few differences either so you wont get bored battling the same monster over and over again the graphics are nice  but not top  and aesthetically pleasing the soundtrack and sounds are ok but nothing memorable

 all in all it is quite fun and it offers many things from simple upgrades to new abilities exploring becomes a happy activity there is a high chance that many times you will feel lost in this maze and wont know where to go or what to do but youll eventually discover the correct path new power ups weapons and abilities help with this in some way this is a good thing for your level up and the level 3 charging of skills to make you feel powerful but without making the game a breeze its always challenging in some way in between all the combats you get to solve many puzzles in this labyrinth to progress further in the story

 the game has no real tutorial and you get taught what you need to know and how to use it from progressing usually this is not a problem but you still may have some questions there is a help book but not a hint path or directions the controlling is solid and fluid and i doubt youd want to change something one more feature i liked  and i like it everywhere it exists  is the market system i love buying and selling stuff and collecting all the gear

 i would say the best mechanic in the game is the spirit system thats what makes it the most fun i only wish they had utilized it more for progression there is a big con in this game and this is its story its very confusing and most of the times you wont understand what is going on the dialogues are fun and funny on their own but in the scale of the big picture they dont mean much

 bbe very mindful if you are epileptic or light sensitive that this game  without a warning  has flashing images and changes in color all of a suddenb

 this game lived up to my expectations and i have no major disliking in something i only wish the story was more coherent and better written to make more sense and they used the spirit system in a greater length and for more things i loved the gameplay style and mechanics as well as the labyrinth setting it didnt tire me except on a few occasions and all in all it was an awesome experience you can feel the love that has been put into this game

this great metroidvania pretty much perfectly imitates the art style and feel of symphony of the night

pros
 fun physics puzzles with your bow
 windfire combodefense system feels natural and allows needed health regeneration when travelling between save points
 elemental weaknesses system feels impactful and makes boss fights easier with preparation

cons
 you have to read thru all the weapon descriptions to understand their elemental attributes  i wish the weapons had elemental icons right in the weapons list
 the map is a little bland and straightforward

#####

i thoroughly enjoyed the two hours of gameplay record of lodoss diwl currently has to offer at the time of me writing this review 
if youre a fan of ps1 classic castlevania symphony of the night or hollow knight for that matter i would recommend buying this game not only to enjoy what quality gameplay it has to offer but also to support its development team to continue adding content for this game
likes 
tactile feeling animation running sliding jumping dodging attacking shooting spells all feel satisfying on press
sprites system adds an interesting guard like system that allows recovery as well as special abilities like levitation or fire damage makes boss battles very fun in my personal opinion as you have to switch sprites on the fly to negate damage and heal
level  character enemy design  animations they have a great spriter on their team
soundtrack love that funky bass in stage 1 definitely want to hear more themes from their composer

dislikes
quantity it is short in its current stage like i said it is about two hours if youre blazing through and die a few times so i understand any hesitation on purchasing
story a bit vague currently might help to watch the anime to get some clues on character relationships im assuming i dont know a whole lot about record of lodoss war other than that it is vaguely based on a dd campaign and has manga and anime adapted from that

critiques suggestions to team ladybug
animated backgrounds would be a good addition the waterfall in the background would bring more quality of life with it being animated as well as the dungeon in stage 2 adding some bats flying in the back would add a great amount of quality despite it seeming easily unnoticeable
a bestiary monster log as well as a journal for deedlit just something to add optional lore storytelling elements
spot dodge for enemies that rush you the troll or wolf or even arrows from goblins can be annoying and a spot dodge similar to that of king of fighters would add a smooth addition to combat instead of just jumping or backstepping or even a reposte or parry of sorts would be cool
destructables items theres some secrets and exploding barrels but no candles or anything to break for any loot even adding minor items to break for small amounts of gold that dont respawn like enemies do obv would be nice or even usable items would be a cool addition though not entirely necessary







#####

easily the best combat in any metroidvania exploring the world isnt very interesting however story is pretty much meaningless for anyone who doesnt know much about lodoss war stuff overall very fun would recommend to a fan of the genre but not to anyone looking to get in to metroidvanias get it when it is on sale

#####

this game is pretty good if you enjoyed touhou luna nights i would recommend this for sure however the design of the map is noticeably less enjoyable than luna nights on top of that while the platforming is snappy and responsive the combat doesnt do a good job of implementing it in the same way luna nights did the boss battles are more about having the right weaponmagic whereas touhou was more about balancing precision platforming with dealing damage which i definitely enjoyed luna nights is a bit more of a challenging and intense experience compared to this which is a bit slower and more relaxed most of the time

this game has a few great ideas namely the puzzles theyre not logic puzzles whatsoever that you do with the bow i though they were really fun but unfortunately theres only like 15 times in the whole game you use them and theyre all really easy there was definitely more potential for introducing the bow into combat since its relatively useless in boss battles

as far as the story goes similar to luna nights its not particularly deep or gripping and most of the characters are literally incomprehensible due to the lack of any kind of exposition still the story is pretty minimal and i found this one a little more endearing than luna nights

if youve played platformers before you can easily finish this game in about 4 hours with no replayability value or postgame content its fun and neat but i would only recommend picking it up on a sale or if you have money burning a hole in your pocket

#####

tldr 910 short and sweet and worth the money

i am a fan of this genre so felt i was bound to like this game too and yes i did like this game a lot

its not a long game at all its pretty short it only took me 7 hours to beat the game with 100 map completion but for the asking price i think thats very reasonable the controls are responsive and satisfying and the mechanics are all very well polished

at times i felt the game had a bit of a problem with enemies piling on damage while i was recovering from the last hit or being stunned leading to a few deaths but because of the abundance of save points and versatile attack strategies to counter these enemies these deaths were never irritating

the music and visuals are amazing and brings the presentation together with a lot of flair

if i had some critique it would probably be the following

the equipment system feels somewhat redundant especially from the shop since you will progress the game and find better weapons before you have time to start appreciating the ones you already have while some weapons have elemental properties that deal more damage to certain enemies i never found myself relying on this to the extent i had to switch gear speaking of elemental attacks

the expanded elemental system feels entirely pointless you always have access to wind and fire element at the press of a button and no enemy is resistant to both if they guard against wind hit them with fire and vice versa therefore the addition of light dark water wood and earth elements added almost nothing to the game whatsoever equipping high power gear relying only on fire and wind and casting the wisp spell for its homing ability got me through the game just fine from beginning to end

however neither of these critiques detract from my enjoyment of the game whatsoever they just seemed superfluous it was a fun time beginning to end and im happy i finally got to play it

#####

its fun briefly rather disappointed that a demo is being used as a placeholder for an early access game not exactly sure what people are raving about this build of the game ends after about 40 minutes of gameplay you experience very limited and buggy skills abilities and weapons no loot drops and a tiny portion of the map to explore this is hardly enough to make a recommendation for it in this state 

further details

its a classic metroidvania with everything in the moveset from sotn youre basically alucard
you can swing your sword straight up or diagonally
it uses an annoying elemental system to pass obstacles and block specific projectiles example blue barrier use blue ability red barrier use red ability and so on this nonsense is further exacerbated by the fact that you will need to be in specific elements to even attack some common enemies or it will simply deflect think of how annoying this was in lords of shadow grrr
the item rooms are unique in a way that they force you to ricochet arrows around the room to cut a rope holding a door shut
music and art style are top tier for a 2d side scroller
its based on the lodoss war anime

#####

perfection

#####

it would seem i fall into the category of having some previous experience and attachment if im to be honest with the lodoss franchise from way too many years ago while that in itself is not a prerequisite it definitely helps to elevate the experience as the game pretty much carries the same feel across

as a metroidvania its a little on the light side with a relatively short completion time and lack of gameplay settings or extra modes on the other hand what you do get is pretty condensed and solid a well crafted game with level design that hits the mark fluid gameplay beautiful audiovisuals wide enemy variety and some fun unique mechanics

the english localisation does have some obvious dents to it but weve all seen oldschool arcade games from japan with far worse right

i definitely recommend if youre aware of what youre getting into
 if youre looking for the next genredefining hit that every game is going to copy for 20 years youll most likely end up disappointed
 if youre going for an enjoyable weekend afternoon romp with characters and a setting you know or outright cherish this should be right up your alley
 if you just like pretty games it might be relevant to your interests

depending on your tastes you can consider waiting for a sale i dont regret the 13 quid i paid for it at all

#####

overall deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a fun but slightly disappointing metroidvania that includes a couple of really cool ideas but doesnt do nearly enough with them sure the pixel art is to die for and the ikarugaesque color swapping mechanics are neat but the experience is held back by lackluster enemies stale and uninspired level design as well as overpowered easily exploitable mechanics that end up trivializing boss fights its not a bad game per se which is why im still giving it a thumbs up albeit a weak one but i really wish there was more substance to it more meat on its proverbial bones

#####

really great adventurearpgmetroidvania with a budget price but quality execution my only complaint is that there isnt enough of it but im an instant fan great animation solid game design fun game play an absolute recommendation

#####

outstanding game it embodies everything that makes a metroidvania great and adds some really fun mechanics i love the element system bosses are challenging and fun the environments are beautiful and the artwork is beautiful cannot wait for the full game to be released i want more

#####

i loved the gameplay 

suggest armor equip to be added to the game to give it more complexity also deedlit seems to use all the weapons in the same fashion suggest the weapon gameplay should changed based on the equipped weapon she cannot wields an axe the same way she wields a sword the weapon motion and weight should be reflected in her attacks differently for each weapon type

#####

super very fun this tastes like sotn d

#####

my favorite metroidvania of all time the music atmosphere and artwork detail is hauntingly beautiful i am a huge lodoss fan and loved seeing all the familiar faces throughout the game the developers really did an excellent job making you feel like you were apart of lodoss universe the length was perfect as was the pacing of gameplay highly recommend if you enjoyed sotn

#####

short but so so sweet  an excellent inclusion into the metroidvania pantheon  playing through really made me consider watching the anime adaptations of rolw and reading the manga

#####

it took a few minutes but once i got into this game i couldnt put it down

#####

about an hour and a half worth of content in so far but nonetheless a solid game with a few interesting mechanics that set it apart from games ive played but so far thats about it for content yet im hopeful for more content to come 

disclaimer i have not seen the animemangalight novel that this is related to

#####

well its early access and only about an hour of gameplay right now but uh this game whips ass

#####

good quality classical metroidvania game with some of its own unique mechanics it is a bit short 45 hours but makes up for it with the quality of the content id recommend to get this game on a sale

#####

the story takes a smash bros approach to story telling remember this character from the manga here fight fight fight and thats it if you havent read the manga which i didnt then you have no clue who anyone is i mean it doesnt matter in the grand scheme of things castlevania games dont need a story but if it had a really gripping and engaging story i wouldnt be sitting here complaining that the game should have had less of a story would i 

game play is basically just castlevania difficulty is very low with all your spells auto aiming so most bosses just turn into you running around dodging and repeatably casting spells or rather just the stone blast as that thing is clearly the strongest spell in the game yet you get it as the 2nd one the enemies have varying immunities and weakness yet your main attack can only switch fire and wind so again amplifying the opness of spells 

also there is no need to have your element levels to constantly flash in the middle of the screen when they reach level 3 after a while you get used to it and stop looking there but it is what initally stopped me from even considering buying the game by just looking at gameplay footage 

a lot of people call this the best metroidvania of the year and they are right but not because it does anything really well but instead because a lot of companies seem to have a very hard time figuring out what makes a good metroidvania game and even trip over the low hurdle of just 101 copying castlevania

#####

im very pleased that rolw is making a comeback to gaming and what a comeback it is
lets face it its a sotn clone but a very well made one
the experience is short for now it is early access after all but what is delivered is polished and already very promising

gameplay is smooth fast and with a fresh touch 
animation quality from the sprite art is superb in my opinion
metroidvania at its finest in formula however that should be the norm with games like this

the only negative in my opinion at the time of writing is that the health regen granted by the spirit system is making the game extremely easy

keep it up team ladybug im excited for the development

this is honestly what i wanted out of bloodstained

#####

i love the franchise its based on deedlit is awesome and team ladybug made an amazing game the animation is phenomenal beautiful even and does unique creative things with its solid gameplay loved it

#####

being a fan of the series it was done well game play was solid art was classic and if youre a fan of metroidcastlevania type games  this falls right in line i would wait for it to go on sale since its a short game

#####

i just finished what is completed so far with the game this is one of the best non iga metroidvania games ive ever played
 i only found two gripes when fighting jinn and ifreet when hit by one of the wind attacks deed gets pushed left and right in rather unnatural looking ways because she trying to moverecover with the regular animations 

and the two handed weapons seen a little over strong 485 for a beta

#####

conceptually this game was going to win with me easily  lodoss my favourite anime in a sotn game one of my favourite games of all time format  i really look forward to this game in its finished state

in terms of gameplay it felt very smooth and familiar like i was playing sotn again back on my old ps though it does have some unique mechanics that make sense for the character the bows and magic  the magic was a bit tough to keep topped up but if you manage it you are definitely rewarded extra damage and self healing  that said even if you cant keep it topped up you can still get by just fine

in terms of soundmusic  i have to admit i didnt really notice it as i played  thats not necessarily a bad thing though  everything felt very natural and it clearly fit together well or i would have noticed it more

story  its early access so there isnt much there yet but the tidbits that were have me a least a little hooked  i really want to know more but only time will tell on this front

after release edit

so i do feel like my original review stands but i will add a bit here

difficulty  this game is pretty easy and i think vets of the metroidvania genre will breeze through it without any difficulty or effort  i still think it was fun to play but the folks talking about how easy it is arent off

length  it was a bit shorter than i expected  im happy with what i got but after playing some larger metroidvania games this did feel like a slight let down but not a major one for me  id understand if others didnt feel the same

#####

moar gib me moar

#####

very nice little game i have next to zero experience with castlevaniaesque titles but i am feeling rather intrigued by the genre after playing this

i bought this on a 50 sale after finishing the 90s ova you could argue its quite small in length and it is but similarly to its anime despite the small size it manages to deliver a pretty satisfying and compact experience

one thing that should be mentioned is that someone diving into this game without any previous experience with record of lodoss will likely find themselves a little lost by the dialogues since the game seems to expect you to have a minimum of experience with its lore prior to playing it so i would recommend giving at least the ova a watch if you can its very worth it 

gameplay is generally fast and engaging you are given a lot of tools to work with and progression is pretty natural the idea of switching between elements and becoming invincible to each one was especially cool to me i think it opens way for a lot of unique ways to play i wouldnt mind a little bit more melee weapon variety as a lot of the latter ones end up being buffed reskins of the earlier versions but its not a dealbreaker

i think it is an easy recommendation for fans of castlevania or people looking to try the genre out like me

#####

i dont know what a deedlit is or what any of the title means but its the perfect source material for a fun sotn clone with a wonderful art style and cool music it didnt take that long to complete but i couldnt put it down until the satisfying ending

#####

relatively short igavania but very tight i saw some complaints about difficulty being too easy because of the regen mechanic with spirits but i felt it was a good level of challenge without being too frustrating

#####

a fun time to say the least the visuals are really nice the music is great and the mechanics are fun to learn too the game isnt too long it could be finished in less than 7 hours first time through

if i had any criticism is that the monsters were not tough to fight until maybe the final part of the game the boss fights were
cool too i would recommend a hard mode or a level cap option for a greater challenge

#####

a short gem of a game goes hard on the castlevania vibe

#####

dang team ladybug really never misses this is a really fluid and fun metroidvania that has a lot of similarities to sotn but very obviously has its own mechanics and identity i really liked the elementswapping reminded me of synchronicity prologue by the same devs the graphics and music of course were totally perfect

#####

game has a great feel flows well instantly became one of my favorite metroidvanias

#####

even if you havent seen the anime this is a fun metroidvania with great art a good ost and some fun gameplay gimmicks like the element system and all the movement techs it doesnt seem to have much potential for sequence breaking but its still fun to explore and the bosses are a good challenge there are even some minigames like an archery shooting game and a dice game for gambling and ofc you can save scum that if you want and there are plenty of swords bows and magic to collect as well if you like sotn or smt synchronicity prologue same devs made the latter you really have to play this game

#####

finally i got 100 achievement
its really a good game

#####

good story
good for metroidvania newbie like me 

#####

to any fan of the old school castlevania this game was amazing

#####

this is based on an awesome anime series

#####

overall is a good castlevania some achievements are not fun as they require you to abuse some mechanics such as stacking magic unless that is how its meant to be played which would be a bit lame

#####

this game takes basics of castlevania games and copies them  the locations look similar the walk cycle is similar the attack animations are the same but then it builds some additional systems around the core which make the game unique

most of things in this game resolve around redblue mechanic where you are immune to the colour you currently have while taking damage from the other one this was previously seen in ikaruga and outland it allows the bosses to throw full screen of attacks at deedlit while making it relatively easy to dodge once you master the system i always liked it in ikaruga and here i really got the ikaruga 2d vibes

while red and blue represent wind and fire there are other elements in the game and those act outside of ikaruga system so you need to dodge them properly for map traversal i found out that instead of finding out proper way to deal with most monsters i could just outright kill them before they managed to make their attacks by mixing my weapon attacks with first magic attack you learn in the game within 30 minutes you start to feel like overpowered build in some castlevania games but here it is just natural state for the game even most of the bosses are pushovers and you can abuse the element system to take them out easily on first attempt there are some exceptions but even those are on easy side

the most abusable element of the game is autohealing if you use one element the opposite element levels up when you damage enemies if the element youre using is at level 3max youre recovering health rather quickly if you get hit your current element drops by 1 level by switching between elements and keeping at least one at level 3 at all times you are very hard to kill against bosses you can easily turtle them out and just attack from the distance until youve recharged the opposite element not useful for speedruns but for regular players easy to use

you also get a bow which is useful for most of the puzzles in this game and some monsters are much easier taken out with it its useful against some bosses too but overall i didnt use it that much the puzzles were decent mixing a little bit of thinking with a little bit of dexterity you also get access to few spells and few mobility options like hovering double jumps higher double jumps etc controlling deedlit with the upgrades is fun although i found the higher double jump input to be a bit irritating to do there are many jumps where you have to use 95 of your double jumphigher double jump range to pass

what i didnt care about too much was the map design unlike some other vanias where you get interconnected castle and the areas flow into each other rather naturally this game divides the map into stages each stage is pretty much micromap which is solved separately from all other stages there are few rooms where you cant enter until you got an upgrade from the next stage so you need to backtrack but otherwise the map is rather uninteresting exploration wise

all you can find on the maps are weapons 7 spells1 is mandatory and few hpmppower upgrades the weapons also drop from monsters randomly you can have up to 1 copy of each weapon there are no usable items that you collect the only source of such items are the shops you find in the dungeons ive never used or bough any of those somehow the rewards from exploration are quite unrewarding for the most of the game i had better weapons than i was finding

the equipment system is very limited  you only select your two weapons and they dont affect your stats or each other so you just can select best weapons for the job and kill stuff usually you can settle for the higher raw damage but against monsters with high weakness you can opt to choose elemental weapons or weapons with an animation that makes monsters easy to hit or with some added special effect like homing arrows you wont be spending much time in the equipment screen

as you can see on the screenshots and trailers the game is a sight to behold some areas make great use of parallax scrolling and there are a lot of details in the environments the music is serviceable the story is serviceable and predictable but still cool there are no hidden endings or timeconsuming mechanics unless you decide to collect all weapons or something

in the end ive enjoyed my 5 hours with this game completed it but i dont think ill be replaying it unlike castlevanias i highly recommend this but think of it as vania lite or platform game with some vania elements 

steamdeck note ive completed the game fully on the deck if not the launcher where you might want to press f1 to toggle vsync this game probably would get great on deck instead of playable label it currently has it works perfect trough the game shows proper controller symbols and everything works fine when i started i couldnt control music with the deck buttons but subsequent update to the deck seems to have fixed it

#####

i paid 16 and beat the game in 36 hours  i think its a solid enough game but theres definitely some drawbacks

in summary its similar enough to sotn or bloodstained  theres distinct areas you gain weapons as you progress along with a couple of spells and its the usual platforming with attacking to kill stuff

positives
innovation in some gameplay especially with the redblue energy system  i liked switching between them and it generally added a lot of depth
art style was great
music was phenomenal
no bugs though one crash to desktop
the map will mark locked doors you cant progress past yet with the appropriate color automatically  personally id rather have pins ala hollowknight to place myself because it feels more like exploring but its definitely better than having a plain map with nothing at all marked

downsides
its short  like really short  i wouldnt necessarily mind that its a condensed sotn clone but there were more than a few times where i picked up a weapon that was then immediately superseded by another weapon id pick up
item drops from enemies didnt really seem to be a thing past the first few enemies
combat is very bog standard and theres not really spots where theres choices in what weapon you use  simply pick the one with the highest numbers  same for spells
normal enemy combat is super boring excluding the final area  i dont even know what the dark elves attack is because none of them ever lived long enough to attack  excluding the final area every single enemy dies incredibly quickly except maybe the crocodiles who are evil  bosses were the right kind of challenging or maybe even slightly too easy and all normal enemies and areas were incredibly easy  i just breezed through the whole game  walk into room spam attack everything dies super quickly
the shop is pointless both because the game is so easy and also that i found more than enough swords and bows that i never needed to buy any
secrets are barely a thing
exploration is barely a thing
no interaction with torches like in castlevania so less need to pay attention to the background personally i enjoy the constant need to interact with the environment

so in the end i feel ok with this game  overpriced for whats there but at least whats there is solid enough  theres some innovation beyond sotn but theres also some things removed so i suppose im still waiting for a castlevaniatype exploration game that takes things to the next level

all that said i think developers that make bugfree complete games should absolutely be supported and these developers fit that so they deserve support  im hoping they can improve things for their next iteration

#####

rolw deedlit in wonder labyrinth is a gem

the rolw plot is somewhat tacked on but seeing rolw enemies and characters as bosses is a nice touch as a metroidvania its a fantastic game i lean towards the metroid end more than the vania normally but theres a real charm to this one its fair on difficulty you may die in a couple boss fights but it never feels unfair or cheap the pixel art is gorgeous and its outright fun to play

if youre a lodoss fan or a mildmid metroidvania fan its a good buy if you just want a fun game to play for 810 hours its a very enjoyable play through

#####

really fun metroidvania great visuals and good music the mechanics can be finicky but there wasnt a section of the game i felt was too much or where i wasnt having fun definitely recommend to fans of the metroidvania genre

#####

an excellent metroidvania with clever mechanics and a gorgeous 16 bit art style very good music too

#####

solid metroidvania game  fun ikaruga like polarity switch mechanic  good pacing  solid presentation

#####

incredible game  just incredibly satisfying both in feel and visuals  i even like the puzzles which i usually hate in games  this is a must play for any fan of sotn metroidvanias or pixel art in general

#####

symphony of the night but with elves and elements fantastic game

#####

for anyone who wants a smooth symphony of the nightlike experience with its own short yet fun evolution on mechanics also who doesnt love deedlit

#####

very well made game the pixel art was gorgeous the game play was solid and the player controlled very well 

i enjoyed touhou luna nights and this was a clear step up in improvement over that game if you miss sotn at all i dont think you can go wrong with this

#####

tentative review for now im going to play though it again and see if i like it better the second time it was just very repetitive with little that felt interesting or creative visually this game is stunning i wish more 2d games went for a look similar to wonder labyrinth
