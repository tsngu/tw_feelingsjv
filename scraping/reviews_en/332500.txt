release the source so the community can finish the game

i am making this post for my guild as well as several other frustrated players on the forums that have been deprived a voice my hours are not high but many of them were not logged to steam consider this a shared experience based on what i have not only experienced directly but witnessed many other players experiencing the unhelpful votes at the top are most likely going to pile up as the griefer guild and admins find this post just look at its contents and decide for yourself

dont get this game it might look ok at first but the melee combat is roughly based on circling around the opponent repeatedly and smacking them in the rear quarters then rinse repeat the diversity is mostly just reskin of the same character types

in addition pve is full of griefers which we as well as several other groups on the server were suffering from due to their use of exploits andor hacks to grief while in pve they would hack into bases and destroy generatorsshieldsetc of every other player that wasnt from their little group the server in question was eu 9 and the players in question do not attempt to hide their actions even on the forums admitting to it that is the treatment new players were given once they had set up a protected base that should be protected from destruction we had plenty of wood for 5 days in the generator but exploits were used against us and basically every other player on this server due to the fact the moons are connected it means other servers were effected as well

what happened when we tried to bring this to admin attention via email and steam correspondence we were blocked and the players are still doing exploits and destroying peoples protected pve structures to this day
wow talk about fantastic moderation

alot of people would say to move to a new server however in this game that would require starting over and this player seems to do this kind of thing on multiple servers andor moons so that wouldnt really help if admin action were taken like it should have been the problem would be solved

currently expect to lose your stuff to griefers even in pve and expect the admins to do nothing about it

you might ask why it is that noone has done anything about names omitted due to political red tape in steam tos

by my research of simply looking at publically available shared friends lists and the fact that i was ignored by the admin as are their griefing posts on the forums id say they know each other there you have it nepotism it is the only rational explanation i was able to come up with to explain the ultimately either lazy or malicious lack of action

a player that uses hacks andor exploits to glitch into peoples pve bases and destroy everything including chests and spends 90 of their time bragging in global chat that they are on their train of destruction then also brags on the forums will get away with it due to poor support for this game

the game wasnt really anything to write home about before the fact that exploiting griefers can destroy your chests even in pve game modes and force your entire guild to start over on a new server that may suffer the same problem
the game looks somewhat flashy but there really isnt anything to do for a sandbox and the building and gameplay are rather limited and poorly balanced a similar game that is in development that might need support is planet explorers really there are several similar games with better support if you toss a stone in a random direction

it is grindy and it feels grindy
things are a palette swap if they are any different
no cheat protection that i can discern so enjoy the large amount of hackersexploiters in pvp or pve
the graphics really arent that great and the cartoon polish doesnt fix it
the combat feels kind of basic
large amount of unnecessary resources which get dropped even in pve which require you to put it in a chest at your protected base and log on frequently otherwise even in pve other players can and will destroy all your things and get rid of all your belongings if you choose to not carry them around into dangerous areas even if you do keep your base protected by filling the generator some players will exploit and destroy it anyway cements fact 1 that the game is grindy
building system uses very limited supply of polished yet uninspired structures

there is no end game people complain about this constantly on the forums go check it our favorite griefers complain about this as well and had stated that they decided the endgame was griefing other players and use this as an excuse

without the griefers id say a 710 at best at this point especially when compared to other similar games
with the griefers the game is unplayable unless you plan to deal with your friends and everyone losing their bases to some jerky griefers and have to rebuild every time you log onto the servers 5 or 610 at that point at best i would like you to simply look at the number of negative vs positive reviews at the time of writing 500 vs 1500 that is not a good satisfaction rate by any stretch of the imagination this game might still sound good to you but i request you support one of the other similar games with a friendly community and people who care

i would consider changing this review if i am given evidence that action is being taken against such players who grief in pve or hack i have screenshotted it and am prepared to post it to various other popular websites if it is removed or swept under the rug as i am sure will happen if this happens i have the resources to go straight to the higherups at steam who will be curious as to why negative opinions of the game are being censored


tldr
even if you are planning to play this game i humbly ask that you rate this helpful so that people can at least go into the game knowing about the inner workings and happenings which may ruin their and their friends experiences and so that people know at the very least to avoid eu 9 due to its toxic community that is simply being enabled by the developers or avoid the game entirely because you can expect no support by the mods or admins

i flagged grav as fraudulent even though i know valve wont do anything about it because theyre still making money off all us poor schlubs who buy these abandoned trashheaps and dont find out how bad they are until its too late to refund
below is the additional information i put in my sure to be ignored report

grav has been abandoned by the developers for nearly a year now with nothing forthcoming but sale announcements which also ceased in july yet they still claim it is in early access thus defrauding potential customers who buy the game under the assumption that it is still in development and not longabandoned this fraudulent behavior by shady developers is rampant in steams early access program which valve seems to be just fine with judging by their complete inaction against the myriad offenders

#####

strikethis game is tons of fun devs are active they reply on steam forums and keep on patching bugs

the game has vibrant colors imagine rust and planet explorers had a baby and named it grav

i have played 5 hours straight was killed in pvp once owned by flying bugs made friends built a base with them explored caves the game has tons of potential but requires your patience i believe as more players join more servers will come up creating another succesful survival game but this time with a different feel to it

totally recommend the game for those who understand what early access games with tons of potential require

edit 1 after playing even more ive noticed some bugs but they never ruined the fun the only issue is the lag at times but the devs are working on it

edit2 crowded servers tend to lag a bit more than servers with 816 people on is what i noticed from trying out different servers the game is enjoyable in less crowded servers at current state

edit3 as of patch 4 the lag has been reduced and server performance really improved looking forward to future updates

edit4 as of the 18th of january patch 7 is released more improvements cpugpuwise in bay as well as further graphical enhancements see the announcments for further info 

i dont know anymore still positive though

21st of may 2016 i miss grav

24th of may 2019 still miss it strike

20th of august 2023 what couldve been

#####

it started as a fun buggy early access game which was sure to grow or so we thought 2 years ago  for more than a year the development progress has been a joke some minor bug fixes most likely done during half a workday and serverfusions were announced as great content patches while in fact no real content has been added at all since october 2015 theres also still hundreds of gamebreaking bugs

its abandonware dont get fooled by the devs poppung up every few months before a steam sale switching three numbers in their code and acting like somebody was actually working on this

this game had soo much potential but abandonware stays abandonware

edit
update  for the first time after 2 years as of today the devs have come out of hybernation and real new content has been added 22th march 17 new items and a new vehicle it wont change my review considering how the last 2 years went  but it wouldnt be fair to ignore these improvements this game does have potential lets see whether the devs learned their lesson

edit
they didnt

january review
loving this game so far community is great most people tend to cooperate and explore with each other and disregard pvp the potential is very very great in this game i personally love it the building resources visuals are stunning 1010 the other negative reviews probably are just on the wrong servers and doing the wrong things im having a very smooth time and so far there are no game killing bugs as of now respawning is designated with a craftable item and putting away resources is also achieved by making an item both that are very easy and cheap to make see you in game

update after an extensive amount of gameplay i quickly grew tired of it i constantly stuck with the game hoping that an update will fix lag issues and after some few updates it did but what got me was the leveling and crafting grinding was like a job you are forced to do it or you wont get anywhere im talking in the sense that building a decent base will take almost half a real life day then the amount it takes to actually make the item takes away almost half of your resources you spent grinding for about 30 minutes i am sad to say that i have left this game it has potential yes it does but the image its creating now is not the image i saw in my head when i saw this game on greenlight i expected borderlandsminecraftterraria crazy adventures and fast paced action with some nice base building that is easy and fast maybe next time ill come back to this game but for now its out of my to play list

june review
so i just took a look at the summer trailer and it still displays so much misleading and flashy visuals that can instantly capture a person who takes a big interest in suvival open world games such as me

definitely not open world its just one piece of a huge land with only mobs and resources laying about with a few dungeons nothing to interact with just a barren wasteland the combat is a looping cycle of meleeing and backing off or with guns its just unloading bullets on the mobsjetpacks take years to make the fuel it uses is also a pain to get pvp is still laggy and somewhat broken monocycles dont go as fast as you really think they do building the claim in this trailer would take irl days to make considering all the resource farming youd have to do still waiting for that lovely overhaul to resource gathering and actual things to do in the game rather than just kill mobs farm dungeons

november
so i just wanted to jump back on grav because of the reborn update and not much has really changed its still the grav i knew back in early 2015 the ui has improved greatly though so props for that the environment and the world design has greatly improved too the world isnt so barren and random anymore it looks like an actual world and not some dream world the vehicles look great but i have yet to obtain them the multitool harvesting has slightly improved with a bar on the bottom indicating your progress during the harvesting the combat is repetitive as ever and the noises during battle are still so poorly timed a revamp to the combat system is needed to immerse people in a fight instead of just wacking things then backing off then repeat the guns still havent really changed either the reload animation is still the guy rubbing his gun sweety refill your clip now kind of thing 
overall i think the game is slightly improving but not enough to have me recommend it but theyre getting there with these recent updates

due to this review being quite popular its drawn much attention of course but with that also comes a flood of angry fans and players yes i dislike the game you love oh so much i dont care this review is meant to give the devs a kick in the head and try to look into a problem that not only me but many others find very horrible so i please ask you to keep your insults to yourselves take it to an online message board and put it there ideas and suggestions are welcome however if you really do must write a comment of disagreement be civil and show no hostility to an individual and be humble thank you for taking time to read this review have a good day 


































just adding this here completely optional and has nothing to do with the review
go play trove its just like this game but not sci fi focused theres base building a fairly large world to explore and generate theres exp gains and leveling also a loot system character customization wings mounts and also guns and exploration its free to play but is not broken with pay to win like i said im just leaving this here for people looking for games to play with this kind of genre completely irrelevant to the review and optional

oh right another edit november wouldnt recommend trove anymore the little innocent sheep has grown into a devil goat trove has expanded quite alot and now theyre adding a lot more grindy things pvp is a real thing and eventually people will start building pvp characters and the game will probably feature pvp exclusive gear so gg to those who want to have a good casual time and still maintain good gear

the f2p element has also bloated with their cash shop too theres alot of advertising now and almost everything you do in the game will make you think about buying something with irl cash dont bother touching trove anymore its going downhill

sorry if none of this makes sense to you if you dont understand thats fine im just sharing my thoughts and taking no time to revise what im saying its sort of like a free write

#####

currently as of june 11th 2017 grav machine broke shows no signs of recovery or any work at all so far for the past month should have waited to buy early access garbage ill come back in a year and see whats changed the mechanics are fine some small inconvenient glitches but nothing super as far as gameplay the servers are a nightmare and that is whats limiting gameplay otherwise its a lot of fun

#####

played this game for around 270 hours also reached the endgame long time ago lets sum it up
pros
nice graphics
the idea of multiple planets and moons with different hazard conditions
official servers divided on pve and pvp
the game has a lot of potential
lots of weapons to choose from also balanced
many different resources to get
great community at least on eur pve server which i played on
cons
resources and monsters grindfest to the point of extreme boredom
more than half of all planets except homeworlds look similar or identical
only around 1112 type of monsters
building anything more complicated than a simple cube is frustrating
there is a single player mode but use it only for a tutorial to learn basic things  advancement is impossible there unless you play 1000 hours because of the way resource nodes spawn multi is fine

and the last most important one  little to no updates since half a year there were some small patches that brought new hats hooray and a few changes in game rules on official servers but theres a complete lack of new content since october and no major bugs were fixed throughout those few months the devs support and contact is also greatly lacking

would i recommend this game right now  no as i mentioned  great potential but squashed by people with no heart to finish their product
if so then why did i play it for so long i guess i just like to finish things also other people on the server made it more fun to play

#####

tldr another great game abandoned before its time  i can no longer reccomend it and it should no longer be sold  see my story below for a laugh

landed on an alien planet with a knife now you get a club and a multitool  only hint i got was get wood and fossils to make an armory they have added a great tutorial that gives you exp and mats as you do basic tasks now  saw a giant flying alien bug and poked it with my knife it expolded with a squish sound  repeated several times to hear the squish sound  accidentally ran into a bug that made me make a squish sound 

made an armory and got a rusty gun and killed the bug that squished me  

found a cave but there was a big pit in it  the monsters chased me to the edge of the pit  i fell in  second time i built a bridge over the pit and stood there pointing and laughing at the stupid monsters  monsters destroyed the bridge while i was standing on it  they pointed and laughed as i fell to my death again

this game is a blast  it has survival elements but no so hard core that you have to count how many mms you have left in your pocket before you die  it also has rpg elements where you can upgrade some skills active and passive and get new jobs that have a new set of skills with them and you can build  building is fairly simpled but lots of fun  you can also make a variety of weapons armor and vehicleslike monocyle jetpacks tanks and jets

you will dieyou will laughand you will die some more while you learn  the folks playing are helpful and fun  this game is more than worth the money right now and is being patched frequently

my best advice is to build a little base as soon as you get a shield generator blueprint  use it to store your extra mats so if you die you dont loose much  you do not drop your armor ammo or weapons when you die just a percentage of your mats on hand  you can also train a skill up to reduce how much you drop  

there are pk gankers of course but there are antipkers as well that tend to balance it out  you will get pked  the best thing to do is dont panic  you are much more likely to survive if you keep your head and fight back  or run around some cover and pop and invis stim and run away 

updated a bit  there has been much patching and improving recently  the game is better than ever  the player base has grown after a recent free weekend  there is so much to do in this game you shouldnt get bored  

yes it can be a big grindy at times as some people have asked  i dont find it bothersome  you can have about 8 different jobs which are like classes  you can level each one seperatly or just focus on one   each comes with benefits  i dont find lvling up other jobs that hard as i gather mats while i level  you can hot swap any job at any time just in your inventory screen and any passives that you train remain no matter what job you have active

openworld scifi style sandbox survival and building  try it  you just might like it

#####

game is ruled by high level players  being there is 0 risk to them they spend most of their time taxing as in they gain a percentage of all the resources you farm and killing low level players and destroying anything they want whenever theyre bored  you cant do anything to stop them but watch what you have built be destroyed and you have start over  luckily your levels and equipment dont reset on death but youll lose most your resources and the people who killed you can take the rest  at least with other survival games the risk to them is bigger the more they have  so youre not always constantly attacked  

the combat is also boring  you have several jobs to try to make the game look like there is a reason to keep grinding  the jobs offer new passive skills and active skills to use but dont offer any gameplay differences  they are there strictly to drain your time  because when you start a new job you start with level 0 stats  even with your more powerful gear youll have to go through the same grind as when you first started  youll have to do this on all the jobs if you want all the percs  but unlike a mmo where the classesjobs would offer unique gameplay grav offers no such thing and its strictly there as a time sink   

and all the monsters of the world are pretty samey as well  even as you gain new levels and go to new places youll fight the same monster over and over  and most monsters even of different kinds have the same attacks  most have some sort of spit attack and those that dont have a small aoe  thats it for diversity  speaking of the worlds  theyre pretty small  those big worlds they show in the trailer  thats about the size of em  very small  

so there you have it  grav a game where you get tortured and picked on by the few high levels while grinding against the same boring monsters farming the same resources so that one day you can be a high level to pick on the low level guys as well because there is no endgame besides that   

it really isnt worth your time this game has nowhere to progress  a cross between a survival game and an mmo and not very good at either

#####

after loosing hope on early access i decided to buy one last game and holy vodka am i glad i did this game is amazing
great graphics
great gameplay
dungeon raid mechanics
mmolike gameplay
no paywalls
no need to rent servers you can just open one yourself
frequent updates

#####

before i review i do want to mention this is essentially a brand new game as the reborn update has dropped  its radically different from what the game was so in my opinion most of the reviews prior to mine are no longer accurate

ill keep it short  this is one of the most unique games ive ever played its essentially a dedicatedserver based online rpg with some slight survival influences extensive base building fun scifi and an awesome resource centric progression system  its very much like starbound in this fact

pros

you can travel to other planets as you level up they rotate on a loop about 3 planets per tier so it never seems to get boring
very diverse crafting system
persistent vehicle like dune buggies tanks jets etc  prepare yourself for epic endgame battles over territory
territory system  you can conque grids and form mini kingdoms on each individual planet having separate grids
class system  allows you to specialize or diversify this game is all about choice
this game is very fun with friends
complex pvp and raiding system  guys cant just show up with pickaxes and raid your base like some survivals
its a very playable alpha game definitely worth it for the price
pvp is balanced gear is a factor but a dude with a t1 pistol can very realistically challenge a top tier player

cons

this could be a pro or a meh depending on your mindset 3rd person combat system can make pvp inconsistent
its grindy but a very rewarding a fun grind especially if youre with friends
get ready to break your mouse with semiautos as you crush your lmb  haha

meh

community this is serverdependent  noob zone is easily camped sometimes it is sometimes it isnt  you seem to get the rust and ark washouts who couldnt handle a more skill dependent pvp system

get the game

h1 review h1

 grav is a good game i open with that statement as unfortunately the game is hanging around the 60 positive review mark which in steam terms is terrible

 does the game deserve negative reviews yes of course every game will have people who dislike it and thats fine
but does the game deserve this many negative reviews no i wouldnt say so grav isnt a bad game and you will notice from most of the negative reviews that people who dislike this game are people who have only played the game for a few hours or people who complain about how the servers arent fully alive and active all the time that is because these people do not fit into the target audience

 i will address all of these subjective flaws but first i will point out to you that grav has a lot of grinding this is not necessarily a bad thing even though the general public would assume so the game is absolutely full of things to work for and many of these things take a very long time to achieve in my opinion this is a great thing you always have something on the horizon to strive for youll always be able to try out that new equipment you just earned and youll always ialwaysi feel satisfied with the results of a long grind that is why you should take another perspective on any review with under 10 hours played

 as for server activity pvp etcetera i dont recommend this game if youre looking for a purely playerversusplayer experience against random people grav isnt built for that a few experience levels make a huge imbalance in damage and total health and so the game doesnt hit the mark as far as public pvp environments go
if pve isnt your thing though dont be strayed away i think grav is great as a team game where everyone starts at the same time and has a race to the top in some sort of red vs blue scenario

 but where this game really shines for me is with or against friends progression is made much sweeter when you have a partner or two by your side so i recommend this game the most to those who favour pve or team environments grav has so much to offer in terms of fun player interaction and memorable moments are a plenty ive had many epic experiences gliding through the air alongside my small group riding a futuristic vehicle over plains or simply dancing around a fire with friends

 so in conclusion i can easily recommend grav it is fun and it is good however you should take some more time to consider if you are wanting to play the game alone that can be said for a lot of multiplayercompatible games but grav in particular shines with friends

h1  h1

i thank you for taking the time to read my review on grav id appreciate if you could rate it and let me know what i could do to make my reviews better happy hunting i

#####

first of allnote that grav doesnt have the survival element in itthe rpg element is the most dominant one in this gameyou dont have hunger thirst bar like those true survival gamesgrav is a hybrid between tpsopen worldand rpg

bpros b
 beautiful graphics  like planetside 2some places can make quite a scenery and i love it  just remember to turn post processing on
 cool vehicles designs with a wide range of varietyfrom wingsuits to fighter jetseach with its upgraded version that consume less fuel and have more speed
 humor element includeddancing gangnam style beside a campfire with a dubstep music will replenish your health and staminayou can also poop anywhere you want
 fun buildingbases are some kind of your personal trophyand designing it is a lot of funespecially preparing your base to punish griefers
 your character can do a lot of emotionsit decreases the crude feeling of the gamefor exampleyou can waveyou can clapyou can vomityou can say hiyou can saluteetc
 very friendly and supportive communitythey will help you level upthey will help you farmthey will give you high level weapons and multitoolsthey will guide youand some of them will give you a ride to certain places if you dont have a vehicle yetasia 01 server
 very active and communicative devs that will help you with any kind of ingame issue
 new players wont suffer from high level playerssince theres some kind of protection policy on asia 01 serverhigh level players who kill new players will get punished by the level 300 guybig shoutout to klipwc for the great guide and his support for new players

 game performance is dreadfulyou will experience crashes midgameconnection interruptions ur character blinks around the mapfps spikesping spikesendless loading screengame suddenly not responding after loadingand sometimesyou will have to wait around 25 minutes after loading for the map around you to loadduring this wait timethe map around you will refresh constantly and you will get 5 to 20 seconds freeze each time you try to movethe problem is from the game itselfhigh end gaming pcs wont fix this
 spotlights will drop your fps to 510 if you fly near themdespite your strong pc spec
 very few players210 players each serverthis is due to the high system requirements and the current state of the game
 needs a lot of time to farmthe resources you get from the sources are so low that it makes the majority of time you will spend in the game is for farming
 monster spawning system still require a lot of workmonsters still spawn behind youon top of youor sometimes doesnt spawn at all even if i already waited for 15 minutesimagine high level bosses spawn on top of your head
 if a lot of people play this gamethis game will not be ready for 32 players on each serverim sure it will increase the loading timeand your bases will get destroyed everydaypeople will attack each other for the resourcessince it will take a long time to farmand they will also try to get the 100 kill hat trophy
 you will lose 90 of your resource when you die 50 if you maxed your astronaut skillas i said beforethis game is not ready for 32 playersimagine 32 hostile players attack each other for resources and no high level player protect the new playersit will be a total chaosbases will be destroyed easily by the players that already has rocket launchers or tankslosing 90 of resource is a pretty ridiculous system and its one of the biggest factor that make this game isnt ready for 32 players
 classic rpg mentality problemsome high level players are very proud of their basesvehiclesweaponsetcthey show off their things everyday to the new players and tell them to do stupid things for their amusement
griefers alertgriefers are extremely annoying in this game and one of them are very active going around the servers to trollthey will destroy your baseschange your signssteal your resourcesetcall experienced players are currently hunting griefers even though its very hard to find and punish themsince they always move from server to serverbeware for mf thathersonhe is the infamous griefer that goes around the servers
 new player spawn point system is ridiculousthere is a chance for you to spawn inside hostile base even though its your first time playingauto turrets will shred new players thatre the victim of this spawning systemi was forced to leave my old base because i accidentaly built it on the noob spawn point
 you need 16 gigs of ram if you want to run your own serverand at least 8 gigs of ram to play with maximum settingsthis requirement really shows that this game isnt optimized well and perform horriblynote that not all country has cheap access to computer thingies
 new guns only means new colorsno new designs from each gunstheres only 1 design for pistol1 design for shotgun1 design for smgand 1 design for assault riflethe melee already has a lot of designs though
 no headshot hitboxmakes combat system very boring and requires a long timeimagine holding lmbclicking lmb multiple times for hours on each cave with no variation at all
 no new weapon soundsall weapons have the same soundexcept smg and shotgun
 boring and dreadful soundtrackexcept the campfire dubstep music
 building bases maybe fun but the building system is still not perfectits pretty complicated and made a lot of my friends frustrated
 bases lack of decorationsthey should add chairstablesor any other decorations that has actual effect on the gamefor examplea daily expresource buff if we use certain furniturestodayall bases are only filled with crafting stationscomposterstargatesand their defense systemswhich make the bases look horribly empty

bsuggestionsb
1fix the performance of the game asapthe games performance today is extremely horribleits worse than horribletheres no word to describe itits just a total messimagine losing 90 of your resources only because you disconnected by the games ping spikes and the game killed you with cdt_forcedsuicide
2increase the farming speedharvest pets should give twice resources and each resource points should have more resources availablefarming 20 woods from each tree while you need thousands to build a base and craft things is ridiculous
3ban griefersi know its pvp and griefing is technically not an illegal thingbut remember that it hurts the player base because common sane people hate and avoid games with griefersgriefers are trollersthey are people who have questionable sanity and mentalitythat entertain themselves by making other people angry through internet because they feel invincible since people cant do anything to them
4find permanent teammateswith todays rate of farmingyou need at least 1 permanent teammatethe more the merrierteammates will decrease the time needed to build a base and craft thingsbecause you can easily trade resources through publicfof only storage bin
5play at the most crowded server in your regionmore high level guys means more support for new playersjust be patient when theyre showing offand refuse when they told you to do stupid things for their amusement
6read klipwcs guide on how to make griefproof basethere is a way to completely prevent griefers from destroying your base

overallthis game has a great potentialbut it still needs a lot of work rememberits still on early accessi know that today only a few people play this gamebut opening the server for 32 players with this current state of the game is ridiculousif they want to open it for 32 playersthey have to be ready for itnote that i am not stating that there are literally 32 players inside the game todayeven with this current statei still have a lot of fun playing it with my friendsas long as i ignore the irritating people

#####

well what to say from the few videos you see you really want to get it at least that happened to me is it fun yeah but it wont last long
i felt attracted to the game mainly because of the looks of it and the fact that it was a survivalcrafting game 

 survival 
the only survival aspect if you play singleplayer hosting your own server to play alone in it is the fact that you have that hunger bar that if you just farm for blueprints exp and materials from mobs youll get plenty nothing more you wont even see it like never going down to half
in multiplayer the survival aspect comes from trying to survive from other players if you are on a pvp server ofc

 enemies 
little variety you have slimes something that resembles a really fat bee a ticklouse thing that barks a blue humanoid alien that you really dont want near you and another mob thats called day killer and night killer depends on the time of the day that runs fast and wants to kill you the only thing that change with this mobs is that they are elemental based icy slime or blaze slime fe cant remember if you have more enemies

 crafting 
dont just dont buy this if you assume the crafting system will be like minecraft or dont starve you can craft very few things at the beginning and if you want more you need to kill everything on sight hoping to get a blueprint this is easier if the mob or boss you are killing has a few levels more than you 1 or 2 the red crates that drop stuff just gives you materials not blueprints a thing devs might add to the crates at least basic bps

 weapons 
you have the basic item and the same with an elemental damage type to craft fire ice poison electric and maybe one more u start with a hunting knife then you might get a club a wooden sword pistols rifles and even a shotgun
firing weapons sux really low dmg even with the pet that buff that i used a wooden sword and a wooden sword with fire damage until lvl 14 remember if you dont get a blueprint from monster drops you are gonna have a bad time

the mining tool that you use to get ores wood crystals and stuff has like 10 or more upgraded versions to craft mark i mark ii mark iii etc i crafted the mark viii and didnt even noticed a change maybe it mined a bit faster but the same numbers of mats where being mined 1

 the world 
small if you ask me even more small if u join a server with lots of ppl it has a central island and 1 or 2 more of high lvl mobs and dungeons from 14 to 29 from what i saw
cant remember if the stuff i read before buying the game said anything about being able to explore other worlds but you cant here not now at least remember its an ea

 final notes 
if you like the general idea of the game watch gameplays and want to buy it now before its fully finished and more expensive maybe buy it 
if not dont do it i bought it in 11012015 and today 14012015 am ready to say that maybe when finished it will be a fun game to play not now but maybe someday

i really dont know what more to say i liked the game the time i played it i still like it and i think this has much more to offer
right now devs are trying to reduce the lag on their servers but between yesterday and today i had to download 2 patches wich is a good thing

#####

i really cant wait for future updates this game is really fun and already has alot to it

so far ive found a pretty active public server with lots of people on it
all the servers have their own home planet but once you head to a other planet by building a stargate all the servers  about 12 at the moment  are on common ground 

you have the possibility to create building blocks with ladders doorways closed rooms open rooms teleportal rooms glass rooms shields gun turrets material factories armories spawn uplink points stargates and alot more im sure alot is going to be added in the future
these buildings can all be protected from outsiders or be set to public if you wish to share with others 

the game is heavily material grind and pve based wich in my opinion is great cause you feel that you have progression but ofcourse that differs for others
that said pvp is also a big part of this game at the moment when you kill other players you can loot all their resources if they arent able to pick it up within 15 minutes the gear will stay after the resources are picked up so you wont be completely useless after youve been killed

combat takes abit getting used to im hoping to see future improvements since the animation when swinging your melee just swings your arm rather then seeing your body put weight into the swing
would also love to see more diversity in melee weapons as the begin were able to make a club while the rest of the melee weapons are all knifes  wich look pretty badass 

for guns there is a good diversity from what ive seen assault rifles pistols and shotguns at the moment 
combat with those also needs improvement since now whenever you shoot you always have to be zoomed in wich is quite annoying since you cant really see whats going on around you and walk into mobs or against walls wich gets me killed most of the time

as for teams were able to set a fof up at the moment that way you can share structures portals and other stuff with your buddies

ive had tons of fun so far and will continue playing this already been in a conflict with other players where i got ganked on the moon and retaliated by seeking sweet revenge upon their base  

bring it on players  

oh and if you dont like pvp you can always choose a pve server 

i hope this review gave you enough information if you have any questions feel free to ask
i always keep steam broadcasting on for everyone so if u want to see gameplay footage you can always check it out too

devs gave up on it
not supported was a good game though

#####

highly recomended to the following 1 any fan of minecraft 2 any fan of the forest 3 any fan of starbound this game strongly resembles a 3d starbound to me

perkspros
sand box
survival
vehicles
guns
swords
buildings
challenging as you must unlock more blueprints
levels
skills
dungeons

bugscons
sometimes buildings will disappear after reloading your world quitdisconect and rejoin
ai are incomplete and all are pet vendors as of now people and robot ai
all ai seem to be able to noclip thru natural structures trees rocks etc
some resources trees ores gems etc trees mostly tho will sometimes also be clipped thru natural objects such as rocks

overall rate  495 or 9810
this game has a very strong potential outcome to be one of the best on steam or atleast very close to minecraft equivalent seeing as whats already here and it still only pre release

#####

i played grav when it first came out servers were active the game was fun for all development was smooth and steady bringing great balancing and stuff that the players needed dungeons dropped plans frequently everything didnt cost to much to farm and we actually went to other worlds this what grav shouldve been but all of a sudden the reborn update hit changing everything for the worst making drops more rare everything needs to be farmed a lot more and making the beginning strategy useless if they had never made the reborn update a thing i believe the game would still be active and people would be enjoying it

#####

okay from the time im writing this i have 36 hours of game time in grav this game has considerably exceeded my expectation from the being as an early access game in a difficult genre not only is the game both beautiful and fun to play the community and developers are pretty amazing from day one yes there has been many bugs but those are expected in an early access game almost immediately they were dealt with in a patch released hours after if youre willing to contribute and help the game grow and develop buy it if you want a more finished product wait a little while my recommendation is to buy it and get in on the grav 3

#####

tldr should have returned this game instead of looking for the good in it does not match advertisement or expectations several environments in preview videos do not exist previews suggest gameplay that is not present in current stage of development gameplay is exceedingly simplistic grinding for numbers game is in alpha stages with resource stability and memory leak issues potential exists but no amount of quantity makes up for the lack of quality

what follows is a section by section commentary on the about this game bullet points

endless worlds  planets are not procedurally generated counter to advertisement all planets have a static map exoplanets rotate every 3 hours making some game objects virtually useless exoplanets are often either small enough or with rough terrain to render land vehicles near useless flying vehicles feature six axis movement but no horizon or flight hud and no tuneable flight controls expect to roll and tumble wildly for your first dozen flights glide suit and jetpack do not work together you must alternate using one and the other to remain in the air

gorgeous visuals  while grav can be rather pretty the visuals are unoptimised the game itself consumes an inordinate amount of system ram 4gb and leaks memory consumed 7gb system ram after a few hours reducing texture lod reduces visual quality far faster than system load i frequently experienced terrible artifacting near the beach area with each patch to the game slightly altering the location and severity of the artifacting

frenzied combat  circle strafe while tapping backwards and holding the fire button for up to a minute per enemy twelve different palatte swapping enemies advance with the same mindless behavior and ignore collision with most player placed objects but halt and become confused when the player jumps onto slightly elevated or out of the way platforms enemy melee attacks damage the player for 50 of health in early game and nearly nothing late game rare enemies use mild but irritating camera shake inducing ranged attacks alternating with aoe ground pounds and regular melee one mob has a pushback that deals significant damage if you are pushed into a wall boss type enemies are 3x the size with 4x the health and 2x the xp using ontier equipment against equallevel mobs players damage enemies for 1 of health using automatic weapons expect to carry 10000 rounds of ammunition and use 75150 rounds per mob grind away for hours as xp gain sharply falls toward 10 when fighting mobs below your level and damage sharply falls toward 1 when fighting mobs above your level enjoy becoming stuck on random terrain or ambushed by sudden respawns from behind and dropping 5090 of your loot

player vs player  no easily managed friends list become friends with people by giving them the numeric passcode to your teams private chat and granting them entry to all your buildings and belongings no method to determine who is currently using that passcode changing your individual passcode does not automatically update your buildings or chests no such thing as a list of foes for tracking your enemies no such thing as a neutral list anyone who isnt your friend is your enemy impossible to raid other players bases unless they contain one of two different placeable objects

play with friends  most of my friends were bored within 10 hours many quit after 60 due to the nature of the friend passcode it is very difficult to make friends for fear of major theft system resource requirement is prohibitive to running a solo or local server

powerful base construction  build cube shaped rooms to make cube shaped bases no method to control which walls are removed or preserved when building an adjoining room no method to add walls back to a room after walls have been removed destroy the entire room and try again sometimes this requires you to destroy an entire quarter of a base and try again dont bother trying to build balconies around your base turret damage is overpowered at low levels and near worthless at upper levels

extensive crafting  there are 123 different crafting materials but the bulk of work is done by 10 the rest are oneoff items for specific recipes you may use only once or never at all you will craft an ar and an smg because the ar has the best dps without rapid clicking and the smg ammo drops are plentiful enough to make it a viable secondary all other ammunition is a waste of inventory space by the time you have an automatic weapon melee is a waste of time and effort equipment progresses linearly while costs increase somewhat exponentially defensive equipment is the primary progression but variation is lacking at least one set of equipment is a palette swap defending against an environmental hazard often means using equipment well below the areas difficulty there is no method to sort filter or easily manage your inventory or your storage bins

dynamic environmental events  enemies spawn more frequently at night night is very dark and flashlights are craftable temporary accessories large numbers of a single enemy type will spawn occasionally as an event i have never seen flowers bloom as part of the daynight cycle as advertised i have never seen meteors fall across the terrain as advertised let alone regular rain sometimes there is fog and thats about it

procedurally generated dungeons  dungeons are procedurally generated from about sixteen different component rooms but component rooms are static uninteresting tunnels often accompanied by invisible clip walls and enemy pathing issues the same four direct harvestable resources are available on all planets three resources require a placeable object to createharvest four resources are exoplanet specific making them slightly harder to get each level of exoplanet has an uncommon variation of each of these resources but youll soon find yourself throwing out stacks and stacks of the uncommons once youve used them for their one purpose sometimes there is a pit in the caves or the procedural generation makes a gap to empty space i guess those are the advertised environmental obstacles

hostile environments  warping to a planet with a hostile environment without the appropriate equipment begins a countdown when the countdown is over you lose 5 of your max health every tick all water off the home planet is damaging thats about it

roadmap  several of these features are already or partially implemented this is not a good track of coming features or completed features

#####

final review halfyear in the making do not buy avoid like the plague  game is being treated like postrelease in terms of development while in early access

the developers in their communication with their customers make their changes sound wideranging and grandiose like adding entirely new multiplayer mechanics or the like while they tweak small portions of their ui or networking code over the period of a halfyear
in the amount of time the game has been in early access read since the release date on steam there has been all of one major update  this is over years of development as a customer and reviewer i cannot stress enough how little progress has been made on this game and how much of a debaucle this has been over the years  ive logged far too many hours into this game to demand a refund but if youve logged anywhere in the single or doubledigits i implore request a refund and go take pictures of your nearest fault line or glacier since theyll show just about as much change in the same period of time

archive
in the past few months gravs playability and players confidence evidenced by poor player numbers on servers with the game has tanked  the devs pushed out the reborn update which got lots of people into the game but neglected to fix a number of annoying quality of life bugs for weeks on end  one of which could have been fixed by a  or   players hemmoraged as soon as they added overflow servers to handle the free period players that swarmed in  older players left during this period and didnt bother to return  these overflow servers or at least the architecture behind them still exist to this day splitting players up and making it impossible to play with ones friends from the getgo extra steps added beyond building a flare launcher acquire blueprint for home gate build home gate  two serious mismanagements nearly wiped their active player table to prereborn update levels

gravs premise is amazing and i watched it for over a year and a half and have played it extensively but i took a break around that free weekend with the annoying sprint bug at its heels poked back at it and i dont see myself wanting to play this again since i cant start playing with my friends  they get thrown onto a different subserver which is allinall poorly noted to the player

they appear to have gotten lazy dev updates are nearly nonexistent on steam  this game is on life support for the time being  really what have they been working on for the last six months and why are they so reluctant to tell us about it

ill be checking back periodically but i have much lower hopes for the future after this debaucle  perhaps ill rope one of my friends in to see if the sprint bug is still there

update pretty much october  it appears that there has been about no development on the game since ive made my review  if i had to estimate in the past seven months theres been maybe two to three times that many manhours put into the game

#####

at first i didnt think i would like it sure i read what it was about and everything but since its early access i didnt think it had much to offer damn i was wrong

just bought today and put in a good four hours so read this review with some caution im not fully capeable of giving a indepth review

i started out by playing with two of my buddies making a server wasnt that hard its almost like making a vannila minecraft server need help go to wiki then loaded into the world the first 20 secconds will be a bit laggy because everything rendering in we got a house going and started cave hunting the enemies scale nicely and theres not much of a learning curve i would also like to add that i absolutly love how the developers of this game update it almost daily thats somthing i love to see it shows they care about their consumers and game keep up the good work

pros
small learning curve
looks beautiful for alpha
lots of content was very surprised
updates almost everyday
noticed little to none bugs
enemy scaling system
lots of items d
price
much much more


cons
i run a r9 290x oc and a i5 2500k and its choppy 56 to 32 fps at some points which is disapointing so i find it hard to belive that lower end pcs can run this game well
better looting system with friends no loot hog
same enemies
graphics options  thats what really got me

tips
new enemies
extra vehicles gyrocopter
optimise
mod support later on
space travel instead of portals build your own spaceship
pets that attack for you

if you read it down to here i appriciate the time you took i definitly recommend this game because the developers update often which you dont see a lot lots of content low price for a game you can play for hours and in my opinion i find it actually relaxing building and chopping down trees




#####

dead game had potential but has been abandoned by creators should be pulled from the store

#####

i feel like we should start getting refunds for games the devs abandon after they get our money

#####

i bought this a couple of years ago played it for about 15 minutes then forgot about it i decided to check it out again and its basically the same as it was 2 yrs ago there has very little progress made by the devs really pretty sad grav could have been something special but the devs have abandoned it

#####

first off i want to say my reviewgame ratio speaks for itself i dont review things unless they really make an impression


started the game with an open mind which really means why did i buy thiswell lets see what kinda mess this is
i was pleasantly surprised
picked a server from the extensive server list and joined
after weeping at the view i start to wander
met a higher level player may his benevolence continue to shine for i was not murdered instantly
i fought some monsters and surprised at how you need a tad bit of skill for even basic ones
of course i got hurt built a campfire and danced
i could feel the music someone said hello and joined the firedance the music got better
i realized after the dance was over the someone was an npc omfg what npcsaresocool
talked to npc  npcs are ok
gathered resources and got lost desperately tried to locate my fire for hours
gave up and made a new one realized how cheap it wasshame
crafted a small 2 room base  hovel and put assorted crafting structures around it
lost it all to a walking bomb or two
rebuilt the base realized how expensive it wasshame
broke some machinery that didnt belong to me gathered something i didnt understand
ran far away when high level people started making death threats in chat over the loss giggled in mischievious glee
went into dungeon with basic rotted wood armor like a champion
died horrible death for my hubris
realized i am back at my first fire and have no idea where my base is
gave up on that server made my own
i am god of this land
invited friends
we are gods
contentment

1010 would be god again

ok for the real review
like myself you are reading these reviews for the simple fact that yes early access has burned you hard probably 23 times and youre torn inside thinking why do i do this to myself here i am looking at another ea
this review is for that gamer

first off ive bought my fair share of crap i dont learn but this is my first review on an early access game for a reason
the games not finished but that doesnt mean its not working the game has dozens if not hundreds of hours of content like a sandbox you make your own game out of it are you going to follow the mold and be a settler an explorer a raider a completionist grav has something for everyone

the negatives
its early access its not optimized its not finished its not a full game please understand this
the ui is slowly being put together which means its kinda crap but at least in 2 days ive seen some improvements
running your own server is an exercise in basic batch file building admining your server is an exercise in commands

the positives
its early access its being actively supported every indication like how ive downloaded 3 fixes in 2 days says so
its early access if you love the game now every addition is free dlc if you followed minecraft for years you know what to expect
theres tons to do and the leveling and gear system is wellbuilt it rides the line between quick and easy and boring and bored of this game to long and arduous and boring and bored of this game youll feel like you have a goal thats just around the corner for many hours which lets be honest is damn near impossible to find in games these days
if you take the time to learn the commands theres a ton of control you can influence on your gameplay check built in wiki link ingame
you heal by dancing around a fire that fire makes music when you do the music gets better the more people dance the music is dubstep

overall i give this game a 910 its amazing and ill be back to flip that review to a 1010 if they continue development and finish the game

#####

totally worth the bucks it may play a bit like a mmo as combat is essential to progress but so far i have almost no con

pro 
gigantic open worlds
dungeons 
already a vast amount of biome variety
campfire press x and let the party begin
good crafting system
great looks

con
one downside is that you cannot hunt for specific planets like desert planets or tundra planets so there might be a little frustration there but its not that bad and will hopefully change in the future

#####

i really enjoyed this game

all the features it have and the potential that it had

sadly the game has been abandoned

i really do think that valve needs to have certain policies in place to protect us the consumers

early access has been used as an excuse for far too long now

it is a good game for what it is and for how far into development it is but i cant recommend the game because of the developer and how they left without saying anything to the community that supported and backed them through early access

#####

this game has a good start for a good game  however in its current state it is limited and buggy  as to be expected for early access  

the good
graphics
combat
exploration
simplified resource gathering
vehicles
guns
pets
wide variety of items to craft
classes with bonuses

the bad
no real level progression
collision detection
rarity of certain common resources
lack of base defense options
lack of harvestable resource types
lack of monster models
very resource intensive
small groups are ineffective

the bad will probably be resolved but a few really stick out
no real level progression sure your classes can level up and you can create new weapons and armor  however it doesnt matter  all weapons are level based damage  this means if you give a level 1 character the max level weaponry they will still hit mobs that are only one level above them for minimal damage  this is not apparent at lower levels but after one reaches level 20 or so it is an obvious pattern  bosses that used to be challenging turn into a huge time and ammo sink instead of being fun  

rarity of certain common resources there are a ton of resources in this game  however you will run into a brick wall for one or two of them that are extremely rare  even though they are marked as common  these resources will be staples to your progression and will basically stop it until you run around gather the 1 or two around the entire planet for a few hours  but even then  when you do build that upgraded equipment it wont have a noticeable change on combat 

small groups are ineffective if you want to play this with 1 or two of your friends it will be fun for the first few hours  however after level 20 or so the no real level progression portion kicks in  if you find a loot chest or an artifact youre either going to waste all of your ore on ammo or fail to get the artifact  

all in all it is worth a try  i liked the game for a while  however the bad points really ruined it  hopefully these get resolved

#####

this game crashed my pc
gave me severe fps drops
made me frusterated af when you are getting ganged raped by non stop spawning monsters
left me in complete confusion as a level 0
disconnected me from the server multiple times

but

i fucking love this game as i spawned into the game having no idea what i was doing or where i was i was stunned by the almost dream like graphics as night comes by i build a campfire and around 34 other level 0 noobies like myself gathered around and chatted after one of us found the x button the dance key we all went ham the stunning realization that this dope ass music was implemnted as the main way of healing in the game just adds to my respect of the creators the amount of hype for 5 level 0 noobies was something i have never experienced before we exchanged stories and went our seperate ways as morning one of my fire buddies and i began to finish the objectives until around level 5 where it really started to get interesting we started to get blueprints for vehicles assault rifles wing suits and frog feet  actually quite helpful campfire buddy and i have mics so we can enjoy our adventure togethor as we conquer dungeons wreck n00bs and pillage from the rich i soon invited a friend to play with us so campfire guy and i tped to his world and proceed to waste all of our wood and fossils searching for this scruberino by shooting flares every 5 seconds but eventually we found him and pillaged togethor once again as you can see after only my first day of playing this game i have already logged 5 hours into this game

side note i was originally only going to play about an hour of this game and go back and play fallout 4 but this game just grabed my attention

#####

it reflects poorly on steam that this game is still purchaseable on the store

#####

this game grav reborn is abandonware full of game crashing bugs yet it is still marketed and sold by steam as early access when it has in fact had zero updates of any kind since 2015 httpsgravgamepediacompatch_notes
this is fraudulent and is abuse of the early access category and grav reborn should have been removed from the steam store years ago do the right thing

#####

heads up games dead devs abandoned it

#####

i may have been extremely positive about this game in the past i bought multiple copies of this game and gave many to friends i am now going to retract my positive statements on this game

i fell in love with the game when i first played it the graphics are absolutely spectacular and i seriously just walked around and did nothing but look at scenery the alien landscape is beautiful exploring the world sending flares up in the sky having little lightproducing robots following me in the dark at night setting up camp whenever and wherever i felt like it it was amazing but now my opinion is different

the devs are gone theyve disappeared theyve abandoned the game the last play session i had in this game my doom buggy clipped through the ground with me and a friend in it players may be familiar with this bug  do not drive in the desert biome with the doom buggy especially near the crashed spacecraft that buggy was expensive and was a mindless waste of resources unsurprisingly i also died when i tried to exit the buggy from under the ground the bugs are going to stay bugs no one is fixing them new updates arent coming even the community updates have stopped i am so disappointed it seems doubtful that this game will ever leave early access

#####

really enjoying this game i find myself to be easily distracted due to the urge to explore and find new blueprints whether youre playing on your own with friends or with strangers its always a lot of fun theres pve and pvp servers to suit the experience youre wanting from the game as well as official and unoffical servers like i said its incredibly easy to become distracted in grav i often find myself gathering resources then spotting a dungeon and being drawn to the idea of killing mobs and finding them precious blueprints grav i can i be a very unforgiving world youll have to watch your back whilst gathering ensure theres enough wood in your generator to power your base and be very cautious on new planets you travel to all in all its a fantastic game despite some optimisation issues and bugs remember people this b is b an early access game run by an indie dev with a recent major update and an enthusiastic and active dev team this is a game that is sure to have a great future ahead of itself

#####

so im writing as of the current state of the game now by date of its launch  812015 

even though im giving it a thumbs up its not recommemed for anybody aside from the people who label themselves as bug finders as its not playable to be enjoyable for the average consumer right now the issues that plague the game at the moment is lag lots and lots of lag to the point where its unplayable to check out the other parts of the game to decide on its quality and whether its good or bad but from the parts ive played and managed to look into it is as follows

the graphics are decent with the art style being really colorful and good looking same goes for the level design of the game with how nice the landscape looks kind of reminds of no mans sky but it definitely has its own unique fun look

the controls are nice and responsive but a bit floatyboaty and the uiinterface of the game are really basic you can see that its sort of a place holder crafting and building structures and objectsitems are easy but not that convenientenjoyable with how basic the ui is at the moment also there isnt much to do at the moment aside from crafting building structures and items exploring and killing monsters there may be a lot more stuff to do but its hard to tell right now since there is no offline mode too at the moment not sure if it will come later on

so yea thats what i got from playing the game at the moment with how massive the lag is right now the game has great potential to be a lot of fun looking at the videos and getting a quick play session of it now i dont recomemend it right now but will definitely check the game constantly to check if its an ok purchase or not because i do have really high hopes for this one

#####

bought this game years ago when it was still updated the devs were neat talking with the community about fixes and ideas

yet theyve abandoned such a neat puppy monsters

do not buy

oy valve please take that game off already

#####

playing grav on a server with friends is hilarious i really enjoyed exploring the world and the blueprints getting slapped by a fantastic kevin the snorter  finding that first vehicle blueprint and going to new planets
there are lots of flaws sure
but with the right attention and love grav deserves it could turn out into such a great game with lots of potential

pros
fun gameplay
beautifull places to explore
lots of dancing and pooping in other peoples houses
lots of random moments and places u just want to capture a screenshot
devs very active on forums 
cant stop playing once you start

cons
 cant stop playing once you start 
 daily grind if playing on official servers
 not that much variety in the game
 still lots of bugs is expected of early acces
 monsters can get repetitive  fe killing 100 frogs in and around an area gets kinda boring
 pvp system might need some kind of rework update  fe adding a punishment system where u lose resources based on the amount of crimes u commited like killing other players instead of leveling a certain job to reduce the amount of recources lost so high level players think twice before killing noobs

suggestionsmost are obvious  more mobs more places to explore more variety in dungeons more blueprints rework current pvp system decay needs to be way longer i still have lots more but this isnt really the place to go over all this d

and im to lazy to go to much into detail 
but grav is a great game and it pains me to see so much negative reviews
if the game can get some more love from both players and devs im sure it will turn into such a great game

so to wrap this up 
is grav worth spending 8  in sale
yes
i spend almost 20 yet dont regret buying it back then


update 12 june 2016
still waiting on some bigger updates
after seeing grav on sale for such ridiculously low prices and the lack of consistent new content im starting to worry the only updates are community updates and balance changes
really hope devs get it together but out of experience i find this hard to still believe in
cant recommend grav for full price anymore but if u dont have it yet and you see it on sale  just grab it but dont expect big changes still hoping for a change but yeah gotta be real about it what you see is probably what you get 

#####

edit
game is incomplete and dead


with over a 160 hours on grav as of the time this review was written i did like to believe i can at least write a decent one 
i now clock over 400 hours as of build 20

i have also written a guide for this game reading it will help you address the common annoyances people have with the game and also further influence your decision to get it
httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid470854662
the review has had stuff added due to patch 19 nothing was removed though
this review has been rewritten for build 20 due to the large amount of stuff and improvments added to the game new players have a much easier time starting the game now due to the new damage curve area level rerolls and tutorial objectives

firstly grav is a sandbox open world much like the other sandboxes on the market you farm for resources craft stuff build bases and consume stuff to survive it also belongs in the scifi theme the game does start out alittle boring but once you get to around level 13 and make your first trip to the moon the game becomes infinitely more fun then i would suggest trying the game till this point before asking for a refund

what sets this game apart from the others honestly i cant give a definite answer to this yet and i am not gonna mention dancing the game is still in development and community suggestions on stuff to be added to the game are conflicting  eg building decay  but still i am recommending it  based on several factors 

pros
large maps
game is gorgeous
they got the basics right
all basic resources are always useful
great developers
early access updates come hard and fast a new build every 2 weeks
vehicles jetpacks wingsuits
problems are solved fast
building stuff is great if you are innovative

cons
8gb ram requirement
repetitive combat or rather non existent combat changes across levels
repetitive dungeons see a few and you see it all
no end game content yet
insufficient playerbase
resource farming requires some knowledge of where to get the fastest amount
some lag is present
griefers like almost every sandbox game griefers is a problem
building stuff is horrible if you dont excatly excell at doing stuff like that
early access

so allow me to elaborate on the pros
the maps are pretty large maps the starter world for example is consisted of 2  3 islands and each island is serval kilometers wide by basics i mean combat movement ui and stuff are all decently done there are some problems and room for improvements but updates are comming in fast for them 

the game is gorgeous a picture says a thousand words
httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid482330205

comments saying the game did not ship with graphics shown in the store screenshots rubbish they didnt turn on post proccessing obviously it wont look the same

all resources have a use for them you wont lets say have no need for wood when you reach max level far from it wood becomes more important than ever this applies to every single resource something which you thought useless at the start for example i thought plasma was useless after i got off the moon little did i know my vehicles and drill platfolm required plasma to run until i got them that is 

the developers are great they are actively talking with the community suggestions made by the community have even been added into the experimental build within hours 

httpsteamcommunitycomapp332500discussions3530645446313592491

proof that i aint just pulling your leg 
there is a normal build and an experimental one roughly every two weeks all the patches added to experimental is released to the normal build and the build number goes up by one currently waiting on build 21

what i mean by building stuff is great if you are innovative well 

httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid470288120

a building project i did alone dubbed project racer this was completed in less than 4 days inclusive of resource gathering
the full thing can be viewed here

httpsteamcommunitycomapp332500discussions0530645446305634897

also my base
httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid487241226

you may check my guide under section 7 for building projects i have completed and am in the midst of making hopefully they might give you some ideas if you do intend to buy grav


now for the cons

the ultimate killer for this game imo the game requires at least 8gb ram to play properly at the moment you can disable all the graphic options to enable grav to run at 4gb but thats the very bottomline it can go for now this basically means unless you are using a custom laptop  high end one you will not be able to play grav on a laptop

like a few other reviews have mentioned there isnt much variety once you see a level 1 slime you have seen the attack patterns for a level 60 slime as well there are also no headshot hitboxes in the game yet i have personally confirmed with the developers they are adding this in but no eta on it yet so what does all these mean basically pve combat in this game boils down to kiting over and over again but considering its early access and they are planning to release more content for combat its excusable at least for me 

currently the game has basically nonexistent replayable end game content but as you can probably see the devs are starting to prepare and release stuff for that vehicles for upcomming warzones like the build 20 released hammerhead  vtol jet  new monsters stuff like that

insufficient playerbase is related to its somewhat bad start and also the lack of end game content when more content is released i do believe the playerbase will increase substainally this game has alot of potiential and the devs are living up to it

resource farming on the other hand isnt as bad as some people made it sound as with a majority of the cons i have covered ways to make your life easier in the guide above 


the game is horribly optimised for large scale building projects atm patch 19 is supposed to fix quite alot of it but we will see
edit
as of patch 19 building large scale projects no longer lags the game to kingdom come i now run at a pretty smooth 20 fps around my base previous was 9  15 fps along with severe lag spikes do note that my base is huge and filled with dymanic base items like laser fences i play with 30  60 fps on other planets this is with a custom laptop
another edit
patch 20 further improves on building with serval optimizations and also introduces building decay into the game

and griefers this one is a major blow to the game i will be upfront and say this the pve servers are even worse for griefing than the pvp ones this is because a griefer can shoot your buildings and you cant even damage them while they are doing so on the pve ones they are planning fixes for this but i did not ask for an eta for this because there are ways to grief proof your buildings also there are alot of stupid things that are done eg new player killing by a small minority of jerk players well you get my point if you do intend to get this game i recommend you head to the offical server in your region with 01 in their name for example i am based in asia pvp 01 these servers normally have an active community that will help and look out for each other to keep the griefers away

building stuff this one took me hours to learn once you learn how to utilise the system its easy but before that its a pain in the ahem to do so just building a simple house with a single door to a balcony can drive you nuts when you are first starting to build stuff i have covered how to use the system in the guide

and so yeah do i recommend this game 
if its on sales of course
at full price sure i gotten more than my money back already

#####

so much wasted potential in this game  there is a great framework for the devs to actually do somethinghowever they have basically abandonded it  dont waste your money on it

#####

very meh game with a decent amount of potential 

pros 

 really cool enviroments very appealing to look at 
 good art assets
housing system is pretty cool and works well although basic there are not too many objects you can make even when you unlock them all but that not really is that surprising usually housing systems in these typs of games dont have many options so it is forgiveable
 cant really say there could be a lot of awsome stuff or bad stuff that i will never know since this game turned me off since i got really really bored

cons
 its boring gameplay i played alot of early access games that i enjoyed much more i wish i played this game for 2 hours then returned it 
enemies are boring to fight just attack dodge attack dodge every enemy is the same in a different body
 dungeons which are the main attraction on planets are boring nothing new just walk in kill everything with the boring combat repeat or die because enemies keep on spawing through the walls

in summary the game was just plain boring for me its a cool game dont get me wrong but i cant reccomend it i usually avoid giving negative reviews because i love supporting devs from all types of games since it takes alot of effort to make them regardless hope this game continues making progress who knows i might come back a few years from now and have some fun or not since many games fail to become finished products we shall see we shall see



#####

was extremely unfinished back when i played it but now doing my research turns out this game has been completely abandoned remove from the steam store please so nobody makes the mistake of purchasing a game that will never be finished

#####

remove this game from steam dont buy it

#####

step 1 release game as early alpha
step 2 go dark never to be heard again
step 3 profit

#####

absoloute shit team making this game they could not care less about anyone they have abandonded the game without a doubt i have over 1500 hrs in this game and had very high hopes  the delevopers will not deliever for example about 6 months ago they released an update that broke some guns still have those useless guns in my inventory and no fix in sight  they are the worst game developers i have ever seen


guess i was right shout out to all the haters below

#####

dead game official servers arent up its dead breaks my heart was a good game

#####

an extremely clunky execution grav takes up way more computer resources than it should making it run poorly on all but the newest machines

the game itself is trite most of the game is harvesting resources and grinding mobs there are only like 78 different mob models that can be fought they all behave the same way and are just recolored for different areas

pvp is not well balanced or implemented and the game is completely lacking without it

developer support is slow coming as their team is very small 
minor pointless bug fixes are constantly pushed out while major issues are put on the backburner

all things considered this game has potential in the current state i certainly cannot recommend anyone purchase or play it

#####

early access review

22 hours was played thus far on a pve server

i will start off with the negatives if you dont like the look of any of these stay away and come back later if not keep on reading 
lag issues 
lag is still an issue right as of now but the dev is working on it and commited to fixing it right now a special test server is up and a patch has already helped part of the issue but there is still a way to go

somewhat barebones 
you cant take down the stuff you build at the moment well in pve i havnt played on a pvp server so i cant tell if its pve related only 
no clear friendslist you have to make parties with custom codes and key commands
inventory system is minimal and missing features like displaying the lookpicture of an item when selected

the positives
alright still here good because what is there is really enjoyable did you see all the stuff in the trailer you can do all of it well ok 90 at this very moment unlike starforge angryface you can level up to max level 30 and gear up accordingly you can play coop with friends and run dungeons and fight bosses together or alone you einzelganger you you can build really neat bases craft armor weapons and yes working vehicles and jetpacks the graphics are bright and the colorscheme is nice the aesthetic has its very unique silly and somewhat cutesy personality 

all in all its impressive how complete the game already feels for a 6 month old project and there is a lot of fun to be had already if the developers keep this up this will be a fantastic game but you do have to realise there is still work to be done you must understand this is still an early access game in alpha so things will break bugs will annoy you and im not only talking about the enemies  and stuff will be missing

give the trailer another go does it look apealing yes dont you mind alphabeta testing and do you want to add to the development of the game join in have a blast playing with friends recommended game may be addicting

#####

i had high hopes for this game and realised quite quickly this game is nothing but a daily grind

the setting is quite interesting and i quite like the graphics though after a while it gets quite boring as everything just looks the same
there is no manipulation of the surroundings no landscaping all you can do is build certain devices and prefactured containers wooden containers stone containers glass and metal which you cant build unless you level a certain profession up which takes forever no free building as you would be used to from other survivalmincraft genrelike games 
and these prefactured blocks are the main problem all items have a certain amount of degrading time unfortunately usually quite short something like 2 days if you dont login over the weekend youll suddenly stand there without your house the only way to keep them from degrading is to build a certain type of shield this shield needs a generator this generator needs wood so what you basically do is logging in every day grind wood to keep the generator and your shield going to keep the house from degrading and this is literally your own purpose in this game
apparently there are more features like claiming land which then makes you be able to claim tax from other players but unfortunately as blueprints need to drop from bosses after 2 weeks of playing this game and basically mainly logging in gathering wood for the generator and killing endless mobs outside and inside of caverns i didnt get anywhere 

as it is bad enough already i played this game with my brother so technically there was twice the manpower twice the chance of dropping blueprints and you would suggest twice the fun but it wasnt we just both got annoyed really quick and as you might be able to see in my playing time in other games i am usually not giving up that easily

no quests same monsters over and over again random npcs called wei wei the wanderer appearing wandering about and being killed by the monsters same with vending machine robots 

unless youre an oldfashioned wow grinding lover you should avoid this game

#####

this game might be one of the best games on early access i would recommend this to anyone who likes survival games as its not like the other generic survival games youll see here no this one is special
this one has a bigger potential than my dick literally ive got this game yesterday and i have already spent 7 hours playing it and it actually got me off my counter strike  global offensive addiction which is pretty impressive considering i havent tried a different game for months but lets get to the point
what this game has
great graphics for an early access
no pay to win 
great combat system atleast in my opinion
very fun to play especially with friends
great crafting system basically you gotta get blueprints to get certain items which keeps the pump to play ive been trying to get this cool motorcycle at the picutre for my entire playtime so far
regular content update
now this is a list of what this game has to fix keep in note that its in alphaprealpha so i suppose this list will get fixed after my review has been posted
optimization
single player
lag fixes
add an option to crouch
implementing more ideas into the game as ive mentiond its still in early access and im 100 sure the developers will add great content to it
in my opinion this game is fun for whoever likes survival games as it might be a bit repetitive its not as boring as the other generic survival games which wont be fun to play after 1 hour of playing

#####

pros
beautiful graphics good music decent sound design
large and varied worlds to explore
solid meaningful progression
deep crafting system
wide range of armors to craft
very wide range of weapons to craft including various raritiesqualities
decent building mechanics allow pretty deep creative expression
basic tower defense capabilities can be built on your base
very fun to play with friends

cons
pretty buggy still its early access so thats not unexpected
although the different biomes have decent variation theres not a ton of different mob types
although i did not have regular lag problems occasionally things would slow down if there was a lot of activity
dungeons get pretty repetitious and the crazy fast spawn rates make them sometimes frustrating
inventory management gets pretty overwhelming and it could definitely use some love

pro or con depending on the person
it gets pretty grindy as you start to craft higher end items its no worse than any mmo though i personally found collecting resources relaxing
pvp seems to attract griefer types i played on a private server with irl friends so this had zero impact on us

so yeah overall i love the game its got an mmolike scale to it theres lots to do and its a fun challenge to try to survive on hostile worlds until you get the proper armor sets to mitigate the various planets environment most of the negative reviews i see seem to stem from people encountering cheating griefers on public servers its understandable that that would impact their perception of the overall game but i run a private dedicated server for friends and of course everyone worked together and we built some pretty amazing stuff so if you do buy the game i strongly suggest running your own world

there arent a lot of games that allow you to run your own massive and customizable mmoscale world grav is one of them and i enjoy the game immensely

#####

i dont remember buying this game but i regret it anyway

#####

another game the devs took the money and ran do not buy they have no intention of finishing this steam needs to punish devs that do this by backing the community and filing a law suit against them and give us back part of the money for this abandoned pos

#####

its fun for wasting time but there really isnt that much to do besides craft loads of mostly useless gear and completely useless structures combat gets tedious very quickly exploring mostly empty worlds is pointless and depressing and since the devs have officially stated they wont be working on this game anymore i really wish steam would not sell it kind of unfair to say its early access when we know for a fact nothing is coming later

#####

bgravb is far from finished but hasnt been updated since at least 2016 im not sure why they are allowed to sell this

please dont buy this game developers should be more transparent than this

#####

if you have played ark like me you will be disappointed about what grav has to offer as much a grinding game as any of these types but it fails in being attractive it get repetitive easily the amount of content is disappointing the state of the ui the absence of a dev  progress tree etc
and then there is soo little support from the devs ark has updates daily and they almost alway offers something for everyone with at least one content update per week this game hasnt been updated for weeks
i tried it convinced some friends in doing so too i really shouldnt have done that nor should you this is early access at its worst

#####

had potential but long gone forgotten by the dev itself
be wary in the future if the dev bitmonster inc try to pull out another early access games

good game bad dev

if you like heavy grind survivalcrafting game i can only recommend this game if its cheap and on sale

#####

abandoned no updates in years
the class system sucks have to level up each profession in order to unlock things to build
the enemies sucks and are repetitive the spawn rate sucks the dungeons sucks all are uninspired
lots of wasted potential

#####

dead games should not be sold on steamthis game is not being worked on anymore and hasnt been for a very long timeplease remove it from sale

#####

why does this even have a page anymore steam needs to refund all of us our money for this purchase as it is a developer confirmed abandoned project

#####

at least no mans sky still gets updates

#####

grav had more promise than no mans sky a visual acuity far superior than ark freedom greater than in pretty much any other game ive played which had jetpacks art design absolutely unique fantastic gameplay and then it all went to shit when it became abandonware

it really breaks my heart but this rough gem has shattered to a million pieces

#####

 abandonware 

last updated 2017  incomplete  should be removed from the steam store the positive most helpful reviews are from 2017

#####

dead game dont buy why is it still on steam

i wish steam would force the developers to inform them when the game is dead so it can be removed it should be part of the of the early access rules

#####

abandoned game

#####

when it was fresh and newly released updates were often and decent took a short break and came back after 6ish months and nothing changed this was a couple years ago now its more or less dead the only server that has a measly population has 200 ping on a good day waste of a promising game 

find another game dont waste the money

#####

the game has been abandoned that is true i only played 50 hours but i was able to get 50 quality hours out of playing without any issues that would impair my ability to play the game i had a blast playing with friends and wish the development would have continued my thumbs up is for getting more than my moneys worth with this game considering the cost of some things for a few hours ie theater etc i found it a novelty when the game came out that dancing around the fire created a special music and the more people that joined in the louder it got more instruments etc was a cool concept anyhow me and my friends had a blast i just wish they would have finished it

h1 grav  a surprisingly well polished early access gameh1

tldr  goto the bsummaryb

bsurvival sandbox proceduralb
sure its a common trend these days with so many similar titles coming out on a weekly basis you get resources you build stuff you craft stuff you kill stuff repeat

to me progression in these games is the hardest thing to nail to what end i always find myself yelling that is not so much this time

ilets start with the basicsi   this is an early access game this means that bat times it simply may not workb because as developers patch it it can break it is the nature of these beasts so please do not spam forums because you are too stupid to identify that prior to buying the game additionally use the forums to search for information instead of reposting the same questions

igraphics 355i
in line with other titles this game has a slightly cartoonish feel based i think on the unreal engine it has some pretty good features currently though customisation of the options is minimal

iinterface 255i
the main menu is minimal however the ingame hud works fairly well an upside is the inclusion of item descriptions in the hud making learning the game a bit easier

igameplay 45i
gameplay is comprised of multiple components
list
the gather
the grind
the build
the reward
list

uthe gatheru
resource gathering is primarily done through the use of a multitool this device allows you to effectively deconstruct resources into nuggets currently the primary resouces are ore wood fossil food elementx
the first 3 spawn in random locations on the map dependant on the biome food is available via a farm which requires wood for fuel elementx however is a little trickier it requires a harvester to be built and placed on to a deposit this must then be checked and emptied all resources are available as drops from mobslootboxes aswell as materials

uthe grindu
love it or hate it the grind is a key component of any levelling game thats right grav has levels firstly lets look at the way the world is layed out there are multiple biomes which are all assigned with a state and a mob level for example you may start in a lush forest where the state is freezing and the level is 12 this means that there is tonnes of wood at your disposal the mobs do freezing damage and are of course level 12
as per any levelling scheme low level creatures only give good experience until you equal their level then you are best to chase bigger prey
what i like about the levelling system in grav is that the mobs are genuinely brutal at level 6 if you try and take on a medium bugdog of level 8  its practically a deathwish unless you have decent gear and lots of health packs
lootwise grinding is the only way you will get blueprints  required to further your knowledge build more stuff and win at life
bsidenoteb i forgot to mention the excellently done combat system although simple for an alpha game it is smooth and well polished whilst maintaining fast paced combat

uthe buildu
by grinding and gathering you are able to get materials and resources as you would expect from any sandbox game these are used to buildcraft things
building is simple there are a number of predetermined layouts which allow you to build in a modular fashion the interface is decent and the skill required is minimal in terms of craft items and machines there is a natural progression here which allows you to build bigger and better things however the most vital component is blueprints which once aquired allow you to build items such as generators and automated turrets

uthe rewardu
this is where it all ties together and somehow grav has kept a very balanced gameplay in order to build decent items you need decent mats which can only be found on decent foes and thus the circle is born although not disimilar to the multitudes of sandbox games available grav just seems right there is just enough annoying resource gathering wihtout it becoming a bore


bsummary 1015b
at the end of the day its an alpha there are issues bugs and bugdogs there is no single player besides running your own lonely server the netcode is laggy and and the system requirements are pretty brutal

however
its fun exciting progressive rich and adventurous the combat is great grinding is fun and with a blueprint system you need to keep searching for your next leap of knowledge

my tips to starting with grav  
check your system specs before purchase
ensure you have friends to play with or at least plan on playing with other people
if the game bunks out when you run it for the first time  dont panic goto the discussion boards and search

hope you enjoy grav

#####

pros

beutiful graphics
lot of leveling  skill unlocking character building etc
lots of blueprints to collect things to build
endless terriancaves towers to explore
ways to get around terrian in timely fashion
online community is friendly
all grinding aspects of the game have techs to increase effienciently
the game seems very fair  giving you refunds for things destroyed etc

cons

can be glitchy at times
public server is averaging 30 players at the time of this writing  feels empty with all that space 
house building can be an exercise in pateince at times

overall ive had lots of fun playing this game  though theyre arent a lot people playing you can often find people to dungeon crawl with  defiently worth the price  i bought no mans sky and while that game is better all around as far as gameplay it lacks multiplayer and ive had more laughable moments playing this game

buy it  play multiplayer  make friends  explore kill gather build repeat

how is this allowed on steam game was abandoned years ago during early access and is still for sale on steam absolutely ridiculous steam needs to get its act together and start curating again but were way beyond that point i guess were all just breathing wallets in the eyes of valve

#####

abandonware  buyer beware

#####

i played over 270 hours of this game and met some very nice people in game   but

forums  

within two weeks so many things have happened in this game the pve east server us iota starting world was completely destroyed after the new 92 patch nothing at all was responded by the devs even after multiple bumps in the thread keeping it utop the forums for over a week nor the other posts by other members had any responses people quit becuase of this on desolate moon i made a drill high up utop one of the rocks and it does not work at all it just stays blue and takes plasma decreasing it over time but always says 2 hours once again wrote on forums  no response from the devs recently after upgrading myself to having 4 drills on one planet i tried that and after over half a week of me collecting over 100s of thousands of materials to upgrade these drills three of the four of them this morning are completely gone this also happened to a friend of mine on the same server earlier this week one drill said inf time on it the other three said 12 days till decay well they decayed within a few hours and i lost a weeks worth of mats i went to a pvp server and the exploits are ridiculous everytime we make a home it gets destroyed shields are up and everything we know how to fortify the composters do not work properly and take 50 of your wood before you can even start putting wood in them cheaing you out of your gathered resources the list goes on 

you couldnt even fix something as easy as the chinese new year hat that was bugged nobody got it if thats the extent of this game i can tell the future of this product is very bleak

 i actually did get a response back from the bitmonster devs saying they do care and to contact bitmonster support through an email in which myself and and some other friends did to urgently let them know the issues with the game  over a week later we recieved emails from the bitmonster email with an automated message no fooling and it said to register with another site and send an email through that way are you kidding me

i find it funny the moderator said they do care but then deleted the post  how hypocritical

#####

this game is dead so dead that i am a little angry at valve for not putting a warning sign on it stay away    this game will never be finished weither this is negligence cowardice or a downright scam    avoid this game

it was a promising game at first

#####

probably the most heartbroken ive been over a game being abandoned such promise and zero closure hope maybe one day the source code will become available and the community can take it over

#####

this game is one of the most satisfying early access games i have ever bought

i was kind of hesitant on buying another alpha but i was not let down by this game one of the things that really sold me was how much the developers have done to the game in just 5 months so i thought to myself the developers seem really active and hard working plus they really want community ideas plus this game has an amazing concept okay ill buy it i was not let down game was pretty bad in the beginning due to lag and other issues in about a week they released 3 patches fixing pretty much all the lag issues they developers are also working on a lot of balancing for everyone to be happy right away

this game is extremely grindy but in the new patch coming out soon 90 they are going to reduce the grinding to make it even better

i have put so much time into this game i have gotten nearly the best of everything you can get so far and i still hop on to play

all in all if you want a game where you can build structures join factionsgroup up wage war keep peace level up gain skills and venture to many unexplored areas to just enjoy the scenery and find new things this sounds like a game for you

remember this game is alpha and the developers have a lot planned for it i cant wait to see how much more amazing this game can be

the most important factor is we shape the game

#####

this is abandonware  dev had given up on it

#####

do not purchase grav the developers abandoned the project years ago 2017 and it should not still be on the steam store the game had great potential but never even reached an official release  not even close such a let down

#####

tldr dont do it unfinished and will likely be unfinished feels like they pushed out the prototype took the money and ran they call that a scam as such flagged

it took them 5 months to push out most of the content to early access and then it just ebbed off the official server browser is dead completely empty and what unofficial servers remain are just deadempty there are currently 3 people playing unofficial servers there is some official server up at the moment but alas i see no one on it the last seasonal event was easter value tweaks again no real eventchanges or effort

the roadmap has not been delivered still weve not seen any updates for 8 months and even then they were not content updates the last content update was halloween 2016 they added zombies and a hat i  you not

the game as it stands
you can run around cut down a tree build a base fight monsters visit other planets via portals the nice spaceship in the advertisement is a plane by the way you wont be flying to other planets the setup of the worlds is very predictable im not on about foliage and all that but the difficulty as you go further out etc it gets very old very fast as much as there are procedurally generated worlds the ai is predictable theres no real challenge to anything unless you fight a player but if you do manage to actually find a player theres also plenty of hacks they can deploy to make you ragequit not limited to aimbotting invincibility suuuppperspeeeeeed and if you get one of these unsightly players on your server those door locks that arent set to public
 will magically be public soon enough

still a plethora of bugs in the game tons of unpolished game mechanics here and there not really very balanced performance is ok if you have a decent rig if not youll be tweaking down some settings
wouldnt exactly call the graphics gorgeous either no matter how much i tweak my gaming rig my game doesnt look like those videos everything is very rough even with aa and all that some of the textures in the game arent stretching right

characters do have customization very limited but lets face it the game is an absolute sausagefest want to customize your character hmm i suggest you put on a zombie hat if you can find a zombie to kill

hate to say it even no mans sky is better than this nonsense shudder

#####

had a lot of potential too bad it didnt get enough funding and exposure

#####

whatever you do dont buy this game its completely deadand thats a shameso much potentialdown the drain

#####

abandoned dont buy

#####

stay clear this game was abandoned by its developers they left it as a buggy contentless lagging mess that barely runs on fairly beefy computer ive kept track of this game since its release back in 2015 and progress slowed down exponentially since then the devs have gone silent and rarely update or even communicate with players one update even had a developer mocking those who believed an update would come by claiming that the updates are taking their sweet time no one has heard from bitmonster in months its safe to say that the game will never get updated which is a real shame 

this game used to have life it seemed like it had passionated developers that cared about players and the game updates were monthly with new and refreshing content being added for a while it looked like the game was on track then they went silent released a new major update and destroyed the what made the game good this is what the game is now unplayable and souless i highly doubt it will leave early access but if it does it will be a shell of its former self this game is a prime reason to be cautious when investing in a early access title 

i strongly reccomend you do not buy this game

#####

no update then more then a year
all devs were not online or write in forum since 2 or more years

and you can buy the game not ok

#####

abandonware yet no release of the source code for community to continue with mods and improvements lame

#####

over 4 years of early access should be removed and people refunded for a game that never came out

#####

dont buy this game the developers havent spoken a word in a very long time no updates at allstay away from this company

h1  09012015  grav early days alpha review  h1

b if you dont want to read the full review feel free to go to the bottom of this and check out the bulleted 
 positives   negatives   most information is given in that b

grav at this moment in time is a game that needs a hell of a lot of work doing to it especially before it becomes an actual enjoyable playable experience 

so why the upvote

this game has a lot of promise and looks to be a great game as time goes on and i am going to keep this review as simple as i can for the time being 

a lot of things will be put into a bullet list at the bottom

the one thing that sets this game aside from other survival games in my opinion is the art style and use of vibrant and contrasting colours

the idea of combining a survival game with that sort of mmo leveling and gear aspect is quite a good concept since there is a leveling system in the game it gives to think that there will be a lot more to do than just surviving against other players and the wilderness although at this early in the game the leveling system could be a slight problem as there is a level 1 starting zone and pvp is usually turned on

dungeons and quests seem to be the main thing that will keep a lot of players busy as well as building your base or house especially those running around in groups hopefully item drops and loot spawns will be evenly distributed but we will see

there is currently no singleplayer at this moment in time only a multiplayer and with it are a lot of lag issues

the game as a whole at this moment in time should only really be given a shot by those who want to go out and scout for bugs and breaks in the game since it has only been out for around a day and a half there is really no propper way to pass judgement on how good or bad this game is or will be we can only wait and see

h1  positives   negatives in a bulleted list h1

list

  art style  visuals
  leveling system
  dungeons  raids
  items weapons armor building material
  building system
  open world
  probably vehicles  mounts
  soundtrack  seems to have a great psyambient style
  extensive lag issues
  quest system isnt quite there alot of the givers just get killed
  no singleplayer
  constant pvp toggle  especially in starting zones  even in groups
  quite a few graphical glitches
  getting stuck in the most unlikely places is likely eg while jumping in an open field
  not a lot to do at this stage in the game not everything mentioned so far is implemented
  combat system is quite fiddley and broken
  no map or minimap feature
  gui is quite broken at this moment in time

list

#####

dead and unfinished game for years  do not buy  honestly steam should close that store page or at least warn people 

#####

fuckhead devs abandoned this game without a word giant cunts

game is not early access its abandoned

take it off of steam for sale

#####

dead game another slimy company making money selling a game theyll never finish disgusting i cant believe steam still allows people to purchase this garbage

#####

it was pretty fun for awhile but then got super grindy and then it just died out again no updates no nothing

#####

seriously i want a refund its been over a year since this games servers have been shut down

#####

let me preface this by saying this game does have a lot of potential  i have put quite a few hours in it and in the beginning it was quite enjoyable   lets look at the good and the bad

good
1 graphics are quite nice  the style is unique and pretty
2 the crafting system is fairly robust  
3 good music and sounds when they arent bugged
4 the idea behind the game is sound if realized i may recommend this game

bad
1  this has improved slightly but this is still the most poorly optimized game ive ever seen
2  the sound is bugged badly since release hasnt improved at all  random sounds and music at random times
3  this is falsely advertised as both singleplayer and survival  it is neither of those
4  a better name for the game could be grindy mcgrinderson lands on the planet grind and builds grindytown
5  it literally seems to get worse with each patch  sounds have gotten worse the events are no more than large groups of random mobs unless you get slimes then you might see some bosses the resource placement is appallingly bad right now and the instances are scarce and nearly useless
6  to call combat rudimentary would be generous imagine minecraft combat only not as intricate 

the game is an ea title as some will surely point out  this may all get ironed out by release but i dont recommend games on what they might be  at this state is not really worth 10 much less 20     do yourself a favor and let them sort out this mess dont toss your money away just yet

#####

the game just disappeared no more servers no more updates really sad looking back at the fun i was having with this game 

#####

grav is a scifi themed survival game with action combat
it feels kinda like a mix of world of warcraft and minecraft with a solid thirdperson combat thrown in
the game is build using unreal engine and looks absolutely gorgeous
and theres plenty of procedurally generated content to explore
on top of that you can build your own base which will undoubtedly be attacked at some point so dont forget the defences
jetpacks monocycles and pets are included
oh and dancing around campfire to increase healing rate is there too d
plus developers are pushing out updates like crazy just look at those build notes

on the downside
 game in general is not very well optimized at the moment and there are no options to tweak only ini files so unless your machine meets min reqs have at least 8gb of ram this game loves it you probably shouldnt get it
 net code seems to be unoptimized at all  having any latency and lags to local server is a bit strange although that might be related to fact that server as well eats tons of ram and 8gb is just not enough for running both  server and client
 current v7 progression is limited to getting all blueprints from monster and leveling your character does not do much

oh and its definitely more fun to play with you friends
if that sounds like your thing  youll probably enjoy playing grav

this game has some of the usual ea problems but the foundation is rock solid and i have had a lot of fun in just my first couple play sessions   compared to many ea games this game has a lot of content and variety and the frame rate is smooth even on my mid tier rig   the landscapes are gorgeous and the art style works with the music to produce some real immersion

i enjoy pvp and so far i like what i see  gear and level is important but so are tactics and aim  at level 4 i was able to scare off a level 19 just using the starter pistol when he had an assault rifle    i was also attacked by a level 9 when i was level 7 and was able to down him mostly because i had better gear had the better pistol at that point so its a good mix of skill and gear based victories

the gunplay feels  a lot like halo to me and i mean that in a good way  its arcadey but still feels like skill matters and accuracy while shooting on the run is critical and can be practiced

the end game seems completely different then the beginning so i will update my review when i get to that but so far so good with grav  more people should be playing this game imo its highly polished and fun for an ea game

#####

if this game is abandonned   how come steam still sells them knowing it is a dead fish  scamming  your clients aint the good way to keep them

#####

game had great potential just another unfinished project

#####

game is a pleasant expierence

made with unreal3 engine it bring very best of it  fantastic looking worlds sky creatures structures lanscapes even waterfals  everything moving or static look great tons of screenshots to be done

pros
 single and multiplayer mode to get different expierence
 variety of worlds biomes with terrain creatures and objects for days
 leveling system for tools mobs and even treesores determinates quality and amont of loot
 mobs loot is a source of crafting matts and ammo 
 wide crafting system  many structures weapons vehicles connected to character level
 vehicles  monocycle buggy jetpack and more
 tools and weapons arent subject to degrade or loose with death crafted once  used infinte
 loot you drop on death could be returned in 2 ways and you may easily find your loot using compass compass also useful to find other valueable stuff and locations  never get lost
 interface hud design inventory at present state is much better than you may see on most youtube videos intuitive and userfriendly as it is even made me forgot to mention this aspect in pros list
 updates are meaty with lots of bag fixes balance adjustments and new content  on regular basis aprox once a month 

jobs system  to choose role like engeneer or pilot or hunter etc and develope its special skills and level it up not clear if it pro or con just feature

lots of guides in community to help you if you got stuck on your progress way

cons
 it has grinding part for resources much less than ark though 
 expierence available only for killing mobs as far as i know not for role related stuff like building structures or piloting vehicles
 mobs design is questionable looks like random models bought on market and hardly related to anything in the world aroud them
  early access caused lack of optimisation even available through interface settings for graphics are mostly useless  you have to edit config files to disable flares etc   still with light effect on fps youll get on lowend pcs

overall i like it more than ark it has variety and it isnt that hardcore to stop you from discovering worlds around you or force you to grind all day long 
game wont scare you most likely as ark would it more would inspire you to explore and learn

and it has nice music and you can dance to that music ingame

#####

noncommunicative devs

slow development

long periods of no updates

low to empty server pop

bugs bugs bugs

#####

this game is dead look at last images on the steam even dev gave up

#####

game should not be on steam community has received 0 notice the studio has dropped all development but is leaving it on steam with the high quality videos  pictures to rack in cash

#####

dev abandoned this

#####

grav started as a great survival game that was fun had lots of stuff to do was visually appealing sounded nice the soundtrack was awesome

but then then they fed up something server performance on public servers were dreadful and seems they couldnt get over it they even tried a relaunch or reboot whatever but the damage was already done

now bitmonster has been silent for a loooong time and sadly it looks likey theyve bailed out i really dont recommend anyone buying this game at this stage  even if the gameplay videos look nice your just throwing your money in yet another abandoned steam early access game

#####

this is a dead game

devs seem to have wanted a quick buck its abandoned for a few years now and you can still buy it

please do not

#####

update 1617some cleanup 

since grav is in early access i cant really review it i can assess based on its current state whether or not the game is priced fairly given the amount of content provided

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvguccp8frntc

as a single player adventure id say grav is worth a look as long as you catch it on a sale of 50 or more the developers update frequently but the game still has a long way to go in terms of content if youre the type who likes to explore every nook and cranny of a game without any real objectives then grav may be for you

if the rpg tag on the store caught your eye be advised that theres no real rpg elements beyond changing your job class in its current state grav is a pretty scifi survival title that is purely sandbox

if youre looking for something to play with your buds but dont have the patience to hunt each other down id wait until the game develops further there is no friends list no icon on a map that will show you where a friend is relative to your current location whether or not youre in a party and no sort of intuitive way to tell where in the game world you are or are headed if you and your friends are patient and willing to stumble around blindly until you run into each other go for it

either way seeing as the price wont increase upon full release waiting for further development may be your best bet

codeif this assessment helped you please give it a thumbsup for more early access reports like this one follow the urlhttpsteamcommunitycomgroupsgamingwithntkcurationneedtoknow gaming curatorurl page 3code

so i bought this game in late july so far this game has been amazing spoiler warning
pros
openworld in the sense that there are very large maps
transportation there are many amazing vehicles such as monocycles tanks and a spaceship along with jetpacks and wingsuits
every server has a world the server you join is your homeworld all of the planets and moons are connected across all servers only servers in there region of the world as in all east coast servers share the same planetsmoons resulting in the ability to trade between servers pvp etc
the graphics are great the world looks fantastic
the building mechanic is good as well a bit confusing at first but once you get used to it its easy
decay unused objects will slowly decay and disappear after a few days
the community is great though a bit small
theres a long list of dances and emotes if your into that sort of thing
some planets have harsh weather conditions hot cold radiation
worlds are all procedurally generated
some developers will add u on steam you can report bugs straight to them if need be and ask questions overall great developing team
the pvp system if im correct isnt level based but gear based so if your classes have the same upgrades as the high levels and you have the same gear you can go toe to toe with them
there are classes u can choose from each with unique skills and these skills overlap each other meaning if i buy the health upgrades for my astronaut all of my classes will have the health upgrade
when u die u can go back and pick up your things if they arent stolen which is pretty rare atm
you can craft an extremely cheap building that acts as a spawn point called an uplink

those are the main positive points that i can think of atm

cons
a small community if more people played this game it would be much more entertaining but atm theres 010 people on a server at the time
the game is pretty grindy if you dont have help from the community its going to be a major pain in the ass getting the blueprints and then the actual gear that you need to compete with the high levels
there are small lag spikes now and then rare and not to major but definetly something to address
if it wasnt for the community i wouldnt have been playing this game for as long as i have the dramawarstrade really make the game come alive if there was a larger community it would be so much funner but because its small theres not to much action
there are asshole players on the pvp servers as would be expected but there are also some really nice ones and depending on the server u first join if pvp you might meet some really helpful friends or really horrible enemies such as east o1 is pretty peaceful and frowns on high levels murdering the lower levels
there arent to many mobsmonsters there are many types of the same creature but overall theres only a few that i know of at least yetis slimes daykillers nightkillers tech hunters and a flying creature cant remember the name it would be great to see more regionspecific mobs such as the yetis which are only found on cold planets
you cant go in the water if you go to deep you will start taking damage when i say deep i mean a few blocks from the coast


overall the game is worth checking out if you have any questions feel free to msg me on steam

#####

tldr no not in current state

does not match advertisement or expectations several environments in preview videos do not exist previews suggest gameplay that is not present in current stage of development gameplay is exceedingly simplistic grinding for numbers game is in alpha stages with resource stability and memory leak issues potential exists but no amount of quantity makes up for the lack of quality
wait till its in a better state

#####

this game has been abandoned for at least 4 years dont bother

#####

game is dead not coming back no updates since mid 2017

#####

the game is kind of empty and unforgiving but the idea is good when i started to play it befor the reborn update it was great for a relaxing solo game but after the big update it got way grindier and boring so i lost my interest now it looks like theyre doing a bunch of updates trying to balance out the game but i would recommend to wait a while befor buying the game and following the updates closely it might be worth your 20 in the future but it isnt right now

#####

you know that house you have to drive by that put a broke down camaro in the front lawn or what would still be a lawn had they bothered to water it because im gonna fixr up one day then come to find out the rusted out shell still sits there years after he overdoses on meth and steel reserves never having touched it well after nearly 7 years of early access and no updates to get er runnin i feel its fair to say grav is that poor car we all still have to see here on display and worse for sale for some reason 

potential wasted early access theft

#####

edit true singleplayer is coming in patch 13


the singleplayer tag is very misleading check the forums about it before you buy if thats all you want it for

thats probably the number 1 complaint i see everyone saying how theres no true singleplayer so hopefully this will help dissuade you from making another post in the future about how theres no singleplayer 

with that said this game is a great multiplayer game with a bright future since patch 10 i would say you could get a solid 80100 hours out of this game however that also presents its own problem where a lot of people will find it very grindy leveling itself i found to not that bad but if you want to make new weaponry you have to take a solid amount of time to build one gun as you get higher in levels building armor isnt that bad personally i find that to be a positive but thats my preference so keep that in mind 

the gameplay is great and has come a long way from its launch where it was almost unplayable due to lag you now almost never even see a hint of it the community is very friendly and i would definitely reccomend bringing or making friends while playing this dance battles and base building and the competition is a big part of this game for me plenty of new content has been released and its constant which is comforting in an early access game if it keeps it up ill be playing this game for hopefully hundreds of more hours

never been so dedicated to watching and waiting for new releases 1010 play this game with friends

#####

please ignore any review from players with less then 5 hours of play time due to the following reasons

1 this game will not take you by the hand and spoon feed you its content like most big name games do expect to have to ask or go look up things like how to use the friends system or for that matter how to find your buddy who has started off in the game on another home planet to you

2 the game will at times apear to have crashed due to what looks like an unresponsive load screen or even that at times it looks like its kicked you back to the main menu  due to the massive worlds and player buildingsitems on those worlds that it has to load it will somtimes look like its crashed when it has not just give it time to load between planet warp gates even if you see the main menu and it will load you where your warping to in the end 

3 sure you might find that its a bit of a grind at times if you do then your doing it wrong ask in chat for leveling tips and farming tips or even better gear to be crafted for you there are easy ways do level and to farm if you know how and players like me and many many others will help you out when you ask for it as long as its not stupid requests like and end game equip when your level 10 lol

4 despite what some players say the game is been worked on by the devs who unlike other dev teams are fixing bugs before rushing new content that adds new bugs to the game there is bug fix updates monthly

tldr 
in short if your looking for polished aaa game thats almost ready for full release and will take you by the hand and spoon feed you like other openworld base buildingsurvival type games do then this is not the game for you yet keep checking back on it as for now its 65 complete imho

but if your looking for a game that you have to put some time and patience into and like to figure some stuff out on your own then this is a game you will love

in closing i enjoy grav as much now as when i started playing it 2 months ago first i was on the eu pvp server and got to rank 278 420 is max but due to a friend from the usa who had crap net and could not play on the eu server i rerolled on the uswest pve now after 3 weeks i am 294 
top tip if like me you want to move server instead of rerolling like i did there is as i only recently found out a character transfer service provided by the devs follow the link for more info httpsteamcommunitycomapp332500discussions8

#####

bupdateb learning that this game is nolonger being updated disappoints me greatly  i love the idea and premise of this game and held high hope for what it could achieve however its ended up being abandoned either willingly or not it changes nothing the time i had played while it was still being developed got me into other games fo the same genre most notably ark

while it was fun and despite the not recommended status of this review i do still recommend playing it if it ever updated again until then please dont waste money on buying it as the servers have been down for some time and i currently dont foresee them coming back up in the near future

heres looking at you space cowboy

boriginalb let me start off by saying to anyone looking to get into a survival game this one is pretty awesome

now i dont know what the reborn update really consisted of and what it changed to make so many players before it have more salt than fresh mcdonalds fries but to new players coming in i think you will enjoy yourelves pretty well
 
now im not saying the game is perfect because frankly it isnt even close to being so but it is fun

pros
easy building
getting mats is really easy once you get the hang of stuff
blueprints for things drop pretty frequently starting off
grindy but doesnt always feel so

multiplayer does need some things it needs to work on softer collision between players so they dont get loaded inside one another and glitch eachother out of the game in the process 

cons
no actual map bummer  compass is skyrimesque navigation but atleast give me a local map inside caves so i dont run in circles all daylong p 
doom buggies will sometimes glitch either under the map and fall through the world or into an instance making you lose the vehical in the process
rather hard to find your friends whilst playing on a server to get them all set up if they just joined
finally though easily managed no actual graphical setting page ingame  can change settings betting in the ini file though  urlhttpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid374738562 go here to find out how url  

its got bugs but what game doesnt i strongly believe that this game has more credit going for it than most of the negitive reveiws suggest hope you too will feel the gravity okay bad pun sorry

#####

please release the source so the community can continue the game

#####

grav could have been a wonderful game but knowing the developers abandonded their work is sad
valve should just remove the game from steam already

#####

grav features great visuals fastpaced action easy crafting and so much more this game has a lot of potential and has already provided me with hours of enjoyment i definitely recommend getting the game d

if you are just starting out check this out as it might help

had so much potential and was a very good game i played those 50 hours within the first week of buying back in november of 2015 but stopped because i was waiting on updates promises and future plans but dont buy this steam and bitmonster are stealing your money to say the least do not buy havent seen or heard anything of bitmonster since may of 2016 i repeat 2016 three years ago steam if you read this get this crap off your launchersite bitmonster still has this on their site and have the positive reviews on there even a link to still buy the game it is all a lie and has apparently been abandoned for at least the last three years from what im researching and finding out now do not buy if i had a way to tell steam to get this crap off i would because the people who have spent money on this in the couple years have wasted their money expecting future promises and plans that from what i can see will never come true half tempted to msg the ones that have their information for everyone to see on their site and see what the heck is going on because this is ridiculous that not only they havent said anything on what how or why things arent being done by either steam or bitmonster disrespectful will update if i am able to contact any of the team on bitmonster site

#####

abandoned since 2017 the lead developers have moved on to making nft and cryptocurrency schemes save your money do not buy

#####

too bad this is an abandoned game this one could have gotten a good one if cared for
dont buy it it is dead

#####

every one at bitmonster inc should be banned from all game related activities for life
stay away this has been abandoned with latest word from the developers 1 year ago

#####

this was one of the best games ive ever played i seriously enjoyed every minute i put into it then for reasons unknown the dev team decided to destroy the game and abandon it its officially dead and unlikely to ever be revived its a sad day

#####

omg they still sell this its been long abandoned like years ago wtf run run far away with your monies dont fall for the pictures lol its soooo long passed dead and gone send me 20 and ill thankyou thats more than youll get outa this game

#####

let me start this review by saying i bought this game on release it is now 02062015 ive played a lot of hours this was more so when it first came out where i could forgive glaring errors with the typical saying hey man its early access so itll get sorted wow was i wrong

first of lets get the graphics out the way yes we mostly bought this game for graphics and the great gameplay video however on release it ran terrible for nearly everybody apart from those with super computers since then i have a very powerful pc and i can run it great however since the beginning and now they have radically reduced graphics fine this makes certain the game runs all on pcs right well one thing where is the graphic settings so i can turn them back to original as i want the game looking like it is advertised yep thats correct still no settings

so what do we have now a game that looks worse than when it was first released

okay so graphics arent everything they did promise quests lots of things to do highly populated servers and base building well 1 out of 3 isnt bad they got base building which is a bit square to say the least every base almost looking identical to the next with very few exceptions

they have included wood rooms stone rooms glass rooms metal roomsthink they was there day one a few bubble like shields they keep reinventing these are mostly done by a 3d artist so during this time has the programmer fixed the network code nope look at server populations if you dont own this game well right now the offical servers have no more than 6 people max and maybe 46 servers may have 12 people and the rest are empty this game is dead and maybe not for the reasons i thought lack of content but purely you play the game and first your like wow its so pretty followed by right what now well you grind grind grind level up to beat better bosses to get better tools to grind grind grind and you think well how is this different from any other mmo well other mmo have better everything seriously this game is broken beyond belief try chatting in the game its impossible not to lose your temper as the chat constantly closes down when you press grammar keys such as  so write a long sentence only to release its no longer there

i wanted this game to do well i really thought it could be something great ive even set up my own server so me and my best friend can play it we tried recently and it was just so boring void of content that i honestly dont see this improving and what is so funny is that its being updated very frequently by huge sounding updates but when you play it you release how small they are 

the devs have included countless dances whats the point when no one is in their servers they have included lots of colours of the same monsters lol they have added a few more 3d models of buildings you can slot together in a linear fashion but you know what they havent done theyve not fixed their dreadful laggy network code its the worst ive seen theyve not added quests even though we have quest givers to make it look like we have content when we dont 


before you cry early access early access i can tell you right now from the time they released the game to now i expected wait a normal person who has no bias would expect much more playable content something to do differently from when the game first came out its the same game with a few 3d models added its disgraceful and not worth the money 

the longer they go without fixing their network code the more impossible it will become when they finally get round to it if they indeed ever do

please if you havent bought this game just avoid unless you dont mind playing by yourself in an mmo game with next to nothing to do other than grind grind grind

#####

i wish i never invested in a game that would be abandoned

#####

do not buy
this was a fun game to play to bad it is dead if they would give up the code so we all could work on it im sure it would make a big come back but till then it is all over was fun for the little i got to play

#####

honest review
before i begin let me mention why this game has a bad overall rating before the reborn update this game was not great and got poor reviews now since the reborn update has dropped its and entirely new game

pros
fun gameplay
good dungeons with lots of loot and things to collect
fun multiplayer
one of the best games to play with friends
leveling is easy

cons
game is boring if you play alone
pvp servers are filled with jerks
huge learning curve
no tutorial 
you will get dissconnected sometimes for random reasons
the map is a minefield where you will just randomly get stuck on nothing 

overall
i belive this game has alot of potential it could be the next big game like ark but ark has major problems but i wont go into those i would have to rate a 710 but now your asking yourself should i buy this game yeah you should and if you dont like it just return it

#####

game is abandon

#####

h1grav is in early access hellh1

nuff said

okay so its april of 2017 at the time of this review  grav has been in the early access program since january 2015  grav hasnt changed much  its still the rather grindy thirdperson survival i saw back then  they have added a few additional movement methods and improved but still butt ugly character models but the charm of the game is actually gone  i no longer see dungeon levels everywhere  i actually could not find one the last time i played  i see all this reborn news and dont really see why they call it reborn because nothing was restarted on the development side and very little has changed over the years  the game is still in early access and im wondering when itll finally have an official release  im not going to try the game again until it gets an official release

#####

it was fun  but its abandonware now  dont even bother buying  wont get updated 

#####

played it a little and while very rough it had some cool ideas  i looked forward to the enhancementsupdates that never came  its games like this that are going to completely ruin the early access program  there are some amazing games done through the early access model but im really tired of getting abandoned and screwed

#####

game was abandoned at early access dont even consider it

#####

i am going to say wait on buying this game for now

i like many things about this game but there are things that really hold this game back for me i love a good open worldsurvival game and the original vision of this game had me very excited to try it out  i am however slightly dissapointed that this game has been in early access for two years and it still is suffering from many of the same issues  the optimization of this game is lacking and it can and most likely will cause stuttering and lag issues you will probably also suffer from the occasional crash  this is something i do understand comes with the early access territory but it has been two years

besides optimization problems i also disagree with some gameplay decisions taken by the devs  first i feel needing to find blueprints for a good chunk of the buildable items in this game is kind of annoying  i will let it slide as you kill a very large number of mobs as is so you dont really need to go out of the way to get more blueprints  however i do feel the costs of building the blueprints is pretty steep  this is more of a problem with building your base than anything else you need to grind for a fair amount of time to acquire the resources to build even a modest base  i dont have anything against resource gathering but i do feel the material costs for some of the items should be decreased or resource nodes should give more materials

resource problems aside there is only so much you can do in this game before you have seen all done all and crafted all  this is in my opinion a serious problem while there might be a lot of blueprints most items are just reskins of other things which play the same way as everything else  i really do not want to build and use exactly the same things over and over again more variety would alleviate this issue in my opinion

to end this i will reiterate my first statement hold off on this for now  wait to see if the devs return to fix the optimization problems tweak building costs and generally add more content

#####

as a huge fan of base building survival games  ranging from ark to rimworld  this game was iprettyi good

my only experience with it involves a 4 player lan and alcohol for about 10 hours straight the included dedicated server was easy to set up with easy customization options however the game settings are not as user friendly some settings like fov and mouse sensitivity had to be set either through the console or a text file in the games directory and even for ea not having at least basic settings like that ingame isnt okay 

the gameplay was fun and the game pretty bugfree but around 5 hours in the gunplay started to get a little repetative most of us used the assult rifle from hour 1  9 it was genuinely fun finding dungeons establishing a base defending it from attacks and leveling up your skillsresearch the heatcold mechanic works pretty well as did the air mechanics on the moon the food mechanic didnt really seem to have much complexity it generally just boils down to press j when it flashes hungry   i literally never thought about where food came from either i just had it on me and kept getting it or its just unlimited who knows

around hour 9 we were about rank 30  45 some of us focusing on one job more and others focusing on getting all the jobs to a minimum level to maximize diversity we didnt get super far into vehicles the highest being the dune buggy but the tanks looked really fun and the mob size was getting larger in the fields so i could see that turning into something pretty fun as well as some sort of space area would be cool even if it was just above the planet map and had some asteroids or something

we got a moon stargate around hour 4 and that was a really cool experience we got the lowplanet stargate around hour 7 and that was even cooler none of these really change the gameplay that much as far as i can tell the best part about this game are the vistas the terrain generation just seems really on point that was really the main draw of these other planets as well as the higher level content but that could have just been on the same planet 

the loot was alright a little underwhelming when it came to weapons there seemed to be enough choices of armor with some to protect against heatcoldno airetc the building system was what i would call above average but not amazing it was sometimes unclear what you had to do to get a piece at the height you wanted i could not for the life of me figure out how to place stairs going up towards something that has been placed already such as transitioning from the ground into a deck

overall i think this game has great potential but needs some more love to get it in a really coherent and compelling state

#####

grav is an incredible survival game the vibrant colors and fun artstyle is a perfect mix the game is mostly online only i imagine there is probably a way to play by yourself but that wouldnt make for a very entertaining experience there arent a lot of enemies right now i have been told that this is due to a bug so far i havent experienced much pking player killing though i have seen it happening according to the chat the game has a nice friendlyunfriendly system which makes playing with friends a lot easier the cavesdungeons can be really hard to find and leveling up can be very difficult as well but this game is still extremely pretty and i hope to see this game get even better over the next several updates

if you are thinking of purchasing this game i would highly recommend it there are a lot of friendly players and the game is very well made

#####

there should be rules against putting games out on steam and taking money from people with the promise of a finished game and then just leave it  and the worst part is that it is still up for sale to this day and anyone that would come in and see this game and decides to buy it will get scammed and steam supports it

#####

unfinished and abandoned dont buy

#####

ive owned this game for quite some time its sad to see that it hasnt updated in almost an entire year this is another one of those it has potential games but it never panned out because the devs have clearly abandoned ship

#####

grav was a cool game  the devs gave up on it about a year ago   if this game and empyrion could merge we would have a fantastic game

#####

dead game dev website down twitter inactive since 2017 no word on anything yet another example of abandonware

#####

this game will consume you  it is by far one of the better sci fi sandbox survival games out there  i definite recommend

first 2 days playing i have techd up well but not easily  it takes alot of resources exploring and killing in order to get the stuff you need to advance

be prepared for a fun game

#####

abandonware developer hasnt even touched their website for over 2 years waste of money 

#####

abandoned by the devs years ago the servers had been shut down
why is this game still for sale
dont buy it

#####

this game had so much potential
the game has been abandoned

i was in love with this game at some point base building was great movement was as expected combat was awesome along with some different concepts

the roadmap was promising along with community driven content updates and changes

unfortunately it has been abandoned and wont receive updates as of a while ago

#####

this game was great fun at the start but it is very dead now abandoned and forgotten by the devs mourned by those who played during the heyday and somehow still for sale thats why im writing this review dont buy this dead and forgotten game especially for the price they are still asking for it

dead game steer clear

#####

no updates since july 2017 abandoned

#####

sadly this game is abandonware its never left early access and the last update was was over 4 years ago it had potential but now its just an incomplete grind fest dont buy should be removed from the store

#####

i feel the need to contribute to the overall user review score but not so much to say what has already been said read pretty much any review and you get the idea great concept fun for a couple dozen hours no updates no improvements game cannot be resuscitated at this point its sad but this is what you get when you buy an early access game on steam you roll the dice and hope the devs will listen and not abandon their loyal customers and community

#####

i remember grav back in its prime its a shame to see that it died like this would be cool if they released the source to the community or sold it to another company with a similar picture for it cause all in all its not that bad of a game just needs more updates

#####

sadly this game is beyond dead this is abandonware

#####

this game is abandonware i got it years back in the hopes that it would be improved and playable now its just collecting dust in my library while the devs run off with my money steam needs to get its shlt together and vet alphabeta games better perhaps have some sort of reprocussions for games that flop this badly

#####

i dont know how anyone could not like this game honestly its one of the freshest most beautiful most interesting and challenging games ive ever played its grindy as heck its punishing its buggy as hell sometimes but man overall what a fantastic game love that pve servers do not allow pvp love the crafting system and levelingrank system love the visuals and scope and weight of everything in game love the pve gameplay monsters are challenging but not impossible

last night on a multiplayer server me and a buddy were just puttering around our modest and efficient base all of a sudden there was a commotion outsidenight had just fallen and all seemed like it was peacefulnow for a couple of days we had been seeing a message in our window that said raptor attack  3 dayswe had no idea what that meant so upon hearing said commotion outside we scrambled to our roof and looked down around the base hundreds of level 1114 raptors were swarming around our base the prophecy had been fulfilled it was insane difficult and tedious but we had to kill all those suckers and we did 

this game is fantastic give it a shot thanks devs this is truly one of a kind in a world of crappy early access games

#####

another early accessᵀᴹ since 2015 abandonware something that seemed promising when it was first introduced but then turned into another dead game in a short period of time avoid even if you wanted to try it since theres nothing to try here

#####

#####

bitmonster matthew et al turned into real poop when the grav community began to realize several years ago that the game was being abandoned the level of hostility they faced was deserved but they reacted in a petty and personal way  adopted the basic fu attitude to the gamers who paid for grav 

now every 20 sale to some unsuspecting new gamer is just another big fu to the community from your friends at bitmonster bm is everything that ruins ea games for legit devs out there

this comment says it all

bit dissapoitning it was dropped had a lot of potential have 2 copies for free mesage me if youd like one

#####

update 2 well update about no updates how ironic 2019 and the game still on steam as a cash grabber

ive bought 4 pack in a promo given one to a friend and other 2 still on my inventory i simply cant give a cancer to another friend update 1 i will not give these copies to you please dont add me asking for it

pros
 motorized monocycles
 crafting mode is cool but grind is just a nick you need to grind a lot so is more or less a cons here
 overall graphics seems pretty good for a indie game
 super cool way to regen life dance around campfire and if friends dances together the awesome music grows in volume and style
 overall animations are ok

cons

update 2  see that starship on game image theres no starship on the game
 excessive grind even for stupid things
 stupid enemies in every aspect design behaviouria and rubberband
 a very very small of amounts of players that are so toxic that seems im playing league of cancer
 when a retard purchases a indie game plays for almost 8hrs a day changes his nick to gravmaster and spent his life on the game hes simply kills the game by killing noobs for 200 wood or a other shitty resource even if they pays for the game they just quit by tormenting the already lazynot my problem devs with stupid complains
 gotta friends that have this game but never played with them they have 06 hrs 02 hrs and some of them with simply zero play time i will let your imagination wonder why they have that small amount of play time
 non existent player base just the above mentioned
 bugs from graphical glitches to imortal mobs

 survival what a joke on this game  level its just dumb
 mixing level 900 with all jobs leveled at max too with level 1 with zero jobs its dumb
 partially redo the game and calls the update as reborn and left various bugs and worst optimization before the update its dumb
 create a recipe for a emp bomb only for high levels to destroy little bases and even shacks from low level players its dumb

single player is meh
multiplayer you just got destroyed even using an advanced weapon than your enemy if hes using a leveled job thats right this game uses jobs if youre a level 200 and uses engineer as a job level 25 and uses the most advanced weapon that you can use youre gonna be pwned by a level 100 with job level maxed with the most mediocre weapon makes any sense for you

this is one more abandonware on steam devs just got our money keeps on early access so you cant complain because isnt finished yet do not buy even with discounts your time will be wasted and time my boys no one will give it back to you

this game had potential but now the game and the devs at bitmonster inc are just with their reputations tainted

#####

this is an early access review features are subject to change upon full release
grav is something that i was hooked to instantly im not sure if its the beautiful alien landscapes or the dungeon raiding you can choose to do by yourself or with friends but i really enjoy it the early access so far gives you 2 fairly decent sized islands to build on scavenge explore and dungeon raid im not sure i would call this a survival game though although you do have a food meter and you can build a farm it is very easy to collect food dropped by enemies in all the time ive spent in the game ive only ever needed a farm once and it was because i crafted several health stims from the food i had upon killing enemies they can drop numerous items but the one item you get a lot of is food so i would hardly call this a survival game unless they are talking about the fact that you can die from enemies and other players it just doesnt have the survival feel it is a great game though aside from the dungeon exploring and vast landscapes you can also craft numerous weapons armor and comsumables as well as build a base with defenses from enemies like turrets laser fields and shield nodeswhich create a dome around your base not allowing anything in  there is a leveling system and in order to take on high level enemies you will have to start at the bottom killing low level enemies first and using low level weapons i found fighting anymore than 2 levels higher than your players level usually turns up bad unless youre attacking a bugdog or a slime those things are usually easy to defeat but can take lots of hits and be tedious to kill another great feature that seems to grab a lot of people is the ability to dance now dancing doesnt just look funny and awesome but it is also a means of healing yourself and others if you crowd around a campfire and dance you will instantly start recovering lost health and if you dance with friends you will gain it even faster there is also some very awesome music to go along with it 
the crafting aspect of the game is pretty vast there are numerous materials to be collected and some will only be dropped in certain level areas craftable items include buidlings weapons vehicles armor stims defenses and work stations among the many things available for you to craft in the game you can get a jetpack eventually which will allow you to visit the other island that you can see in the distance from a certain side of the island you start on everything on the second island is meant for levels 14 i believe although there isnt many low level dungeons or areas to fight in on that second island it makes you really have to be careful what and what not to aggitate it kinda makes you feel stuck doing the same thing for a while between just a couple dungeons but once you hit level 20 your horizon starts to broaden and you can visit a lot more of the many dungeons available that is pretty much it for exploration at the moment but it still offers a lot i would say each island is about the size of one of the bigger battlefield maps in future updates there will be something they are calling stargates that will allow the player to visit other planets galaxies and hopefully have new enemies to fight now i personally havent played much pvp considering the servers and the game desync and lag are still being worked on there are rubber banding issues just like there was in dayz standalone when it launched but those issues are being worked on and a lot of progress on those issues have already been made in the short time ive been playing so playing against other players isnt really fun at the moment cause you never know if that person your fighting is actually where you see them on your screen but it should be a fun game mode once the lag is sorted out the developers are very active in the forums as well and seem to want to make sure everyone has a good experience they even consider ideas that others have posted for the games future  im very interested to see where this game will wind up i have very high hopes for it and will continue playing it im sure for a while i highly recommend it if youre into exploration dungeons bosses leveling up and crafting

#####

game had so much potential but the dev couldnt be bothered to listen to the community or even just stay in business

game is dead dev is dead nothing to see here dont waste your time or money

#####

abandoned by the devs still not optimized or playable

#####

bought this game years ago and it hasnt been updated at all dont waste your time or your money

#####

i bought this game when it first came out in early access and while it was fun for a few hours rust had just received a new update and i got consumed in that for a time  after the last update i decided to jump back in and boy oh boy im glad i did this game is truly awesome  it has a bit of grind but it rewards you and finding new blueprints and crafting new items armor weapons etc is really fun  once you learn the basics of survival and find a wing suit jetpack and monocycle its really a blast  then there are the gates which you can build that take you to entirely new levels and the global world events which yield a lot of loot  theres already a lot here  the developers have proven theyre invested and are constantly adding more content  it reminds me of a prettier anarchy online aesthetically  and because of the leveled npcs and dungeons theres variety to what youre doing   and it has basebuilding and pvp servers but pve is really where this shines  its an mmo with crafting  play it with friends  youll see a lot of houses around and evidence of human life but the players are spread out i really look forward to the upcoming patches and hope this game gets as much praise as it undoubtedly deserves  give it a shot its addictive

#####

bought it 2 days ago 24 hours logged got a jetpack and have armor made from the bones of my victims

#####

the devs left it unfinished dont even bother

#####

they abandoned this game and yet you can still buy it dont

#####

dont buy it was abandoned a looooong time ago criminal its still being sold on steam

#####

this is currently abandonware do not purchase

#####

abandon all hope ye who enter here like the devs did

#####

had a good time when devs where still working on the game
unfortunally this has become yet another abondoned ea game

online died out a long time ago single player was still attractive until 
also that became unplayable

i waited a while like 4 months with this revieuw in order to see if
it was only a period of nondevelopment but the truth is here

steam should remove this from the store

#####

the game has been abandoned stay away

#####

well i have had the game awhile and played about 35 hours
i have waited to write a review untill i had a good feeling of the game
i will make the review pros  cons with a few statements

pros
very good graphics and they really make you feel that they are real somewhere
sounds are decent and also suit the game and weapon sounds and the npcs
devs are still working on the game that is fantastic
size of the game and access to other planets is great
game has both single player with options for cheats and has multiplayer i do not play multiple play so cant rate
the game is fun and challenging at the samme time

cons
the controls are ok but needs some improvement
when building items such as fence you cant build right againts rockshills so you will have gaps unless you use nothing but fence on all sides
it takes long to get resources unless in single player and using cheats
needs a better tutorial in my opinion as it does not cover a great deal like all the commands and controls seeing them is not enough
a big con is the build restrictions they really limit placement
and the last con is camera and player view you should be able to change distance and view points from your character and from a free float camera

would i suggest this game to others 
the answer is yes as it is a good game or even better on sale

it needs work but all in all a good rounded game

#####

i cant believe this game is early access it is extremely fun to play and the best part is the developers keep adding new content i recommend this game to everyone who likes space base building exploring dancing and many other things

#####

i nominated this for the perpetual state of denial award

i still believe theyre going to finish this thing and it will become the cool crazy timehogging fun it has the potential of being i cant bring myself to recommend it as a new purchase because i just dont know anymore

i love it even if it never gets anymore complete than it is right now i have no regrets for buying it but at this point all i can do is hope for the game that i can see it should be

#####

just a reminder review the game is abandoned the devs practically scamming people for money by still selling it as an early access game do not buy

#####

dont buy this abandoned unfinished game this game shouldnt be for sale anymore

#####

all things considered this game is dead not a peep from the devs from any medium still in early access

#####

there is a compelling mix of stuff to do here even in this extremely early stage i can see a lot of potential if the devs continue to engage the community in the way that ive seen during this initial weekend of gameplay im sure players can rest easy that they are in capable hands with all that said if youre adverse to bugs glitches performance issues crashes grinding bright colors floating rocks and dancing then you should probably wait for this game to get further along before you dip your toes in the water also it runs like crap at the mo see video fro more details

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2whywgxmq0

#####

game was abandoned in early access and the devs didnt respond for months i dont see why it is on sale right now it should be pulled from steam too bad it had potential

#####

i wanted to like it i really did for the first hour or two in the game it felt like it was going to be fun until you reach the two hour mark and i realised thats it not a whole lot to do 
the game could argue its a sandbox game but no sandbox is fun unless theres things to do 

you can wonder around looking at the pretty sights and fight some monsters but thats about it the loot system doesnt really give the player any sense of acomplishment theyre meaningless crafting things and building structures is so awkward and hard that by the time you have farmed a few hours for resources you either die or build 2 or 3 walls before having to go out and farm for another few hours its just not fun

if the game wants to suceed they really need to give it a sense of direction at the moment any generic zombie shooter is funner than this game the game looks pretty and sadly thats not enough for me to recommend this to other people

the game is indeed in early access and i wish bitmonster the very best in bringing out the best the game has to offer i only hope they will take on the community feedback and enhance their game at the moment the game has a strong foundation it just needs content but for what it is at the moment im going to have to recommend people keep their money in their wallets for now



#####

tragic end to a game which could have been something special how unfortunate

#####

key feature yet another 20 abandonware in your library

the perpetual great potential very slow developmentwillitevergetfinished thing on steam 6 months without updates basically steam keeping this game on their store is similar to a brick and mortar store still selling city of heroes mmo disks after the servers went down fraudulent steam needs to crack down on this issue or nobody will trust anything in early access anymore

#####

game is good ngl
but the devs one day just vanished and left with the money

game couldve been a real gem

#####

abandoned and unfinished should be removed from the store

#####

youre paying for abandonware

#####

was a really fun game during its prime development has been dead on this game since mide 2017 do not buy this game i repeat do not buy honestly though if the developers actually cared enough to continue once funding got a little slower this game mightve actually been bigger than ark was sadly they gave up when the player count ebbed and the money stopped flowing in

#####

abandoned product should be removed from steam

#####

unfinished and abandoned

#####

do not buy the developers have vanished with everyones money and no final product will ever be released

#####

this used to be a good game with potential then the devs abandoned it do not buy

#####

dead game abandoned years ago remove from steam only writing this because i was surprised you could still buy it

#####

for those who might be scared off because this is early access dont be i know we live in a era were early access is a often approached thing here on steam and many of these games are not worth it while some are i can truly say i didnt know much about this game when i bought it but damn this game feels like an adventure

exploring new places building bases and try to become stronger slay beasts and gather blueprints n resources so you can gear up find friends and people you can work together with or attack other players wouldnt advice that since you can get a pretty tight defense system up and running 

but ofc this game is early access so there are minor bugs and lags also the ljoin server loading screen is really long and takes about 5 min to finish by my experience and the game can be very laggy at start but after a couple of minuttes the game is pretty fluent the devs are really hardworking though since the updates and replies from them are pretty quick  often 

this game has so much potential and i am excited to be a part of the progress of the games development

9510 would grav again

#####

rest in peacegrav

#####

another early access cash grab abandon nothing has been done in months on this game and things seem to be leaving like servers to play onwould recommend moving on to another title for anyone thinking of playing this

#####

abandoned by the devs

#####

best grinding simulator ever

the dev are not going anywhere been year now and all we got is barely any new content just some rebalance here and there
even the reborn update was a pure lie

to sum up you have multiple profession that force you to grind the same mobs over and over to level up and if you pick one you will need the other at some point so at the end you level up 20 times the same character killing only 4 different monster barely reskinned to unlock what  the same 2 items with a  because its sightly better

there is no rewarding feeling you grind you level up but you still grind the same thing
there is nothing to do really just build a base with 3 small set and that is

great concept but badly done

only recommand if you buy the game for less than 3 usd

#####

i got this game soon after its release it was a great game with a lot of potential in my opinion many planets to explorer and farm specific resources to make specific gears you could build magnificent bases even had machines that farmed resources for you

i did not play this game in years now but seeing how the last communication from the devs teams was on july 14th 2017 i thought id make this review so idk so people stay away from it since steam is too dumb to do something about it and is still selling it hopefuly the mostly negative will keep people away





#####

i have had the game for years my wife and i play on a private server easy to set up simple bin file even in its incomplete state it is an addictive game hours and hours of addiction it has bugs and quirks rumor has it that a few of the original creators have created a new company and intend to either pick up and finish this version or recreate it ground up i would still play it even then

#####

have to admit im not normally one for survival style games but this one has been a blast from the moment i downloaded it definitely a bit of a learning curve in some parts but over all well worth it

#####

abandoned game dont buy

#####

abandonware needs to be taken off the store

#####

ive had this game for a while and early on it definitely had issues came back to it last night and joined a friend  we had a great time playing it there were a couple of crashes my guess is some kind of memory leak but all in all that game is very pretty and a lot better then it used to be its an easy going game esp since there are things you can do to stay away from the mobs if your not someone who likes or can do a shooter type so for the builders out there it can have some downtime but its got some really great scenic places you can build all in all i liked it being a couple of years old now i doubt there is going to be much more to it but it could use some love

#####

the development of this game was abandoned way back in early 2016 after making the devs good bank

#####

developpers ran away with the money

#####

good thing the reviews dont reset every now and then like your multiplayer character

#####

there is a lot of negative comments about this game that are unwarranted with the small size of dev team to the massive work they have put out is phenominal the fact they listen to suggestions and really only real negatives are that people who feel the need to bash a game because its not to thier liking or thier a troll try constructive critism so that any concerns you have can be dealt with if its an actual suggestion

#####

abandonware

#####

i think grav has a lot of potential and i found my first hour or two in game were pretty fun however at the moment you cannot currently save your character in any way not sure if this is a bug or something that will be patched later shades of the forest as the game stands and as with any early access game it is an unfinished product and will need time to really shine also id like to see some level of personal character customization

heres a video of my first impressions

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlak2tmb9r3clistuuew4xzhefiriybiuigchrlg

#####

h1an update a day doesnt necessarily keep the bugs away h1
 
you gotta give the developers their due 2 days after purchase and im already on my second half gig update not something i am particularly happy with when at home on aint so great british break neck net speeds of 500000 bps you like that yesterdays patch caused lag on all servers so i guess todays update addresses that 
now i know some of you c0cky mofos ye you know who you are are going to blame our cr4ppy net for lag issues although this may be true in many circumstances the lag issue above were prevalent with friends multiple configs and on many servers 

basebuilding  check you place prebuilt rooms stairs fences etc lets call them modules which come together in varying ways depending on the type it feels like its kind of a mix between sandbox and tower defense the modules are not cheap and without defense are soon destroyed i wouldnt really call this sandbox atm open world for sure but there are no tools for modifying the world merely adding
survival  yep you have to eat scary things can come out at night depending on where you are but ftm thats about it
adventure  explore i suppose procedurally generated and im sure i read infinite i find that hard to believe as we reached an endless ocean after a 30min run from server spawn although i suppose that is infinite p no npcs missions storyline or any other distractions
action  kill various stuff mainly played pve but we did jump into a pvp when testing lag issues no deaths but no kills despite trying lag was just too bad

likes pretty yet doesnt feel too taxing on rig easy learning curve at least atm nice community so far plenty of potential

else gathering sound come on you can do better than that no building amendment that could be a biggy even with its potential for growth it could fall prey to its limited foundation
 
ive seen alot of reference to the dreaded grind to those people i say perhaps you aint a gamer  anyone else who isnt currently enjoying any other mmo sandbox what are you waiting for a written invitation get your a in here 

linky r4te tum sub add  dlup kill die  suck 1t muchos luv x peace especially for you

#####

game is abandoned and even if you buy it after 2 hours you get boredgame was dropped long ago and devs are not coming back
useless grinding and game scales with your level you do the same damage to a lvl 30 creature when you are lvl 30 as you do damage to a lvl 5 when you are lvl 5 so to make this clear no need to get higher lvl because loot is nearly the same with lvl 30 as with lvl 5 even your weapons scales with your lvl your first pistol is going to do nearly the same damage as the latest and best rifle in the game

#####

this game is amazing the developers are active and do a great job 

#####

the game was an early access abortion theres literally no point in buying this game and i have no clue why its even in the store any more

#####

dead early access game  the developers abandoned it long ago  pity

#####

checked on this 4yrs later still early access thinking

#####

dead game avoid

#####

dead scam

#####

its a shame that this one was abandoned when you open a game in 2020 and see developers notes from 2017 for game is early access  it means death

#####

cannot recommend at the moment needs alot of work before its obviously going to be a finished game  right now far too many issues which make the game more of a chore to play than a fun survival game   dungeons have monsters that spawn way too fast sometimes as you kill one enemy another respawns in its place  and sometimes you die because of monsters respawned on top of your character locking you in place because of clipping issues  graphics wise it varies from area to area it can look stunning in forests or on moons to looking kinder low res and somewhat ugly in dungeons 

another issue distinct lack of the varity of enemies just 4 or 5 monsters in the game it seems  so it can get boring fairly fast especially once you start the grinding   base building is also a chore since you have very limited options all across the board becomes very difficult to build a cool looking base  another issue with bases is that enemies seem to have no problems walking through walls or spawning inside your base either also what happened to base lights or better options at night since its exceptionally dark pet lights dont really cut it so again basically grav needs more of everything

i think if the developers can really build on this game improve base building  add a lot more monsters  fix spawn rates and generally add more content then grav could be a serious contender against ark 

pros

multiple planetsmoons
many dungeons to explore

cons

lack of options across the board
too few enemies types
melee combat is useless
grindy
too dark at night with limited options for lighting
base building isnt intuitive 

i hope the developers keep working hard at making grav the game it deserves and aspires to be i think everyone interested should keep an eye on the development it shows promise once they can get fix the game up

#####

this is the best survival game ive come across since minecraft and its still very early in it seems to me to fit somewhere between rust phantasy star and mc with a splash of something all its own active developers regular updates easy to learn mechanics and an immersive world make this one of the most promising titles ive seen yet

#####

game has been abandoned dont buy

#####

game was good it is good but its dead official servers are down only some private are still goining devs moved on never stated anything about dropping the development of grav 
skip this game

#####

so this game taught me why its a risk to get an early access game true many turn out to be great games but there are others like this one which showed great promise but simply gets abondoned by the devs

#####

this is actually my second review for this game my first was back in jan 2015 and was positive however things have changed

i cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone at this point 

in the 2 years i have had the game not a lot has been altered at all the developers did frequent burst updates back when it first got released into ea on steam and then slowed down to a snails pace now they hardly ever bring out updates and when they do its minor bugfixes no new content in well over a year and the developers also have a habit of going into silent mode classic bait and switch by the developers here  who have clearly given up with the game and run off with any money they originally made

unfortunately this game is dead in the water  a prime example of how early access games should not be done it is a great shame too since it originally showed great promise

do yourself a favour and avoid it i would also be weary of any future games from this developer

jimbo rating 410

#####

it was a beautiful and very enjoyable game back when it first appeared on steam unfortunately the developers abandoned both the game and the community leaving us with something thats too buggy and incomplete to enjoy for long   

nearly 5 years with no word from the developers but they still charge full price whats left of the servers are all empty dont waste money on this

#####

people complaining so far clearly do not understand what early alpha access means
obviously a lot more needs to be added fixed etc

game looks great played for about 23 hours

things i would like see done though
some sort of mapminimap
being able to actually drop items for people in your group
friendly fire off with team

the lag is a bit annoying but what do you expect the day of the release

i will be giving this a good month before i can start saying any bad about this
so far i have no complaints for this being day 1 and alpha to begin with


#####

decent game a bit grindy for most impatient players who wanna log in and be a digital god in one night with out putting effort into getting gear etc build stuff and some bored player makes it extinct while your offline lol whatever server you choose will be your home planet like it or notcostly star gates take you to one icey moon or mid and exoplanet that on my server looked same as my home world with the same enemies only different color or name the few types of enemies are the same with generic names for elites and rare spawns but higher level mobs are the same as lowbie ones just different color and name no matter where you go this all based on playing up to level 29 not the level cap the servers are as dead with barely anyone online at all hours of the day why give the game a thumbs up because its only ea and for an alpha staged game its got a lot of love from the devs and has potential to be a fun addictive game later on but has a long way to go

#####

cant steam make a thing that having a game on early access on steam requires a monthly fee so you are more pressured to finish the game or that if you keep it on early access too long without interacting youll have to refund people

#####

i was extremely excited to start playing this game space exploration technology different terrains and random enemy events all garnered my attention its way upon playing it further i wasnt all that impressed bcontrolsb felt stiff animations were decently good gathering resources became annoying as it was a grind every time and the bgameplayb simply remained alright i realize that this game is early access but there are some issues to be address

grav is a sandbox game by its premise in which players are required to acquire resources to build and improve their technology or build up their base on a world that is segmented with different environments bcontrolsb are basic at the moment and movement is a bit limited in regards to jumpdodgerolls obviously the player can move about using wasd and increase their speed with shift if they have a stim available space will make the character jump quite a distance in the air airtime cannot be adjusted while g will initiate a greeting and put the character into an animation as well as x and z on top of this players are able to fire out a flare using f and are able to keep pets which can be managed by pressing k additionally skill points can be managed by pressing k as well b handles the build menu and will most likely be one of the most important buttons you press there are devices ingame such as the flaregun that help players locate one another if players are looking for something more indepth a locator can be built in which coordinates will be displayed on the screen showing locations last death points and current locations

the player will start out with a club and a multitool basic objectives will be displayedgiven for the player to complete first some of these objectives include forging weapons crafting new tools or building certain stations the harvesting tool allows the player to harvest wood fossils gems ore plasma and sunstone special resources include food when the player gets hungry elementx used to craft higher level items but needs its own designated harvester to collect and a loot crate loot crates require the player to be certain levels before opening them they got pretty creative with some the vehicles they created and decided to make it real by using fuel one of the first modes of transportation is the wing suit altitude cant really be gained but holding space will let the character glide and doesnt require fuel the monocycle looks like something out of south park its this giant wheel the player can craft that sort of looks like a motorcycle that does require fuel the jetpack is another mode of transportation that is quite selfexplanatory and uses fuel as well a doom buggy can be created as well as an aerial vehicle known as the hammerhead which is extremely expensive  lastly the centurion basically looks and acts like a tank some will require a blueprint to build blueprints can be found throughout the maps or dropped by bosses upon their death in order to unlock or expand possible crafting concepts blueprints are not lost when you die

crafting stations is what makes this all happen crafting stations include  armory factory kitchenette matter condenser science station and vehicle bay for large vehicles armory crafts ammo armor weapons devices and multitools the factory will produce materials traps and smaller vehicles kitchenette is obviously for food while matter condenser if for producing materials the science station will craft stims and devices room configuration is basic at the moment but some neat combinations can be put together in order to make it all look appealing obviously different material can be used such as glass wood or metal but basic designs involve a basic room with a door a balcony supports stairs roof room with windows enclosed room and a bridge additional smaller structures can be added such as ladders ramps bins camp fire and flags lastly power structures are available to build these include forcefields stargates automated turrets alarms beacons jump pads generator data recorder and not limited to shield generators

similar to terraria in its customization players can craft armor out of the resources they collect so wood fossils plasma etc to compliment a good defense players can craft better weapons in melee or ranged situations some melee weapons include swords knifes blades and cleavers some ranged weapons that can be crafted are pistols rifles smgs shotguns rocket launchers and superior weapons that have a pretty intense impact stims can be crafted as well to give a player boosts such as damage or invisibility or health traps can also be used such as landmines but i havent experimented much with these weapons its sort of tedious trying to get an enemy to run over your trap but it does provide a better defense for the base

there are occasional attacks that can occur as well this sort of took me by surprise as i had no idea what to expect i got a message stating that there would be a raptor attack soon and had a lot of bird looking things come out of nowhere and swarm around me the variation in enemies is minimal at this point but some cool concepts have been introduced there are specialty enemies that will sometimes be rare in color or in size jumping from planet to planet or moon to moon wasnt as exciting as i thought in the game rodina early access currently the player may physically land on the planet and get out from their ship or may take part in interstellar travel its not quite possible in grav moons need to be accessed via stargate im not sure exactly sure how planet to planet travel happens either than stargate but i highly doubt the player is able to interstellar travel by spaceship

bvisualsb are pretty neat at times while sometimes it seems as though they are buffering i have a pretty powerful computer so this shouldnt be an issue the designs are actually quite interesting and seem unique to the game bsoundsb are pretty basic and can become annoying as you grind to collect materials and resources the enemies have varying voices but when they get hit every clip that is played is about the same although gameplay should be the primary focus of this game wouldnt hurt to tune all this up to

its quite difficult to get going in single player as gathering resources can be extremely difficult while trying to stay alive and dodge enemies i would recommend playing with a group of friends to advance quicker in the game as advancing yourself is extremely difficult overall it is not a bad game but it just doesnt feel put together properly at the moment there is way too much of a grind and not much of a reward i find the available options seem cool but almost seem unattainable at times with no mans sky coming out soon as well as rodina it would be tough to recommend this over the two if it appeals to you i would suggest buying it at a cheap sale price

bought 2 years ago little to no progress 

developers promised things that ever came another early acess cash grab

do not buy

#####

this game is dead do not buy

#####

the trailer was not kidding currently over half the game is about dancing half the customizable controls are litterally dance moves

that aside this game has a quite a few drawbacks that need to be addressed first of all this game has severe motion blurring when you movelook around its like youre drunk and cannot see where youre going second the option menu is minimastic like an aeria game there are barely any options no sliders for detail no sliders for brightness nothing third placement controls are awkward compared to other survival type games and needs to be refined fourth as opposed to most other survival type games there is no first person mode infact the camera distance is permantly set and cannot be changed which can cause problems such as when trying to look out windows fifth the interact and punch button being the same key is a bad idea new players would get used to the button being the interact key try using it against something that seems like it should be interactable but isnt then end up punchingstabbing a traveler in the face

hopefully those will be adressed as the games development continues

something else that needs to be mentioned is the games building system is a cookie cutter build of preset rooms some may like this design but for me i prefer building the home piece by piece roof walls and all

#####

whats going on here 

i bought this game in november of 2015 and it looked like a great start to a game under development and i was excited to get into it that being said it doesnt run well on lower end pcs ive barely been able to play it until i upgraded my hardware and now that i have a higher end machine i find that nothing has changed from the original game

its been two years two years of what minor bug fixes theres nothing to this game theres no worthwhile content and when i spent enough time to reach level 10 on solo play so i could travel to the moon game lags out freezes and does not respond id like my money back honestly this rate of development isnt worth the asking price this game has been abandoned dont be fooled by the store page 

oh and one last thing the sound effects for resource gathering is absolutely horrid i can stomach the idea of having a multitool laser to harvest things but im not playing some tap and wait mobile game you dont need to drop little icons all around me and make it sound like im picking up a bunch of coins that gets old after the first 10 minutes and there isnt even an option to control effects volume add a mute option to your multitool or do some actual development on this product 

for all the other early access sandbox survival games out there on steam alone this one gets a 210 and im being generous

#####

abandoned product should be removed from steam

#####

sadly this game is super dead had so much going for it but devs or dev have done nothing more than little twiks for a really long time now have not seen more than 22 people playing this game at the same time for far to long just look at the server browser and add them up lol

#####

abandoned should not be allowed to be sold anymore

#####

dead game

#####

game has been abandonded no updates in years dont waste your money

#####

honestly i wouldnt buy this game yet its too buggy and has a lot server lagg on official servers you can host your own dedicated servers updates at the bottom of the review

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkizeugzvvaa

but if the developers fix the bugs and lagg i think this would be a great game thats why i recommended this

good things
 beautiful graphics in my opinion
 multiplayer felt really good
 runs in my gtx660 over 60fps with max settings
 you can mine and build i like stuff like that

bad things
 obviously lagg
 bugs bugs and bugs
 i think there should be more npcs and things to build

this review was made in early access so things might have changed

updates

january 9th 2015 a lot bugs has been fixed and game has been balanced

#####

wish it was not abondoned

grav is a crafting survival sandbox with some action elements you begin your adventure on a planet inhabited mostly by bugs and slimes after slaughtering some of the local wildlife and extorting the ecosystem for resources your inventory will begin to fill with the three main components used for crafting wood fossils and ore there are also gems but these are used far less in recipes once youve crafted some armor and some weapons the next step is to set up a base it might start as a tiny hovel but once the sandbox experience takes hold youll find yourself scouring the planet for more components to complete your fortress once youve got your castle together what could possibly be left another planet of course there are many alien worlds to be conquered as long as youve killed enough monsters to find a blueprint for a spaceship once you find the blueprint you will find yourself grinding for the raw materials there are tons of crafting blueprints from landmines to automated turrets grav has so much potential but there are some key elements that will require an overhaul before a full release what are they lets find out as we take a deeper look at grav 

the first thing you will likely notice are the striking graphics everything in the world is wonderfully rendered and sticks to a pretty cool looking neoscifi aesthetic this is completed by a soundtrack that displays some fine synthesizer usage as one would expect to hear anywhere in space though on occasion the sound will drop out completely leaving you listening to plants rustling as you walk i think having a soundtrack is fine so is not having one but a clearcut choice should be made if this is only because its early access then please disregard the dancingwavingpointing in the game is quite silly and adds to the laidback nature of the game players seem more focused on base building and resource gathering than on murdering each other which is a nice change of pace for these types of games the reason for this might be that the world consensus to being nice to strangers on the internet has completely changed but the more likely reason is that combat in grav is currently pretty unsatisfying pvp matches take upwards of 10 minutes with both players doing nothing but leftclicking monsters have a slightly more varied attack pattern but still telegraph their two or three moves pretty early you will be killing a lot of monsters to level up the grind is felt pretty hard due to the linear nature of combat hopefully with the full release combat will be improved and questsobjectives added since they will be essential components in breaking up the grind

grouping and descending into a dungeon is also a decent option for breaking up the monotony though grouping is most often used for chatting and sharing buildings the grouping system is not fully implemented and a member can currently only be invited via the console luckily dungeons dont require a group if youve got the chops you can brave the dungeon alone and reap the sweet rewards boss creatures arent just found in dungeons either they have tons of health but their attack pattern doesnt differ from smaller versions of their species there are a variety of boosts you can craft health stimpaks invisibility stimpaks and even a stimpak to increase your speed you will use them often as you traverse the landscape and eventually space in search of resources there is a nice daynight cycle to keep you on your toes and let you know when you should head back to base night is a very dangerous time but you can buy droids to assist you some provide light others will provide attack or defense bonuses they are all bought with a secondary currency called element x which can be mined from glowing spots on the ground by building a harvester currently the game is based on element x build a giant base near some extraction points build some harvesters and lock them down then about 30 or 40 hours later when your base is massive and your level is maxed you can head out and destroy the techpalace of some other maxed level players thats the mmo formula and while building a giant castle is enticing enough i do have a couple bones to pick

before i unleash criticism id like to say that once grav fully develops i believe it will be something amazing to play currently it has some serious flaws that need to be addressed before id put 30 hours into a game in order to reap the full reward combat simply doesnt feel that fun or dynamic and needs a ton of work weapons dont really seem to scale as much as levels while incoming damage certainly does one would think an assault rifle would be a decent remedy but ranged damage is pitiful on top of the low damage they actually use ammo building my first pistol was a major letdown the generator runs on wood and eats quite a lot about 2000day so if you get a base worth defending most of your social life will consist of cutting trees with a laser world events are a great idea but poorly implemented monsters spawn 2 levels above the highest player in a zone so a level 30 can hang out in a lowlevel zone and really cause some havoc base building is the only real incentive ive found at the moment even during the build you will need to head out for resources which can be hard to find  while youre out and about youll inevitably find some combat enemy ai needs a lot of help i cant count the mobs that simply stood there and took their beating its either that or they walk through a tree for a cheapshot overall i think grav has all the makings of something great but well probably need to wait for a few more updates to truly find out

summary futuristic multiworld sandbox set around basebuilding and domination of the landscape

final score 610 for aesthetic community and blueprint variety

video review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzfysj4arpj0

#####

why is this abomination still being sold

#####

loved this game would have recommended it at the time  sadly its been abandoned for many years now

#####

so i went as far to check to make sure the game was dead no officals left only some community and almost no players the devs went silent over a year ago their facebook and twitter is dead they have ignored everyone everywhere

the game concept was great i bought a 4 pack on sale ages ago for my buddies we had a lot of fun serious issues with greifers tho but that isnt very uncommon only issue was a few toxic players going around making it so no one could ever play on servers just like ark but ark has a much larger player base with much more to do grav you couldnt run to far from someone who wanted you to stop playing

leveling system was different from most survival games at the time  upgrading buildings too was cool lots of great mechanics in this game why the devs did what they did is unbelieveable gravereborn was after they pretty much abandonded it the first time hell sooo many people came back just to try it out again just to have the same thing happen with the dev team

if your company has issues all your community wants is for you to say it just tell us you went bankrupt or there was no way you could complete the game the silence in ea game is killer but i think these companies have to be silent or else they may face monitary reprocessions i would assume most of these developers llcd themselves where the funds for this game where going if they did not then their presonal assets could be forfiet should litigation ever be brought agaisnt them but this requires a precedent to be set in the industry hopefully steam does something about games like this

do not remove this game make it free it is not fair to the few players doing community servers to remove them if it is free maybe people will come back steam could take the source code and give it to people who give a damn

#####

a better and cheaper no mans sky

#####

artistically this game is fantastic the graphics are one im going to remember but the game is very grindy it feels as though it is pulling in several directions without making up its mind yet i went into this game started playing and thought this so much less grindy than the reviews said as i kept on playing through the game there are no hazards besides creatures unless you count oxygen as one there is not really a challenging aspect to the game all you do is grind to level up it seemed very promising when i made a gate to go to a small planet but as i explored the new terrain i saw the same types of creatures repeating there are no new creatures whatsoever this game has great promise i know how survival games have constant resource collection but this is constant monster hitting for xp or crushed star dust vital resource to make a gate or level up all new planets except the moon is the same thing same monsters sometimes without even coloring them different i would say i had a fun time but it just got way too grindy  personally i would buy it and let it sit in my library and develop but in its current state i would buy it only to support the developers

edit in 2020 seems this game was abandoned based on the comments and very negative recent reviews i am hardly surprised considering that the game was plagued by multiplayer griefer issues i would have probably abandoned this game too because even if they fixed everything it would likely not age well compared to newer games

#####

couldve been nice it was no man sky before no man sky potential wise another buyer said something and ill say it too  release the source so the community can finish the game

acslater2001

yeah liked the game before it became an abandon ware

#####

do not buy it this has been completely abandoned by developers and left with an unfinish uninteresting game

#####

was a good game once but devs took the money and ran

#####

abandonware

#####

was a good game still enjoy it from time to time
needs a revive

#####

the dev abandoned this game in an unacceptable state and i will follow that example and leave this review as a negative

#####

more steam ea abandonwaresomehow still for saledont buy this

#####

grav graphics look good music is nice and sounds are pretty good i play it with some friends cause i would get bored easy in the game but it is a fun game to run around in and explore the worlds it needs a lot of updates  and maybe a story to go with it i do recommend grav as long as you got some friends to play with you now down to business grav is a 7 out of 10

#####

appears to be dead no updatescommunication from developers in 7 months as of jan 2018

#####

dead game valve need to get this out of store

#####

lasted 2 years  last update in 2017

#####

since this game is still on sale i would consider it theft of your money due to the fact that this game has ben abandoned since july 2017

you can buy this but you cant play it

#####

this is a fine example of thieves who make a incomplete game then take you money and run the game is buggyunfinished and  online only garbage steer clear

#####

grav had some decent core concepts and action the survival experience was different enough to set it apart from all the other copy cats in the market with enough fun factor to keep playing it for hours and hours im sorry to say the game has been abandoned and theres probably no hope for it in the future 

the developers and publisher have abandoned the game with zero input to their community that kept them active for so long a big f you to all of us 

do not buy it is abonded and is not finished

#####

early access limbo hell dont buy

#####

the game has been released in early access 4 years ago its latest update being over 2 years ago it costs 20 usd make of that what you will

#####

game hasnt been updated since like 2017 wild

#####

dead game do not buy do not support

#####

was fun when it was getting updates abandoned game should be free

#####

i love how steam lets game like this continue be sold

#####

dont buy the game its dead

#####

first of all i bought this game on sale thinking i could get a bargain like others may have as well i was not disappointed at all i would have paid full price for this game had i known beforehand what i was getting into

grav isnt your runofthemill survival games you have a few different things going on in here that make this game unique from others you have to first learn the basics of the game through the tutorial guide that gives you some information or ask players of the various multiplayer community for help afterwhich you have a sandbox openword to explore  research  conquer and through your personal trials in grav you may or may not make it to the top 

you have a choice of 6 more jobs to choose from after you research them after you attain lvl 10 astronanut beginner job for which you can then branch off and do your exploratory own thing and see how the game is really going from crafting gear and weapons to base building  base raiding pvp on some servers rotational planetary systems and mroe to be seen

a few things to remember when playing grav dont snack in real life while flying with limited wood if you hear graks suck you will understand sometime soon yourself 

so feel free to come join the fun and i am here if you have further questions feel free to ask

have a great grav day

#####

from the description of the game right now as of 2022 we here at bitmonster has been working on grav for about 5 months and feel that getting the community involved earlier is vital to a great game 

was this 5 months across the past 78 years or was this 5 months after it appeared on steam in 2015 either way same result you can tell this was a cashgrab by the way they couldnt be bothered to even update the description

#####

still very sad that it died

#####

having just taken a momentary break for a few days from empyrion galactic survival to give a few other games a chance since that one was eating up all my time i saw grav and figured id give it a go expecting to potentially have my life sucked away by it too by the sweet lull of constant upgrade progress that empyrion and subnautica taught me to love prior to those games the genre hadnt really appealed to me but now im open to giving these games a chance grav however did not delight me

gravs music is pleasant and its levelupitem collection sound effects are definitely designed to have that casino payout sensation of making a human feel happy to have accomplished something very trivial it works even if i know its doing it it just feels good however the actual gameplay amounts entirely to grinding killing wandering mobs of enemies in empyrion killing naturally occurring enemies is done to avoid taking damage and to obtain meat for better food sources in subnautica killing is rare for the player to do and has little benefit its the main objective in grav i love me some killin but this is outright grindy i do less grinding in jrpgs and mmos ive played

its so grindy and so focused on constantly killing enemies that you will run around in the world and each area will pop up with a recommended player level and the enemies are wandering around with their names and level above them when you kill a few more start to spawn in sometimes a few feet ahead of you in plain sight just like in an mmo if that kind of thing is what gets you going and you always wanted a survival game that plays like a wowstyled mmo then grav is for you if you want something more about exploration and building sweet new tech while avoiding or killing enemies when necessary but not constantly then go for empyrion galactic survival or subnautica

#####

i like this

shame about it being abandoned

#####

after playing this game for a few hours i can honestly say though it is interesting its pretty linear one thing i dislike about games like this is that they dont really bring anything new to the table the whole concept to these games is basically as follows

spawn
level up
farm resources
build a base
make a clan
build up your base and clan
farm more resources
create op items so you can pvp other players and basically rule the game

what this game does do differently however is the very unique vehicles and different dungeons you can raid either solo or with others base building currently is actually really extensive so if that is your thing im sure you will enjoy this one

a few things to note however this game doesnt really have very many graphical tweak options at least i couldnt find them anywhere so youre pretty much not able to lower the quality by a lot if you have a lower quality pc

also when you look at this game graphically and the behaviour of different charactersnpcs and sound effects you kind of get a silly vibe from it as a whole me myself im not too drawn to silly style games games like villagers and heroes or aura kingdom and stuff like that theyre a little too pg 12 for me but hey thats just my opinion 

all in all though i am not recommending this game purely because it isnt my type of game i am not purely saying that its bad it is very unique and you should definitely give it a shot if youre into this type of category



#####

for a early access game i am very suprised at how well this game runs and how well its done so farafter 20hrs i havent run in to any bugs glitches or had a crash yeti am shocked at this for a ea game  there is a lot to do in this game it feels like a phantasy star oinline  monster hunter rust  with out the sucky parts and mmorpg all slammed in to one game i have only played the single player because these types of games its either that or coop with friends only and the coop isnt done yet

after 20hrs i find my self very hooked in to this game its very easy to learn the crafting is deep and yet does not feel all that complicated and was pretty easy to learn how to put it all together there are a good amount of enemies and differnt planets to explore lots of cool stuff like building a base jet packs vehicles and tons of other neat things to slap togetherthe only thing this game really needs to be a complete game is quests boss fights raids online privite coop and id also like to see more wepon types like explosive wepons sniper rifles  ect  also a ability to upgrade your ammo amount on your charicter

otherwise this is the best ea game i have played  devs seem to be doinga great job with this game so far

#####

deeeeeeeeeead oddly enough theyll still take your money seem to be pimping those 4 packs plus the monocycles remind me of the ones from south park stay away far far away

#####

dont buy it no one plays it anymore devs have abandoned it long ago this game should be removed from steam tbh

#####

the game appears to have been abandoned only buy if youre sure you really want to play it andor have some friends to vouch for it


this review acted as a giveaway for 3 copies of the game which have since been claimed if youd like to acquire the game for free perhaps ask around the community forums for anyone who might have a copy to give away like i did

#####

dont buy unfinished game that will never be released

#####

game is abandoned and unfinished dont buy

#####

here is a quick first moments video showcasing my first 7 min moments or so in this game on early access launch day  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv1rlkj8kbkt0featureyoutube

33 minute 1080p hd first exploration of grav httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvndlhr0uhiyw

55 minute 1080p hd exploration of grav #2 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdvwu5qoaw88

okay this is still not even close to what i plan on being my final review of this early access alpha but now with over 4 hours of game time i can at least give you something worth biting on

this is a huge amazing and beautiful world that is procedurally generated and perhaps the most amazing procedurally generated world ive ever played in  this is impressive stuff and is a great addition to the unreal engine library of games

combat is frantic frenzied and furious fun as you move in and out and left click your attacks trying to best time them against the mob or enemy players own attacks  quite simply the combat is very fun and a nice way to keep you invovled as you fight for your life  while there isnt any kinda of special attacks or rolls to dodge and that kind of stuff at this early point it is still very fluid responsive and engaging

exploring the different biomes of this gigantic world full of vibrant colors is perfectly speckled with just enough dungeons and caverns to adventure into  inside these tunnels sounds echo through the natural looking rooms of rock and water drips from the top  some great rewards are found inside as well as a much greater risk in the form of more dangerous monsters  ore gems better loot and the valuable element x resource are some of the rewards found within these glowing entrances

this is a very friendly development team who are showing more then a healthy determination to make this the best and most fun game they can and they prove it with a patch to fix numerous bugs in less then 24 hours after its initial early access launch  that is very impressive to see  add in fun well thought out game design and you can see these guys care about what they give us  just an example of great and fun game mechanics is their idea to have you dance at a campfire to gain health and the team work bonus of mutual faster heals by adding more fellow players dancing at any camp fire  this idea works brilliantly and makes the game with online strangers much more cohesive fun then other survival games out there

crafting requires exploration and killing the bad guys that roam the dark places and nights of its virtual sandbox if you want to craft more then just the bare basic stuff that is  resource gathering seems less boring and less grindy because of the dangers present all around you  monsters fight each other in unpredictable fashion and will even attack npcs walking through the world  its never going to the same experience twice when you log into grav and i look forward to seeing where this game goes  the sky is the limit for this amazing and brilliantly assembled online survival game  its very different then anything out there now while offering enough familiar game mechanics to keep us feeling comfortable with the game controls  

all in all this new online world cries to us to explore it to live in it and to take in its spendor and beauty  its bugs and lag is there but minor and a small dent in an otherwise beautiful new online realm  

until i get more game time i want to play more so im giving it a definite thumbs up at this point  please ignore all the negative reviews complaining about this early access game not being complete or having bugs  thats to be expected in early access period

#####

its like no mans sky but way cheaper and way more fun

#####

dont buy this game it has been in early access for more than 4 years
last update was on july 17th 2017 it has since then been abandoned and should be taken off the store
when it was still being developed 20152017 it was a blast hence the 20 hrs ingame

#####

its a beautiful and very dead game even when the official servers were up when i last played there were maybe 8 people online per day in total on all servers combined in 2016

do not purchase it  you have been warned

#####

there is loads of bugs some game breaking not to mention the occasional server wipe but the game is in early access this i think is something many players forget yes the developers have been a little lax on communication at times and yes there are loads of improvements that need to be made but grav is freakin awesome the community is small but generally very friendly and happy to help there is a bit of grind to the game but the environments and general quirk of the game makes it enjoyable rather than tiresome try it out if its not for you then just get a refund simples

#####

abandoned game  dont waste your money servers are no longer operational steam really shouldnt really be allowing games like this to be sold any longer

#####

here is why im recommending this a thumbs down after a few hours of playing on a pve survival server i setup a base come back within 10 minutes and find it to be griefed i attempt to setup another one and it makes it through the an real world night the next morning i attempt to raid some caves i had a level 7 follow me into a 1012 cave no big deal right ill help the guy out i died and loots my shit and runs out i cant do anything because its pve my point is whats the point for pve if it has the same rules of pvp minues killing other players fix your game and actually make it pve

game is dead and abadonware avoid

#####

sometimes i forget about grav then i scroll through my library and see last played june 6 2016 and 414 hrs 

that about sums it up its playable and there was enough content for me and a few friends to play for a few weekends made some cool bases gathered resources killed a bunch of things

it was promising 5 years ago but sadly it is abandoned and content dries up after a few dozen hours mostly grinding

at most you could say its worth 510 bucks i mean they didnt even have the decency to remove early access game and just call it finished with a reduced price good game to avoid and a prime example of abandonware on steam

#####

cant refund dont buy abandoned game

#####

abandoned by the devs in early accessshame

#####

grav is fun and could be a great game its not worth its price because bitmonster inc abandoned this game in early access if you buy grav just know it wont get updates or a full release bitmonsters twitter has been inactive for years and their website link is even broken maybe one day well get a surprise update who knows

#####

abandoned game

#####

has been abandoned steer clear

#####

first off this is a gorgeous game of which i have enjoyed every minute spent on it it is at flawed space in its timeline like so many prerelease games but i have been playing it for nearly its entire arc here on steam and it has come a long way

i do want to note that if you have even a moderately old or underpowered machine at this point in development you will see a lot of lag my previous machine was a 3ghz quad core with plenty of ram and a 970gtx and grav would stutter like a nervous crying child new generation i7 ssd and a gtx1070 strix buttery goodness with naught a missed frame in over a solid day of gaming

i have come to the realization that while the mechanics for better things are in place many of the elements of this game are hollow at the moment waiting to be filled in with better content too many repeated creatures a dungeon system that feels like hack 10 with some normal maps draped on the walls and a very linear tech progression system

again an asyet unfinished game what one would expect from early access

but there is inspiration here and just the smallest tweaks in various areas would elevate it higher there is a definite sense of accomplishment when you progress along the tech line the monocycle instantly expands your reach in the homeworld the glider makes it more interesting to scale the heights of the landscape the jetpack lets you reach what before just looked like pretty environment decorations often with prizes letting you know the devs wanted you to get here all along 

there has been a definite attention to balancing what you get when as some of the later game content has been made accessible much earlier like the buggy and all that may change again and again before we get to the end deal

my primary complaints lie in a lack of content that the game seems to be leaning toward but just isnt in place yet a void with haphazzard placeholder the many clones of wei wei the weary wanderer speak indicate some idea at a narrative to keep driving you forward but no actual semblance of it except a tutorial goal window exist at this time we dont know why our character is where they are we just are the only goal you have from the outset is basically dont die and dont starve only the basics of a openworld survival game are yet here

at this point i can recommend this game if you enjoy the aspects of resource gathering base building which comes with its own odd frustrations at this stage of implementation and watching your character grow as you ford through the various available class options

#####

game is dead if you like games that are unfinished and dont get any updates this is for you

#####
