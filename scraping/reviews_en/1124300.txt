conceptually the game is really refreshing and interestingeach era provides an opportunity to further develop a premeditated longterm strategy or dynamically adapt to the games situation in theory this should lead to matches feeling unpredictably distinct from one another and therefore prevent the game from getting stale as your experience knowledge and skill level increases from playing it in practice however the cultures are too poorly balanced and consequentially not distinct enough for many of these adaptive strategies to occur as they are seemingly intended 

for example you may pick the assyrians as your first cultural selection intending to harass and plunder your neighbors territories with your military stealing gold and territory to further your own expansionist agenda in the process this seems to be the clear design goal of the assyrians but they do not excel at it when compared to other cultures with entirely different design goals 

the harappans for example are clearly intended to be a culture which focuses on empire growth and development traditionally 4x players might call the harappans design that of a passive tall faction and the assyrians design that of a militaristic wide faction 

the harappans definitely beat the assyrians at growth as they ought to but building and incorporating new outposts requires influence and because influence is generated per population the harappans are often better at claiming unsettled territories than the assyrians additionally military units cost population and either production or gold all of which the harappans should quickly outproduce the assyrians in thanks to their ability to work so many population slots at once so when the assyrians produce their superior unit to gain early dominance they are crippling the early development of their first city by costing it population and vital early production or gold to secure territories they dont yet possess the influence to claim meanwhile the harappans growth advantage allows them to outpace the assyrians in every important aspect of their design goal past the first handful of turns making the assyrians focus irrelevant 

all of the eras culture pools contain these kinds of illusionary choices where some of the cultures gameplay orientations are more of an aesthetic choice than a strategic one unless you are the kind of player who enjoys playing at a clear disadvantage for the sake of style this results in the player feeling like only a minority of the faction choices are viable choices additionally some of the factions excel at fulfilling their design goal so much the khmer are a particularly egregious example in this case that choosing a similarly aligned culture in following eras becomes redundant

these factors all result in the selection of your culture having the opposite effect to the intent deciding what faction to play quickly becomes stale if youve selected the egyptians as your first culturea culture which is very proficient at generating incredible amounts of productionyou are less likely to feel like you need to select another faction focused on generating production later in the game considering the already small pool of viable cultures this further shrinks your pool making consecutive playthroughs much more similar than they should be separate playthroughs will contain a variety of cultural selections but from a significantly limited pool and with a dull predictable combination of cultures representing each aspect of empire development

the games approach to war and diplomacy require either of them to be longterm commitments rather than impulsive choices which i find quite good tradable resources are represented by an undepletable number relative to your number of deposits of which access can be purchased diplomacy is streamlined through the removal of quarrelsome haggling between both by compressing everything into a number of progressive independant treaties this prevents trade from feeling unreasonable due to the uncompromising nature between both parties especially since these interactions can generate war support in either direction 

war support is the resource required to maintain and reap the rewards of a war against each of your opponents forcing you to take their actions demands and grievances more seriously though this system sometimes results in unexpected or seemingly unintuitive outcomes like not having enough war support to keep occupied territory when your opponent is forced by a lack of support to surrender i generally liked it the mechanic prevents the game from becoming a snowbally steamroll when one opponent gains a sudden advantage and keeps war from feeling frivolous and unpredictable 

the pacing of the eras is one of humankinds biggest problems early and midgame eras are understandably the most important since they establish your borders and early disputes but lategame eras are far too compressed by comparison many of the technologies are made inferior by the one directly following it like the technology for contemporary tanks directly following the technology for wwii era tanks while others are completely irrelevant because they do not progress you towards the easytoexecute scientific win condition enough to justify their rewards 

these problems are magnified by the players tendency to grow exponentially in nearly all possible categories during these eras with science easily being the worst offender this is primarily because of poor balancing on the features added by the later eras technologies which are able to propel even the poorest civilization to the moon if they have access to the right stuff or in the case of science poor balancing of cultures traits you can only get access to later in the game in extreme cases it is possible to spend only a couple of turns in some of these eras especially when trying to achieve a scientific victory

the lategame eras are also the stage when the ai usually starts falling behind and the game starts to feel like youre kicking a can down the road in my playthroughs it was normal for my neighbors to still have horsemen and swordsmen when i had the ability to produce tanks and planes even when the scores were somewhat close this is so much the case that i would usually abandon having a military at this stage since the units any potential attacker would siege with were unable to beat my citys free garrison and implacements and going for a military victory almost always seemed too timeconsuming compared to a scientific one  

in my first 30 hours or so when i was still learning how to play this game i was visibly excited to try and master all the fresh concepts and ideas this game brought to the genre once i had a good grasp of them though i quickly understood how unrealized this games potential is in its current state that excitement hasnt left but its been tempered by disappointment 

i dont think humankind is a bad game i think its simply an unfinished one i think humankind will become an excellent game once the cultures have been rebalanced the ai enhanced and the technology tree more wellrounded as well as some smaller things if youre itching for a new 4x game humankind will definitely keep you entertained while you master the new mechanics it introduces but expect its replayability to be low when compared to other 4x games until these problems are addressed

#####

i really really wanted to like humankind specifically because it promised to be a breath of fresh air in the everdulling scene of 4xciv games

it started out with a pretty ambitious vision by the makers of the whole endless franchise lots of dev diaries detailed vision concepts and of course the first open dev program that has nowadays been adapted by quite a few other game titles during their developement

the game did and does a lot of things right when it comes to fixing the classic pitfalls of civilization games you do not play as one particular nation that assuredly didnt even exist for the full 10k of human history but an amalgam of indiivdual cultures that move through the ages you do not get one unit and a building for one specific age and then end up being the exact same civ as anybody else for any timeframe outside of that age but you pick a specialization and a playstyle focus per age being able to shift and adapt to whatever your current situation requires you do not just race down one techcivicmilitary tree to reach one of multiple goals the fastest but you strive to maximize score gain by fulfilling smaller scale goals that may even require you to pace your technological progress

buuuut the game also runs into the same pitfalls as other civlike titles the game is very overtly built around the early game which is obviously played and tested the most but then someone loses track towards modern times with tanks just being stronger cavalry units airforce being an afterthought nuclear deterrent and modern political problems being nonexistant
the ai as usual cant remotely keep up with the player and has to use massive cheats to not become immedeately redundant past turn 50 and even then barely evolves beyond being a sitting target
the games performance stutters and struggles as cities grow more and more and all the numbers inflate to usually nonsensical levels of production science or gold and in the end it doesnt matter how you got there or what you actually are because the endgame tends to look the same anyways

the game would still be a valid alternative to civilization 5 but

i have to subtract a significant chunk of review point for the games trajectory humankind started a buggy halffinished mess in open dev thats fine early access  beta and all that upon release it was barebones but playable then the next patch added religion fleshed out civics and added qol all good
its the most recent expansion when things for me started to turn sour i was part of the open dev for the expansion and the insights were sobering the expansions theme was diplomacy which okay wasnt going to fix anything about the lategame and added the obligatory espionage system in the obligatory undercooked fashion but it also made so many dumb mistakes like adding midgame exploration menial tasks in regards to players micromanaging diplomatic scouts to pick up diplomatic goodie huts for some reason it took weeks to even get a basic autodiplomatic explore button after countless testers complained how the new system was a lot of manual pathing for nothing but then that autoexplore was utterly incompetent would run your noncombat diplomats units into foreign territory or just break when a diplomatic goodie was inaccessible
the usage of the new diplomatic currency was clunky and often not even worth it there was this grand idea of paying another civ with an expensive treaty in order to be able to build their emblematic units in exchange for giving them a token payment that wouldnt scale with age and thus be absurdly irrelevant in anything but early eras
there was one particular instant of a culture from the expansion having an emblematic unit with a special effect that was both abyssimal and counterintuitive to that cultures diplomatic approach so when petitioned to change it with countless alternative suggestions for the units special ability by the testers the response of the devs was to just double the obscure useless bonus to fix the problem

needless to say overall the expansion was so much of a letdown even in the final stages of open dev i simply did not buy it upon its release alltogether

now after a couple more months and minor updates i revisited the game and
its straight up worse off than before the expansion the ai on higher difficulties now deliberately avoids entering new eras in order to maximize score and competitively challenge the player which sounds good in theory but in practice means the ai will intentionally handycap its technological progression meaning now the players will be ages more advanced even without ever picking up a scientific civ and in the end going for an extra star or two doesnt justify being overrun by your neighbour whos units completely outclass yours
then theres the new nonexpansion thus free cultures that add even more quadratically scaling modifiers that break the games balance in hilarious but not exactly balancefurthering ways all it took was one culture to swap me from the least populated to the most populated civilization in less than 10 turns theres such a thing as overkill
additionally ive noticed that a lot of menus and features have been reworked not necessarily to the better you no longer can see on a glance how your research is going because for some reason despite plentyvoiced concerns about it in the opendev the research menu was moved from a helpfully informative circle in the bottom to a small featureless button at the top and features like managing wonder production allocation by clicking the wonder and assigning cities with a few clicks was removed in favor of having yet another city production overview whichs tooltip claims you can assign them to the wonder here but doesnt actually provide that option not sure whether this is just another instance of horrible ux design a feature now locked behind the expansion or an oversight

so by all perspectives i can apply the game has legitimately become worse
and i dont quite see that trend reversing since a lot of focus seem to have been thrown at providing community challenges and exciting scenarios instead of actually fixing the problems of the actual game

overall ill give humankind a 510 and place it into the interesting concept mediocre execution and woeful postrelease developement box

#####

as someone who played a whole heck of a lot of civ both sp and toplevel competitive mp id like to offer up on humankind
humankind is a really good game its not a great game  yet  but it could be it has some pretty significant balance issues that need resolving before that some strategies are embarrassingly more potent than others and some nations are absolutely a joke compared to others

but thats to be expected from a first generation game this isnt civ 6 which is basically iterating on the same formula circa late civ 3civ 4 

humankind does some very bold things that civ  inertia of time and tradition  would never have the guts to do you change tribal identities every era humankind solves the sodbottleneck problem with a genuinely clever combat system that actually allows over time reinforcement humankind also solves the why would i stop beating your face in problem rather nicely and even solves civs perennial endless sprawl issue rather elegantly go wide or go high is a legitimate choice  and even more cleverly you can reverse course later if you change your mind 

having said that humankind is not yet in a position to say we canwill unseat civ for all time humankind still struggles with the i already know i won the game and i still have to play it out problem  much more so than civ does it has a fair number of bugs a few of them genuinely gameplay disrupting temporary no doubt but some genuinely rough humankinds lack of diplomacy win is curious their victory model will please some and infuriate others looking at you apolyton sp gurus who steal deitylevel wins at the last second 

all in all id encourage anyall 4x players to encourage this dev and buy this game it might  or might not  be the game to unseat civ what it will do most certainly is light a fire under firaxiss hindquarters to do more than just a lazy iteration for the next civ id argue c5 and c6 are exactly this

long story short humankind might or might not be a win for firaxiss competition but its definitely a win for players give it a go

#####

you know that meme with the sketch of the horse that starts out realistic on the left but transitions to a childs drawing on the right thats the progression of a game of humankind

the beginning of the game is great lots of new ideas explorations meaningful choices but then it starts to get a little stagnant but youre still intrigued and are interested in what might happen but then its just bad and youre shaking your head at the dumbness of it all

i really think this game isnt finished the last few eras have too many useless techs clumsy balancing and bad pacing the events are pure filler and offer no meaningful decisions an example the global warming event every civish game has got to have this right so in humankind you get a text box that says some scientists say something bad might happen and you get to choose between paying a little money really a negligible sum by that time in the game to do the right thing or collecting a tiny bribe from the oil companies to ignore it with the threat that this might have future consequences and thats it were done there is no meaningful choice to be made its just a banal public service announcement games are about making choices

many of the systems in the game are interesting but dont work well

war support you have little control over how a war ends one game i just needed to make an enemy a vassal and i would win the game but because i occupied so much territory at the end of the war and had made claims to certain cities i was forced to take those cities in the settlement and didnt have enough points left to force capitulation and when i attacked again the war was over too quick to earn the points i needed in another game i tried to play aggressively from the start i rushed an opponent in the classical age and forced him back to his first city but then suddenly the game decided that i had lost the war because it was waged without a valid reason i had been bleeding war support for many turns because of my naughtiness and now i had none left my territorial gains were handed back by i dunno the un 

civics you can pay an increasing amount of influence to buy little perks to help define your civilization neat idea but the perks are mostly useless and influence is more important than money for most of the game so after your first game you will barely use this system

faith i tried to find somewhere that faith was tracked in the ui but failed a few wonders mention it but i dont know what it does religion is advanced by the number of followers which is afaik the same thing as your civilizations population and the religion perks are mostly useless and you cant avoid getting them the religion is really really bare bones no flavour no choices it would be a better game without it

sphere of influence i could not figure out how this worked there was a map filter that would show how different territories were under the sway of the different powers with percentages but i couldnt figure out how they were calculated and then they would change and i didnt know why sometimes if a neighboring city fell under your sway you would get the opportunity to demand it from your opponent and sometimes they would give it to you this would lead to bizarre cultural osmosis events where that new city would receive free bonuses of tech points each turn and not a trivial amount either often more than a quarter of all my other cities combined i do not understand what they were trying to simulate with this feature or how it worked

theres more but ill leave it there the thing is the game is fun at the beginning its beautiful and fluid and has that something that makes you want to keep playing even now im thinking of trying some different options and seeing what happens but ive played four full games now and i know what happens it becomes tedious and stupid

this game might become great but its not there yet keep working on it guys

#####

i got humankind in early access played 110 hours in the betas very impressed high high hopes for this game  confidently expected it to be a real breath of fresh air in the genre
 
i played 30 or 40 hours on full release terribly disappointed with its incomplete state at that stage well i thought civ often gets off to a slow start unfair to judge humankind yet

so i didnt review it and waited for the dust to settle after a year i decided it was time to give it another try

now it is true that a lot of the more glaring issues with the game have been resolved or mitigated or can simply be switched off at the players option i played with pollution switched off because thats such a souldestroying mechanic otherwise vanilla

so whats the final verdict well i have 70 hours in the game now  ironically thats 40 less than the betas  and thats enough for me

the sad truth is that humankind just isnt very good it has so many moving parts that they get in each others way often with completely counterintuitive results
  annex a farming region to a city for instance and suddenly you are short 100 food per turn 
  when you are in the lead by around 8000 points suddenly an ai decides to suicide by racing through 3 eras with minimal stars just to snipe you out of your preferred civ 
  i thought i was taking a risk in the last era  picking influence with under 3k influence per turn but i neednt have worried because it so happens that when you use the special influence ability just pressing a button gives you 120000 influence for 240 gold 

sometimes a game mechanic becomes utterly counterproductive  whats worse is that its easy to understand why while at the same time finding the devs choices intensely annoying railways for example the devs want to create pollution and discontent so they require stations in every single territory between your cities  amazingly its the same with aircraft you have to have a vast network of airbases to move your planes from city to city so either your cities have to make their own troops until well into the last era or you have to take a big hit to discontent a simple question  how is that fun

and my main competitor the suicide guy interesting story by the end of the game hed developed every single hex in his core territories since he went gold for the whole game his other stats were pretty rubbish so i ask how did he do that well over the whole game he made around 200300000 more gold than me  of which around 180000 in the last 20 turns that translates into over 600 hexes in development colour me suspicious
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2865808047

no doubt somewhere in the games labyrinthine rules all this is explained but to get far enough into humankind to work out why would require a substantial sustained effort which would in turn require the game to be interesting and absorbing in the first place and it just isnt

often when i finish a game of say endless legend im tempted to start over at once so i have over 300 hours in that game to date with humankind it was the opposite i felt much the same as bart simpson did when playing lee carvallos putting challenge httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcaptpivf8n0

friendly ai give us your capital city

me uh no thanks thats alright 

ai haha no seriously give it to us

meno

war

narrator three hours later

ai ok ok we give up sheesh

me im going to take this territory of yours bordering my capital so youll stop bugging out about me being on your border youre lucky i dont just wipe you out 

ai fine fine its a deal

me alright glad were over this

ai actually give us that territory back 

me are you kidding you literally just agreed to give it to me why would i give it back to y

war

narrator one turn later

me wait i have to surrender to you wtf you didnt even do anything i didnt even do anything how does that work 

ai well you see because we demanded something and you refused we got to have warring resources and you didnt because reasons so we automatically won this new war now we know what youre thinking whats the point of going through all the trouble of winning a long hard fought war with units and tactics and battling and stuff when we can just come right back and instantly win a war on a technicality based around an abstraction for conflict management that must seem like a giant waste of your time and effort right thats because it is

me oh

ai yeah hey give us your capital city

#####

i suspected i was going to give this game a recommend pretty early on in my time with it but i wanted to actually finish a campaign for a broader take on it now that ive done so

iblets start with what i found to be pain points since the largest offender was in the ending portion of the game and as i just finished my campaign thats whats on my mindbi

pollution  i just dont really see what has been added with this mechanic full stop it just feels really separate from everything else going on  when you first encounter it your main way to fight it is a mere stopgap planting trees this takes up a build spot in the citys queue and in many cases the build time for the forest is longer than the cleansing effect it has on pollution 2 turns the scaling for its severity makes absolutely no sense either even just going from very low to low makes for a really strange jump in severity on both the local and global levels the entire mechanic needs some iterating attach some fame to the more overt actions of combating it or for being the greenest empire perhaps maybe have the narrator announce its presence if its going to be a whole new mechanic at the end of the game or if you cant get him back in the studio a pop up at least as it stands its just a little number thrown on top of the competitor emblems late game and if you miss it youd be totally forgiven for doing so or dont quite know what to do with it beyond plant trees welp good luck also yes in my game i did figure out how to manage it and kept it no higher than low but that doesnt forgive throwing an entire mechanic 23s of the way into the game with little explanation beyond a few gas mask icons dotted about anyway enough about pollution

religion  its flat it generates grievances for war thats about it really theres no fame attached to it and no fame attached to a wonder that just so happens to give faith doesnt count nearly all kinds of wonders gave fame anyway so right away its not part of the victory system going further though even if we consider that religion only being good for war serves its purpose within the game well even that argument gets thrown away at the end of the religious civics the irreligion civic takes all of religion and gives you two choices on the one hand secularism it throws the entire mechanic out no exaggeration the button itself just stops relating to you entirely no more holy sites no more grievances neither for nor against all done or atheism your empires one religion is that gods dont exist and now the narrative side of the mechanic is at complete odds with the function of it your people are galvanized against outside faiths fair enough you can still push faith claims  and in fact faith is boosted 

pace  the game was very much balanced around the normal 300 turn speed thats not a problem on its own they have to use something as the barometer for what is in fact balance i just feel like all of the games math really falls apart when you try to go faster or slower than that things dont adjust well at all i was playing alongside a friend they were on normal i tried endless and our experiences were vastly different ranging from how the ai was handling fame to different productivity markers not lining up in any sensible way

ibfor everything i said above though the game does feel really good to play even despite what ive laid out furthermore i believe everything i said above can be fixed with some iteration and some more looking at the math these are things that can be addressed during the postlaunch support cycle for a game amplitude studios does significant postlaunch work on their titles i have every reason to believe this stuff will get touched up

on to whats goodbi

the war support system makes sense to me its not the first time ive run into such a mechanic stellaris and here i feel its even more clear

the trade systems framework is probably the best trade framework ive ever interacted with in a 4x period the math could use a little touching up i actually think trade is a bit too strong right now too front loaded id like to see more of its wonderful effects be pushed into the wondrous effect tier of any given resource but thats details the actual act of playing with the trade system is absolutely beautiful an empire has a thing we discuss our trade level i buy a portion of it access granted nice and simple none of this only one of us can have access to any one share of a given resource or the constant spam of garbage tier trade deals of past game you now the ones 
____________
ill give you 70 gold lump sum for lifetime access to your oil 

no 

15 turns later 

ill give you 70 gold lump sum and 2 bottle caps per turn for 10 turns for lifetime access to your uranium oil silver and you give me 2000 gold lump sum in return
_____________
infuriating

in fact id extend my praise for trade to the diplomacy system as a whole with a caveat i dont think its done yet whats there now is excellent as a framework and pleasant to use building levels of permissions  as trading peers with very clear differences as you push across the table from no trade to just luxuries to all trade good stuff some other basic states open or closed borders sharing maps nonaggression i even like what currently exists for alliances i just think more can be done with it allies helping with your cities shared projects or giving gifts separate from demands which are often on threat of violence and have a way of souring relations just as example and perhaps an espionage type system down the line sharing intelligence basic intelligence intel spy corps working together completely that kind of thing

anyway the game is also gorgeous to simply look at whether its panning the landscape in search of new exploitation opportunities or zooming in to take in all of the moving parts of everyday life in your empire

music is another good one here particularly the battle music  i found myself manually attending to some battles which were forgone conclusions just to bob to the battle rhythms

the ai does a decent job on the whole on normal speed and the proper difficulty setting whatever is proper for you youll find yourself middle of the pack or lower and have to do some maneuvering to take the top spot there is some snowball to be had but thats just 4x gaming really depending on difficulty though and your own skill level though you might not crest that point until the 4th or 5th era empire difficulty i intend to try civilization difficulty next and see how that goes for me finally on the micro level during the battles the ai does a very good job of keeping terrain bonuses in mind utilizing range and opening firing lines for the units who need them it will also focus fire effectively

itaking everything ive said in this review into account i can certainly recommend this game at its current stage at the very least its one worth keeping an eye on this is the most foundationally sound 4x ive put my hands on in a while theres nothing that sticks out to me here on day 2 where i think to myself yep im definitely going to keep hating this at the end of year 2 the problems it has can and have in the past in other games be addressed there are no fundamentally broken things that just cant be reconciled and when the game is in its stride doing its best and youre invested in that one more turn mentality goodness does it sparkle even now hours fly by in humankindi i cant wait to see where this thing goes

#####

h1 simultaneous turns make you feel bullied by ai reflexes and alpha strike mechanics h1

b 1 sieges b
if you start besieging an ai city the ai immediately initiates combat and gets the alpha strike
if the ai starts besieging your city it immediately initiates the assault and gets the alpha strike

b 2 field combat b
even if you see it coming in the beginning of the next turn the game will show you useless popups to dig through while the ai initiates combat and gets the alpha strike this is especially ridiculous with hitandrun units like the hunnic horde

b 3 missing mini map b
for ui design aesthetics were more important than usefulness according to stephanie kaiser amplitude studios besides the ui being generally nonintuitive this also resulted in the decision to not include a mini map thus you even have to pan through map while the ai can simply chain its actions no matter where on the map with a mini map the player would at least have a chance to jump to their units and start moving them before the ai units arrive at their destination and initiate combat

#####

the opponent ai is always set to progress at the same speed as you

think you got the baller start with good resources and city sprawl too bad your opponents are all doing as well as you are

the more you rush the harder you try the better you are going  your opponents are all there with you

its like one of those race car games where if you manage to find yourself in first place the entire grid of ai drivers will fill your mirrors all the way to the finish line possibly passing you in the final corner

there are several different game modes and plenty of options but no ability to disable this annoying opponent balancing setting so you restart and you try again youve learned a lot and you play better but to no avail rinse and repeat pointless

#####

i definitly cant recommand this game and it makes my heart bleed
in short the game definitly has a lot of potential but thats it

i really enjoyed the game starting back with the first open devs
but the overhaul experience is filled with frustration


state of the game

 before realease open devs  
the game seemed very promising it was fun beautiful but very prototypelike

 at release 
lots of promises were unfullfiled and the game did not evolve this much since the open devs the modding tools did not exist multiplayer was unplayable due to stability issues solo was barely playable as well and some aspects of the game were just rushed patches quickly released but stopped beeing released quite early as well while major issues like multiplayer stability stayed unsolved

 today as in the today of this evaluation 
since then there have been some major updates the release of the modding tools 2 dlcs 20 and some very minor content released linked to event

dlc for the dlcs there is not much to say honestly in my opinion they are plainly bad and only serve the prupose of showing that the game is not dead yet they really dont offer much interesting playing content but they do have great visuals

updates for the updates i cannot express of disapointed i am
the greater part of those updates were focused on fixing the game but theres still so much left  some of them arent even bugs but design problem that were already mentioned before release
some basic quality of life features like summing up the benefits of 1 constructible in a city just got released 1 month ago
and most of all the mechanics and balance of the game are as they were released initially  broken uncomplete and rushed


bugs
bugwise this game is a mess
i think i havent played a single game with a major bug forcing me to reload the game multiple times
the worse comes of course with mulplayer where you can get desynchronization every turns and have game breaking bug forcing you to drop the game
i wont expand too much since its obvious uninteresting and very common today but yeah theres too much


balance  mechanics
theres so much mods did improve and its definitly balance
i especially value the vanilla improvement mod if you are looking for more enjoyable game

culture wise its simple  if youre first you pick the best if not good luck
i you win in this game youll win more passing each eras because you can pick the best culture each time

in this game you have to balance your ressources to win  industry science food money fait influence stability
err sorry i need to rephrase that you have  industry industry industry industry and industry
of course im halfjoking but the ressources in this game mainly revolve about industry because it is the core ressource allowing you to gets them all
meaning that if you get a builder culture you can do everything efficiently
if you get a scientist culture youre super efficient with science but not so great with the rest
if you get a militaristexpansionnist culture youre strong now because of the better units but useless if you dont wadge wars
and this could be interesting to be honest  if it was well balanced
because right now industry surpasses all

diplomacytradeinfluencereligionpollution features are just unfinished
some of them are oversimplified with very few means to know how to plays with them
more often than not youre just witnessing whats happening

trade trade have cryptic prices with almost no fluctuation and no means of blockade or micromanagement in any way the only way you can interact with it is either yes me allow trade you this or me want this or me pillaging everything

diplomacy diplomacy is not bad but you cant say its well done either you cannot interact with someone to give or claim something and its very lacking
trade shouldnt be limited to the merchants but should also be diplomatic with money exchanges units cities ressources

pollution the pollution feature must have been added as joke because of how rushed it is it is not interesting it just slows the game andor have oversized consequences  like oh no im polluting lots in this peticular era  everything instead of the heavypollutingindusty can work properly here now yeah no

religions imagine wanting to be the leader of a religion having great influence over entire continents being rich from taxes and having countless allies and strong foes  well go play something else here youll have eiither to invest massively on religion for small bonuses and lots of resistance from others even wars sometimes or you could follow anothers religion and gain the same bonuses yay

combats to be honest the game really shine here
combats are really fun and interesting
but again its so unbalanced  somes iascultures can have somes huge bonuses its almost gamebreaking
if a player goes all in at war from the start it can be unstoppable in laters eras due to how powerfull their units will be
and here with this system if you win youll win even more 



ais

i hate this
i think the unbalance of the game is the main cause of this

as for the difficulty you can choose between oh no i accidentally won again or wow they have 5 times my entire population in their army each turn

and the fact that you can know how the ai will react to you from the start of the game is really annoying after a few games
it would be endless space or endless legend i would get it  each race is designed differently so you cant do everything with the cravers for example but in humankind youll change culture and you want to do what is relevant at the current time
with the personas  theres just no random there are designed to play one way and only bet on that based on their static preference when playing against agamemnon or boudica for example youll have nothing but wars even if it cripple them to death and thats just frustrating



multiplayer
i havent played much against other players but ive tried in cooperation
but playing in multiplayer is possible but youll have to suffer constant reload to fix the constant desynchronizations

personas returns to vanilla constantly you cant load a game without mixing all ias
there is not a game without a major bug youll have to reload constantly

and oh let me guess in multiplayer you would hope for grand battles with many nations fighting each others 
well nahh lets just stay with a basic 1v1 combat system and a 1v1 war system even in alliances



so those are my thoughs
i havent wrote them all because i already spent to much time writing this
i hope this will give a good idea however

i youre still unsure about buying it you can always wait until a free weekend to try
its not a bad game after all but an unfinished unrefined and incomplete game thatll remain as is
do not expect any noticable improvement even with other titles the major dlcs did not touch the core design but added more layers of flavous on top of it sometimes for the worse

#####

honestly wait on it

its a fun game i wont deny that but its also disappointing with growing pains it needs to ache through before its truly ready

mechanics like pollution faith and civics arent integrated into the game loop they dont really matter though you can choose to care about them for minmaxing you can play a winning game without missing any of them  not it would have been nice to have this but there wasnt any incentive to begin with pollution doesnt get to the point of making a difference faith is mechanically backgrounded and the civic unlock system is so rng based that you can be a colossal nation and never have unlocked most of the civics this is to say nothing of the impossible resource distribution and prohibitive game setup options the game is also rife with bizarre design choices that dont work when they work as intended just one example you earn the pacifist badge not by avoiding wars but by offering a white peace when you have the upper hand you might notice that this means you become a pacifist by steamrolling people but telling them it was just a prank once youve already decimated their forces

the interface for its part needs work it isnt intuitive and its often difficult to navigate information you need may be hidden three menus deep and until you discover that idiosyncrasy youll be ignorant of intelligence that may be critical panning the map with wasd is painfully slow your units take forever to walk three blocks and getting the right data overlay or list to show up is like performing alchemy thats not to mention the pervasive jank from achievements misfiring to fullblown mechanical glitches in the game the cute little ai persona feature also stumbles over the fact that you cant play against your own ai persona its something youre forbidden by design from enjoying yourself

what saddens me the most though is that humankind doesnt deliver on its promise 

ievery great deed you accomplish every moral choice you make every battle won will build your famei

this just isnt true far short of redefining the genre humankind follows every other 4x by incentivizing snowballing and punishing minding your own business you can build as tall as you want but if you arent wide enough then youre fucked the endgame is a bumrush to the most fame before the last turn is triggered  forget the advertised dream of reaching your zenith and coasting to victory the nation options in each era pay lip service to different play styles but really it comes down to how much and how quickly you can expand 

playing pacifist is an uphill battle and domination is comparatively easy the different era stars nominally have different categories but because theyre capped and not proportional the obvious results youre gonna have the most research money influence and population if you just attack everyone if thats your style then maybe this isnt an issue for you but i was expecting a game that let me lead my nation the way i wanted to without punishing me for my choice it doesnt matter if my people are preposterously rich or developed for their size if that size is small you dont eke out a win in humankind by being a kind human to make it happen i had to manipulate the map generation and give myself a minor continent where i wouldnt run into anyone else this defeats the purpose

mechanically this game is different enough from the civ series it cant avoid being measured up to functionally its not its my hope that amplitude will actually deliver on the promise they made before long

#####

civ fans either love or hate this game as someone with 1000 hours in civ 56 combined heres what i think about humankind

bthe goodb
the game is simply the most gorgeous 4x game out there civ 6 looks like a cartoon joke mobile game in comparison performance is good and turns transition quickly even in the late game the ai is surprisingly capable multiplayer is finally stable which took civ 6 forever

the early game especially neolithic is fun exploring before settling satisfies my inner perfectionist and you can choose to get away from a strong enemy if you want using influence to claim territory is a new mechanic that takes a bit getting used to but now i prefer it to civs settlers

diplomacy is interesting and nuanced due to how strong luxury resources are you almost always want to trade with others and since violence blocksdestroys trade routes its very expensive to wage war as it should be this makes empires naturally gravitate toward peaceful cooperation in most cases

when diplomacy fails you get war battles outcomes are affected by high ground river crossing fortification reinforcements etc all of them add depth into a tactical battle system that rewards good planning you also get true turnbased combat that isnt decided by whoever clicks firstfaster this is where humankind really shines

bthe badb
war score and war support are the most frustrating part because its a mostly opaque system with huge impact on the outcome of wars you managed to capture 2 cities spanning 7 territories in the actual war doesnt matter you can only afford to keep 3 of these territories with your war score hand the other ones back having a slow war because both sides have other priorities too bad suddenly you realize that your war support has drained to zero and now the other empire gets to claim actual territories what

balance is a huge issue some cultures are incredibly broken myceneans khmer soviets etc and while the devs are attempting to balance things in monthly patches theyre still nowhere near balanced builder and scientist affinities are inherently stronger to the point where multiplayer games often need house rules limiting them certain unique units are completely busted promachois for example unlock after one tech and have no effective counter until late in the ancient era

civicseventsreligion are very influential in the early game but fade into irrelevance past the mid game seems like a good opportunity for an expansion there

bsummaryb
overall its a promising game with lots of innovative concepts youll love it if you can live with its imperfections compared to civ 6 with all expansionsdlcs it has a long way to go however its miles ahead of vanilla civ 6 and thats enough potential for me to keep supporting this game

#####

 its been over a year now since its initial release i used to be of those naive and blindly optimistic person who truly believed in games potential to reach greatness however it is time for me to finally let go of humankind for good

why

 devs dont care they dont care otherwise the game wouldnt still be in its rudimentary form with persisting glitches from day 1 of its release its almost excruciating to encounter some of these glitches even after the first overpriced expansion and yeah i am done with the game the expansion pack lacks contents its boring its just appalling overall




#####

this is the very first amplitude game that i am truly disappointed with

but heres the thing humankind is the rare civlike  4xlike game that is not about making your civilization bigger stronger more cultured or more technologically advanced the whole point of humankind is to play a metagame instead  ie to delay and hinder your growth in order to collect more of socalled fame which is gained with metagame arbitrary achievements or stars

you want to conquer the world think again going to war will mean slower stars for you and thus your peaceloving opponents will win yah even if you are conquering the whole world eventually they can still win because you know they were more famous for things like having 5 peops of population when they had still been tribal  when they had still existed

ok so you want to win by developing your civ instead sure just dont advance into new eras too fast getting few cities with 8peops each when you are still in ancient era may give you more stars than having dozen of 38peops cities in contemporary era which means that if you rushed through the game ultimately reaching 99 of the globes population dominated all the cultures and religions learned 40 more technologies in comparison to your most advanced opponent etc  well it all probably means crap because your opponents were smart enough to remain in the ancient era until 1700 ad and by growing their fourth city to 8peops at that time completely obliterated you with their newly gained fame

dont get me wrong the game looks nice plays nice some mechanics are nice and there is still a lot of potential in it but unfortunately the very core mechanic of fame is completely broken sure i can play with it  i can easily beat ai in the metagame of collecting stars but to do this i must hamstring my own empire i must postpone my own growth until i have fulfilled enough arbitrary conditions rinse and repeat through all the eras which is hardly difficult but very very unsatisfactory and immersionbreaking

there are other broken mechanics in humankind as well but this one alone  playing a metagame instead of an actual 4x  is more than enough for me to give the game a thumb down

i really hope this will get fixed with some of the updates but since fame is the main core mechanic of humankind well lets hope

#####

im a history nerd play 90 or more or my strategy games in historical settings but prefer endless legend to humankind  and now after abandoning another humankind game and going back to a drakken campaign in endless legend i think ive figured out the gist of why that is

while mechanically there are a lot of solid ideas humankind lacks the spirit that endless legend and many competing historical strategy games have  the storyline the raison dêtre  in endless legend you have quests and lore that drive that forward  you are spreading your cult and the glory of your queen or pursuing wealth or fostering cooperation between the inhabitants of your planet  in old world various characters and events can create a storyline out of the game and in paradox games you are a nation in a historical settings  even in civilization a heavily mechanicsfocused series you play as the aztecs or the japanese or the english  perhaps the romans invade when you thought you were friends and become your mortal enemies and you become invested in besting them even if at a strategic level it would make sense to seek a truce with them and focus on other objectives instead

humankind is ironically for its name plain  events at least through the middle ages are binary choices which bonus do you want of two options  none of the character that endless legend has or branching storylines some of the competitors have  armies dont have leaders unlike the developing heroes of endless legend or the statbased leaders of old world  but perhaps most of all the system of allowing you to choose a new civilization for each era while a novel concept also robs the game of much of its potential to develop the longterm storylines and lore that endless legend thrives on

you get to choose a new civ with its own set of bonuses from a sizeable pool of choices when you advance  having a configurable perk per era iisi nice and i like that option on its own  but its disorienting when not only you but all your neighbors are changing identities frequently  the assyrians my ally  now theyre the romans  im fighting the olmecs until now our enemies still in the same lands are the japanese  it hinders the emergent stories in the games that competitors have and also has a practical drawback diplomatically  the spanish are coming to you with an offer who are they again  theyre not on our landmass and didnt exist five turns ago are they the big scary country over there or the ones we want to help

having stable civilizations could also allow the questbased storylines or longerterm historical narratives that made endless legend so great but are lacking here  im reminded of the unique historical victories in irhyes of civilizationi a mod for iciv4i  each civilization has a set of three unique and quite challenging objectives to fulfill to win based on their own criteria as well as the global criteria for winning  amplitude did try something unique here with the fame mechanic for determining victory but it only differs percompetitor slightly  if youre agricultural for an era you get slightly more fame for achieving agricultural objectives for example  compared to rhyes mod or endless legend 2 its disappointing  in 2001 this would have been acceptable but for a 2021 game its disappointing and all the more so for being an amplitude game  old world and paradoxs historical games have enough flavor based on real historical events that i learn about historical events i didnt know about before and that isnt going to happen much if at all in humankind  we have a mechanically stable 4x game but learn precious little about humankind

i could pick a few nits with the mechanics but ill just note two that are a bit odd  one is the city versus outpost system im not really sure what the goal was of having a secondclass option called an outpost  i guess its supposed to slow down expansion but it doesnt feel natural to me  its like if new york city was your main city and albany was an outpost of nyc completely controlled from the big apple and sending its resources through it and you can only have one library for the both of them  is it better than endless legends system where theres one city per region but theyre both real cities  i dont think so  

the other one that is odd is the resourcetrade system  once you connect up a resource you can trade it with everyone for gold and vice versa  i need 8 horse resources to build a horseman or 6 horses plus 4 copper for a chariot  but unlike endless legend its not a growingshrinking stockpile  if i dont have 8 horse resources i cant build any horsemen  i dont understand the move away from endless legends model where even if i didnt have much adamantium i could still occasionally build buildings or units that required it  endless legend seemed to finally solve that problem in a way that would make sense in general for 4x games but the approach isnt carried over here

so in the end i see why the reviews are mixed  from a purely mechanics perspective there are some interesting ideas  but its 2023 and amplitude spoiled us with endless legend and other developers have built immersive historical strategy games that give you a sense of place and increasingly flavor around who you are playing  perhaps there is still time for amplitude to add the missing humanity to humankind and if so perhaps it will get more playtime in my stable  but i wouldnt be surprised if theyve already moved on and are working on endless legend 2 behind closed doors and in the meantime ill go back to spreading the cult of the endless end

#####

i feel a bit bad for the developers they get a lot of negative reviews for a game which is really quite good 90 of those reviews seem to be either complaints about the game not starting or crashing or people saying its either not enough like civ or too much like civ simultaneously somehow

the game plays very well and people custom to the ui of the endless titles will find their way here as well if not then the game offers a tutorial and a in my opinion very intuitive ui i personally love the function to build your own civilization instead of choosing a premade finished one like in civ  and then playing as the usa under washington in 2355 bc somehow 

i personally agree that i would like civs to be more limited to decisions of previous ages so for example if you picked the nubians you should not really be able to switch to england later but thats just a personal feeling i understand that it would limit the game quite a lot

currently i can definitely recommend the game its an amazing 4x experience and i personally did not experience any crashes or instabilities so far  even the frame rate problems many here described have so far not occured to me

thanks devs for this game was about time civ gets a rival

#####

this game has a lot of potential but it has a few balancingmechanical issues that really hold it back

the appeal of the game is creating a custom civilization over time mixing the strengths of different cultures as you evolve over time however there is a radical imbalance among the civilizations and different strategies that result in most eras having a few correct choices doesnt matter how much you wanna play around money and sailing the phoenicians just stink the other issue with this concept is your civilizations never feel melded into each other civilization bonuses scale over time which is reasonable but they do so with such insane aggression that your early civilizations almost immediately feel irrelevant to your overall strategy by even the next age and the main reason to pick one is for an overpowered unit or short term bonus this makes it feel less like you customizing your civilization over time and more like a race to get to each age as fast as you can in order to secure important bonuses and wonders the imbalance between the wonders is its own issue but at least those are an explicit race

this compounds the other big issue with the game a distinct lack of progression the vast vast vast majority of your time in any given game is going to be going from the age of antiquity to classical medieval and then early modern which all play nearly identically to each other and have no real sense of escalation or variation you mostly are slogging through keeping up with escalating costs with units that are all fairly tight in power level with signature units being quite a bit way too strong and specialized troops coming along too late in any given age resulting in you mostly fielding masses of the same units until you get to the industrial era where you finally start seeing some new mechanics in the form of pollution but even that barely nudges anything and its only the contemporary era where the game actually opens up

which is a huge problem because the contemporary era is very short most of your opponents will not be in it leading to a steamroll and also you almost certainly wont be able to actually have your technology in the contemporary era if you reach it in time to actually start scooping tech from it before the ai reaches it and starts to tick down the time limit for the game tech costs are just too aggressively scaled and there isnt enough parallel development for a tech tree this granular this feels like it wants a system like stellaris where you might be developing 3 things at once rather than dedicating 10 tears to the concept of trench warfare which doesnt even make much sense for a technology but never mind that 

the result is this game having moments of real fun and flash it actually is a good combat system and you can win fights you have no business winning or lose fights you have no business losing on the tactical level rather than mashing units together but otherwise the journey is mostly a horrible slog because its a constant battle to keep up with earning era stars

it could be great with some changes maybe removing an era or more likely removing some era stars from earlier eras and just letting you build emblematic districts from older eras reducing the tech tree or creating tech categories and giving more for offbeat strategies to do and heavily rebalancing cultures so that your old cultures feel relevant if still waning in importance and you dont get lol what is this actually a joke tier cultures like americans or romans it needs a fairly big overhaul to a lot of the numbers to really shine but there is a diamond in this rough

#####

my wife and i have played a ton of this game as a successor to civ vi when firaxis stopped investing in it  weve wanted to love humankind but every time the devs update the build stability gets worse and worse  in the last week the game has gone from a ton of bugs that have been around since launch to almost unplayable with a disconnected from internet message for both of us  this is a bug thats been around for over a year when searching the internet and the dev just cantwont take the time to find it there is so much potential in this franchise but they are seemingly unable to get their qa process to match their ego and ambition

#####

i dont usually leave reviews for games but as someone who has completed nearly every achievement i wanted to clear up some misconceptions i have seen floating around the negative reviews here i would like to note that i am a long time player of 4x games with thousands of hours in civ 4 5 and 6 

firstly i have seen people complain that the cultures you were previously have no impact when you move forward  this simply isnt true every culture has a powerful passive effect based on their affinity that you retain whenever you change culture also the architecture of any cities you found during that era is uniquely that cultures architecture and remains so there is also the less direct effect that being a given culture will make you play a certain way that era so after being the huns you may have a sprawling and yet underdeveloped territory needing you to choose an agrarian or productive culture to move your people forward there are some balance issues with cultures but you do feel the impact of every culture for your whole game if you plan around them

another major complaint i have seen is around the fame victory condition i understand this is frustrating for some people who achieve genuinely difficult things like conquering the world  but this isnt civ and i feel like if we stop thinking about the game as civ this becomes much less of an issue the babylonians hardly stretched further than a small region is mesopotamia in reality  they certainly didnt conquer the world nor spread their culture to far flung regions of it but their civilization is still touted as one of the greats despite being long gone similarly for the maya in central america or even lasting cultures today like the egyptians the fame victory condition makes sense in terms of the world we live in far more so than any diplomatic victory in civ 6 it also encourages a varied playstyle and thus a more natural growth of cities 

thirdly combat combat in this game is simply a huge improvement over that in any other 4x title you have to pick your battles wisely because terrain matters even settling cities sometimes takes consideration of what a siege would look like or strategically building districts so as to have an additional line of defense for ranged units stationed inside you can reinforce your armies mid battle even on following turns so drawing them out can be a strategy you can defeat more powerful armies with strategic placement bottlenecking and knowing when to attack or dig in and defend  or by holding out till your larger forces arrive there are issues with the ai being quicker to the punch with clicking the sortie button before you can click assault when attacking a city but im not so sure this is a huge issue as i imagine in reality the archers would be firing from the city before you reach the gates

finally there is the matter of when the game ends im not sure why reviews are discussing how the games turn limit ends before any other end condition has been fulfilled  ive only had one or two of my countless games end that way i usually play  on endless though have also played slow normal and quick to speed up the ol achievement grind and it is the same throughout i normally end the game by fully researching the tech tree or if resources allow completing the mars colony mission there is of course conquering the world which is doable but i tend to do less often i have also had the ai complete the tech tree or mars missions before me and ended the game on the harder difficulties this is eminently frustrating if i have yet to surpass their fame but sometimes i have the interesting thing is when and how you end the game affects your likelihood of winning so you actually have to strategise around not rushing the ending which is an interesting deviation from civ 

there are still balance issues and certainly some bugs that need working out especially ahievement wise oh i crashed the game so many different ways when trying to nuke my allys city centre but the game is an original take on the 4x genre that gives you a sense of historical awe in a very different way to how civ does and i would highly recommend it

#####

the potential is here but ultimately this game just reminds me of what i find frustrating about civ and other big 4x strategy titles

battles can be extremely fun and engaging barring some annoying exploits mostly to do with dragging out sieges through sorties this is helped by the games complex terrain and generally excellent map generator the tile placement mechanics for expanding cities can be immensely satisfying and some of the factions unique districts and abilities encourage unique playstyles combo in cool ways and make for an interesting metagame plus the way the game handles roadrailair travel and its integration of diplomatic grievances into war goals are just clever and i hope future 4x titles take notes

all of this is mitigated though by bugsperformance issues units attack animations frequently freeze during battles forcing you to reload the game the reinforcements and trading screens sometimes randomly become unresponsive and the game crashes to the desktop just from the diplomacy screen being open at least once per playthrough

and humankind runs into the same issues with lategame boredom as other 4x games usually one or two players have built up unassailable leads tech gaps make wars laughably onesided and citybuilding becomes less and less fun the bigger cities get by the end im frequently just painting the map with districts to keep cities build queues full and limit the number of notifications i have to respond to industrialcontemporaryera mechanics like pollution the space race and nuclear nonproliferation have never been integrated well finally too many of the factions play similarly or have abilities that arent noteworthy or interesting and that hurts replayability

obviously theres a lot to like about this game and ive sunk a ton of time into it but the more ive gotten into it the more frustrating the ways it falls short have become

#####

the game is interesting to say the least one of my biggest gripes is the cheating ai so far i have played 2 quick matches on normal difficulty and both matches i pushed the ai to their last city and destroyed all of their troops somehow they are able to instantly produce another 12 troops in one turn on their final city forcing me and my worn out troops to go on the defense whereas i should have been able to steam roll their capital one of the play through i was able to vassalize a nation only to find out i cant control anything they do and on top of that they completely stopped producing troops leaving me to fight the other ai when i did have the ai troops as reinforcements that would have easily been able to win an engagement they always retreat on top of that the ai will continue to expand and claim territory right next to you with no repercussions yet if you do the same the will declare war on you in less than 20 turns tldr the game cheats and is highly biased to favor the ai winning over the player even with other computer players

#####

the more i play this game the more i understand how it works and the more i understand how it works the more i wish i was playing civ 5 instead

#####

honestly really wanted to like this game i have sunk so many hours into paradox and sid meiers titles it felt like a natural and interesting addition to my library

but something feels so impersonal i never feel like i am playing as or playing with anything the constant tagswitching the general sameness the lack of flavorful events it just grew stale very fast
for a historyinspired war game that emphasizes making your own choices none of the choices feel like they matter and none of them are interesting if i wasnt going to be made to feel like my choices matter at least the game could let me stick with a culture so i could feel a sense of identity
but no each team repicking their culture every age just honestly makes the game feel like pink team vs blue team having someone beat me to a culture or progressing fast enough to need to pick a new one too soon just really sucked me out of the game i see these culture packs and i think why the heck would someone pay money to only have a chance of playing as a team for a small portion of the game it never mattered if i was mayans songhai english or mongols for 15 minutes of game play loop because id always end the game at the same spot having made the same meaningless gameified options fighting teams i couldnt remember and no sense of self in the game 
at least i can make my own ruler
except character customization options are many very many and all someone very samey its like a buffet with only two good options both of which are fried chicken and then the dialogue which needed to be kept generic because culture is meaningless in humankind was just based on personality which always distorts your lovingly crafted character into one of four very samey options all of which make me rush to skip past the dialogue as fast as possible

this game does not manage to maintain an illusion of choice a consistency of narrative or a semblance of fun the journey to a slog and the destination is disappointment i was so excited when this game came out and now i just use it to remind myself to not preorder anything
real shame considering how lovingly crafted it all is

#####

played a lot of this game its not gotten better with time mechanics feel clunky its a game of steamroll because you took an industryscience culture first era or be steam rolled the additions of new cultures through dlcs was real welcome i had fun with most of them 

the together we rule dlc fumbled the bag the new types of cultures are poorly balanced and often their gimmicks are time consuming for little to no rewards combat has ups and downs but good luck figuring it out without the wiki some of the things units do make no sense sometimes sightlines make no sense 500 hours and i could not tell you what a fighter jet does usually by half way through the game you either have all the points you need or are thousands of points behind with no hope of making it back districts scaling in cost gets ridiculous at points especially when you have cultures like singapore which have the gimmick of being a massive one city empire 

whats really crazy is that achievements often just dont work the amount of times a nuke has crashed my game or prevented the turn from ever moving on is crazy which have fun using your nukes hope the player you wished to nuke was anywhere near you otherwise youre never hitting them 

the game has an alright character creator but if you wanted to use it to say make ais of your friends you cant you have to go through a convoluted modding process because this game decided to avoid the steam workshop for mods and suffers massively for it while on the topic of characters most the ais are pretty bland and the voicelines make little to no sense the amount of times ive been made a trade offer by the ai only to have my ai instantly snap back and say do not trifle me with such matters gets on me 

im not usually a warmonger in these games i much prefer the city building aspect where i can minmax values and pretend to be a good ruler by building stadiums and the such but the times i have done war in this game is infuriating to put it simply the way the combat in this game works makes it where even if you take large swaths of land before the enemy runs out of support youll only be able to claim one or two territories making the turns preparing for the war feel damn near meaningless not to mention theres a cooldown on when you can go to war again to claim another few territories which you can circumvent through sending trade deals they dont accept btw which just draws out wars

religion influence trade they all happen i think you wouldnt know most the damn time though cause they have near no effect most the time you just occasionally get a notification that your religion is taking over an enemy city and they hate you for that despite having no control over it as well as occasionally your culture will be mixing with others and every turn it is you either have to accept the other players laws one by one or have the entire city go up in flames

global warming is here but pollution is so unforgiving building two or three train stations is bound to collapse the world in a matter of turns im all here for an environmental message but its been in an awful state for two years now 

theres so many good ideas so much potential and its all being wasted at the same time crazy how with every game i played the less i wanted to play again

#####

tldr half baked game

not ready

picture a group of friends discussing their favourite 4x games and wishing this game had this other games feature or this mechanic they think would be cool would this fantasized game be any good i dont know youd have to test the mechanics first and fine tune the interplay well this part was skipped and humankind got released anyways 


heres a few examples of what happens when adding cool untested concepts on standard concepts 


 standard concept each culture founds a religion very early each time a religion reaches a certain number of follower it has to pick and add a tenet that adds some bonus to the culture following this religion 
 cool concept the list of available tenets will be shorter each threshold so its not just a matter of getting the tenet that suits your playstyle since you might very well end up with no tenet to pick at all if your religion is seriously lagging behind 
 problem not thought through if the player is last to pick a tenet and every tenet from the ever shrinking list has been picked up already the game cant continue this possibility has just not been considered and you cant play anymore its not game over mind you you just cant hit next turn on your 352nd turn no turning off the mandatory notifications in the settings does not fix the problem


 standard concept pollution is bad
 cool concept theres a global pollution score if the global score gets to a certain threshold its game over nations frown upon heavy polluters
 problem not thought through theres no endgame as the ai just doesnt care and spams polluting low tech industries until everybody dies opponents still trade or ally with each other no matter what game ends prematurely because you were managing your pollution output and 9 other opponents were not think about it just a second your 400 turns game ending abruptly not because the ai beat you but because it made bad decision that impacted your game too and you couldnt do anything about it

it is accurate in a sense but in terms of gameplay its a very poor mechanic


 standard concept turn base game they move i move
 cool concept turn based game everybody move at the same time
 problem not thought through the civics research events etc all pop up in your face once youve cleaned up the screen the huns are on you because the ai doesnt read pop ups

 standard concept fight for resources resource nods are undetermined until the relevant tech is researched
 cool concept strategic resources oil copper uranium etc are very scarce like 3 or 4 max  and you need multiple of one kind to produce x so you will need to trade for them eventually
 problem not thought through 
often times theres not even enough of said resource generated in the whole map to even produce x so the related tech is just useless remember it could be something like oil which accurately is king of the last era
what if youve been lucky and there is indeed a grand total of 3 oil nods just what you need to produce x on the whole map and you have 2 your ally has 0 and your enemy has the last 1 good luck trading with them now you should obviously have secured that mysterious resource nod at the other end of the map in the neolithic era


 standard concept war score  war attrition penalty on pop
 cool concept the population of warring nations can force a surrender from their leader be it you or the opponent they also dictate if you can go to war or not 
 problem not thought through i dont know whats going on really aside from battle won  war support and battle lost  war support the rest is too hazy players that play the xterminate game in those 4x games are really pissed in the forums especially when the opponent surrenders in a few turns low war support and they have to accept the surrender and stop the war immediately in exchange for a pitiful territory they dont care about while the ai keeps its resources and capital

i dont favor this game style so i play xploit and just ally with a trusted partner so while peacefully minding my economic growth and as my war support against my ally was understandably getting lower and lower i did get noticed that i was going to lose the war huh what against my ally seriously what because of low war support from my pop are you ok game

also reading the forums it appears that a city can not be attacked from sea could be a reasonable mechanic but what if the city spans over an entire island well you cant disembark troops in said city since this would be attacking from the sea consequence your pop is getting tired of this war you cant win you lost the war


 standard concept pick a leader and lead a civ
 cool concept create a leader and lead a civ
 problem not thought through the choices are cosmetics which while very welcome is of very low relevance in this kind of game some perks to pick would have made more sense

speaking of perks there are some perks you can actually pick for your avatar together they make your ai persona its intended for your avatar to be exported into someone elses game and then behaves as you intended to say aggressive  favors luxury ressources i dont care about how much someone else is going to have playing against my avatar i would have preferred to either pick perks or buffs for my playthrough or design some opponents



ui and tooltips
the list of those nonsensical overthought issues goes on it doesnt help that the tool tips often are hazy at best if not downright misleading

exemple 1 nuclear submarine with nuclear propulsion and nuclear weapons says the tool tip cant launch nuclear missiles fun fact of those 4x games the nuclear submarine will lose a 1v4 against 16th century ships but it sails 2 tiles faster

exemple 2 i really would have like to know why this carthaginian port was previewing a 14 food prod when placing it then showing a 1 food prod once built while my city total food prod actually grew 14 bough the production to get the numbers instantly and compare

exemple 3 had a perfect game to test culture switch could cause you to lose a territory i spawned on a peninsula the size of a small continent closed off the peninsula and maintained a buffer territory as a no mans land only one single nation on the other side of the no mans land fought them a lot so they could never settle against this border we never traded obviously and i never met anyone else since early boats cant go through high seas by medieval era i was doing great and they were doing poorly i however had the displeasure to see that my pop was under the influence of their culture how and another ai unknown culture what the no other info except from convoluted colored lines that seemed to indicate i somehow had some relation with this unknown ai opponent far away in the fog of war


conclusion
i do have to say however that the game looks pretty the musics great and i am one of the players that enjoy the sarcastic comments of the voice over i also have to say that switching culture between eras is refreshing and it adds a layer of strategy pick your favorite now or wait a few turns and take whats left but it is also very confusing when reading notifications about opponents wait whos brazil again were they the despicable huns or the amicable nubians

 other than that i cant recommend the game to any 4x game fan for the reasons stated above

side note if youve seen videos about the cool tactical map on the battlefield do note it will most likely feature your machine gun nests mowing down 16th century halberds it is helpful for a few tight early battles the mammoths youve seen youtubers fight against  but some things dont change in 4x games if youre ahead of the curve you just mow down the opposition and autoresolve

review after the first playthrough of a game from a player with 1000 hours in civilization 56

the the first 50 rounds felt like the best part of the game its really cool to run around as a tribe and settle your first cities its also the part where microing felt really neccesary unlike you do in civ in humankind you dont have builers you build all your modernisations in your city centers this means with a huge construction base you get improe your empire really fast 
i played with egypt as my first culture who turned out to be very op my starting position was also very lucky after eating my close neighbor i could settle half of the biggest continent and island hop to the new world very early influence usually limits your expansion speed but with my huge production base i easily managed to be 3 over my city limit the whole game as a result expanding was posible and in a very peaceful way you could also say boring

in the mid game improving my city became very repeative lining up production orders and hunting barbarians was the main part of the gameplay in civ 6 planing your citys district by district is one of its strongest points imo adjacency bonusses are existing too but it feels less important because you are building so many of them 
religion trade cultureinfluece do exist but it doesnt felt like it is really important you build the stuff to push the number but the influence on the gameplay is realative low i had the biggest religion in the world but im not sure if i had any benefits from it

the lategame was kind of strange my big neighbour entered the last chapter of the game a couple rounds before i did but i dont think he was even close to threaten my win with my big empire and a fitting culture i pumped out ridiculous amounts of science finishing all the endgame techs in 1 round each it was now a race between my mars programm and researching all future techs which also wins you the game 

there are many aspects of the game i had no oppurtunity to have a look on war against a nation as strong as me with modern weapons wont happen because i win the game 10 rounds after finishing the first modern military techs my only neighbor my biggest rival and me were allies since day 1 
you have some kind of influence on other players cities but i didnt saw any way to benefit from this also trade and luxuries didnt impact the game very much i build it earn the yields and thats it

so why im still recommending the game

everyone who played civ 6 or civ 5 vanilla knows how awefull they were on launch key elements of the game were totally missing 3 years of proper developement and addons made it the great games they are today
i really see this way for humankind too the potential in the game is huge the atmosphere beats civ already because you are really feel like watching a civilisation forming over millenias yes many features need to get a more significant impact and to interact better it would be also nice if the cultures would play more different in terms of gamemechanics and unique stuff because it seems like they simply have boosts for either science gold production or influece 
balancing is a problem where much work has to be done
overall i dont recommend this game for players who are completly new to the genre buy civ 6 platinum edition has a great price and its definetly the better game in its current state but remember it took 3 huuuuge addons to bring it to this point
for those who are used to the genre its a really fresh impression it has much atmospheric rollplay cool ideas and is looking very nice if the devs make it right they can easily turn humankind in a game that equals the quality of civ 56 buy it cheap play a few games let it alone for some fixes and addons and watch it improve

well amplitudes magnum opus their words not mine is finally here announced in 2019 and with a tumultuous development humankind is finally in our grubby little grognard hands with a long history of criticallyacclaimed 4x titles on their belt a civilizationstyle 4x foray sounds like a match made in heaven but is it since were in the earlier stages of this game which will likely receive numerous updates ill give the nitty gritty and update it as it becomes a more complete and cohesive package and boy is there a lot to say even now

uthe goodu
first and foremost the game is beautiful amplitude has built a reputation of creating stunning backdrops for their games humankind doesnt disappoint even in the smallest maps the worlds feel lush and ripe for exploration districts built by the player create a sprawl that must be seen to be believed by games end civilizations will have megacities spanning continents that truly leave the feeling that the player has built up a magnificent civilization whats more the game has a stunning soundtrack that never fails to set the mood like its endless titles before it the player is treated to a fantastic score that never leaves you wishing you could leave an era to escape cacophony as in some other games 

the games combat system is reminiscent of its endless legend titles though it lacks many of the characteristic design choices that made it stand out players armies are composed of individual units brought together in a single stack when combat occurs the player then has to arrange them on a line and maneuver and attack them many factors come into play including unit type and terrain which all come together to make it a bit more strategic than the simple bop and drop style as is common in firaxis titles it serves to give the game a bit of identity but not much unit types are different but one cant help but wonder why amplitude didnt include at least some of the mechanics that made legend fantastic such as hero units and equipment customization 

the diplomacy system is a step up from its contemporaries as one would expect from amplitudes pedigree players are capable of recognizing grievances that their neighbors have inflicted on them and leverage them to create demands if not met they build up war support which when high enough can be used to engage in warfare and should the player be victorious in combat be used at the conclusion of war to divvy up cities and territories and even force their opponents to act as a puppet it is somewhat barebones as it stands this will be a running theme if this is not clear yet but the system in place is a great base that can be built upon

u the badu
civilization has always ran on a difficult system emerging from the boardgames of yesteryear players are left to suspend their disbelief in making sometimes anachronistic choices in civilization choices yes george washington was not alive in 4000bc and that can be jarring amplitudes response to this in humankind is to give players the choice of a number of cultures to assume the role of at given points in history at first glance this is a spectacular idea coming out of a huntergatherer society and assuming the role of the assyrians certainly feels pretty cool 

the issue instead comes when the player transforms from the assyrians into a radically different culture such as the greeks there is no continuum the player simply transforms from one into another instead of having a cohesive culture that is built upon and molded over time the player simply morphs into a radically different society the issue is compounded in that this characteristic is shared by all players those pesky egyptians to the north theyre now those peskygoths there is a massive disconnect in how the player approaches others and themselves instead of identifying civilizations by cohesive identities they do so by color you learn to identify your enemies by shade on the map more than anything which can be rather offputting

u the uglyu
oh boy where to begin humankind is a game tailormade with a scoring system called fame instead of vying for supremacy by attempting to reach the stars first or conquer every other culture the player is instead tasked with trying to build score before the game ends while it is possible to win via alternative methods it is extremely unlikely to finish them before the conclusion of the games turn timer players are given a huge number of choices many of which cannot be made as they have to prioritize gaining fame at the expense of all else in one way it makes for a more cohesive game  as the player is free to choose from a number of cultures in each phase that could give them potentially more points but being that humankind was opting for a more introspective and playerbuilt civilization simulation it falls flat as the game draws to a close players vie for supremacy not by racing to defeat an opponent or stop an imminent religious conversion but instead build a few cities and research technology to get just a few more stars before the turn timer runs out 

it bears repeating as already stated but the games systems are wildly underutilized or plain unfinished on almost every level outside of combat and citybuilding they are exhaustive but i will list the largest offenders

1 there is a system of religion in the game which is almost entirely useless the player forms one in the ancient era and regardless of choices made or lack thereof will almost certainly reign supreme over all others by the end of the game there is no sense that the player has any real attachment to it whatsoever and that is exemplified by the fact that everyones religion will almost certainly simply be some form of ancient polytheism from beginning to end

2 the player needs strategic resources to build a number of units and buildings but to say they are scarce is an understatement it is extremely common that in most games you will be unable to build any modern units or endgame structures including planes as the resources needed will either not spawn at all or be in such remote locations that the player has no way of accessing them before the game is over 

3 there is a system of pollution which must have not been tested at all later technologies will give the player access to train stations and airports which as in civilization gives the players access to quicker transportation or means to field air units however they also produce pollution in civ games pollution generally is featured as a gradient with later titles such as vis gathering storm dlc having a system of flooding desertification and natural disasters which gradually slow the players progress and force them to use technology to solve their problems humankind turns this up to a thousand building a single train station and airport in a city is liable to cause your city to go from zero to low pollution which for some reason will almost certainly lead to instant anarchy and collapse of any city that builds these structures

at its core humankind is great but its caked in a layer of grime that needs to be scrubbed heavily

#####

for someone with a very long history with 4x games this is a disappointment humankind is aesthetically pretty and has a solid foundation but is brought down by some glaring issues that sap the fun right out of it

1 religion is halfbaked and thats being generous your experience of it will be almost identical every game
2 strategic resources are far too rare do not expect to be able to use your cultures unique unit in most of the early eras as they usually have a strategic resource cost that you will rarely be able to provide
3 there is very little tactical nuance to the tech and culture trees there is almost no motivation to select anything other than the cheapest tech to research and the culture options are binary with one option almost always being better than the other
4 the game completely falls out of balance when using anything other than standard turn speed 
5 simultaneous turns means the ai will usually beat you to an action as they dont have to read the evergrowing amount of notifications that spam you every turn 
6 snowballing is an inevitable thing in 4x games but the problem is more dramatic and pronounced in humankind than ive ever seen before this is partially an issue of number tuning and part because of the first come first served mechanics in the game if youre the global hegemon by classical era youve probably won

i want to like this game i really do and it does a lot of things right but it needs work 

tldr  its not finished save your money for a year down the line when hopefully theyve sorted all this out

#####

so some people have taken to calling this the civilization killer i think thats a bit overly dramatic its familiar enough compared to civilization  hexagonal playing field turnbased research trees historical eras  but it has its differences

the real clincher for this one compared to civilization is that here you dont start with one civilization and play it through the entire game well not unless you want to in some spots but choose new civilizations as you progress through the eras and your leader is for all intents and purposes yourself or at least whoever you choose to represent yourself as opposed to a historical leader who may or may not be controversial the avatar creation is a nice touch

its nothing particularly earthshattering in the genre  some might call it a civ clone  but as i said its interesting enough to give it a try

#####

i want to love this game the concepts that make humankind unique among other 4x games are amazing but there are too many simple game mechanics that just make it not fun to play but 2 years and 5 dlc later its clear they arent going to address them its a real pity game could have been awesome

#####

overall thumbs up but i wish there were an option between thumbs up and thumbs downi want to state from the outset that although im focusing on the negatives here i still think this game is worth it it definitely has that onemoreturn vibe going and while theres a ton of work to be done the bones of this game are terrific im focusing on the negatives because thats what the developers need to hear to keep us all coming back at the end of the day this is a business they produced a product for which i paid if they need someone to celebrate them publicly they can call their mothers to their credit and also why im recommending it look on the forums and all you see are pinned posts like fixing x together making y better together theyre motivated to do the work and im motivated to help themwe all should be

theres a lot of great concepts in the game ill talk about a few and what work i think is needed

culture switching the idea that your culture would change over timedifferent civilizations symbolizing that changeis cool people whining about immersion are the gaming equivalent of hipsters and i have no time for them however there is something disjointed about it that i cant really put my finger on something is missing i would think at least in part selecting one culture should in some way limit your future choices so if you select the celts you cant become brazil the next era it doesnt make any sense and that mayyyy be part of the reason why that fabric of cultures through time idea they were talking about doesnt really work i dont even really think about them as cultures to me its more like what bonuses would i like for the next 100 turns its possible my problem is also cosmetic the fact that my outposts and cities change stylesslightlyisnt really all that dramatic or interesting and considering the relatively low city cap you dont really see the most dramatic changes all that much i will also admit i do kind of miss going up against stalin or playing as roosevelt or watching gandhi nuke the daylights out of everything however its sometimes hard leaving old things behind so maybe thats all that is  

the most controversial concept it seems is war support which some people really hate i like it it simulates the idea that you need the people with you to some extent if you want to go to war however it needs a ton of work as it presently stands you can essentially conquer your neighbors without physically capturing any territory if you game the war support system rightgame isnt even the right word if you simply employ good strategy you can conquer your neighbors by winning a few well placedskirmishes its pretty ludicrous maybe the war support cost of territories should be much higher if theyre not in some kind of zone of control maybe the gainspenalties system needs tweaks probably its all of those things im always surprised these games dont make more of government types it would be cool to have elections if youre a democracyrepublicmaybe a thing that plays out over a number of turns with you trying to influence it one way or the other with you culture playing a rolehell you could even have an election night system that plays out in subturns similar to combat is yours a puppet regime cool you can choose to manipulateassassinateintimidateidk theres so many possibilities here but im getting off topic the point is war support is not itself a problem its that it lacks depth

the combat system has huge potential huuuugee potential but presently the ai is at best inconsistent in my first playthrough i had ai opponents making really smart decisions finding highground flanking appropriatelyall that on my second however my current ai opponent the one ive effectively conquered without ransacking a single territory just seems to throw anything and everything at me without regard to whether theres any hope of victory whatsoever i know that the ais have traits that dictate behavior so perhaps this is the explanation if so maybe ease off the gas a little

game pacelength seems off to me 600 turns is hardly endless as compared to other games in the genre and when a game ends while youre still sending out sailing vessels its even worsealso how is global warming a problem when my primary combat unit is muskets make the game longer so people like me who like long campaigns get some time to play with all the techs personally at a minimum the endless campaign should be 10001500 turns i also found myself spending a ton of time in the early game which is cool and almost no time at all in the contemporary erai never even got to nukes what a bummer

theres something about this game that feels empty i mean that in the literal sense like at any moment you might run out of things to do or something i think a lot of whats driving that is diplomacy simply put theres really nothing much to do there i love the idea that i buy access to resources thats great now i dont have to sit there and play with sliders watching the ai make horrible decisions the system of grievances and demands is super clever and i love the idea that trade routes can be disruptedthough at least on lowmiddle difficultiestheres not really much incentive to go out and protect them if that can really be done obviously those luxuries come with huge bonuses but so far at least i usually have enough going elsewhere that it doesnt cause a real issue strat resources are another conversation but again so long as ive built enough of the related unitsa temporary disruption is not really a problem anyway back to diplomacyyeah kind of as a result of the great ideas they implemented theres just not much to do id love to see some work in this areamaybe there could be like jointventure projects eg build this dam together somewhere to increase industry or make money etc if they build out the pollution system a bit theres a world of opportunity there too

religion i dont really get it thats my feedback it seems very ancillarythe bonuses are nice i suppose other than that the whole system seems very passive
culturespheres of influence spheres of influence i feel like i dont fully understand the consequences of that seems like one of those things where i must be missing something still for something thats so big thoughso foundational historically i can spend a heck of a lot of time not caring about it
pollution i dont think we need to spend time talking about this everyone is aware of the issues
navalwaterway issues im a little surprised at no point in my first playthrough did i have the opportunity to establish control over the waterways seems like a missed opportunity to me 

bugs they exist theres a reasonable number of them upon first release but overall i found what was provided to be very polished at times the ui could provide more information it would be nice if the infrastructure build tooltips would simply do the math for you rather than me having to count the number of districts and do the math but other than that i thought they did a nice job here

overall i do recommend this game ive never written a review before so that should tell you how much i care about this one between modding support and the clear dedication of the dev team theres a great future for this game but ill admit the road ahead is a little long but with continued support and constructive feedback  i have no doubt theyll make a game that makes civilization a thing of the past

#####

to be honest the game in its current state just isnt worth it it can be fun but most of the time with the ai it devolves into using cheat engine or trainers especially at war just to deal with the ais cheating i wont go on about the things i see everyone complaining about but i will raise one glaring issue ai moves
the game is simultaneous turns good on paper or more specifically good for humans vs humans but throw ai into the mix and they are reacting faster and doing things while your still checking you notifications at the start of a turn and they do react to you example i order an army to attack and ai army while my army is marching to them the ai army counter attacks marching to attack the moving army with the army mine is attacking apparently that counts as the ai attacking and they get first strike badly mangling my army while normally that can be praised as reactive and clever ai after all a player would do that right i say its still bad because they do it every time i have confirmed in my latest match any time you dont have an overwhelming advantage hard to do once they get the research to involve reinforcements or near a city they counterattack you you move and attack defender try to siege a city nope your defending while they still get the benefit of the fucking fortifications 33 cities i took in said war i had to take without siege weapons and my calvary were just damage sponges since i couldnt break the walls and use them all cause the ai can decide no you are not the attacker the ui even still labels it a siege it makes anything other than early game combat a massive frustration to the point of near unwinnable and come late game where gunner units that can shoot and move in the same turn come in play battles can be decided in the first move

so overall there is a great amount of potential in the game but questionable design decisions and the bugs and problems others have mentioned tend to overshadow it sometimes badly did i mention you cant turn simultaneous turns off
amplitude please sim turns were tolerable in the endless games or at least endless space but here its just absurd

#####

this game has a lot of ideas  that probably sounded good on paper in reality they just dont work

the culture choice system disconnects you from your civilization there is no attachment you started out as babylon went on to become japan and ended up as the united sates or you would if the ai wasnt in full cheat mode and always picked the most efficient cultures before you even had a chance

that is the greatest pet peeve i personally have with this game you just dont feel connected to your civ they try to combat that now with a patch by giving each civilization a unique empire name but that doesnt fix the problem its just painting the culture frankensteins monster construct with a unique paint its still a patched together monster without a coherent identity 

maybe if they at least would have limited the culture choices to regions  as in asia europe africa or something similar it might not be such a disconnect but in the end the great big competitor civilization just does it better a single selection of interesting civilizations that feel unique

combat feels more tedious as engaging after a few fights i started sighing when combat started first the ai always seems to have an advantage over you somehow unless you outnumber or outtech them vastly

diplomacy ai is pretty samey as any 4x game the biggest problem for me is that the enemies are interchangeable and forgettable because they are just random avatars with random cultures attached to them for me compared to civ and their memorable leaders this is severely lacking

technical problems i personally had little a few odd crashes here and there a bit of stuttering for a few seconds nothing too serious

i was hoping mods would fix this sooner or later but now almost a year after release im still waiting for workshop support that i think was announced even before release as a thing iirc

the development of updates also feels extremely slow considering the game had so many issues technical as well as gameplay wise yet in one respect they are really like their great big competitor  theres a host of dlc to purchase for you i would also not recommend you do that

i would have wished this game to be a great competition for firaxis civ series but alas it is not even playing in the same league as of yet i dont recommend buying it if you are looking for a serious civilization alternative if you just want another 4x game that has a lot of ideas but mostly feels bloated and not thought through at times maybe wait for a sale

ill change my mind maybe if they patch it more

#####

since the george sand update my game will grind to a halt after 1030 turns no settings matter and force quit is the only way to recover i love this game with 400 hours since first release and all dlc but i am leaving a negative review because of what happens next

they added a new report bug button to the title screen  swell these are my attempts to report the bug

1 spend 20 minutes typing up details and hunt down the logs and save files they want uploader says it wont accept the html report files that the game itself generates that you yourself asked for okay how about the zip file that the game itself generates and that you yourself asked for oh no its 30mb thats too large 10mb is the maximum what 10mb what year do you think we are in okay finally everything is what they want i hit submit  your session has timed out force redirected to a register page and everything i just did is gone what the 

2 get to upload page pick two zip files which are 25mb each the page says no thats over 10mb wont let me submit what the 

3 get everything working had some text copy pasted from earlier experience to save time and typing at the speed of light for others hit submit same deal open browser console and see 400 bad request error on token refresh b gtfo your page has basic noob level bugs it was never going to work to begin with

this can probably be solved on my part if i register an account on their stty  site instead of try to post as guest but you know what you can  right off i know i have in my hands exactly what they would need to fix this bug i assume but i am more motivated now to get onto steam to write my first ever review after a combined 10000 on all games than to deal with this flaming piece of garbage of a bug report experience

i hope you have a better day than mine

#####

let me preface this by saying that humankind isnt a game you shouldnt buy just that you shouldnt pay full price for it youll probably still enjoy it if youre a fan of civ or 4x in general but it has some major issues that honestly shouldve been fixed long ago while the devs seem happy to ignore them in favour of adding more shallow and questionably balanced content

first the games pacing is completely out to lunch even on the slowest game speeds youll barely have time to make it through a fraction of the tech tree for each era before youre already being prompted to advance a number of cultures emblematic units dont show up until midway through or at the end of each era tree so your eus are already largely obsolete by the time you unlock them some cultures also play like nearly identical carbon copies of other cultures and there are definitive culture sequences through which you can completely cheese the game by minmaxing on bonuses

there are copious issues with graphical and audio bugs  constant background crackling when any audio plays is enough to make you want to shut off the decent if not repetitive soundtrack which you can expand by paying 350 for small music packs in a shameless case of walletsqueezing the consumer units terrain textures and whole districtscities will simply vanish late game and become invisible with cities becoming just masses of greyish ground textures airport and airstrip runways and textures disappear and things just generally become a graphical mess that amplitude should be utterly embarrassed about it indicates that they never even playtested their own lategame to catch it or it wouldve been fixed before release

then theres the constant infinite loading loops the game will constantly get stuck trying to process a battle action or ending a round of combat or ending a turn and it will hang anywhere from a couple minutes to hours ive left the game on one of these loops and taken my dog for an hour long walk to see if it would resolve itself and even after getting back it was still processing the only thing that fixes this issue is to save the game and reload the save and youll do this far too often to excuse even in the starting nomadic era youll run into this problem

the unit tree also has some massively glaring gaps that make absolutely no sense  ww1era siege artillery never upgrades further napoleonicera cuirassiers upgrade into 21st century mechanized infantry mounted in strykers and musketarmed line infantry upgrade into ww2era infantry which then dont upgrade further it makes no sense at all some of the gaps its like they got to the early late game and just said fk it good enough

the game isnt without praise though the environmentmap visuals are beautiful the natural wonders are stunning and the terrain functions as far as gameplay go are awesome its the same as endless legend with terrain actually being truly 3d in function versus civs 3d terrain that functions more like 2d the era system and changing cultures is also a refreshing change but it also feels nonsensical at times with the ability to switch immediately from say an ancient african culture to a classical asian culture and then a medieval european culture it wouldve been nice if such shifts were more natural and felt more migratory than just abruptly sudden but im not sure how theyd have been able to work that functionality in considering the nature of random maps

all in all its not a bad game yes its playable but it has serious issues that havent been fixed or even acknowledged despite the fact that its been nearly a year since launch jul 2022 as of this review release was oct 2021 and yet the devs have time to add more cultures of varying balance and depth and content that isnt really changing the biggest problem of the dull lategame that many 4x games suffer from

if youre thinking of picking it up just make sure youre waiting for a sale while the game is decent it isnt worth sticker price and amplitude certainly doesnt deserve to take your 60 for it until they shape up and fix the numerous bugs and issues that have been ignored since the game dropped



tldr  game is about a 710 and id wait for it to be on sale for at least 30 off respectively

#####

im a 66 yr old  gamer or a old man that like playing pc game i was deciding between this game and new civilization after doing my homework decided on humankind and never look back this game is challenging in all molds i love playing in humankind mold and also on line i play for over 610 so far and not tired from it yet narrating  graphic are all great i recommend this game highly to all who thinking about getting it

#####

so after a handful of false starts and two full games i have to say meh 
other reviews go into allot of detail on the problems balance famestar chasing etc i agree with the consensus on all of those matters one thing i want to call out is the fact that the marketing for the game really leans into the idea of being able to disrupt history and build radically different societiesalternative histories based on the choices you make and the civilizations you pick and really that is not the case in both of my full games the only thing that really changed is the second game i did more combat which was really just a conscious decision on my part 
for the most part neither game felt much different everything felt the same between my game where i was authoritarianhomelandtraditionalcommunal vs when i was progressivegloballibertyindividual there was just no real difference most of the decisions you make in the popup scenarios are meaningless and just end up coming down to if you would rather boost science or money for 10 turns or whatever save the whaleskill the whales  educate kids or dont  none of it seems to matter much
i really wanted to like this game but i cant really recommend it because there is nothing that really sets is apart from any other game of this type

#####

its a 4x game you dont need me to tell you whether you like 4x games or not either youve played one before or you havent instead lets consider what differentiates humankind from similar games in the genre  the most obvious and common comparison being to the civilization series by firaxis

speaking generally each new entry and dlc although for simplicity well ignore that in the civilization series has added or modified or removed pivotal new mechanics which fundamentally change the way the game is played civ 5 added the hex grid and removed unit stacking civ 6 added districts and a second tech tree for culture at its core humankind is close enough to the standard formula that we can consider humankind to be a spiritual civ 7 pending an actual civ 7 release consequently we can examine the major changes that have been made and how this influences the experience

humankind has made a lot of stylistic decisions  some received better than others for example the pollution mechanic while incorporating climate change as a concept into the game in an interesting way also lead to so much complaining due to abruptly ending games that it is often switched off as a gameending condition on a fundamental level however there are three major changes which define and differentiate it from previous civilization games listed here from least to most consequential

1 the combat system combat has been completely revamped leading not to a regression to the infinite stack of units of civ 4 nor the continuation of the one unit per tile of civ 5 and 6 but instead to a compromise between the two where units of different types can be combined on one tile when out of battle with the size of the stack depending on technological and cultural research era and religion perks etc these unit stacks when going into battle with an enemy form a miniature lockedoff battlefield in which each unit occupies its own tile reinforcements can be sent in after an early game technology is researched but units cant be sent out this approach makes combat feel a lot more dynamic than in previous installments of civ often requiring more attention in placement battlefield control etc the most striking downside is that the procedural generation of these battlefields by the game can be somewhat arbitrary leading to a common situation where an otherwise easilybypassable bottleneck becomes the only way to attack an enemy besides this the ability to instantly resolve the battle is also great in speeding up the game but can give completely unexpected results and is often paid for with less efficient use of units compared to manual play 

2 culturesera advancement the developers have recognised the reallife evolution and morphing of civilisations over time and have incorporated this into an era advancement system which allows for far more complexity in each game due to the sheer number of culture combinations available this in turn causes a really interesting interplay especially in multiplayer games as the cultural choices of other players influence your own advancement path and vice versa it allows people to lean into one form of gameplay or another and even allows for some mitigation of rng  if youve been dealt an environment unsuitable for one culture another one might be more advantageous to take having been burned too many times in previous civ 5 games after locking in a civilisation and starting a game without a given strategic resource or inhospitable terrain this approach removes this downside while  if you care about that kind of thing  more accurately portraying reallife civilisational evolution in short a great new addition

3 the win conditions  or perhaps win condition singular because there is only one this is by far the most important difference between humankind and the civilization series the classic string of different victory conditions send the rocket to mars persuade the world congress eliminate all other players has been relegated to simply ending the game leaving the only way to win is to have the most fame points when the game does end  fame points in turn mostly being awarded through era stars earned through the different ages relating to districts influence and gold generation population expansion and military aggression this means that particularly at higher difficulties its no longer sufficient to lean heavily into for example conquest and expansionism in an attempt to wipe out your opponents and be the last civilisation standing if your opponents are able to earn more fame points than you before you wipe them out and they almost certainly will at higher difficulties those eliminated civilisations can still win overall this does add another layer to the advancement mechanic are you going to delay advancing era and get more fame points but potentially miss the opportunity to pick a particular culture but also forces a more wellrounded style of play where neither total military domination nor scientific focus are enough to achieve victory i wouldnt call this inherently better or worse than having multiple victory conditions  there is still some amount of leeway and creativity in developing your civilisation especially at lower difficulties so its not like every game plays the same or that the game is solved  but it does represent quite a radical change in gameplay that might be unpalatable to some

there are other more minor things to quibble over  the landscape can be a little hard to read the visual difference between a surmountable hill and a blocking cliff can be minimal at times city stability has a tendency to fluctuate in ways that can be confusing and opaque the population allocation is virtually nonexistent compared to for example the micromanagement of civ 5 and there can be some buggy moments  but all of these are ignorable and dont really impact the overall experience too heavily and could even be revisited in later updates

on the whole while it doesnt quite reach the pinnacle of gameplay that lead me to sink a frankly embarrassing number of hours into civ 5 with all of the expansions plus a balance mod humankind is a very strong addition to the real lifestyle 4x genre and a serious competitor to the civilization series strongly recommend giving it a go to people both familiar and unfamiliar with this style of game

#####

im a huge fan of civ games and im a huge fan of spiritual successors to games that got bad sequel treatment humankind is a earnest attempt to continue the 4x genre forward in the space that civ abdicated with civ 6 theres a great deal of promise in the game and its systems but the game and its systems simply arent finished i dont usually take time to give notes on a game but id really like to see this one succeed so here we go

warm
1 civ system that changes with era this gives me the flexibility to tailor my bonuses to my situation huge win over the normal formula
2 cityoutpost system i love that the game has an elegant solution to building high and to avoiding cityspam that has absolutely plagued other titles
3 influence as a resource i like how civics and expansion are linked together with one currency unlike say stellaris where they are separate currencies
4 general performance and responsiveness the game and its ui are snappy and look slick
5 water movement mechanics i love that you can leave the shallows for a bit at a cost but i wish the pathfinding did a better job of managing the shipwreck status
6 placement hints these are so much better than those in civ i would love a button to jump to reccomended spot also i didnt always get 2nd or 3rd options
7 fame system i think it might need some numbers tweaks but i really like the overall idea over the typical victory conditions of other 4x games
8 buildings not costing gold upkeep is a very welcome change

lukewarm
1 diplomacy grievances make for much more finegrained interactions with npcs  but its really hard to gauge how other civs are going to react
2 units require pops i like the idea but the balancing of pop costs is awkward there are some nasty cutoff problems where units suddenly cost x2 the pops around midgame for only a minor improvement in combat capacity
3 civics i like the overall idea but the system for unlocking civics is unintuitive and should be reworked also civic adoption cost scales too quickly and the bonuses are a mix of completely useless and insanely op
4 district mechanics i like that adjacency bonuses are a thing but they are ridiculously swingy the bonuses not transfering over cliffs is also fairly frustrating  an area with lots of cliffs is just worth less

cold
1 notification spam its absolutely unbearable even with a fairly small empire i get constant notif spam about pop changes some of which are not real  theres definitely a bug in there other civ opinion changes and other irrelevant stuff worse the notif toast often wont give me a summary of what actually happened so i have to open the full menu even worse that menu will often not call out what was of interest on multiple occasions i found myself wondering why i was in a particular menu

2 event pacing generally events like osmosis and cultural clashes happen basically every turn this is too much i had a city outputting x5 the science that it should have been because it triggered osmosis every turn this contributes to the overall notif spam problem

3 battles battles are time consuming and confusing the ui is buggy as hell and the battle estimates are regularly incorrect sieges are even worse and the mechanics for reinforcing a siege are confusing and not properly explained i dont like that battles break out into a tiny section of the map with hard edges or that the movement that takes place in battlespace doesnt translate to actual movement the capturetheflag mechanic for defending is awkward and does not feel intuitive it is often not clear that a movement will result in a battle

4 movement blocking being blocked by neutrals even between infantry and ships is awful 

5 strategic resources i dont think the current system where you need to just meet a threshhold of a certain resource makes any sense it means that strategic resource control is incredibly binary  you either have access to resources or you do not worse resources dont spawn very much in my first play through my continent didnt have any copper and my only neighbor had only a single node and we didnt get along this meant that i was locked out of a huge portion of the tech tree until i unlocked proper seagoing ships and bought the resources i needed until of course i somehow broke my trade routes in an unrelated war

55  other resources i like that there are other resource bonuses on the map but they feel too rare and arent properly called out i think a small fullcolor picture icon over them and resources in general would help differentiate the map id also like to see more resources that only give base bonuses a bit like wheat oranges or dear in civ 5 to help provide focal points

6 ui  city stability one of the most important resources you have to manage  your city happiness  doesnt have a display to tell you how much margin you have until stability starts to drop you literally have to add up the bonuses in your head actions that can have a large effect on stability like linking an output to a city have a cryptic little hint that it will affect stability without telling you what will happen this is just a straight up fail  i need to be able to see what the new equilibrium stability will be after a given action

7 ui  resources i love that the ui tells me how placing a district will affect my citys resource generation i dont like that it seems to lie to me sometimes i think that the ui wont display some lost resources from undeveloped land bonuses which leads to situations where some early districts seem to have enormous bonuses to resources only to have those bonuses slowly encroached away in addition i was never quite clear how many of my resources were coming from tiles and how many from pops

8 overall pacing i played the game through on default tutorial settings and chose the civ in each era that seemed to have a good economy bonus i ended up blasting through ages i  eventually got to the point where i could finish wonders in 4 days with only one or two cities like in civ games i hit a point where my tech was advancing faster than events could keep up so a siege of a single city lasted so long that i was using trebuchets even though i was in the industrial era i also regularly failed to even gain access to my civs unique unit before i ended the age let alone actually employ the thing in addition the map felt much too small  not in tile size but in terms of space that i could actually expand into the entire map was completely developed by the time that i could build a ship to go check out the other continents

9 overall balance the games bonuses seem to be constructed so that if you can make the best use of your bonuses or grab a good civ you can completely break the games systems but if you cant youre stuck in the doldrums and fall far behind some civs have completely ridiculous bonuses that just straight up need to be nerfed i correctly identified that i had lots of rivers in my lands and picked khmer for my midieval civ the districts provided absolutely insane bonuses  to the tune of an entire citys output of resources from a single tile it was fun to completely outpace everyone on the map but it felt a bit dirty 

10 visual bugs  lots of problems with units displaying wrong on the map the ageup camera pan looks glitchy instead of impressive as the new models for tiles ghost into existence 

11 tech tree i feel like civ 5s linear tech tree was one of its weakest systems and humankinds is arguably worse i generally found my research decisions were fairly unimportant

nits
1 the dividing lines between provinces feel arbitrary and are often ugly
2 if you control a city with many provinces it can be hard to find the suggested place to build
3 units lack differentiation especially unique units

#####

game has a lot of potential but if youre on the fence hold off on buying at the moment the game is a lot of fun at times but the fame mechanic is infuriating and the changes that came alongside the recent african cultures dlc sent the game overall in a worse direction 

its a wait and see on this one for me the concept for this game was great it looks amazing but the execution on the gameplay elements has been pretty poor

#####

thumbs down for lying about allied victory conditions having broken and untested mechanics having no cooperative features helping in battle trading territory sharing tech etc and for a lack of an infinite turns option in multiplayer which is due to lying about allied victory conditions because the game would be unfinishable without killing your allies 

there are so many issues with the game mechanically i wrote up a longer review but i dont think anyone would read two pages of mechanics talk heres the rundown
alliances dont work there are zero allied victory conditions or even basic cooperative options you cant trade territory you will constantly generate war grievances and popups you will lose stability by declining cultural edicts you cant support allies in combat you cant share tech and probably more things im forgetting
cultural edicts have insane bonuses and objectively correct choices propaganda literally breaks the game as it deletes the stability mechanic all together this makes every game the exact same
the playtesters at humankind did not ever think to raze a city and see how it interacts with the warfare system not once and warfare in general makes absolutely zero sense
religion does nothing but give you more grievances popups that the ai will never accept because why would it and gives you very small empire bonuses
in 4 full games ive never successfully launched a nuke before i won because you go to mars before the nuke tech and there is no way to stop producing science so you will eventually get every tech and win anyway 
the ai is programmed to never step foot in territory guarded by any air force so ive also never seen a plane do anything 
sometimes the ai will teleport units to random squares on the map that only happened once and it might have been a desync issue 
multiplayer lobbies randomly shut down all the time and require everyone to reconnect 
the ai is completely braindead and will spam hundreds look up screenshots if you think im exaggerating that number of the same district destroying all usable land making conquered cities horrible to even have 
at the end of the game a top tier fighting unit like an attack helicopter will have 58 strength medieval knights have 41 there is no ramp in fighting power also i think the ai is incapable of building the higher tier units
you have no way of knowing where pollution is coming from as it does not have an icon on the map so good luck trying to stop the ai from polluting the world without killing their entire empire

honestly the mechanical stuff doesnt bother me too much im not a powergamer by any means i see the value in building a personal narrative the alliance stuff really gets me playing these games alone is fine but man whats wrong with wanting to sit down grab a couple bevs play some 4x with some buds and shtstomp some ai i dont want to fight my buds i want to chill out and try to race to nukes so we can disassemble the dmn dirty italians at the atomic level whats so wrong with that

this review is written from the perspective of single player only 

i probably have 3000 hours on civ 46 because i was a loser in high school but i loved those games i was a bit bitter about civ 6 but grew to love it imagine my interest when i saw humankind a game like civ made my amplitude oh dear burned by failed launches and misplaced hype in the past i was hesitantly exited for this game 

unfortunately i appear to have not learned from my mistakes the game fell flat quicker than i would have liked there is something missing in this game i dont know exactly what it is but its something big that diminished my interest far quicker than i would have liked i think it has to do with how alive the world feels the ai seems lackluster and dead i thought i would like an unexpected cast but they lack any illusion of life they are more of a terrain feature that blocks parts of the map until they are conquered and even then world domination isnt even fun 

dont get me wrong i actually like this game but it grew stale very quickly for me the combat is awesome the nation building is fun although i would like it be more consequential rather than minor stat buffs diplomacy needs an overhaul the skeleton is there and solid but its lacking city building is fun i love it far more than civ but things seem too big cities districts etc but with all that said the ups and downs this game has the foundation of a fantastic game i really really hope that more people play it i hope the game gets a second wind it has so much potential like civ 6 but another civ game in the next couple years would kill humankind forever it is so close to greatness i dont want to see this game die 

is it worth it yes i got my money out of this game for sure should you buy it if you like 4x you will like this i cannot say you will love it but youll like it i hesitantly recommend i think this game has a future

#####

all the surface level features for this game are fantastic on paper this game rivals civ 6 in every way except for the fact that this game has no depth it is a large puddle between balance issues broken ai scaling and the lack of decent features i cant recommend this game plus the fact that the developers seem to ignore the things that actually need to be fixed and instead opt to release dlc that offers very little to the game

#####

h1 buy this game just maybe not today h1

that header is basically my review in a nutshell other reviewers have done a great job of breaking down the good the bad and the ugly so im going to focus on the weird

b resources are weird b

when you start the game as a simple hunter youre surrounded by resources that are nothing but question marks you will have no idea what it will be until much much later in the game when you develop the right tech i understand this from a historical pov  a lack of specific resources needed for a modern era has fuelled plenty of conflict like japans conquest of asia circa ww2

but the weird thing is that even if you have the resource a lot of unit types will require having several of the same resource just to build a single unit

to put this in perspective i sent missions into outer space  satellites into orbit i built stealthy nuclear submarines capable of sneaking across the map i bombed my enemies with cruise missiles from afar and i tested thermonuclear bombs

but i couldnt get two oil resources so i was never able to build a single ww2 era tank or a basic aircraft carrier and my best ship was a preww1 steamship oh and my air cover for that nuclear submarine was a biplane

okay so thats still somewhat understandable  certain resources are vitally important i get it so i built alliances covering 34 of the entire planet and waited till my allies had researched the technology needed to see the resource and mine it i rubbed my hands in glee and prepared to build an army of tanks to crush my enemies only for them to buy my single resource instead of building a mine for their own

and because they never built a mine for their deposits i couldnt buy it from them nor could i even offer to pay for the construction of the mine except for one race during one nonmodern period so there we were apparently eating from the same single neverending yet neverenough pile of resources  puttering our mismatched militaries around where even though a nuclear submarine uses the same resources as something else i can have 100 nuclear submarines but not a single of the other unit because lol who knows

b combat is weird b

okay so youve lucked out  congratulations on building an amazing army youve built up enough grievance points to start a war youre up against a relatively puny force of selfindulgent fools using weak technologies and sure enough steam roll them in city after city when suddenly ublorpu youre forced to negotiate a truce

why erm war weariness i guess except the war hasnt been going for that long youre kicking butt without losing a single unit and your goal is to annihilate them okay so you enter this mandatory negotiation and despite being able to wipe them out completely you can only afford to take one district

the option to turn them into a vassal exists  but it requires so many points only certain nation types with certain bonuses will enable you to do it

i see a lot of folks in the forums justify this as being historically accurate they give vietnam afghanistan and other examples as evidence that even the most advanced populace grows weary of war and occupation and will be forced to negotiate

but this is a false equivalence this game is essentially tell you that the british would never have been able to occupy the land of australian aboriginals that the chinese could never brutally vassalise their asian neighbours in vietnam and beyond for centuries that mongol hordes would never have successfully taken over countless tiny tribes villages and protonations in their campaigns because at a random point in the middle of a fantastic campaign ghengis khan wouldve encountered a fingerwagging enemy whose land is 98 occupied insisting he negotiate and only to be given a single city

the worst insult is that after waging an epic campaign the fact that youre forced to surrender almost every territory youve conquered means your troops are often stuck far into what is now enemy land which you had conquered and then confusingly given back to them and will suffer attrition damage coming home because apparently giving the land back wasnt enough  you had to let them kill you on the way back

i have suffered more military damage coming home from victory than i have in combat to the enemy which is fundamentally weird

there are other weird things about this game glitchy maps that glorp out at random artillery units that can blow up tanks but cant attack walls the fact that your military units can fly anywhere using a commercial airport but cant use a military aerodrome forcing you to build both because the latter is needed for military units the list goes on oh and the fact that a fleet of 18th century warships is apparently better than my undetectable nuclear submarine is also fun

b the game is still great b

the developers need to create a proper tutorial rather than videos but the game in its bones is still amazing the vast majority of the things being complained about are balancing problems that can be fixed the soundtrack which changes between ages and nations is insanely immersive the graphics are wonderful

when this thing is fixed its going to be a title you come back to for years you literally start as a tribe of hunter gatherers chasing woolly mammoths across the plains before settling down to become spacefarers dont compare it to civ  it looks prettier by far and has arguably better pacing 

so im waiting for patches before running another play through and so should you

#####

humankind is a game full of charm wit and the kind of dramatic flair developers most often miss yet is weighed down by flaws which undermine the personalised experience that is promised ultimately the civilisation you create does not particularly feel like a convergence of culture history and values and instead plays as hopping from one empire to the next as you advance through each era 
 
firstly the era system suffers from issues comparable to civilization vis era score feature where the player is forced into completing specific tasks if they hope to remain relevant chasing after fame restricts you from playing the game in any unique way depriving the empire you build from personalisation as you consistently check the statistics to ensure you earn stars before anyone else 

secondly the eras themselves do not reflect the technology of the game by this i mean the science scaling is relatively poor and without focusing solely on your science output through the course of a game youll reach the contemporary era without having even discovered electricity 
on the off chance that you manage to research technologies further along the tree you will likely find it to be pointless regardless since resources are spread so thinly across the map that you will not be able to build lategame units or buildings anyway 

i think my greatest issue with humankind is that there is nothing unique about the civilisation you play as the selling point of the game hardly exists and the cultures you choose from almost feel as insignificant as the other hundreds of choices you make 
the pop ups feel as if they should be something more and originally they are exciting to read through as you contemplate a decision but they end up as just something else to hurriedly click through 

despite everything i have said you can still enjoy humankind its quirks are entertaining the narrative is fun and the game looks wonderful i am confident that with a few strong updates humankind can become the game it was meant to be

another very promising game which was veryvery raw at the time of release 
i am tired of supporting such game titles which become merely playble after a year or more 
still has some drastic gameplay issues which results unpleasant game expirience

#####

tldr buy if youre incredibly desperate for a high budget 4x otherwise hard avoid due to balance issues

i really want to like this game but the balance the stupidity of the combat and the constant breaks of suspension of disbelief keep me from doing so

lets start with the minor annoyance that is the territory system a carry over from endless legend you have no way to define the boundaries of a given territory you claim territories to expand and eventually add them to cities while i dig that you can claim a territory before you actually for real add it to an existing city the actual territories are drawn haphazardly and without any natural boundaries ive seen a gigantic territory that had a huge west and a huge east connected by a tiny one hex tall corridor that spanned several hexes why is this one territory ive seen territories chaotically spasming around a map with no heed for mountains rivers or even ocean why not let the player have some mechanism to define the extent of a territory

another minor annoyance is city size while its cool that you can eventually grow your city to be every single hex of a given continent this trends towards the norm rather than the exception where a dedicated player would strive towards this its ridiculous war is declared and immediately youre sieging a players city because its right on your border every time

a huge annoyance again carried over from endless legend is the combat system and the map boundaries as you may or may not be aware already combat is between two armies of up to 8 units plus however many reinforcements they can bring in from nearby armies it turns out that nearby means in the combat map which is something you can preview but cant control combat takes place in the same map you strategize in but the boundaries of the combat are arbitrarily decided based on some unknown factors youll come into ridiculous situations where the border of the combat prevents you from getting your minions to the desired location why no reason its just wilderness plains on the other side of the border but for whatever reason your troops cant move there moreover sometimes again for reasons unknown you will only be able to deploy one unit at a time of your army this bleeds into the next major problem with the combat in the game in that the player who goes first has a massive advantage say for example that you have a high tech army filled with modern tanks against an ai using ten bowmen from the ancient era happens more often than youd think he attacks you and thus goes first turns happen simultaneously so even if you plan an attack you will often be attacked first you get to deploy your troops but because you are only given one deployment zone for this particular battle usually you get like 10 you only get to deploy one of your tanks the bowmen then proceed to batter the tank with their wooden arrows tank dies in 5 hits well get to this absurdity later which is fairly normal for any unit in this game regardless of era you now lost the battle because the one unit you deployed was destroyed even though you have seven more where that came from absurd unfun bad design especially since losing a battle has impact both on the retreating troops and your war score do i feel good when i do this against an ai no the grand battle i tried to setup was robbed from me

combat heavily favors those who go first you can wipe out most armies in one turn before they have a chance to act just by shooting them off the map the map gave you only one deployment zone no problem you can just move your units out of the deployment zone one at a time and shoot your opponent off the map

now archers taking out tanks if youre like me you play these civ type games so that you can exult in the experience of your modern battle tanks completely decimating the enemy you love that juxtaposition of a poor babylonian era army completely getting obliterated by the modern hardware you tech rushed to in this game sure you can destroy enemy units in one hit one at a time but those babylonian era units from the ancient era can also destroy your armored tanks with arrows it takes about 5 shots per tank give or take the randomization this may be on purpose in the early civ games it was possible for an ancient settler unit to defeat a battleship because of how the random combat worked it was just highly unlikely in this game my modern battleship can get overwhelmed by 5 cogs from before the renaissance

finally pollution developers always get this wrong and this game is the worst example i have ever seen of it keep in mind you can easily end the game before you ever get to this point either by conquering the world but i assume lots of people play these games because they want to oppress savages with ultra high techness first things first you can end the game through pollution very easily build a train station awesome 5 pollution build an airport 20 pollution alright a factory 510 depending on culture alright want to build fighter planes 10 for that aerodrome oh oh 40 pollution a turn thats low pollution if this keeps building up the game will end by making the world uninhabbitable for human life the hell i realize devs always get this wrong but thats not how this works an airport and a train station across three cities in one civilization will not end the world

heres another problem i believe this to be a recent hamfisted change the game limits your city growth by a stat called stability anything above 80 and good events for your city below 20 and your city starts to revolt every district you slap down that isnt a fort or a commoners district lowers your stability by 5 forts raise it by 5 and a commoners quarter raises it by 5 times the number of noncommoners quarters it lies adjacent too the fort can be upgraded to give 5 to 20 additional stability with techreligion things such as religious sites and wonders can also raise stability by 20 to 40 or more by building them within a citys territory so far so good

low pollution which again you can easily get to within seconds by merely building a factory an airport an aerodrome allows you to make bombersfighter planes and a train station makes every district in your city output 15 stability at the time of this writing i had a city go from 300 stability to 1000 in a turn once that low pollution status was triggered 

remind me what great revolutions were triggered by carbon emissions china on the verge of revolt india guilotining its rulers the united states ready to hang congress because of smog its dumb stupid and incredibly hamfisted its enough to make me want to deny global warming irl just to spite them i mean ill stop short of that but you get my drift

want to lower pollution you can lower it by 10 30 nuke plants which should completely replace fossil fuels only lower it by 30 what sense does that make youre still inching closer to the invisible death clock moreover you just hit the pollution barrier and thats it no gradual degraedation of the environment no floods no indication at all everything is fine one moment and then bam world ended lame

i have more to say but steam review lengths 
maybe theyll patch a few of these things out pollution seems to already have been changed quite a bit and resource scarcity has been addressed at least once so far all of these problems are fixable unfortunately they still need to be fixed as of this writing and they do a lot to make me unhappy with the game when a game depresses me it means its time to stop playing and therefore i cannot recommend this game stay away

#####

buys game on discount
boot up game with normal settings and mid diffuculty
notices the point where ai gets no additional bonuses  ok good start
turn 1  see ai next door plop down and outpost when its technically impossible you need to go find influenceresource before thats even doable
turn 5  myself still trying to find resources  ai pumps out 10 units
proceeds to attack me
sends army to attack manage to attack their troops one by one cause dumb ai
even strength tactical advantage on the hill
friendly troops needa retreat
somehow retreats straight behind enemy backline instead of safety and positioned right between 5 different positions
gangbang ensues

boots up new game and tries again
same shit
boots up new game and tries again 3x
same shit x3

dont get this game for the singleplayer 


#####

this is a really great game and is a worthy addition to the 4x genre theres a number of negative reviews currently but they seem to be from people that either dont know the genre all that well or who have forgotten what every other 4x game is like at release comparing all titles at their release date state this is one of the better releases in years take it from someone that has 1500 hours in civ 5 and 1000 in civ 6 this game is worth it if youre on the fence then wait for some updates after a few months and just pick it up in a sale

#####

i want to love this game there are so many aspects that are unique and almost make the 4x genre feel fresh but theres so many issues that the developers seem to have no interest in fixing that ill never recommend this in the current state on top of that dlc announced before a major patch despite mixed feedback good luck amplitude

update first time ive ever come back to a review to tell you that its even worse than before and the same bugs still exist pathetic developers

#####

humankind a sterile plod through history

in 2014 amplitude released endless legend a game with many clever design choices that refreshed the 4x genre and massively influenced larger titles such as civ  7 years later the same studio has released humankind a game that largely abandons the decisions that may endless legend a success and refuses to adopt ideas from much better games

tech tree  bland linear tech tree there is no evolution of game mechanics rather every tech just unlocks something that creates more food industry gold or science  this is repeated again and again and again  previous endless games had clever innovative tech trees that forces the player to make tough decisions and leave some techs behind in order to reach more powerful highertier knowledge  the humankind tech tree is a giant leap in the wrong direction for mankind  

combat no interesting promotions fiddly movement rules no generals no character at all to units or armies

map blobs of continents geography is nearly totally unimportant after the decision of where to create an outpost  curiously advanced resources are visible from the start of the game with  mark  why can prehistoric tribes recognize uranium which will not become useful for 6000 years  better 4x games build in mechanics that reveal new information to the player to force adaption or major strategic changes  also the system of extracting an amount of a resource and expending an amount to construct buildings or units as in previous amplitude games is a much more robust system than simply being allowed to construct buildings and units with simple access to a resource

city blob of a city there is little ability to specialize or develop your cities in any feels special  city development usually is just spamming lots of the current unique district because it generates more gold production food etc  

events an amplitude specialty banal events with minimal impact mixed with poor ui  there are a limited amount of events and they quickly become repetitive  the effect of many is so inconsequential that the events just feel like an unwelcome interruption to your game play  sometimes less is more a gamers imagination can often create a far more interesting setting story and experience than repetitive anodyne events    

ai poor even at highest difficulties you can claim an unguarded city in first 20 turns of game  combat ai seems to struggle mightily with fortifications and the player repeatedly has to take on what becomes a rather tedious chore of manually controlling battles in order not to unnecessarily lose troops  

bugs current game got stuck on turn pending upon completion of a wonder

atmosphere the game is rather characterless quite literally you can progress through thousands of years of history and there is not one human  your people are faceless pops that you can slide around to produce you guessed it more food industry gold or research  

pacing the game is largely passive  the majority of turns will just be hitting end turn as you wait for cities to build something that produced more food industry gold or science and there is little point to positioning armies  

a couple things that i did like the beginning of the game was an interesting shuffling of the deck so that by the time you are ready to settle and start building and researching the player will have a different amount of influence stored science population etc  also choosing culture at each era created some of the more interesting choices in the game but at the cost of leaving you feeling a bit identityless

humankind invites the player to write their own history  unfortunately this invitation comes at the cost of sacrificing much of the richness beauty and fun of human history  humankind is meant to compete with civ but discards too much of what civ players find engaging and familiar  rather than facing off against historys greatest leaders the player instead matches wits against characterless androgynous hipsters  the different cultures ebb and flow and like the incessant tide will erode all that came before and stands in their way  there is no richness to humankind that will guide a curious player to wikipedia articles on roman warfare or sleepless nights planning strategy because there is little strategy in humankind just a dull sterile existence  

the verdict
the game isnt terrible but its massively underwhelming and there isnt much reason to play it  humankind does not bring much new or interesting to the 4x party  the decision to include this particular mix of poorly constructed and implemented mechanics is particularly damning when previous amplitude games had stronger iterations of many 4x systems that humankind is patently missing  



#####

is it a new take yes are some of the ideas compelling yes is it balanced thought out or well done no no and no

like most modern releases this game will be good in 20 patches when the suckers like me that bought it finish the beta testing

#####

this game cries out for a maybe button

pros
i love the concept having multiple different cultures throughout the eras  in civ your uu is only useful in one era if that and your advantages may or may not be actually useful to your empire not on the coast  sucks to be you  in humankind you have a uu for each era and you choose your advantages in game to adapt to your situation
feels more storydriven and narrative than civ or most other games of this type ignore the fact that old world exists
graphical style appeals to me more  personal preference i know
a vast array of cultures that all feel relevant  maybe not all 100 or even 75 balanced but the devs do at least try look at the khmer at launch to now or the turks and most cultures are at least situationally useful
sharing avatars so you can play against your friends even when playing single player is a great touch
combat  playing out the combats is actually fun here unlike bashing units together in civ
much like in endless legend province based maps are more fun to play on than oh the ai managed to settle a city in between two of my cities now i have to go to war to get rid of that city  related developing cities is more fun when the placement of districts and rails and such are important

cons
as much as i love the concept there are problems bound up in the concept too  you get 7 cultures so what do you call the empire to your east  not egypt or china but blue or light purple or maybe by the leader name but those are easy to lose track of or perhaps by their symbol sorry doesnt work for me at all  the devs realize this and have admittedly tried to improve this problem but im afraid this is just a cost of the multiple cultures playstyle and is inherently unsolvable
the storydriven aspects are great the first 6 play throughs but there isnt enough variety and it just gets tired in subsequent games
your control of civics in humankind should give you immense control over your empires government but it feels much more watered down than government types in civ  government types play very differently there in humankind the changes are are very marginal
multiplayer  once you start snowballing you really get going in humankind much more than in civ in my experience  this means playing mp is frustrating  if you are a step behind there is almost no coming back
combat  much like the total war series if you arent playing out the fights you are shooting yourself in the foot so you feel like you have to play them all out  this can make conflicts much more of a slog than they need to be
the less that is said about war score and war exhaustion the better

other
ive also heard complaints about instability in general connection issues in mp and performance issues in late game  i must be incredibly lucky because i havent experienced any of these i mean yes the game slows down on processing end turns late game but isnt as bad as civ
diplomacy the subject of the next expansion is pretty meager but actually slightly more robust than civ was out of the box so im not going to call that a pro or a con

tl dr
worth it on sale or if you want to support the studio amplitudes endless games are all excellent and i can still see this heading that direction in fits and starts  if you love civ but want something a bit different this could be it


#####

humankind has a lot of potential and does a lot of cool things to mix up the 4x civstyle genre having the potential to far surpass civ if it was given the opportunity but its also one of the most poorly executed games ive ever played a year later and it still feels like a indie early access game just with amplitudes amazing art direction its extremely buggy with gamebreaking issues that reach back to endless space 2 and endless legend which still havent been addressed having your save become unplayable due to the dreaded infinitely loading turn makes each game feel like a gamble because reloading an older save will not fix it it also has some of the worst game balance ive ever seen in a strategy game so bad i wonder if they even tried i wont even go over them here because id be here for hours it runs to the games core gameplay loop theres also just a whole lot of vestigial mechanics that dont seem to serve much of a purpose making some aspects of the game feel like shallow attempts at introducing roleplaying elements although they miss the point entirely theres also pollution which feels like a cut mechanic that was replaced with something that just makes the endgame fall apart at the seams
instead of dealing with these problems weve gotten a handful of patches some really bizarre fomo liveevents which use their weird online integration with time locked content in a 50 game 2 culture dlcs and an expansion for a total dlc price tag of 38
as a side note the weird online integration also spreads to mods which require you to use modio instead of the workshop which i would be fine with if it wasnt an absolute pain to navigate and actually worked half of the time its also missing features like autoupdates its apparently for multiplatform mod uploads but its just another platformlauncherexternal website i need to worry about and juggle in a game that already does that
amplitudes games have consistently been on the edge of being groundbreaking but they always seem to miss please make game balance a priority from the start and figure out that turn glitch its been over 8 years since endless legend launched

i genuinely dont understand the hate for this game ive clocked thousands of hours on 4x games over my life especially civ 6 and 5 after two full playthroughs i think humankind is very close to being my favorite game of the genre

i think the biggest draw of humankind is that you switch cultures every era which is ironic because thats the main reason i resisted purchasing at first i was expecting civlike cultures  play as australia in the ancient era japanese in the colonial era etc i was pleasantly surprised to see that the culture selection actually matches the era in a historically accurate way that is youre playing cultures that actually existed in the ancient era and evolving into a different historically accurate culture in the next the result is a much more seamless and immersive playthrough than civ 6 where you might start as teddy roosevelt in 4000 bc and play him through to 3000 ad not only does that make no sense whatsoever in a historical context it also makes the game drag in humankind you have a completely new play style to look forward to every 3060 turns

other pros
beautiful art style
military combat is far more interesting than civ franchise there is an option to micromanage battles and terrain is far more relevant i usually opt for manual battle but autodeploy so i get to watch massive 40 unit battles take place but only interact when the autoplay is really screwing up 
simple endorphin rush because you can earn up to 21 era stars per era versus 7 or whatever on civ 6
fun strategy involved with deciding whenhow to evolve your culture between eras in order to maximize fame and respond to whatever youre dealing with ingame at a given time war trying to catch up on research expanding to a new continent etc

simply put this game is far more immersive than any other 4x ive ever played the constant culture switching introduces a whole new tactical element to the genre what used to feel like a total slog through the mid game of civ 6 is now consistently engaging in humankind

that said this is a new game and there are some issues that a hope the developers fix
nukes are essentially worthless the range on all missles is not near enough to ever have hope of hitting one of two opponents cities unless you set up an city right on their borders for some reason icbms just dont exist in this game
it is really difficult to tell what districts are built in a city unless you mouse over each individual tile which makes planning adjacency bonuses pretty annoying
in a similar vein its also difficult to see roads and rail systems additionally there should be other transport systems besides just road highway rail and air id like to see some kind of natural dirt road evolution prior to the road tech unlock akin to how traders make roads in civ 6
if an opponent has a navy it is virtually impossible to safely transfer embarked land units to their border because embarked units get immediately one shotted by every naval unit this is even the case if your naval units and embarked land units are part of the same army there needs to be an escort option that prevents embarked units from being attacked before the naval component of the army is destroyed
ai players seem to be generally resistant to trading if they dont like you a lot even if they need resources that you have that doesnt really mimic reality
unless youre really really trying aesthete stars are very difficult to earn especially early game the first game i played i had nearly the entire map in my sphere of influence yet i was struggling to accrue enough influence to found outposts let alone earn stars the fact that common districts are essentially wastes of space they dont really benefit exploitations makes this issue worse this should be balanced

i hardly ever write reviews for games but i felt the need to defend this one because its getting so much undue hate its a solid 8510 and could easily be the best in the genre with a little tweaking

#####

the game itself is an awesome idea every new game is going to have bugs but the issue with this game is the bugs make it unplayable once you are in the contemporary era the game gets stuck on pending turn and never allows the game to proceed once this bug is fixed the game will be amazing but until then its just frustrating

#####

a game very much like civilization a game that ive played and loved since the first version a few decades ago humankind does have some interesting tweaks on the 4x genre 

at certain points the game presents events the arrival of visitors from foreign lands major weather threats etc that usually present you with choices that can have longlasting effects  a fun element 

it also begins with you as a nomadic prehistoric tribe which is interesting dont underestimate the importance of this stage by the way  dillydally too much here and all the other players will take the best civilizations

speaking of which unlike civilization where you take a nation and control it throughout history in humankind you can change cultures during each major era prehistory ancient classical medieval early modern industrial and contemporary if i recall correctly i like this and i dislike it mechanically it creates interesting challenges and opportunities as different cultures focus on different aspects science industry food etc and have different bonuses and unique units it does take away some verisimilitude though if you like more continuity in your story which i do in civ i almost always played on real world maps with real world starting locations jumping from zhou ancient china to suddenly being the olmecs and then the english just feels a bit off to me as does the fact that your city names except the first one have nothing to do with your starting culture you might end up with thebes edo london and chicago as city names in your nation really though this is a small critique and you can change the names of your cities and units as you like

the biggest  and best  change to the civ template is the way combat works you can create and control mixed armies ranged melee mounted etc and when you go to battle you control the units within the army on the field challenging the enemy in a much more tactical and engaging way than civ does 

its not a perfect game though the default goal is to accumulate fame and even by completely dominating the other nations you may end up in 2nd 3rd or worse place this to me is boring and mildly frustrating you can change the endgoals to suit your play style such as militarily subduing the other nations or being the first to reach mars i find this much more satisfying than merely accumulating points though the game will still rank you by fame 

the default number of turns is only 300 which from my first playthrough was just enough time to reach the modern contemporary era which was a letdown this too you can change i prefer to set the endgame to no turn limits as it took me 800something turns to get all of the tech available 

my final negative of the game is the underwhelming ending in essence you reach your goal or the turn limit and the game just ends no satisfying endgame video no celebration of your victory or defeat  nothing a complaint i have with europa universalis another terrific game 

overall i really enjoy this game its just as addictive as civ and the combat is much more interesting id say its probably up there with civ v and vi a b its slightly more complex than civ less so than eu iv and i highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys 4x games

#####

yet one more reason for a meh rating rather than a thumbs up  this game was hyped as a civ slayer it was going to do everything civ didnt and it would be amplitudes crowing achievement

well  no  its merely ok  i dont dislike it but i dont love it either  meh

it does score over civ vi in some ways

the landscape is far more interesting and well rendered than civ  humankind has the innovative concept of elevation something no civ game has adequately addressed

cities expand in a more natural way sprawling over terrain and growing more organically than civ vis modest attempts to put city growth on the map

the idea of a culture evolving over time is actually innovative although i had hoped it would be even more fine grain than a new era and a new civ

but it stumbles more than it succeeds

the scale seems tiny   rather than the grand worldbuilding of most 4x games you get 5 6 cities and some territories  it feels small regional  i get in the early part of the game one city makes sense but five going into the contemporary age  what the hell can you do with so few cities not much

no world map  one of the best things about civ was the ability to play on the real world  same with the europa universalis series  i like procedural maps but would it have killed them to throw in earth

pacing is terrible  i have never played with a modern unit  first because theres an absolute end date that cannot be disabled so as soon as country x hits a certain point the clock starts ticking down  but the limited number of cities means a slow tech buildup so often the game is ending and ive barely gotten to coal power

pacing is terrible ii  advancement is in theory based on the actions and triumphs of your civ  in practice its the most aggressive civ  and once they start leapfrogging up to new more advanced civs the game is basically over  your medieval civ cannot compete or catch up with an early modern civ  the civs available are first come first serve meaning that the slower you gain your achievement stars the fewer and fewer civs youll have to chose from  the design favors a single superpower and if you aint it might as well hit the resign button

scale is borked ii unit scale is also unbalanced so fighting 5 ships that are one upgrade beyond your 6 ships means you sink one of theirs they sink all of yours  despite the computer telling you youre evenly matched  while the actual combat system is far better than civ the gap between upgrades renders it pointless

no minimap  really guys  one of the most basic ideas in gaming  you dont give me an easy way to navigate back to my empire   i have to pan pan pan pan out scroll scroll scrollis that me  no thats the mayascroll scroll there i am  pan pan pan pan down  tedious

who am i fighting now  ok im in combat withdoesnt say  no mouseover  just  guys with a weird symbol i dont recognize  rebels  angry barbarians  uhno


so all in all im underwhelmed  it kills time but it doesnt then eat it up like other 4x games  its not even as interesting as the other amplitude 4x games like endless legend  that was an innovative game this feels like a step backwards

now theres only been one dlc as of this writing and humankind may eventually do what civ v and vi did ok on release far better with two massive gamechanging dlcs  but as of this writing this is a solid meh buy it on sale

#####

longtime 4x player civ old world ck3 hoi endless stellaris etc to name a few 

in this state i would not recommend this to other 4x players 

this games bones are good but the execution and balancing of fame and war support needs serious work or modding you either snowball out of control in the classical era or you just lose to the ai because fame is cumulative and its extremely difficult to make inroads for instance a wonder gives the same fame in each era also the fame stars are much harder in each era too which means if you are behind you will stay behind there are catch up stars but you will not catch a run away civ at the same time it applies to other civs who are behind you 

hopefully mods or updates will help fix some silly balancing issues some civs in each era are straight up not as good as other ones 



#####

i would perhaps recommend this game in the future but not today ive played 3 full games now and by about the 150th turn or so in each game i just started to feel like every consecutive turn is just coasting until i can end the game

im just going to briefly mention a few of the aspects of this game that i feel are worth considering there are many reviews already that go into great depth so ill keep it light

religion  absolutely pointless the only reason i can see for this to exist in the game is because other games have it so they wanted to include it here also it just isnt implemented with any real meaning the only purpose it serves is to create grievances that you can bring up with your neighbors or create a small amount of disruption in converted cities that are not a part of your nation i suppose it also adds religious structures but that seems to be it there are no religious units or any form of religious warfare 

culture shifting  this is what interested me in the game to begin with and man is it weird you dont gradually shift to adopt aspects of other cultures throughout the ages neither do you craft your own culture what really happens is you just are something different every age used to be the goths last turn well now youre chinese nothing of the goths remains you cant even build their unique structures any longer once you choose to change

this is made way worse when its happening to every player and ai throughout the game its hard to keep track of who is who when theyre constantly called something different you start to identify players by their color and not their names which is a problem when your notifications refer to them by name and not color 

along with each culture choice you get a unique building and unit i havent noticed any major balancing issue with the units although i never really pursued a domination path because i found the combat to be tedious i did find that several of the buildings were way too powerful the japanese robotics lab is one of these i shifted to the japanese culture before the world had even invented steam trains and suddenly i can build robotics labs that granted a massive science boost i immediately shot past every other nation after this

all in all i think the culture choosing aspect of the game to be very poorly implemented it just feels abrupt and pointless besides being an interesting hook

combat  this one could go either way but im going to call in a negative for now combat is broken down to a light turnbased tactical format this is an interesting idea and one that has worked when implemented in other 4x games that ive played but here it just isnt very well balanced ranged units have a huge advantage in most cases including autoresolve scenarios you will often lost a fight even when you are given a 7580 chance to win if the enemy has a ranged unit and you do not 

ideological axis  this is a very cool idea but doesnt really seem to influence much as there are bonuses and negatives on each side of the axes depending on where you are at the time it does seem to change some choices you can make in the  events that pop up from time to time but by the middle to end of the game these events offer such minor rewards or consequences that it just doesnt matter its also annoying that the narrator chimes in every single time you hit the end of one of the axes with the same comment

pollution  this one is where it gets kind of obvious that it wasnt well thought out pollution in this game is global every source of pollution is added to a global ticker which when it reaches the max value ends the game this is not a good mechanic since the only real victory condition in this game is most victory points at the end wins so by creating structures that produce pollution which tend to also produce more industry science food etc you are improving your own chances of winning while also shortening the game there is no incentive to not produce pollution the ais have no built in logic to not do it either so they just spam pollution buildings it doesnt seem to cause other nations to be angry with you either which is the only real way i can think of making this mechanic even work at all pollution needs to be localized so that it impacts the person creating it instead of punishing others while actually rewarding you for doing it in the first place

i do like the idea that this game is built on and i think with some modifications it could be very good in the future but right now i just have no interest in playing another game of humankind maybe ill check back on this one in 6 months or so and see if things have changed

#####

so this game was promoted as a challenger to the civilization series
i will say that while this first iteration is not the challenger it possibly hoped to be its an insanely fun game regardless and i think that it needs sequels to really flesh out a lot of the concepts that are currently here

pros
 the narrative events honestly feel like a solid blend of civilization  crusader kings without dragging down the speed or vibe of the game
 starting in the neolithic era as an unga bunga tribe is honestly refreshing because unlike in civ i dont have to start in the same area i spawned its interesting to think of my tribe as having migrated north or west due to poor living conditions
 while im still pretty poor at combat the combat system in this game is a lot of fun because of how many units can get stacked into a battle and because of how civilizations give certain bonuses to units

cons
 still very rough around the edges with bugsglitches
 after a while the era advancement starts gets repetitive as a gameplay gimmick and the world could use more events
 some civilizations are clearly superior compared to others phoenicians kinda feel garbo ngl
 not enough north and south american indigenous cultures as normal civs like the inca and norte chico
 the independent people feel very bland i mean the inca and norte chico are 2 of them but they honestly dont feel any different than the other independent peoples the akkadians may as well be the tlaxcaltecs the etruscans may as well be the tamils they all just feel like the same random people just popping in and out
 ruins what is the point of these spaces just get rid of these altogether i hate building a city somewhere and having to spend like 40 turns clearing out ruins because some independent peoples happened to die out 100 years before i got there i get thats what would normally happen in a real world kinda deal but in terms of gameplay it just bogs things down
 needs more civics tbh theres only so many and the atheismirreligion one feels mostly useless once you figure out how to mass push your own religion

overall 7510 game i really enjoy it and i find myself wanting to play it a lot more than civilization that said it definitely doesnt beat out the civ series but with some more iterations hk could hopefully be a fun alternative that stands on its own rather than being forced to be compared to civ



#####

recommended but

compared to the obvious similar game everyone is familiar with

its plays quicker
its a little more abstract
it takes a while to wrap your head around
has the most complete set of embedded tutorial videos ive encountered in a game
overall is more playable than civ

but

for a aaa final release game though there are a lot of annoying but not game breaking issues not exactly bugs

for example
warning messages that i am about to be defeated by the english because my population war support against them is low
warning messages that i am about to be victorious against the english because their war support against me is low
war support on both sides is probably low because im allied to the english

when given e a choice ship captains will invariably decide to head into deep water and sink their ships  rather than stick to the coast and avoid damage even when the movement costs are the same land unit pathing is equally messed up in places but less likely to be obviously suicidal

3 of my 4 opponents are edgar allan poe since theres no check when randomly assigning characters for duplicates

in some circumstances left clicking will deselect a unit so you can select another in others left clicking will order the unit to move likewise right clicking

and so on

irritating and annoying rather than gamebreaking and multiple things that are quality of life issues more than anything else but it does tarnish the game release

hopefully theyll be sorted with future updates if you are on the fence about the game you are probably better off giving it couple of months for the final polishing that should ideally have happened before release

#####

has promise but dont buy it
wait a year or so for the major bugs to be fixed paying full price for this was a waste of money atm

#####

as you can tell from my hour count i love this game i love the concept i love the feel the look the aesthetic everything about it except the gameplay loop personally i play 4xs to hang out by myself i dont play multiplayer so keep that in mind 

the ai is bad just bad they barely maximize fims which is a bare minimum but it has no concept of strategic value they dont care about luxuries they dont care about landmarks and the decisions it makes about cultures is slightly baffling the answer that the difficulty modes introduce are adding buffs to the ais base game and late game but buffs do not increase the situational awareness of the ai  which is whats really missing 

diplomacy is still an afterthought even after together we rule and its kind of crazy that a game that is based on human history doesnt take into account the vast array of deals that have been made across human history vassal states have no options the alliances are incredibly straight forward there are no science trading treaties no trade only x good that being said together we rule was a massive step in the right direction and added a lot of balance and nuance to the end game without that expansion this game would be ass now its just okay  not great but okay 

but the biggest problem is production oh my god even prenerf egyptians into khmer cannot build all of the infrastructure and units and districts and wonders etc etc ad nauseum of constructibles that exist in this game and its infuriating to look at a city with a build queue of 100 turns when youre only 40 turns deep into the game for amplitude idk what the solution is i think the way old world deals with building things is interesting where worker units build districts so cities can focus on infrastructure and units idk but this system that exists feels awful 

all in all i cant say i hate this game but i definitely wont recommend it there are way better 4xs out on the market that being said i would love a humankind 2 where they take a lot of the community feedback theyve received and updated through free and dlc updates and put it into the base game there is magic in this game i know it but right now theres too much garbage to sift through to find it

#####

just over 40 hours in and its been pretty fun so far i would definitely recommend this game if its on sale especially if you like civilizations or civlike games but its hard to recommend it at full price

first off the pros its definitely a refreshing take on the civilizations formula especially with picking cultures as you advance through the eras the district system is also pretty cool as you can see your cities physically grow throughout the ages the combat system is also nice and it really makes me miss stacking more than 1 unit on a hex from the old civilizations games theres a max army size that grows with research to a max of 8 so you dont get the doom stacks like civ 3 and 4

now for the cons if youve played endless legend theres really not that much that sets this game apart besides the historical theme rather than scifi the combat system is very similar as is the districtexploitation system also the world feels very small especially when compared to civilizations if thats what you want out of a strategy game then itd be fine but i feel like even the huge map size is really small this is even more obvious after you max out your road research and a unit can zoom across a whole continent in 1 turn on the other hand ships move really slowly comparatively so while the oceans feel too big the continents feel too small also even though the era system is cool and you can craft a story for your own civilization it feels superficial at best since youre usually rushing to the next age in order to beat the ai to the best civilizations

also some of my biggest cons bugs i started playing this game over 3 years after it launched and ive had half a dozen save files get corrupted in some way after checking the forums and reddit it seems like these have been issues from the beginning that havent even been addressed also also a lot of turns from the very beginning to the later eras seem very empty i found myself just hitting end turn without doing anything very often it could just be because im playing on the slow settings but it would be nice if there was a big more to do between turns

again im having fun and it was worth the price at 75 off i definitely see myself continuing to play it in the future but once the next big game comes out i might uninstall it for good regardless of what dlcs come out

#####

ive played this game quite a lot on the highest difficulty since it came out  im not claiming to be the greatest player out there but i feel like ive gotten a good understanding of how to win by turning the strengths and weaknesses to my advantage 

the bad

the ai still makes really weird choices theyre usually pretty good up until the early modern era upon which they just kinda crash and burn this is consistently a problem with most recent 4x games  writing ai is hard and these games are large and complex enough that the devs would usually rather just focus on other areas of the game 

the balance isnt quite right especially in the later eras certain cultures are really powerful for their era and others give you essentially nothing for choosing them many building choices are also fairly weak or redundant this leads to games becoming samey past a certain skill level because the optimal choices in each scenario are far restricted from what they should be 

lots of game systems many of which are unintuitive i like the complexity of a lot of these systems but the game doesnt do a great job of explaining what goes on under the hood  and unlike civ a lot of these seemingly small optimizations can actually present huge obstacles to victory if left ignored the biggest culprit of this is stability which is both hugely important and woefully unexplained combat war resolution and pollution are other notable systems that i frequently see frustrating and confusing newer players just look at these other reviews for proof

not a lot of comeback potential i really like the idea of the fame system overall since it rewards you for diversifying and investing in a bunch of different aspects of your empire but it does usually mean that the optimal strategy is sitting in an era farming all the fame you can since the vast majority of fame comes from stars if you get ahead youll likely stay ahead and if you get seriously behind youre probably screwed there are more ways to earn fame in the late game like going to mars taking over continents etc but in a genre this snowbally id appreciate some more chances to catch up

the game also did have a ton of bugs on release though most have been fixed now i havent tried multiplayer recently but it was pretty unplayable back on release 

the good 

the fundamental design of this game is much much better than most 4x games a lot of the choices its made feel better from a gameplay and narrative perspective  the nomadic era is a stroke of genius the combat is incredibly deep and rewarding and the way cultures flow into each other is really intuitive and interesting the developers clearly put a lot of thought into making a next generation 4x game and it absolutely leaves civ in the dust with respect to its core design

the combat and war system in this game is brilliant if unintuitive once you do understand it its incredibly tight strategic and realistic having to justify wars to your populace by purposefully starting international incidents is some of the most fun ive had in these games and is a disturbing parallel to real life international politics 

the game is gorgeous ive heard a lot of complaints about this game but ive never heard anyone complain about how it looks ive never had performance issues with it either except in multiplayer although admittedly my computer is pretty good 

the game keeps improving its been a slow process but every patch introduces bugfixes balance updates and clarifications to systems it absolutely did release in a bad state and i dont blame some people for getting pissed off by that but the devs are putting in their due diligence and working hard to make the best game that they can this is the biggest plus for me it makes me excited for each patch and im so happy to see the game slowly improve into a better and better state

tldr

the game is unbalanced unintuitive and buggy it also has some of the best design in any 4x games ever released and is constantly working to polish itself until every aspect of its gameplay meets the high standards its set for itself if you can look past its flaws and stick it out for the long haul youll be rewarded

#####

needs a ton of work before i would recommend it many gameplay systems are halfbaked there are ridiculous weird gamebreaking bugs such as the 3rd ai always having total visibility with minor factions and completely broken resource generation that fails at big map sizes and the ai is awful doesnt use religion properly fails to manage its settlements

this game needs to back in the oven for a while

#####

i really want to like humankind the framework is there and you can feel the effort behind the artstyle and design but it just falls short in every category my particular gripe is the cultural progression the main gimmick of the game removes all of your unique cultural abilities and buildings that arent already constructed forcing you to put off moving on to the next culture until you  have a copy in each little province making the transition between cultures feel way to clunky the system should be overhauled dosent help that rather than address peoples concerns and fix the culture law or pollution systems amplitude just keeps churning out gimmick scenarios no one asked for wait for this game to be given workshop support and abandoned then someone will make it playable

#####

to be honest  its very fun game i dont get it why it has so many mixed reviews probably because its little bit different than civ

it was released too early and had a lot of issues now it is better i like it more than civ 6 but still civ 6 has more features after all those dlcs humankind feels like civ after first addon in terms of features

pros
 changing cultures to make combos works great
 spamming cities like in civ 6 is not viable tactic
 possibility to merge cities in one
 great combat system much more depth than in civ 6
 diplomacy works quite well in my opinion
 interesting cultures
 a lot of options when creating a game in my opinions map can be customized better than in civ
 resources are very important from the beggining
 i didnt have any game breaking bugs
 interesting chocies in social policies
 i like war score system it is not possible to take whole country in one war in most cases
 point system you can win by scoring points even if you are behind in science or military it is still possible to win if you play wise
 great music
 a lot of art work for example swordsman from greece will have different artwork than the same unit from asian culture

cons
 some civs are clearly better than the others
 pollution system is broken switched off by default
 there is no things like floods tornados volcano erruptions etc
 sometimes it feels like a race if you wanna obtain specific culture

if you are worried about mixed reviews give it a try it is worth it the best recommendation is that i played till 4th in the morning because i forgot about real world last time it happened in my childhood

#####

humankind is a game that could be amazing but right now is just very very fun until it becomes too tedious

i love exploring the world and coming up with strategies to get a leg up over the other nations but i find myself exhausted after my civilization has reached a certain point 

the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic creating your own civilization and following different paths during each era on the surface it creates massive replayability but maybe around turn 100 everything starts to feel more like work than a game

yoou manually choose every freaking structure and its placement on every city once you have three cities and production is ramped up and a bunch of army units every turn is a nightmare no automated building constantly building prompts juggling citizens civics outposts luxury goods clicking every army unit and telling it where to go and babysitting that it doesnt run into a random npc gets annoying add on the prompts that feel uncessesary like khaoria has gained 1 population and youll understand

it takes a lot of work to build up a defendable civ and raise a decent army but by the time you get there youre so exhausted that you want the game to be over with i feel like this is usually when the game forces me to slip and rush into something i know i probably shouldnt and losing a handful of army units isnt a big deal until you think of the amount of clicking waiting and leading the soldiers to their destionation again it will take 

this game is more fun than civ until you reach that point and after that point youre almost indifferent to making mistakes because restarting and playing the fun part in the beginning again sounds better than slogging through the amount of clicking that is probably necessary to continue the game

#####

if youre tired of how easy civ 6 is this game is for you the game is challenging and most systems in the game are more expansive than civ combat is fantastic changing cultures every era is engaging territory system makes it so there are no gaps between civilizations

however thats where the appreciation for this game ends if youre content with putting in 4050 hours in this game and never touching it again then get the game if you want any sort of lasting value look elsewhere upper difficulties make the above expansive systems extraordinarily laborious

war support system is phenomenally aggravating simultaneous turns means you never have the initiative ai cheats means youre on the defensive ai also exploits every system in their favor in ways that the player cannot the enemy ai is functionally unkillable trying to stamp out even one of them is like playing a tedious game of whackamole


edit i wrote the whiny above yesterday after ragequitting i was in the middle of a humankind difficulty the highest difficulty game and was getting consistently outwitted by my opponents

are there parts of the game that arent completely optimized yes however those issues wont pop up until you hit the highest difficulty i rage quit because it felt like i couldnt win i stuck with it today and won and the ai was being really really tenacious in hindsight i was playing on the highest difficulty so thats more to the credit of the ai than to its detriment

however the good parts of this game heavily outweigh the above now that i can come back to this with a clear mind the combat is extraordinary even in the most difficult situation theres always a way to win the game rewards you for being strategic and clever land battles reward strategic positioning with terrain naval battles are the best i have ever encountered in any strategy game  total war civilization hoi4  pale in comparison to the naval battles in this game aerial units are awesome and effect the battlefield without defining it

the dynamic culture system is engaging and fun  even at toplevel difficulties theres really no wrong choice with cultures theyre quite balanced the territory system is innovative if civ 7 doesnt have a similar territory system i will not be getting it diplomacy is adequate enabling the other parts of gameplay without being cumbersome

overall 910 would recommend i keep coming back to this game and civ 6 is boring in comparison now

#####

from playing around 10 games so far trying out different civilizations in each era and their different playstyles i can say that i do recommend this game and that it will only get better with time let me elaborate a little

hrhr
h1 the good h1

 b graphics bthe game is gorgeous i love looking at the map the units the cities and their districts and how over time they meld together with city walls to boot its a gorgeous game 

 b combat bthe combat is the best of any of the 4x strategy games imo when you attack units or siege a city you have the option to manually resolve it this puts the surrounding tiles and environment into the battle and there is a staging area where you deploy your units in your army then there are 3 attack rounds if the army isnt defeated within those 3 rounds then you end your turn and the battle continues next turn with another 3 rounds its amazing the strategies unit placement environments etc make this a fun 4x game for wars 

 b diplomacy  war support system b okay i will have another section under the strange for diplomacy as well but for the good part of this system it makes you feel as though you are leading people with views on the other nations around you grievances pop up when a nation refuses you trade trespasses in your territory attacks your units in neutral territory etc and when you demand these grievances be repaid in some way if the other party refuses it stays as an open demand and you build war support you need 80 war support to declare a formal war and personally this is very realistic to me and awesome when the other side loses battles cities and the war goal for the demands you had against them are completed then you force a surrender and get what your demands are and then some 

 b leader customization  civ choices b you can customize how your leader will look hair eyes tattoos scars not clothing though as that is determined by what civilization you pick for each era example if you choose the babylonian civ in the ancient era you will have culturallyrelated clothing from babylon also there are traits you can choose for your character as you play games and you can upload your character as an ai persona to games2gether where it can be downloaded and used by other players as enemy ai i thought that was so cool urlhttpswwwgames2gethercomamplitudestudioshumankindpersonas link to games2gether ai persona page url

 b population system for war b each time you build a unit it will take some amount of population from your cities so this makes you think of the opportunity cost a potential war will have if the war drags on you are going to lose population and set back your city development if you arent an agrarian type civilization i thought this replicates real life since military units arent made from thin air and were civilians before their tenure in the military 

hrhr
h1 the bad h1

 b pacing b the pacing is very off for this game there seems to always be some sort of bottleneck in something what i mean is if you choose a normal speed game with 300 turns and you dont focus on building science districts for example each time i did this i barely made it to the premodern era which is 2 eras behind contemporary so you dont even get to experience a little less than half the tech tree which is not good this can be fixed by devs with tweaks to costs in tech etc but this definitely needs their attention 

 b navy  naval units b they are almost completely useless they cost a lot to maintain they only really serve to discover new continents and potential expansion areas ive almost never done combat with naval units you cant siege cities from what ive played with navy units im not even sure you can use them as support for coastal land battles maybe i just havent focused on that but man i just dont think they need to be used there are aircraft carriers in the game unlocked via tech tree in contemporary era but i havent had enough experience with them and i will get to that in the next gripe navy needs to be bolstered and made more useful 

 b pollution b oh my god i hate this system and how it is right now it was added as a last minute addition to the game before release and because it was rushed i think it is terrible first off when you get to the industrial era you start getting into dirty industry think coal and stuff you build infrastructure in your cities that adds a certain amount of pollution to your makers quarters and as tech progresses it makes them pollute worse also railways and airports pollute as well now this sounds realistic right and you can decrease your output by planting trees and building wind mill infrastructure and nuclear energy infrastructure perfect but this doesnt decrease what total you have put out during the super dirty industrial era the system has a total mount in the top left corner of the ui how much pollution is bad dont know can i build something that will take away some pollution i put into the world nope and then if you pollute too much the game ends and i dont mean ends and then you can choose to continue playing i mean ends this is dumb i wanted to build a nuke but i cant now because the game is forcing me to end due to pollution i didnt get to experience the contemporary era to its fullest because of pollution this needs to be fixed bad please add some carbon capture tech that can remove pollution or just remake the system entirely or remove it until you have a better system

hrhr
h1 the strange h1 mainly a section of my personal why cant i do x thoughts

 b no fast unit movement on map b so there is a setting for faster combat movement which is awesome i love that but there is not one for fast unit movement in general like across tiles on the main map they just slowly chug along the map why cant i change it to instant or fast like i can with combat

 b no district planning map mechanics b so obviously districts are really important and the game does tell you whenever you select a district type where it thinks the best location is for it but why cant i preplan where i think i want my districts to layout something similar to map tacks in civ 6 that system is very well for planning and i think if we had a similar system planning would be more indepth 

 b no military strength or data to show how powerful your neighbors areb im trying to refrain from comparing this game to civ 6 because this shouldnt be compared but why cant i see how relatively even estimating how strong economically militarily scientifically a neighbor and civ is even a system similar to paradoxs hearts of iron 4 where you can see an estimated range of how many military units and population strength a nation has why not here 

hrhr
h1 my overall rating 75  10 h1
 i do think its worth the money i really have only a few gripes about the game as stated above this is the best civ contender out the community is really nice the devs are very active in forums on steam and on games2gether i have put in 42 hours and wanted to keep playing so many times so that is testament enough that it is good overall once they tweak and get the steam workshop ready this game will be even better and i cant wait to play more

edit 1 made the review more readable

this game is insanely frustrating it has the potential to be a brilliant 4x but after my third attempt to get back into it i really cant recommend it my biggest problem with it is the way war works in general the war support is a massive issue and every time i go to war even when i smash the enemy and do everything right the war is over too quick before i can get the cities i want this isnt like civ where you can just be at war for as long as your civ is happy it forcibly ends the war i know this is being fixed supposedly in the new bolivar patch but its honestly a feature that doesnt interest me and make wars of aggression just seem really nerfed and pointless the other thing is just the ai i play on the harder difficulties and the ai is the most brain dead frustrating thing to play against sometimes theyre easy as cake and others they are mind numbingly difficult when you happen to fight an ai that is aggressive they will constantly attack you the second your turn starts out of nowhere because you couldnt see them beyond the fog of war the game gives you a chance to move them but there is too much shit popping up on my screen informing me what i built the previous turn that i cant exit it fast enough to move my units into a favorable position the enemy then gets to go first because they attacked and they spam you with 8 units because they have 2 other armies nearby that are then allowed to join as reinforcements on the first turn that brings me to another feature that is completely broken reinforcements this removes any fun or challenge basically assuming both opponents are teched up equally and have an even sized army whoever attacks first wins even when it is in my favor and im able to attack first and call in a blob of reinforcements its so boring because you can just wipe everything before your turn is even over if you have a battle that could go either way depending on how you play it with the terrain the enemy can just  bring in reinforcements from 5 tiles away and just spams you with overwhelming numbers and because the ai cheats they always roll with 24 armies nearby each other so they can abuse this reinforcement feature ai attacks first calls in twice as many units as you have and wipes your army before you can even go i dont see why this feature is in the game why not just make army stacks bigger just seems like theyre reinventing the wheel war is such a big part of this game that i cant ignore these glaring mistakes ill do everything right in a humakind difficulty hardest setting game and get huge leads in my cities and science etc and all it takes is a bad roll of being next to a particularly aggressive ai and its all over i have spent dozens of hours playing only for that to happen multiple times i may try the game again once the bolivar update comes out but im honestly so burnt out from the bs that occurs just play civ 6 there is nothing here this game can offer that is better at the moment

#####

when this game was announced i had high hopes it would challenge sid meyers civilization games and possibly crush civilization 6 instead it did the exact opposite on almost everything i expected it to beat like allowing you to develop your culture and people instead you just do drastic changes between each milestone and it feels unnatural i always believed your culture and nation should reflect your starting point nearby resources terrain and neighboring nations and city states then develop over time based on how interact and grow your nation throughout the game it would feel more natural and would not require directly relating your nation to a historical nation like the romans egyptians americansetc but instead develop in their own unique way that could reflect similarities to historical nations but also allow for more flexibility in special buildings and units that would feel more natural to what you are experiencing in your current play through

#####

this game taught me to not preorder games again

#####

honestly can not recommend i want to but i cant i loved the concept and the differences from civ as a series and felt this would be a major game changer and it is but its also one of the most buggy games ive ever played even months later and they arent working on fixing them not to mention the balance is absolutely horrendous with some incredibly questionable choices i had faith in this game i even bought two copies of it but it has turned out to be an awful experience and they seem to have no intention of listening to their players and making the game playable

edit now that the dlc is coming out i have more to say uh major bad move overpriced and something that shouldnt be charged for at all considering now badly the game needs to be shaken up and its coming as a paid dlc for a quick cash grab and overpowered to high hell f that i thought these guys had standards

#####

this review was written on aug 21 2021 a few days after the release

as of right now the game includes multiple bugs including game breaking and softlocks that were found during the closed beta you can see them from the bug archives on their site but were not fixed so no matter how unique or interesting the game is i cannot recommend buying it at this time

humankind goes out of its way to be different from civ and succeeds by using some rather unique mechanics but it feels incomplete and give me a rather hurried feeling like a game released before it was completely ready considering the studio i expect to see multiple dlcs come out within a year with content that would complete the game

things unique to this game youre on a timer while playing a 4x everything you do should be aimed towards getting the only thing that matters in winning fame points changing who you play as per era is unique as well but it makes it so that you dont really feel like you have an identity narrative stories are cool but nobody will really choose choices based on the narrative outside of specific playthroughs

war i honestly am impressed by the war system it punishes you for playing defensively as it both wastes timeturns to get more fame and your war support if you declared an offensive war even in a defensive one the longer you waste time on the war without any gains theres still a chance where your war support tanks because youre not trying to end the war but the way it calculates warscore is a bit weird  if you win a war you cant take cities that youre not controlling but the ai does not seem to be under this constraint while it would make sense for the ai to declare a war over a cityoutpost and get it if they win the war there has been constant people posting that they could take much more based on war score alone

the ingame encyclopedia is completely useless as it does not explain any of the minor mechanics in the game it only has a description of the each eras civ and stuff thats explained in the tutorial chances are if you are looking through it for some mechanic that just happened or is happening you wont actually find what youre looking for

oh yes and balance this games balance is a bit to the weird side because some abilities combo much much much much stronger than everything else some civs are also stronger than others in each era and this is even considering that they have specific specialities theyre supposed to be good at

either way until many of the problems described above is fixed or changed i cant recommend the game as it is maybe give it a few more months to smooth over the problems ill come back to this review if and when they fix the major problems with the game

#####

more than 2 years since release now and the issues keep piling up faster than the fixes im pretty sure some of them have been around from the start
and then they sell dlcs all the time sometimes with elements drastically more powerful than the base games

such a brilliant concept and such a terrible product its a shame

#####

i have more than 94 hours in this gameway more not sure how that got calculated

the one thing that i realized as im getting older and older is that i care less and less about other peoples opinions the mixed review for this game makes me look back and think about how many potential gems i may have missed out on due to so many peoples crappy takes especially considering there are actually mixed games path of exile out on the market right now that genuinely do have mixed opinions but are rated much higher this doesnt even just account for video games i realized this when watching the show on netflix black summer and was taken back by how its a 62 or something on metacritic that show should have been much higher but im guessing twd fans didnt like it

the same way civ players im guessing dont like this game ive played civ 5 and minimally have played civ 6 you can see the short time i have played civ 6didnt really care for it not going to lie

this game to me is absolutely fun and a step in the right direction as far as how this genre should be going im not going to say its perfect its really not there are plenty of things that need to be tweaked

obviously there are bugs and have been bugs since the start of the game ive ran into maybe 2 that nearly bricked the playthrough but both times i figured out what was locking it up after reloading to a previous turn within 10 turns and managed to continue the playthrough 

there needs to be a rebalancing of some of the currencies and costs but i believe they just got updated in the new and already playable beta

some cultures do blow the others out of the park and on harder difficulties it does become a bit more difficult to not play the meta culture a lot of this seems to be changed as well in the current playable beta where many cultures just got buffed and seem more viable depending on what you specifically need for your playthrough on harder difficulties you will never be playing the same game

sure its similar to civ in some ways and not as intricate in some areas compared to civ but in other areas it just seems to blow civ out the park in terms of depth and the things that might not be as complicated as civ say trade routes for example seem more streamlined and id rather just have this version 

im guessing most people are not going to agree with me but frankly it just doesnt matter there was so much love put into this game from the quirks of your units and map all the way to the music which the music

the music is absolutely beautiful in this game the different scores range from minimalist and meditative where you are contemplating in a relaxing manner your next move loved it in earlier eras then from there range to an uppity score that seems to come on at the perfect time where youre itching for something to go down with your neighbors seems to come on right when you are getting the hang of things and are predicting potential moves quite a few turns ahead the music in this game really is incredible and i find myself humming the tune when not playing its definitely a big reason why i play for the long sessions that i have found myself playing lately  the only time i might feel where the music deters is when it changes from an incredible score to the battle score which while still good is not one of the masterclass scores and feels a bit intrusive when id prefer to have been listening to the one prior 

theres far too much that i like about this game and i really hope amplitude isnt disheartened by the large amount of crappy takes in this review section i truly hope they continue putting their heart and soul into this game just because the civtards dont like it doesnt mean that civ has to be the only game in the market there can be others and this one in my opinion just does it better

are you trying to get into a game like like civ aoe those old school browser based games like evony but are disappointed in the lack of scope try this game this is the 2022 version of what these styles of game should be

if you havent played any of those games but are into rpgs turn based control and domination style gameplay you should most definitely try this game

if you want a civ type game where the progression is fully realized by picking newer era cultures then you want to try this 

i loved evony loved aoe i know aoe4 is a thing i definitely enjoyed civ 5 to me this is the right progression for these type of games and if you disagree thats completely fine but this game deserves to be here it deserves to be in the conversation and im highly disappointed in the community for telling the developers that this games consumer response is mixed it shouldnt be mixed and we need to see this genre improve and move forward this game is trying its best to do that

#####

i really want to like this game 

but the ai has huge advantages over you even your own ai knows how to hone in on resources there is always one ai that seems to vassalise another

ontop of that the later years feel dull the game gets worse as you go along and your options get thinner it becomes quieter and certainly more boring everything drags down to a snails pace and youre simply just sitting there and waiting

i want to like this game i want to recommend it but i absolutely can not

#####

at this time i cannot recommend this game theres just too much that doesnt work well hopefully amplitude will fix the game over time and ill remove my review if they do

 the independent factions citystates are comically over powered and spawn far too frequently
 the fame score system is flawed and is a silly way to decide the winner and losers of a game
 the religion system is half baked
 endless turns are limited to 600 turns
 pollution is a global metric and the ai can ruin the entire game for you even if you try not to pollute
 theres a lack of configuration options for your starting map you cannot decide where you or others spawn for example you cannot set proper victory conditions because fame is the real score
 the war support system is not intuitive to put it politely
 the ai blatantly cheats you can tell the ai can see through the fog of war and in my opinion they spawn military units out of thin air you can see this blatant cheating if you put your scout units on autoexplore 
 builder cultures have a decided advantage over most other approaches try going egyptian  maya  etc and comparing to another culture its clearly the most powerful approach
 the ai is generally too hostile unwilling to engage in diplomacy and will aggressively settle on your borders despite having other options 
 the sarcastic narrators subtitles get in the way of menu items

the game isnt all bad like most amplitude games it thinks its more charming than it really is the music is well done the visuals are well done i think it needed 612 more months in the oven

#####

ok  so i had seen a lot of reviews so was approaching this with mixed feelings being a longtime civ player everything from civ through to civ vi i thought i had a clear understanding of the approach for this game

after about 5 hours of play i hated this game i was frustrated and seemed unable to achieve anything meaningful i was advancing through the ages but struggling economically and with my military

restart after restart trying to work out what i was doing wrong

then it clicked now i am 100 hours in and love it forget everything you learnt in civ because it is a very different creature each city you own grows and sprawls across the map generating bonuses and highlighting weaknesses battles become epic across multiple turns with three combat rounds in each turn this mechanic allows for reinforcements to arrive turning a possible defeat into a heroic victory if the battle is close enough to the city you can produce soldiers and get them to the front whilst the battle rages

each era comes with a set of civilisation templates that you can chose from  giving you a set of benefits unique building and unit for the duration of that era this also generates options as it can be more beneficial to remain in a lower era for a while due to the gain you are getting in some areas it also allows you to change you game style through the timeline  possibly moving from an aggressive militarist into a science genius or economical guru through your game

yes the ai can be pretty dumb yes the placement during battles and reinforcement spaces can be ridiculous but it doesnt stop it being a fun game 




#####

its an amplitude studios game so the following things apply as they do to literally every game that theyve made

1 its very shiny and pretty
but the gameplay mechanics suck
2 the audio is top notch
so you get to listen to something nice when you lose due to factors outside your control
3 it has a lot of game systems
but none of them work with other game systems its like 3 people made a game and glued their 3 games together


#####

i conquered the world and still came in 3rd place 

if the argument is about the fame points i really doubt anyone wouldnt have heard of my empire when everyone was conquered 

tactical combat is nice  i wish civ will have something similar in the future

this game can be better

#####

i have loved every single game that amplitude studios has put out since the first endless space game i thought that every game they produced had amazing insight onto the primary elements of game design and both endless legend and endless space 2 expanded upon those elements immensely they are my favorite strategy studio in the industry right now

which is why with a heavy heart i have to say 

their new game humankind is one of the worst 4x games ive played in many years

the game is an absolute hodgepodge of various concepts already explored with other games crammed into one while the idea isnt inherently a bad thing some of these concepts are meant to be balanced in their respective games and there are fundamental flaws with using them in humankind

take advancing your civilization for example this is not based on your research level this is based on the endless games design however instead of you being able to advance your civilization with resources your civilization can advance as soon as you hit certainly relatively simple goals the theory here is to improve upon the failings of endless space 2 where a lack of luxury resources means you are 100 going to lose the game thus people who dont invest in science or infrastructure are not left behind in humankind

the problem is that most of the time i had not even researched trains before i had reached the final modern era and i was leading the match in science pretty frequently youre supposed to be using coal power plants to power computers by that stage i was still riding on horseback and my enemies were using chariots

this is just par for the course with humankind every element of the game plays out this way  unbalanced untested and unfair most of the time i just put down a few outposts as quickly as possible make at least 3 cities with 3 outposts each and just outpace people on my continent as i bribe and fight my way into the good graces of the neutral factions getting full patronage of a minor civilization is so easy it can be done in 3 turns if you have more than 400 influence and 400 gold saved up  and just like in endless space 2 the first person who reaches full patronage has an unlimited amount of time to try and convert the civ even if they dont intend on ever doing so so thats another problem that wasnt fixed or improved upon

which is the ultimate problem with humankind instead of fixing the primary problems with traditional civilizationstyle 4x strategy games they take concepts from their own franchises mesh it together with a civ game throw in a couple of roadblock elements like needing to research the ability to add reinforcements to battles then just make it look pretty and put it out there

the science tree in humankind is a fucking joke as a lark i did not build a single science building in one of my matches and never had any researchers assigned because i had an unpopulated continent i founded 3 cities and converted 3 minor civs once i owned the entire continent i flooded the rest of the world with many dozens of armies and just zerg rushd my opponents to the point where i was able to ransack every single structure unopposed i just stopped that match easily a conquest victory in just over 200 turns in a 300 turn match

this game was a huge letdown which also makes me point out a massive glaring flaw in the way that digital game returns are handled  i had to invest 20 hours into the game just to be able to understand why i wasnt having fun with it requiring people play less than 2 hours of a game in order to make it eligible for a refund is just plain stupid if i could refund this game i would do so immediately a total mess an absolute shitshow at least the graphics are nice and you can turn your brain off and win

first off this is not civilization that should be made clear but it is obviously heavily inspired by it heres a breakdown of the big stuff

loves
  you can personalize your leader in a manner similar to the sims youre not stuck with a premade historical character
  you dont start off with a settler in the begnining you have to hunt  gather food before you can make a settlement this can take as long or as quick as you want you also can quickly grow an army this ways as you dont have to build them in your city you just hunt  gather also in the first couple of eras you battle bears woolly mammoths wolves etc  there arent any barbarian npcs until societies have started being established in later eras
  the terrain is just fantastic there is ocean fog that blocks vision based on where your army is falling snow on mountainstundras  forrested mountainsits all beautifully detailed  there are 2 different kinds of mountains the impassible kind thats similar with civ  the kind with cliffsledges you cant just go from a lower level to the top of a cliff you have to scout for paths around the mountain to get to the top this can be very beneficial but also annoying its beneficial in that you can have your city on a cliff protected from armies below but if youre own army is below  need to get back to your city it can take a while to get back there
  i personally love stacked armies  this game lets you have it but in limited amounts you have to research to expand your stack  you can mix your stack with different kinds of fighters too
  the battles are just perfect terrain can give you a clear advantage or disadvantage that i think was not as obvious in civ games  you can have up to 3 turns per battle per each playable game turn or if youre impatient you can just click a button  have an automatic outcome that is based on army size strengh elevation terrain etc  when youre seiging cities you can actually see their walls weaken  disintegrate after a hit  certain armies cannot pass the walls until there is a clear opening for them to pass through
  you can change your society to become another society as you advance through the eras you dont have to play as just one historical society throughout the entire game but you can if you chose to
  the city centers are also historically customized to match whatever society you are playing as at the time so earlier city centers can have an aztecegyptian look to them but if you advance to say england or china any city founded under those societies would have a city center to match that particular society while the aztecegyptianfounded city centers still look like they did since being founded
  landmarks are chosen in advance based on culture points  once a society chooses one another society cannot waste time or resources building the same landmark this is so incredible genius i cant believe civ never did this

mixed lovehate
founding cities
in the early eras you can see tiles that will have future unknown resources  you wont be able to settle on or utilize those tiles at all while that has its perks later in the game so you dont accidentally cover up a future resource like in civ i actually wish tiles were not designated as a future resource that you cant do anything with until you have made the discovery i want to be able to put a districtlandmark wherever i want  if it turns out that placement was actually severely detrimental in the future then oh well but again as much as i really dislike being blocked on certain tiles for many many turns it is actually a little nice that those resources are not blocked when theyre actually available
territories
love  the expansion mechanics is everything i wish civ would implement your city has its own territory but you can attached other territories that are touching borders to expand the settled city  then make administrative towns for those additionally attached sectors later on you can also add little hamlets to each sector so essentially each city can looks like its own country with a capitol  little towns but theyre still all under the same civilization or later in the game you can also absorb one settled city into another but i havent actually played with this option yet bc it is astronomically expensive basically if you have 2 founded cities you can pay for one to absorb the other but again i dont know specifics as i have not been able to afford this option yet
hate absolutely hatehatehate  from before youre able to even found your 1st city the map is completely divided into visible predesigned sectors with fixed borders so your city borders do not organically grow like they do in civ you found a city  it automatically has the preset borders that it will have for its entire existence unless you attached other predesigned fixed territories as described above i really really wish the developers would allow territories to grow organically while still be able to attach other districts to it as youre able to currently i really hate that the borders cant change except through attachments
specialty districts
for certain districts  all societyspecific specialty districts youre limited to only building one district per territory so if you have a city with no attached territiories you can only build that building once but if you have mulitple territories attached to the city you can build that specialty building one other time in each territory this is nice in that it makes things a little more realistic instead of just having 20 superdistricts in an area however on one of my randomly generated maps it was a medium island  atoll map  i was restricted to only building one harbor per district this was beyond frustrating trying to get units to move from island to island bc each territory would have multiple islands so many turns are wasted embarking from island to island when only one harbor is available on only one island i also had 2 atoll territories attached to my capitol city island but the atolls on the backside of the island had no harbor to use for the main island so i had to waste turns either going all the way around to the oppositeside harbor or wast turns embarking without a harbor i appreciate specialty buildings only being used once per territory but harbors should not be one of those especially on allisland maps
roads 
love that theyre automatically built between citiesdistricts it saves so much time not having to build workers to then build them
hate that i cannot chose where they go sometimes the roads dont go in the shortest path or cross a river  are thus rendered useless  cant be changed

hatehatehatehate
  you have a city cap for your society which is just so extremely dumb if you have a cap of say 2 cities but you found 3 4 or 5 you are penalized  the more cities you found beyond what youre allowed the more extreme youre penalized so much so that i actually lost my first game bc i didnt know that  was thousands of points negative this is just so dumb if you want 5 cities in the beginning you should be able to have 5 cities  not be penalized but note founded cities are still different from claimed territories which is a bleh tradeoff if you can only found 2 cities you can still at least claim other territories and attach them to a city if you want to but the city cap is just super dumb  made the first few games not enjoyable obviously i do enjoy this game but this one aspect is the tiniest fraction away from being a complete deal breaker please devs change this

bugs
my allies talk disparagingly to me when i contact them  my enemies praise me i think this should be switched

overall  buy it

#####

i really want to give this game a thumbs up i love the idea of the game mechanics they are really interesting and novel
but they are just a little bit dull

i gave it a really good chance 388 hrs but i just started losing interest

it has a long way to go before it beats any civ game

i feel really bad giving it a thumbs down but i just cant bring myself to recommend it to people
buy civ 6 instead sorry

#####

i have been with the game since before it came out i have held on so long to the initial excitement i had about this game 

now i will leave it and only return to it every so often as a novelty besides the fact that the narrator is the single most annoying feature in any game i have ever played and despite the fact that the game constantly preaches to me about the morality of the choices i am making as i supposedly tell my own storythe game has glaring gameplay and technical flaws the game is incredibly buggy even after all this time the new expansion is also buggy i just dont understand the decisions to develop new content when the content that is there needs work well i guess i do you do have to make money and i understand that thats why i continued to purchase the absolute garbage dlc that has been streaming out since launch optimistic that basic systems and bugs would get fixed but no and that is just the surface of the problems this game full of incredibly potential has i wouldnt play it unless you got it for free on a serious sale

#####

ill keep this short because the actions of the company are mostly the reason im not recommending

b timed events are bad b
there is no reason this game should have timed events it only drags down the quality of the game and causes new bugs and glitches every time they happen these timed events should be just converted into free content updates that dont require the player to complete some arbitrary challenge this is my main reason for not recommending humankind i could at least understand why they are doing this if there was some subscription service or season pass but there are none so im simply baffled as to why they are doing something that actively makes that community angry and the game worse off

the dlc for this game is simply not good not bad but less than okay im referring to the non music dlc it simply adds too little content for the asking price heck i would even go so far as to say that maybe it should have been a free update or combined with one or two other dlcs of equivalent size and then released for its current price of 9 us

aside from how the company is try to antagonize the player base the game is what i would consider to be above okay and barely touching good status they have a solid enough idea and some of the mechanics are to my liking but it needed some more time in development to iron out the bad and confusing designs and to add in some more good ones this game is unfortunately not a proper competitor to the civilization series hopefully someone else will get inspired by what is done right and make a great game while avoiding the failures and bad practices of this one

#####

hours in civ 5 600
hours in civ 6 2k

as someone who has been playing civ for almost a decade now i think humankind has absolutely nailed it they have a solved a lot of issues that civ has and have improved on many other aspects

i love how you get to chose a different culture as you progress through the eras whereas in civ youre stuck with one i think the diplomacy and the way wars are handled through international voting is brilliantly done if you declare war after the international vote says you shouldnt there are actually massive penalties and allies actually matter

one of the biggest issues i have with civ is that science seems to be the only real way to win religion is easily countered culture is countered with a few districts and buildings diplomacy can be stopped easily and basic walls and and army will prevent a domination victory unless you are severely behind in science science victory however is only countered by having more science sure you can try to kill them but they can simply turtle up and eventually win through superior units

another thing humankind does well is the immersion you periodically get to make decisions on how your empire will handle different situations which will have good or bad consequences based on what route you picked that combined with befriending or going to war with the other empires really feels like youre in a different world lastly the look of the game is sublime civ 6 is very cartoonish but humankind has a very realistic aesthetic that puts it leagues ahead of civ

i really love civ its a great game but humankind is just better

#####

if you are intending to play a civilization clone you will be disappointed if you evaluate it separately from civilization you will find a competent 4x with a unique gameplay mechanic and some unique scenarios i personally enjoy endless space 2 more but amplitude has created yet another fantastic game

#####

you can be forced to autosurrender wars with no alternative

i want to clarify this review  because its deeper than just losing a war 

the way diplomacy in this game works after the early modern era requires the participation of all cultures in the congress of humankind this is fine on its face but there is a mechanic for conflict resolution that requires that for a war to be legitimate that a majority of the representative powers leverage be on one side of any given issue

this means that war after a single player any player reaches the fourth era becomes impossible to wage in a primarily aiplayer game as soon as a surprise or otherwise illegal war is declared every other player gains a free grievance they can press on the offending party for people players who otherwise would have no stake in a war this means they can and in the case of the ai will immediately press that grievance as an international crisis players who otherwise have no just cause for war gain an immediate surge in war support and begin a ticking clock against whomever declared the original war

again on its face not necessarily inaccurate to how history has played out what follows is

inevitably these demands reach fruition and the vote happens an ultimatum is posted to the warmonger surrender your war or you declare war on me they will have lots of war support now interestingly the player warmongering will have generated none this means that in the twobutton situation they find themselves they will not have enough war support for option 2 as such  and against all record ever posed by humanity on this earth they can only surrender their war against a different unrelated power logically they will do this forfeit their lands money and claims

what a cool game want to wage war for a longdisputed piece of territory fuck yourself albania says no

i never in my lifetime thought i would long for the civ 5 ai just banning every luxury ever i didnt know how bad it could get im sorry sid

i get why they decided to do it this way mao zhedong fighting napoleon with war elephants in 1000bc was always a bit of a running joke in the old civ games so instead of playing a single civ from start to finish humankind has you switching to a different civ every time you advance to the next age 

the result is a complete sense of schizophrenia and alienation you start as egypt then turn into rome then become england korea then france meanwhile theyre all being led by the same blonde pale dude your avatar cosplaying and looking super outofplace half the time your cities are still called memphis thebes etc the architecture just bizarrely changes from egyptian to roman then suddenly east asian then suddenly european again theres absolutely no sense of consistency theme or ownership pretty soon youre just minmaxing the abstract game mechanics getting your numbers up and stomping the other nondescript schizophrenic cosplayers without any feeling of leading a people through history

meanwhile the same thing is happening with your neighbors you start next to harrappans ancient indians so youve gotten used to thinking of them as indians youre intuitively expecting an indian culture to be developing next to you but now theyre celts and now theyre suddenly something else the idiot on the other side is myceneanhunpolishaztecwhateverthehell you feel no sense of relatability or connection to the other civs because you dont even know how youre supposed to visualize them in your head pretty soon youre only killing them or ignoring them

ironically this approach also gives you less not more freedom want to play england nope wait until the middle ages want to play russia wait until the game is nearly over on the highest difficulty settings you also have to be mindful of the bonusesabilities each civ gives you which further restricts you to only a couple options that are actually viable in your situation

on that note humankind also sacrificed one of the main things that gave the old civ games so much of their personality  the cast of historical leaders you wont get to feel that gravitas and weight of dealing with alexander macedon chingis khan or lenin instead the aforementioned schizophrenic faceless cosplayers periodically disturb your minmaxing forcing you to remember who the hell theyre supposed to be during this particular fiveminute interval  

this is 180 degrees from the incredibly diverse flavorful factions in endless legend and endless space 2 where you really feel that youre playing a very distinct faction with its own special character and feeling surrounded by other interesting people amplitude rejected one of the main things that made their games so good 

the aesthetics also rub me the wrong way although i have the same complaint about civ 6 the avatars are fidgeting and grimacing like buzzfeed eunuchs not world leaders the art is happycampycolorful which forms a surreal backdrop to the war starvation industrial pollution and tyranny that is supposedly unfolding in front of you the game seems to struggle to take itself seriously which doesnt exactly help the player take it seriously

the underlying mechanics are mostly very solid amplitude knows what theyre doing as always theres a wellmade game somewhere underneath all that unfortunately thats not enough to salvage a game devoid of any immersion or sense of investment 

i have to make this a thumbs down because these problems cant be patched out or fixed with dlc im a big respecter of amplitude and it hurts like hell to criticize them but humankind doesnt live up to their previous games 

i apologize for being verbose



edit thanks a lot for sharing your views in the comments i wasnt really expecting this many people to read this review many people have raised some valid points that deserve a response

1 you didnt mention that you can transcend and stay with your civ you can also keep your transitions consistent and plausible
this is true and i shouldve mentioned this in the review unfortunately it doesnt solve many of the problems a your neighbors wont bother with consistency and will always be schizophrenics without identity b if you want to play for example a consistent chinese civilization but your opponents grab zhou first and then grab the mings first then you wont be playing china

2 why buy the game in the first place if you knew it has civhopping 
thats a valid question the answer is a i knew about it but i didnt realize how bad it would grate on me until i played the game for a while i suspect many people had the same feeling b i was expecting the transitions to be sensible gauls can become brits ancient china can branch off into koreans and japanese olmecs branch off into aztecs or mayans greeks into byzantines etc i wasnt quite ready for egyptians becoming japanese

3 but thats how history works
egyptians into japanese many folks fell into a false dichotomy between cultures stay the same and cultures transform suddenly dramatically and randomly  

reasonably historical cultural evolution was already modeled in most 4x games ideologicalreligious drift socioeconomic changes technological progress as well as people getting conquered assimilated colonized by others humankind adds a new dynamic  voluntarily and randomly reinventing your whole national identity complete with remodeling all your buildings and michael jacksoning your whole population into another ethnic group which as far as i know doesnt real thats why its so garish and immersionbreaking

4 its not sensible to compare humankind to civ theyre two different games
i completely agree im not concerned about maintaining civs canonical forms and i prefer many of humankinds game mechanics regardless my disappointment mostly comes from comparing humankind to endless legend and endless space 2 which are both amplitude games this really feels like a step back from both

#####

its not an outright bad game but imagine taking the ui of the excellent endless legend then stripping out everything fascinating from the deep worldbuilding and just leaving a sort of awkward civ clone and even then it basically clones beyond earth the worst civ game because theres no real differentiation due to how you choose a civilization every ageup 

theres a lot of really cool ideas and its interesting how the game suggests noncombat solutions but even civ has had that for a long time 

if you really like the idea of civ but have gotten bored of civ go play endless legend if you thought endless legend was too different and interesting try this one out

also you can turn the narrator off thankfully you should do that

#####

i do recommend this game its a solid 4x experience with a number of innovative design choices that are refreshing to interact with at least for a few playthroughs replayability seems to be a bit lacking for me though a few of the mechanics need some polish and improvement and there are a few bugs in the release version

the natural comparison people make is to the civilization games other than the historical setting and progressing through the ages they dont have much in common at all all of the equivalent mechanics in humankind are done very differently from city building to combat to game progression humankind compares more to endless legend and is an evolution of the mechanics introduced in that game

the city building is i think the highlight for me the game uses a mix of on the map districts and internal buildings similar to endless legend but throws in the concept of multiregion cities and oneperregion districts harbors hamlets and various culture specific districts can all be very powerful but only built one per region but you can have a city that covers 34 regions that can build one of each in each region placement is important as are adjacency bonuses this creates a very engaging city building process that i never found to get stale even hundreds of turns into a game

trading for resources is also done better than in any other 4x by miles its not really a diplomatic thing as it wouldnt be you dont ask the leader of the nation if you can have access to some copper in exchange for everything you own because they are stingy and you need it no you create a trade deal then you independently buy permanent access to whatever resources they have whenever you want at mostly fixed and reasonable prices you maintain access to that resource as long as you dont go to war with them more or less or until they themselves lose access to it having access doesnt remove access from the owner if i have 6 gem sources then every other empire in the game can buy access to those 6 gem sources from me i still maintain full bonuses from them and anyone that buys access gets full bonuses its genius

the low point of the game for me though is perhaps its most iconic feature the culture system as you age up in the game you pick new cultures with new bonuses in each era this is presented as sort of creating your own mix of cultures and a hybrid nation but its really not for the most part when you age up and pick a new culture that culture replaces your previous one entirely the name of your empire changes the appearance of your cities and units changes and you lose access to most of the bonuses provided by your previous culture you keep one generic empire buff and any culture specific districts you already built but cant build any more and your cultural unit quickly becomes obsolete i did not find this mechanic very fun and it kind of makes a mess of the game for example an ai you are interacting with might at one turn be the egyptians then a few turns later they are the celts then a while later they become the japanese its hard to keep track of and just not very immersive i dont see the other factions on the world with me as real empires because they dont make sense as such and cant be kept track of like that no i see them as the blue ai or the green ai because their empire color stays the same and they are clearly an ai player engaging in the same very gamey mechanics as you

the other issue the culture system creates is a lack of replayability you dont have distinct factions with unique meaningful gameplay styles you have a handful of choices to make throughout the game for what are mostly generic buffs that favor one of a few gameplay focuses expansion warfare economy science and diplomacy you can mix and match or you can try to stick with one focus playing a game with a diplomatic focus is very different from playing a game with an economic focus but once youve done each of those main classes each culture is basically marked as a class and each class has a special ability for as long as you maintain that class theres not much else i see to do other than just try it again in a different order this is going to be a bit subjective though if you are somebody who has a favorite faction in another 4x and can keep playing that game with that faction over and over you will probably be fine with this

i think the culture system can be fixed and it isnt a fatal flaw just the lowest point of an otherwise very solid title personally i think making the bonuses from a culture permanent maybe adding a few more bonuses to each meaningful ones and changing it so your empire name doesnt change when you pick a new culture would probably mostly solve the problems as well as adding new cultures later with dlc which im sure is coming

release bugs i didnt run into anything noticeable in my first playthrough on standard speed other than a memory leak that required me to restart the game after having it running for like 8 hours straight my second playthrough on endless speed i kind of broke the game by going super hard on money making apparently the game cant keep track of earnings over a playthrough above 2 million and it rolls over this resulted in me not being able to earn any fame for money in my final era it didnt break my economy or anything and was still fully playable just a bit disappointing to lose out on some extra fame i didnt really need anyway also ran into issues with loading saves where some graphics just get stuck and wont load for a while reloading a few times or waiting long enough fixes it the game date is also very wrong on normal speed the game ended for me at like 1800 ce with people doing space missions on endless speed i was in the modern era with electricity and stuff in 6000 bce just an amusing cosmetic issue thats all ive seen personally after 27 hours

all in all its a decent game and like i said i do recommend it i wouldnt call it amazing yet but i imagine there will be a few expansions to fill things out and add some additional mechanics to be clear i am also more a scififantasy 4x fan so to me just the fact thats its historical instead is knocking a few nonexistent points off this may have been a bit more of a glowing review if i was a historical game fan or perhaps i would have been more critical of other things

#####

how is it possible that the same studio that created endless space 2 made this game it falls short in practically every category imaginable every time i give it another chance i wish i hadnt thanks for listening to me vent

#####

i want to recommend this but its just not ready 

i dont mind the civ switching but theres too few options per era i like the idea of calling dibs on a wonder but 4 per era just is not adequate for anything theres no espionage mechanic whatsoever pollution is very poorly implemented and when facing the ai there is no option to continue a war or get the opponent to properly surrender their lands the influence mechanic is strange i get far too many grievances for oppressing my people from my neighbors whatever that means and 90 through a playthrough i still havent unlocked half the civics also shoutout to the one civic choice where picking either makes your entire religious progress irrelevant cool 

also diplomacy is just straight up nonexistent you can trade resources back and forth but you pay like 50 times the gold you receive theres no way to set prices on things you have a monopoly on you also cant set demands on other empires asside from minor ones

in summary the game seems to really not want to let you play it theres good ideas in here but theyre burried in balance issues and lack of variety some systems are undercooked and some systems are just obtuse also theres a painful lack of variety

#####

needs work not dlc

#####

i cant recommend a game that fixes its issues with dlcs

#####

the first 80 of any game is fantastic but once pollution become introduced it goes south  it is implemented extremely poorly and results in true endless games being impossible  really if a simple toggle was added to disable it entirely it would only improve the game

#####

i want to love this game i really do but it is simply infuriating

on top of some real polish and bug problems i actually spotted a 0 used instead of a o in one of the game menus and controls often glitch out

but it is the ingame combat that completely breaks any semblance of logic
have 5 armies in range of a battle no sorry but you have to fight a battle one army on one army
have a stack of units on a fortress tile sorry you dont get control of that tile in the battle because the ai is attacking another army
the attacker has an absolutely gigantic advantage in every battle also  as their ranged units will invariably take out your ranged units before they even get started
this would all be liveable if it wasnt for the fact that the ai cheats units in at a ridiculous rate ive won 5 battles in a row against an ai with just one city remaining and they immediately have 5 full stacks within one or two turns

the narration is fun the visuals are great and there are some wonderful ideas
but these issues make it a game that simply is not worth your time or money

#####

i just got base humankind on 80 sale for only 8 and for what i payed for it after all the updates its okay its generally more interesting and fun than reviews suggest it has flaws but i think many people look play and expect this game to be like civ its not civ and once you accept that reality the game becomes its own thing and you can respect what theyre trying to do with it i have over my many years of pc gaming played great games okay games and garbage games this is okay
 ive been a critic of humankind for a while but after playing it i can say now in september of 2023 the game is playable and if gotten on a decent sale worth it just be ready to accept that its not civ or old world 

but do be cautious with the full on expansion though i heard the new diplomacy and diplomatic units can be quite unfair and game breaking and not enjoyable but i cant really say about it since i only brought the basic game

i give it a 6710

#####

this game fills the gap that civ 6 left for me

the ui is generally much better than civ 6 not nearly as flat and hard to parse and the game is much smoother  new turns are incredibly quick these are the minor upsides surrounding the core gameplay

mechanically the game is much more interesting in the early eras  instead of starting out in the ancient era as a civ you start out in the neolithic era as a nomadic tribe and then you pick a civ and turn an outpost into a city and enter the ancient era this leads to much better starts and feels like a retroactively obvious advancement in the genre

the civics are much more in depth there are four axes of ideology with either end of each axis giving different bonuses city building has a lot more nuance to it with the districting and interacting with other empires is a lot more streamlined and fleshed out units and unit stacking is incredibly smooth and intuitive as well

the unaffiliated actors are all neutral generally animals and roaming mercenaries will generally not attack you unprovoked and you can always retreat away from battles you dont want to take battles themselves are also neat you deploy stacked units onto nearby tiles and then fight out multiple battle rounds in a single turn so most conflict resolves in one turn if you dont want to micromanage the fights you can let it run on auto though i feel this is a bit unoptimal but for most fights the difference is negligible generally the game is not very warhorny from what ive seen but combat is still generally very well fleshed out if you want to be a warmonger

theres also a peaceful modifier when selecting a difficulty level that affects ai aggression levels which is really nice if you want to just flesh out an empire and avoid conflict

overall its excellent and fills the gap in my heart ive had for a while the one thing i havent checked out is the netcode but it would be hard to be worse than desyncy civ netcode so im not too concerned than that

#####

this game has so much potential but just never manages to take full advantage from a mostly adequate but oddly buggy interface to weird graphical glitches to poorly laid out tutorials its all just a little off and its a real shame as i have played basically every amplitude game and genuinely think this was one of the ones with the most potential but also turned out to be one of their worst which when you consider the ai in endless legend is really saying a thing

#####

hate the whiplash of unconnected cultural progression and i despise the inability to pick cultural base from game start but instead race the ai to milestones where its a firstcomefirstserve notion so if youre too slow you dont get to play in the manner you wanted to i hate it

#####

long time 4x player   played every civ and endless spacelegend games

overall this game is ok  i dont enjoy this game as much as the endless series and this is nowhere close to civilization  

the gameplay feels random  the different cultures in each era actually creates less emotional investment in your society  random events random alliesenemies that continually change names  random incursions 

the ui looks slick but its really hard to get a sense of whats really going on in your civilization  it also lacks key information  also game movement is painfully slow and tedious  

on the positive side graphics are good   its a bright game and color palettes are well done  i like the fact that you claim  wonders  the concept of attaching territories to your city gives a good strategic option  the early game is fun fighting wildlife and founding outposts but yet another chance for randomness  you can easily find yourself stuck right next to multiple enemies or way off by yourself  

however the biggest problem is the stuck in turn pending bug  where the game remains in an endless loop and no amount of restoring previous saves fixes the problem    this is a showstopper  you simply have to architect your sw in a way that these things cannot happen

#####

i like to consider myself as a veteran in 4x and rts games eu4 stellaris civ vvi ck3
i really wanted this game to live up to what its claiming to offer but unfortunately the actual gameplay leaves much to be desired
the game is visually stunning and the war mechanics are one of the best im a big supporter of war exhaustion and war support but other mechanics such as religion and culture are too simple to be utilized in a fun and engaging manner

they did fix many of the problems since launch and the game atm is perfectly playable but replayability is rather limited i do come back to it from time to time hoping the devs would someday deliver this game to its full potential

#####

man i really really wanted to like this game i loved all other amplitude games i loved the way they took an innovative approach to making the factions actually different from one another i loved the fidsi and amplitude was selling this as being their magnum opus so i figured man this is gonna be awesome but its just lukewarm

so many of the things theyve done for this game are pretty cool ideas they just fall flat 

idk read the other reviews if you want real indepth analysis and maybe this game is just having growing pains but i cant recommend this in its current state much of the game is either empty or lacking content the decisions feel like theres always one correct decision so every playthrough feels the same and 80 of the game is managing stability because literally everything you do drops the stability of cities

i dont know where the devs went wrong but it feels unfinished

#####

first of all if you have xbox subscription dont buy on steam    having said that im happy to support the devs and own every single one of their previous games

im one of those crazy civ fanatics who has played since the og civ 1 yes im that old  in any case the reason im mentioning that other than to flex that ill likely die well before anyone else on this platform due to advanced age is that well this really isnt civ  think of it more as a civ  type board game has a lot of really cool depth but you do have to realize that the point is to collect vps not just get a cultural victory or swat everyone  

take it from an elderly civ veteran with more hours on civ that you likely have been alive  i give it 910 whippersnappers  



#####

i am in the minority of players who play turn based 4x games in a very particular way 

 i play on lower difficulties nothing above whats considered normaldefault
 i absolutely hate combat of all sort and avoid it like the plague
 i go as tall as possible on a limited number of cities
 i like to smash the next turn button and watch my color take over the map
 i love seeing the map visibly change as i go through the ages
 i live to minmax one specific resource and steamroll everything else with it
 i despise late game micromanaging

so basically i play 4xs without the last x exterminate and i think overall humankind gives me most of that

how it handles war is how i honestly wish most games turnbased 4x titles handled war it is extremely easy to defat an invader without taking a single city i absolutely hate how winning defensive wars in civ is pretty much impossible even if i had been playing as a peaceful power upto that point i am forced to send over a invasion force to stop the ai from pillaging everything 

humankind lets me win wars by just turtling behind forts and watching the enemy break themselves on my defenses till their war support hits 0 heck with the expansion i dont even need to do that  i can just spend my leverage to wikileaks my way to victory if its a bad enough loss i can also just vasalize them thereby removing them as a threat permanently without having to take over and micromanage their cities

i can go tall while still owning most of the map attaching territories to a single city feels so good and it also greatly reduces the amount of micromanagement id have to do late game compared to something like civ civ vi in particular feels terrible for players who love going tall  so humankind is only civlike game out there right now that really caters to this playstyle

not needing workers to build improvements is something i didnt really appreciate too much when playing endless legends but man does it feel good not having to order farmers around all over the place i miss the automated workers from civ v so much rip 

all of this boils down to needing less and less micromanagement  and superlate game i am basically doing nothing but clicking next turn and waiting for my win condition to pop either projects or whatever i need to do for the final stars  i always disable timed victory which is super lame and this is like the complete opposite of civ vi where even i am playing peacefully late game i have sooooooooo many decisions to make

every point ive made so far probably makes it sound like i like humankind more than civ vi  but i dont think thats accurate i have far more hours in civ vi and its a game i find myself returning to a lot more than humankind

i think mine and a lot of other peoples biggest issue is unfortunately humankinds biggest selling point  switching cultures every ageup when i play any sort of game i like to roleplay in rpgs i want to feel like a paladin when i am playing as a paladin when i am playing as doom guy i want to feel like a demon slaying monster when i am playing strategy games i want to be immersed into a specific factions playstyle aesthetics etc i just dont get that feel from humankind  i dont spend enough time with a specific culture to really feel a sense of attachment to it theyre good for a specific bonus and structure  but then the bonus evaporates when you ageup i dont really feel like i am playing as any historic cultural group  i feel like i am just picking numbers

i am overall happy with what humankind is  and i more than got my moneys worth out of it but if i didnt play 4x games the way most other people play them id probably be disappointed



#####

i hate to give this game a bad review because there is so much good stuff here first off its great to have a historical 4x game that has a different take than civilization i enjoy the attention paid to human diversity and the grand trends of history as opposed to the very great person focused take of civ these are both great but hk provides a very interesting foil to civ in this way the culture evolution system is another plus here it shows the evolution of people over time and provides more opportunities to make the biggest and most interesting choices of a 4x game the battle and territory systems are also standouts that i think reflect reality a little better than previous 4x games and make micro more interesting without increasing tedium all this said im giving this game a negative review because while its interesting and engaging at first the game really gets worse the more you play this is different from figuring the game out and starting to get bored it can take a long time to really understand how a 4x works  time in the hundreds of hours with some games  and thats a lot of the fun even more fun is when things finally click and you can force the game into the sometimes silly forms you imagine for it hk does not have this the yield and stability systems are not only unbalanced and lopsided they tend to force the player into specific repetitive playstyles balance in this genre is not important in the p2p sense where everything is equal but more so that different paths can lead to success different feedback loops should be possible to build a system that allows a path forward in hk if you dont build industry youre screwed with the latest patch nov 21 the nerf to industry actually makes the problem worse  now that industry is harder to come by its even more important making the path even more defined but to zoom out even further beyond the specific systems the game feels like it limits the player too much it takes too long to build things too long to move your units across the map too long to fill the map with your territories this takes too long in both turns and real time making even the early game drag on regular gamespeeds and difficulties its slow too compared to ai players who tend to make the same choices every game and shoot out ahead of the player this is again all worse since the patch since now the only viable playstyle builders  industry or lucky military starts is the only way to keep up im not a game designer so i dont have fixes for this  it might be a fundamental flaw of the game that has to wait for a sequel to fix amplitude is a great company with responsive teams that treat the community right and they put out an interesting take on this genre with patches and expansions this game might become a fantastic game but right now it just isnt fun to play

#####

i bought humankind at launch full price and i dont regret that at all ive very much enjoyed my time with it however in its current state i cant recommend buying it 

before i get into the pros and cons humankind isnt civ it plays like a more accessible endless legend mixed with rise of nations players expecting civ will be sorely disappointed 

pros
 beautiful humankind is beyond stunning aesthetically
 solid combat  combat is neat if unfinished the tactical map is engaging and unit variety is enough to keep things interesting 
o i like the flatter power curve even if it detracts from realism as it enhances playability
 exploration of historical elements not seen in games from britain or the us 
 interesting premise
 bite sized game time  games of humankind can be finished in a few hours which can be nice if you dont want to or have time to commit to the gaming version of war and peace

all in all the game was more than enough to scratch my 4x itch and keep me entertained for a few weeks

cons
incredibly imbalanced  combat system mechanics powers all aspects of the game swing wildly as if the humankind 
  didnt ever get a balance pass from qa  
missing key systems  
o naval sieges notoriously didnt make it into launch
o no alternatives for resource poor start locations
o religion more or less doesnt exist
o cultural influence is unimportant beyond a score marker
 humankind spends too little time in the early eras apart from the neolithic  game play is very much a sprint it really feels like they shouldnt have wasted time with the early eras at all if they were going to be so unimportant
game play is rushed  even on the maximum turn limit 600 the game feels forced you pick one tree really science is the only way to go since future unitsbuildings are so powerful clamber up it as fast as possible and will have functionally won 13 to 23 the way through the game

fundamentally this makes humankind an entertaining experience but unsatisfying and unless some major overhauls come in to smooth out the game play not just fix bugs i cant say in good conscience a person should buy it 


#####

when it comes down to it this game has a ton of potential and i really want to recommend it because it really is a fun game to play that is until you get to the end fame which is the ultimate way you win is a real buzzkill i played a game where i was able to destroy all of my opponents within the 300 turn limitalso a nuisance and i still lost the game because i didnt have to highest fame at the end even though i destroyed all other civs the second main issue i have with the game is that i can never get to the modern era before my 300 turns are up maybe i just suck one time i finally researched modern military units but i only had 30 turns left before the game ended it just feels rushed i know i can just keep playing after the 300 turns is up but whats the point maybe i am just pulling too much from my 30 years experience with civ but i am having a hard time hopefully mods will come out soon and fix some of these issues

#####

base game improvements that should have been released already are now part of a dlc 
make it free for old players at least

#####

jack of all concepts master of non

#####

unlike civilization this game forces you into a very narrow set of goals that you need to complete to advance toward the end of the game that turns  what is a very rich game experience into drudgery  youre always running out of food since there isnt an easy way to balance out a city so its population doesnt grow  plus you get nagged by the game if you let the population fluctuate up and down 

i also ran into a couple of what i think are significant bugs  one turn my cities are producing tons of food and population is growing and the next turn theyre hardly producing and people are starving the city is in expert mode so the population allocation shouldnt change from turn to turn  i also have one city where one farmer provides all the food needed an then some while another city the same size has 27 farmers and they cant produce enough  finally following a war where i forced my opponent to surrender i was unable to move my armies out of the territories i occupied but didnt retail as part of reparations the game just wouldnt allow them to move to any hex on the map  

id rather play civ v

#####

humankind contains some truly great ideas but unfortunately it isnt that good 

minor faction pirates and raiders will land on your shores in force and then disappear when you look away for a moment even though you didnt touch the turn button
the ui isnt good its very professionally presented but its missing critical information how big is my stability surplus  can i build this district without causing stability problems and sometimes popups will block you from seeing critical things behind them 

the random event popups are nonsense i got hit with a wild 30 penalty to every stat on every city for 20 turns because i refused to address global warming  in the renaissance era basically for every popup challenge pick whichever option sounds the most progressive and itll go fine 

religion barely has a presence in the game your religion is created automatically doesnt get a name and around era v it stops mattering and the game removes it why did they bother creating a system for it in the first place 

the real killer though is that the lategame is a mess there are hundreds of infrastructure buildings and by the modern era your starter cities will be lacking most of them despite producing 1000 prod per turn my capital still takes 2 turns to build a charcoal oven from the middle ages why while new cities get all of these infrastructure buildings for free 

and these problems are a shame because im not kidding when i say this game has great ideas civ desperately needs this kind of innovation 
i will say that it runs very fast compared to civ theres no lategame slowdown and when you click the end turn button it instantly becomes your turn again no matter what the game state is like i think the ai plans its moves while youre taking your own turn

#####

early impressions part way through first game as a veteran civ  amplitude player

what is it the game is a classic wholeplanet turn based 4x so what that means is youll be exploring a map building cities and units and spreading your people and your influence across the globe the core of the gameplay is about choosing what to build research and where to explore and what to fight over

tldr for me this game is different enough from the civilization franchise that it stands apart it innovates on the genre in ways that are interesting and enjoyable theres definitely room for improvement and the devs are active in getting feedback to do this as well as expansion of features faith and diplomacy feel quite undercooked in particular but then these systems normally are on new iterations of 4x games

i recommend this game if you enjoy the genre if youve played any amplitude games before youll very quickly grasp the economics and its historical setting compared to the usual scifi fantasy style of their games also means youll immediately understand how strong and how advanced everything is at a glance


more detail
it looks amazing there are so many touches that constantly impress about the visuals on the map theres a lot of attention to detail as well as a lot of information the downside with this kind of game is there is a lot of information to absorb so early on youll probably make decisions just to see what happens and figure out the impact of it later
the key with city building is that its in two parts you build districts outside your city by selecting tiles in territory connected to the city and improvements essentially buildings in your city that either give a straight bonus or improve certain types of terrain or districts

districts are excellent it highlights where you get the best bonuses gives you info on how these bonuses can stack and connect and theyre visually pretty clear
improvements are mostly the same however ones that improve your districts or terrain eg food from river tiles dont tell you how much you stand to gain in total except if there are 0 applicable tiles or districts it greys out the improvement

units and combat these are excellent there are a huge number of unique units in this game because of the way your empire will progress below and youll get access to one in each age as well as the usual infantryarchercavalry etc that you would expect combat takes place on the map but unlike similar games when armies clash you spread the units out and fight in a turn based skirmish with multiple battle turns per game turn early on this is usually enough to resolve a fight in a single game turn
theres also instant resolve which seemed fairly reliable for me to just deal with pointless skirmishes

one point ill mention here is that neutral potentially hostile units show up as a kind of pale teal colour and dont really flag if theyre going to be hostile or not so youre best off treating them as hostile until you know otherwise these come from spawning points and independent cities however as there are no settler or worker units to worry about like in civ games theyre not as much of a nuisance here

empires and who to play as unlike other games in both the genre and from the studio humankind has you pick a culture relevant to the technological age and each age you pick again you can retain your existing culture but will not gain access to an era appropriate unique unit or building it also feels like the culture bonus is a lot weaker as well going from raw bonuses to percentages that matter as you move through the game but you do get a score increase if you keep your existing culture for managing to stay in the game beyond the point that culture was historically relevant 

its mentioned elsewhere but this can be tricky to keep track of for the ai players as they can go from olmec to greek to aztec and the shift is an immediate one when they hit the new age so youll want to pay attention to their empire flag and colour as that remains constant their leader and yours remains the same just getting new threads when switching culture

another criticism is the diplomacy is buggy enemies can demand the same thing over and over forcing you to keep denying and giving them war score and tanking their opinion of you and you also seem to be restricted on what you can ask from them compared to what they can ask from you it also isnt as clear why you can or cant do certain things for example i still dont know why i could demand the olmecs just give me some of their territory but it was listed as a grievance so i demanded it and used it to justify a war im sure itll become clear but it could do more to help you understand the triggers of grievances and let you plan a little easier

i dont typically do reviews but i think that i should defineitly give this game a review so others can avoid my fate humankind is honestly a pretty good game it builds on a lot of what civ could do better and adds a lot of new features that i really like that being said however i wouldnt recommend buying it rn as it has lots and lots of bugs i have encountered multiple bugs throughout my play through and ive finally reached a bug where i cant resolve my war because all the options arent showing up upon investigating on the forums for the game where you can ask about certain bugs i saw that many players where running into situations like mine where some feature just goes wrong or the turn just wont end for no reason thus ending the run because the game cant go on i would give the game some time to fix all of the bugs appearing before thinking about purchasing it

#####

if youre coming into this game expecting a typical 4x and are going to negatively review it for not fitting the standard mold then dont waste your time this is not civ and those of us who actually enjoy the game and can play it at the highest difficulty get tired of the incessant whining here and on reddit about how its lacking features and mechanics that civ has that is by design for those who are actually interested in a different sort of challenge there is a lot more depth to this game than the negative reviews would lead you to believe

first off the religious game in particular is generally underrated the tenet system combines with the ability to convert to another religion and steal the religious leader role which is what determines who makes tenet selections for a religion in a way that makes religion far more dynamic than in civ moreover each of the different buffs provided by the various tenets across the 4 different levels has a viable use case where it synergizes well with a chosen culture progression also you can choose religions such as christianity islam judaism and zoroastrianism among others each of which comes with a unique event tree for additional flavour

second dont let anyone tell you that a culture is unplayable some in the community have gotten this idea in their heads that there is a strict meta to be played to be successful in this game but that is nonsense at the time of writing of this review there are currently 1916640 possible culture combinations in the base game and 12096000 with all dlc and no community content cultures thats a lot more opportunity for replayability than the 20 base game options and 67 with dlc that civ 6 offers this offers a plethora of opportunities for unique synergies that outclass a lot of the meta strategies exploring these possibilities is definitely part of the fun of this game

finally to avoid making this review too lengthy i want to end by addressing combat specifically you have to be mindful of terrain as many players dont understand that this is the reason behind the most common complaints this is not only due to the bonuses you can get from actions like defending in forests or fighting on high ground or the penalties for actions like attacking across rivers but also because terrain can block vision its not always immediately obvious when in the combat view that you dont have vision because of such obstacles as a forest or higher elevation tile between both your unit and the intended target also friendly units can block ranged attacks if between your unit and the intended target would you want to get caught in the crossfire of the friendly behind you and the enemy ahead there are units with specialities indirect fire and indirect shatter that allow them to avoid such issues however these are the generic archer ironclad and mortar units and the unique units of the medieval era english and taino cultures the longbowmen and baira hunters respectively if you find yourself frustrated by line of sight issues these are worth giving a try

#####

i dont really write reviews but heres mine

ive been playing since the day of release and have all updatesdlc you name it

i love this game
ive played various city builders civ and such through my time but i dont feel they compare to humankind
yes the ai is a bit mental but it is on most games
yes it can be intolerably slow on larger maps with more players
i feel the art and look of the game is better than any i have played before much better than civ
amazing time waster ive found myself playing for hours trying to meticulously plan my cities and positioning everything for the the future in the game if you are into planning and taking your time thoughtfully through a game this is for you
personally i find the replayability great no two games are the same especially if you mix your competitors and map structures
and its hard on higher difficulties you really do have to work and maximise your surroundings compared to civ 6 where wiping the floor with everyone on deity was childsplay

overall im not a writer nor a frequent reviewer but id share my thoughts on probably my favourite game at the moment if not ever
 
great game will play right up until humankind 2 highly recommend


#####

i like this game its definitely not as good as i hoped for when i preordered and it has some flaws but i still really like to play it sometimes i might even prefer it to civ 5

as to the flaws there are definitely some problems with bugs and loading times but as a fan of the civ games thats nothing new there should be more possible npc characters bc it gets boring seeing the same faces after 2 games and the regions should be smaller to make them feel more like actual regions and not an entire country worth of land each

but there are also some really great things about this game starting with the biggest point
the culture system it makes so much more sense to go from culture to culture when the era changes than to start with one culture to play from 4000 bc to the future like another game likes to do
i also like the religion system where you can choose a tenet for every level building your religion one step at a time
the way your civics and event decisions impact your ideologies and make you choose more unfortunate things to keep a resource help you get from a specific ideology is also well done
lastly the battle mechanic of actually fighting them within a turn and being able to use not very complicated tactics is easy enough to work in a quick flow and complicated enough to be special

if you like civilization but arent a civ purist i recommend this game to you

thanks for coming to my tedtalk

#####

the game has great potential but it is totally wasted

1 cultures are unbalanced
certain nations such as mughals or germans give boni that stack leading to extreme production in cities they are completely overpowered in comparison to other nations

2 pace
even on the slowest pace you are advancing way too fast the only thing in your building queue will be the special district of your culture there is not even time for producing units and fighting a war during the time you are preparing for a war your opponent will already have researched more modern units and beat you even militia from the next era is stronger than soldiers from the last

3 missiles
i build an icbm and it cannot even reach the neighboring island in addition you can only fire them at city centers did the devs consider that i might want to nuke an enemys army

4 bugs
i made peace with an enemy my units that were still in a battle disappeared they were in the units list they were just invisible

5 other
while the events make a difference in the beginning after a while they are not in line with the game state anymore the biggest project landing on mars gives you 1500 while your empire makes 10000 every turn anyway

#####

i do not get the hate this game has received

1 it is a great entry to the civtype games which we really do not have too many around considering it is 1st of its kind from the developer it is a great success theas have similarities but are not similar game system wise

2 the game is unfair and ai cheats  _all_ of these games the ai cheats _all_ of these games to beat the ai on harder difficulties one has to find a way to game the weaknesses of the ai which like in this one  is battle they even have difficulty options where the handicap is give _to the player_ and not the ai i do not get the hate

3 battle system yes  it could use a bit more tutorials for people who do not enjoy learning a game system by doing i do so i did not mind trial and error and looking why and how the system works first of all  it has great depth the lay of land rivers cliffs etc all have a really big impact on how the battle will end up also i have not come across a game before that allows you to win a battle but lose the war one can beat the opponents army to almost nothing but still lose the war due to losing the battle objective or wise versa people who are looking for simpler systems  just go play civ or any other game i find this really engaging and life like is is amazing they have managed to achieve such end results with such small system changes

4 the battle ai  tactical level it is in no way competitive strategic level it certainly seems way smarter even if it gets help i have had experiences where i sincerely felt that the ai did take note what type of units i was fielding and given time  would counter my build there were other times where i thought i would chase away scouts only to find out that they were backed up by 2 armies just behind the forward scout these kind of macro level tactical plays are tied very nicely together with the war system where retreating has a penalty but is sometimes necessary to pick a favorable engagement terrain and armies unless opponent manages to catch up with the retreat in which case you will be in trouble as the opponent gets to choose the angle of attack

all in all i really really enjoyed learning the game i only wish i had more friends that enjoy these type of games and that the play time would be shorter so we could play multiplayer way thumbs up and really hoping the devs did not get disheartened by the feedback and we will get another entry to the series

#####

tldr buy the game in a year or so when late game is more exciting it is based heavily on endless legend and didnt deliver on the legacy and uniqueness of cultures they are just a choice of buffs for a minmaxer



after 40 hours i have to say it is probably a thumbs down the midlate game is boring and the culture shifts are poorly implemented there doesnt seem to be much difference in playthroughs and it took me a long time to realise this learning the game was the usual steep learning curve that sucks you in longer than the refund time window the early game does feel exciting and new and the first few cultures give you a lead  but i either steam roller the ai if i minmax or lose badly if i rp anything pollution and global warming was also poorly implemented as there is no incentive not to use pollution or significant world effects balancing say loss in fertility with increased  buffs i find it all a shame because this game is based on many parts of the fun endless legends but it suited the setting more whereas here the marketing and sales pitch was cultural and human history based and i do not feel much attachment or difference depending on my cultures chosen i never got my head around why i should are about cultural conversion too and religion is pointless really

i would say save the time and find something else this game will come of age in a year or so 2022 if the developers invest in balance and late game content which i do believe they will do given their pedigree endless universe

ieffective playtime before review closer to the 30hour marki

in going historical and ditching traditional factions humankind cant quite rival the blooming personality of the endless games while some of its aspects  like diplomacy and ideologies  remain undercooked its approach to cultures does however offer more playstyle flexibility than its peers and advancing to a new era always feels like an event theres plenty to look after too while the gradual progress of technology is reflected both in warfare and peacetime as infrastructure welcomes the advent of railways and flight

although not all of its features are as fleshed out as they could be humankind does hit several sweet spots both in terms of combat and management having enough going on to push you to click that next turn button while it probably wont be a civ killer  not that it necessarily aims to be one  its clearly a game that historical 4x strategy fans looking for a different spin on the subgenres formula should definitely consider trying out at some point urlhttpswwwgamewatchercomreviewshumankindreview13291full reviewurl

#####

with the bolivar update i think humankind is finally moving into the polished state that it probably should have had at or shortly after launch the game mechanics are quite interesting and the presentation is gorgeous graphics music sounds etc 

humankind is a refreshing change from the stagnant civ series with civ6 being extremely dull imo the hk ai is also getting up there and the scaling bonuses keep the game interesting later in the timeline without overwhelming the player in the early eras 

definitely recommended now for anyone looking for a good civilization experience but tired of the same old same old from the civ franchise also note that some of the negative rating are simply because the game is not civ

#####

lots of great features and improvements on the endless legend design but like alot of the endless games the ai is poorly balanced and make the game a speedrun for the best cultures make them feel like upgrades and not actual cultures game is great with friends but playing against bots makes the game feel hollow in its core features and just another civlike game

#####

well i was loving this game was then i found poor design choices trump common sense i conquered a culture all their units and all their cities but i dont have enough warscore to take the last city so 3 times ive conquered it and had to give it back i dont even want the city i want to ransack it its just in my way but i cant game wont let me i report the issue on their discord and all i get is im playing it wrong why would any nation ever conquer another then just give it back why should i be forced to this makes a military conquering gamestyle pointless and ruins the game for me until this is fixed even though they say there is no problem to fix i cannot recommend this game its bad enough the flaw exists even worse how they responded to it

#####

at first the game is amazing it shows in the art how much love the developers put into the game and i genuinely enjoyed the first 50 hours and then comes the but the game is annoying it is extremely infuriating that even if you move to attack an ai army they get to be the attacker side because the ai will always have advantage in that regard 

bugs there are a lots of them during combat troops are hanging and not executing the orders soft locking you into the turn and forcing you to reload the save this happens at least 510 times a play through one other bug is when you are trying to reinforce your existing battle the ui shows the army can enter but in reality it cannot lost numerous of battles to this bug also ai is not following the rules of the player

for some reason javelin throwers get stronger as time goes on for the ai when you first meet them a lvl0 javelin thrower has 21 combat strength then in the next battle without any veterancy lvl up or anything its magically 23 combat strength and then the next combat they were 28 combat strengthbaseline again no veterancy included it would not even be possible 

balance issues holy fck dont even get me started when an ai on your continent chooses mongols on the highest difficulty 1 forgot its name this is an auto new game for me its just a bother
if you dont find iron in one of your territories on this difficulty and no ai is willing to trade it for you you basically lost on the spot prepare to be swordsman rushed by 4 different empires

if you choose swedes for last era you auto won the game youll get such a high amount of science late game techs will be 123 turns if you want to take a lot of territories early game you wont have enough influence for wonders magically the ai has a bigger territory multiple cities and at least a wonder played countless games where the ai in the second era had more than 10k victory pointsvs my 4k i just quit on the spot

#####

game has ultrawide monitor and pip support if anyone is wondering

#####

the replayability of this game isnt as good as i wanted it to be


stellar game but lots of balance issues especially if you want freedom in operating an empire to your liking without punishment

i know that long reviews make hearing input less magnetizing so ill do my best to get my point across

i started my first empire posttutorial assisted playthrough with a solid idea in my head of what culture and unique empire i wanted to build this empire was planned out in my head as followed
isolationist
sciencefocused
tall economy
neutral or better relations with all other empires avoid war

i was disappointed to see that the experience of this game forces you to use your modern knowledge of the modern real world to date to make decisions on how your empire should be built i realized there was an odd design to the creative decisions you are allowed to make which punishes you for not creating the ideal empire with modern knowledge versus a fictional alternate reality where in my case religion or nationalist ideals can reign supreme whilst respecting science the game gives you bigger buffs for example that is in the game choosing to ignore the salem witch trials versus giving into the mob 
in reality respecting the chaotic will of the mob would increase cooperativeness from the public which doesnt happen in the game but in the decision of officially pardoning the witches leaves you with a larger benefit with zero lashback

how this ties into the issues of how this conflicts with the freedom of wanting to craft my initially outlined empire is that i would have a policy decision placed in front of me which allows me to choose between an isolationist or globalist point of view great of course i can move closer towards isolationist here i would assess in my head low and behold the independent decision thats best for my empire is almost always globalist 

the way humankind does this is by making isolationist benefits focused on military stats such as greater attack dmg per mele unit except the globalist choice would increase your market value by 25 of course i will choose what benefits my economy versus a superficial temporary fight with another empire thus my empire naturally drifts towards a globalist identity 

if you did any arrangement of playthoughs of unique ideas of what empire you wanted to create throughout history sadly the minmaxing of the truly smart choices force you to make the same decisions every time i want to be able to have fun with experimenting how to make the ottoman empire survive to modern day but this game not only makes it hard for you to want to do that it punishes you 

if anything this longwinded review serves as a msg for the devs of this game thanks for hearing me out its fun but the replayability isnt ideal

cheers
gc


#####

its pretty good not quite a civ killer but got a lot to love here districts and urban sprawl are good combat is some of the best ive seen in a 4x game excluding the total war games if you count those events make the game feel more alive and random and the way civics are unlocked based on the things you do and choices rather than just having enough culture to spend makes it feel better and prevents you from being an autocraticcapitalistcommunistrepublic or similar i especially love the cultural evolution which while not perfect does allow you to create something unique whose cultural bonuses are useful throughout the game not just for an era or two it can be a little jarring going from harrapansceltsummayadsjapanese but it feels better than just saying from the neolithic to the information era you are queen victoria specifically leading industrial era britain specifically with industrial era britain specific units infrastructure and culture

the game can be a bit bad at explaining itself even after reading the entire ingame wiki there were some things that came up where the concept had never been explained or even seem to be present in said wiki
it also lacks some diplomatic options id like to have seen though i am writing this without having the together we rule dlc so that may fix some of these problems theres seemingly no warmonger type penalties for anyone outside of the war  theres penalties for the relationship with the player you went to war with and war support is quite a fun system imo  but there seem to be no penalties for being a warmonger unless other players like the player youre warmongering against and it just feels like maybe real people care a bit if youre violently conquering other people even if you personally dont care all that much about the people being conquered

additionally the game has minor civilizations citystates but they feel a bit samey unlike civ6 citystates or even minor factions in endless legend or endless space which would grant you small but permanent modifiers based on the faction when you assimilated them in this they have personalities of a sort but you get the same set of choices for how to interact with them for all of them culminating in either absorbing their city into your empire which you could do a lot faster and easier by just conquering them especially since they tend not to buildupgrade their units  fortifications or in turning them into a client state which gives you some nice perks without adding to your city count unfortunately theres no way to really keep them protected in this case other than preemptively attacking everyone who comes close or keeping your borders closed and surrounding them since they are generally weak enough that you and the ai can conquer them in one turn while you get a grievance for having a friendly citystate be attacked it seems to be the same grievance regardless of if theyre just letting you buy their resources or if theyre your client state and all it lets you do is demand money from the aggressor if you go to war in retaliation there seems to be no option to directly liberate the minor civ only to indirectly create a new minor civ in that territory and start your relations nearly from scratch 

that being said these are my only real gripes with the game it is overall a pretty fun time and a nicely different approach to the earthbased 4x genre if you liked the endless 4x games this will scratch a similar itch

#####

i dont get a lot of the hate towards this game it definitely has its flaws but i find it to be much more engaging than other games of this genre like civ i especially like how you can change your culture in each era making the game play feel a lot more fluid and interesting for example in civ you only ever get one special unit and once the era of that unit has passed its useless however humankind gives you units that stay with the era of the game meaning you almost never have outdated special units
further i think the ability of changing cultures mid game allows for more fluid game play when it comes to strategy if you know youre about to go on a war rampage you can pick a culture with a militaristic focus if you need more population you can pick an agricultural culture i find this to be far more entertaining than games like civ as civ generally locks you into a certain play style aka you wouldnt pick egypt or korea for conquest in civ but you very well could in humankind as a way to beef yourself up before your war era
anyways this is probably my favorite game of this sort of genre and i would encourage those of yall who dislike it to give it a chance yay

#####

i was waiting for this game for a long time ive preordered humankind and played its opendevs the game was supposed to come out earlier but the release was delayed it annoyed me a bit but id rather play a finished game then a mess with a ton of bugs and guess what yes it is a mess even though it was delayed
im not writing this review to tell that this game is trash but to point out things that need to be fixed
id like to play this game i really do but i simply cant and here are the reasons why

1 u constant desyncs u whenever i go into multiplayer with my friends the sync is terrible the game cant handle 3 turns without loosing the synchronization so i dont even know if all the following things im going to tell about are due to this or just bugs changing the host doesnt help at all and everybody i played with had this problem even without me in the game or someone else which means that it doesnt depend on who is in the game
2 u turns not ending u yep every player in the game can have end turn button pressed but the turn just wont end and the host will have to load up an autosave to continue
3 u stuck in fights u the orders you have given to the unit wont be completed or the ai wont finish their turn or the units wont move this happens not that often but when it does youll have to load up the save again
4 u dead end spawns u sometimes even in default game presets you may spawn on a continent divided from the rest of it by impassable mountains the only way to get across is to swim but in earlier eras you cant do that without the research so youre isolated from the rest of the world have nothing to explore and nowhere to expand and thanks to that loosing automatically in the long run you just wont have enough to catch up with the players who got usual spawns
5 u civics not spawning u an interesting game mechanic with you choosing your states development path just turned off for me for some reason i do see that i should be getting a civic in a few turns but it never happens even the basic ones for which you need to simply found a city just dont happen they did spawn before but i have no idea what happened and now theres none for the last 3 or more games when at the same time everybody around are picking theirs
6 u badly balanced stuff u the height advantage makes your trash unit almost untouchable to the same type of unit below some emblematic units are way stronger than others and its just too obvious
7 u the bots in the lobby are not locked for some reason u after loading the game you played before the bots will always be different from the ones you picked which means different behavior patterns and different bonuses for example the bot that loved to trade is substituted with the one that loves wars and here you go  your friendly neighbor stabs you in the back when youre least expecting it
8 u the difference between difficulties u playing on nation seems too easy because as soon as you wipe out 1 ai which is rather easy youre pretty much unstoppable and no one else poses a threat to you but if you go up the difficulty by 1 from nation not only the ai now never wants to be friends with you but they also claim all the wonders and take all the interesting civilizations before you can even do anything not to mention that they will try to attack you all the time instead of destroying each other youll never be the 1st if the bot who is 1 not on the same continent with you so you can wipe them out as fast as you can and snowball yourself
9 u bad players interaction mechanics u yes you can create alliances but they give nothing to help you cooperate with another player all youre getting is some mutual buffs and info there are no cooperative wars or peace deals when at war with another player your alliances give you nothing if two members of the alliance are at war with the same enemy they each have their own separate war and by the time one of the players finishes it and makes the enemy surrender the other one may be loosing and you cant help them at all
10 u not being able to raze the city normally u if youve got a city you never wanted to destroy it youll have to ransack it great right no downgrade into outpost no raze order in the construction queue just plunder your own city with your troops and this is the only way

right now these are the main issues which are keeping me from enjoying the game it can be a beautiful one but theres so much wrong with it hope it will improve and ill have my fun with it but for now ill have to put it aside

#####

i have put up with a lot from this game since i started playing it in early access but i really thought the developers had learned from their mistakes and improved it then i was forced to surrender 3 of my territories to an enemy i was soundly beating without any option to refute it just like that i was punished for trying to play the game with perfectly reasonable strategies which has been a recurring theme with this game since the beginning having to fight almost every battle on the defensive because the ai gets to move to attack you on your own turn diplomacy being basically random half the time constantly being hamstringed by toohigh industry costs for districts that tank your stability too fast to keep up with your tech progression so much promise and it just fails to land time and time again a real disappointment that i just cant keep investing in

#####

this would be far better than civ 5 if the dev team focused on fixing the bugs in the original game rather than pumping out dlcs while there are options to change the victory setting the game will always end once a civ reaches all techs or launches to mars which makes domination type scenarios impossible this also means that the late game is rarely seen as most civs reach late techs by the 1600s even on slow game play not to mention the constant freezing and glitches you enter a battle scenario this game has a lot of potential is definitely a step up from the civilization series however it seems that the dev team has completely gave up on trying to fix the original game in order to pump out additional content

#####

i will base this review on what was advertised

quotehumankind is a historical strategy game where youll be rewriting the entire narrative of human history and combining cultures to create a civilization thats as unique as you are
quote


you do not rewrite anything in history you simply pick bonuses from a list that best benefit you with little to no effect on earth or the people inhabiting it america will still exist

you never create a civilization you select civilizations to become every arbitrary era

quotecombine up to 60 historical cultures as you lead your people from the ancient to the modern age from humble origins as a neolithic tribe transition to the ancient era as the babylonians become the classical era mayans the medieval umayyads the early modern era british and so on each culture will add its own special gameplay layer leading to nearendless outcomesquote

this is sort of accurate  you combine up to 6 historical cultures but combining them really doesnt do anything special and you will simply select them based on what you need at the time  when you become english it doesnt matter what you were beforehand it will still play exactly the same you just might have one or two special units that belong to other cultures and stick out like sore thumbs

quoteface historical events take impactful moral decisions and make scientific breakthroughsquote

not really  you will get the same popups every game and if you waver from the right choice you will be punished  yes the right choice according to the game is pro communism and super woke  and even then nothing really matter for more than a handful of turns



quotediscover the natural wonders of the world or build the most remarkable creations of humankind each game element is historically authentic combine them to build your own vision of the worldquote

you will indeed build historical wonders and come across world wonders  world wonders do basically nothing barring finding them first  world wonders are overpowered and will have you destroying anyone who did not invest in industry

quotethe journey matters more than destination fame is a new and unifying victory condition every great deed you accomplish every moral choice you make every battle won will build your fame and leave a lasting impact on the world the player with the most fame will win the game will you be the one to leave the deepest mark on the worldquote

fame is just score from other 4x games and it determines who wins in x tunrs which cannot be disbaled  fame does not leave a lasting mark on the world and has nothing to do with anything other than being a score  the journey does not matter the destination of most fame is all that matters  just like it does not matter what civ you pick or what you do to get fame  just get that fame  i stopped picking civs and started only caring about which type of civ it was as that is all that mattered

quoteeach battle in humankind plays out like a mini turnbased board game on top of the actual world map unstack your armies and command each of your units including the emblematic units of your culture and their special abilities construct siege weapons to besiege and occupy cities fight in large battles spanning multiple turns and dont hesitate to bring in reinforcementsquote

the combat is accurately described  however i would say just instant resolve manual battle is never worth it

quotein humankind youll be playing the leader of your society as an avatar that you create and customize quote

the avatar you make will be your leader  you can only make one  customization is ok for a 4x game i guess it also feels a bit bland and all the characters kind of look identical

quote your avatar will evolve visually over the course of the game as your civilization developsquote

they change clothing based on the selected civilization  that is all

quote youll also be able to level up your leader via a metaprogression system to unlock custom looks that you can showoff to strangers and friends alike in multiplayer matches up to 8 playersquote

i have not unlocked any hidden looks but you can customize an ai for your leader that your friends can play against  you cannot make custom leaders to play against though which makes no sense




all in all humankind was a massive disappoinment and sadly i would have to not recommend it at this time  hopefully mods and or dlc can fix the massive glaring issues that the game has

edit 8182021
after writing the review i have been unable to start a game  it simply crashes at loading map  this is the first bug i have encountered

#####

ive spent 94 hours wishing i was playing a different game sucked in by the possibility of a better civilization game something more fluid and in depth its extraordinarily shallow it doesnt feel rewarding and campaigns feel very rushed

#####

who needs the multiplayer where you cant play in team with friends against ai or human enemies
it was a nice idea before release and 2 years of hopes after 
nothing changed

#####

a nice take on the 4x genre fans of the genre especially those looking for a civ fix will enjoy it in particular the idea of evolving and synthesizing cultures through the ages is refreshing the diplomacy is more enjoyable than civ  the ai does not expect insanely unbalanced deals to work and in general there are more benefits to diplomatic recourse the more microtactical nature of combat can be really great for outsmarting the computer sidenote autoresolve is usually total crap 

ive gotten a solid 60 hours out of this game at the time of writing this review and i expect to play it more in the future that said i think something about the game becomes quickly repetitive despite all the new angles it introduces and explores in the 4x framework it feels as if the game forces you into a specific rhythm namely conquest is the only reliable way to secure victory now it could be that i have not gotten the hang of the other win conditions but after playing probably half a dozen games to completion i am finding myself rinsing and repeating a little 

overall though this game is worth picking for strategy lovers and civ fans it contributes some unique perspectives on the genre that other franchises would do well to learn from the mechanics seem to limit replayability but the large number of possible cultural combinations offsets this enough to provide dozens if not hundreds of hours of gameplay

#####

im thumbing it down for five principal reasons listed in order of priority

1 the games purported strength  the mix and match of cultures to create a custom civilisation  is also its greatest weakness in comparable games like civilisation you pick a civ  like the romans or the japanese or whatever  and you play as them you become attached to them  you have this anchor point through the ages and it grounds you you become invested in this culture with humankind  you get this melting pot which is all very diverse and what not but the result is this mess of cultures with no real identity so you float around through the ages switching cultures multiple times in a game and its jarring and forced and it makes the whole affair boring because you arent invested everything seems a hodge podge of nothing

2 the combat i like that they tried to do something different but execution is just tedious combat as it stands is boring and most people will just auto resolve which is a shame because they could have done something fun with it to enhance the game rather than detract from it

3 the ai leaders in civ you face off against iconic historical figures that bring gravitas and a deep connection with their respective cultures julius caesar of the romans cleopatra of the egyptians alexander of the greeks shaka of the zulus these figures are so entwined with the cultural identity of their nations that there is no mistaking them when they appear on the scene humankind largely does away with this and i can see why  with the mix and match culture approach it would look silly to see julius caesar of the chinese or cleopatra of the celts but whats humankinds alternative a bunch of random nobodies these characters are completely without charm connection or most importantly  a sense of history in fairness i do like the ability for the player to generate their own character  thats cool but the rest of the approach with the other leaders is really bland and uninspiring 

4 the narrator in civ you get a voice that relates timeless wisdom as things happen usually scientific discoveries with quotes from history that give the proceedings a sense of grandeur in humankind you get what sounds like a smug chap trying to be funny and offering smarmy remarks which again is jarring and detracts from the overall vision of the game which is striving for something grand and epic plus the narrator all too often seems to weave in subtle political messaging which suggest the devs have opinions on what is the right policy choices rather than leaving this up to the player this can be irritating 

5 obtuse and dubious game systems humankind has a number of overlapping systems which on the surface are quite appealing you have narrative style events in which you are asked to make decisions social policies to enact religion to nurture etc the problem seems to be that these systems appear as if they dont really have any impact on the game  certainly not easily identifiable you can ignore the social policies for example and not really notice any difference religion as a force in the game world seems tacked on and without substance so these elements all operate in the same space  you are asked to notice stuff happening across these systems from turn to turn but they dont seem refined or connected in any meaningful way which again makes you wonder whats the point

these factors tip it from an ok 4x experience to one that i feel as if i wasted 90 aud on and found out too late to refund ill persevere with it for a while to try and get my moneys worth but meh its not the civ killer it is trying to be

update i submitted a request for a refund and steam has supported it good outcome

#####

there are some things that civ does better the biggest imo being how cities are placed in civ you can place them anywhere aslong as it isnt too close to another city while in humankind they can only be placed based on region but in most other aspects this game does it better but in terms of city placement rules i gotta hand it to civ

population and city development is generally done better so is combat but

my biggest complaint with humankind is the lack of custom cultures and cultural progression it would have been nice to forge your own path through history rather than relying on preexisting presets based on real life civilizations this could allow the player to take a serious rp route or a silly route

but other than that i am having a wonderful time but the 2 things i would change are

adaptive cultures allow the player and ai to pick from presets but generally promote or bias towards creating your own culture group and only allow you to go from a culture to another similar culture rather than suddenly going from being roman to chinese with the exception being changing to a horde type civ like the mongols or huns and in the case of customprocedural cultures you could only be limited to small changes unless a major event happens revolution new ideology cataclysmic defeat at the hands of another empire collapse then you can make significant changes such as going from dynastic china to communist china or republic of toonyville republic to the toonyville state fascist and the type of major event that happens determining what path you can go down such as a massive worker revolt in the industrial era allowing you to either go communist fascist or crush the revolt and go your own way at an extra cost as in going communist would have no penalty other than the effects of communism going fascist would have a slight cost plus the effects of fascism or crushing the revolt at great cost but giving you the freedom to choose for yourself the type of major event impacting what options you are given and the cost for each

then the other part i would change is city placement and territory mechanics instead of having destinct regions each outpost and city could have a sphere of influence that depends on local geography and how big the settlement iswhat type of settlement it is meaning placing a city on an open plain will exert a massive sphere of influence while placing an outpost on a plataue or inbetween mountains will have a minimal sphere of influence this would add in alot of strategy when it comes to city and outpost placement and would make borders and territorial aquisition alot more fluid and natural

then an added idea which fits with the custom cultures and procedural cultures procedural referring to the stuff the ai comes up with would be cultural drift each city and outpost in your empire would slowly drift in a direction partly determined by circumstance such as a neighboring culture or isolation from the rest of the empire and partly determined by random chance and partly by playerai decisions this would make the formation of new empires and the fracturing of overextended empires a real possibility as even though 2 cities started out the same language and culture by turn 50 they practically speak different languages and are effectively foriegners to eachother this would discourage overextending yourself as to not accidentally either create your next rival or lose the investment you put into the new city to another empire this is already modeled in the game funnily enough atleast on the dift into another empires sphere part

#####

a bit of an unusual review i am going to compare to civilisation 6 as i feel both games can learn a lot from one another and this game was set to be the civ killer i can say with confidence now that this game will not be the end of civ as i think what will actually happen is civ will learn from what humankind did well and also keep doing what it does better these things are in the following areas

identity
humankind strived really hard for this unique civ idea where you essentially create your own civilisation i loved the idea but what it lacks is the sense of identity that you get with civ before playing the game you will have visions of taking your own unique civilisation through time and developing it with minor changes to culture that reflect the needs of your empire however this is not the experience i had instead you pick the culture you wish to to start as and i wont complain about balancing because the devs are working on this and then when you get to the next era the cultures you wanted have been taken by an ai that gets there first this means you are developing a culture based on what is left over now this could be my playing but i have won every game i have played so far but still lag behind the ai even when rushing and not staying behind for era stars what civ 6 does despite its faults is you develop your culture through play style especially with the cool updates that have been added my last playthrough saw me spawn in a luxury rich area and so i built a monopoly on cotton tea and silk i am a science based civ but i have naturally built a luxury merc empire and my natural science ability keeps my tech up to date

pacing
the second issue is the speed at which you go through the game realistically you go through the game in a similar amount of turns but the feel is all wrong in humankind it feels like a speed run to get the culture you want and you dont quite get the developing culture feeling you would like this feels like it bleeds the identity issue because you dont feel like you are nurturing your civ you feel like you are racing towards the modern era and then your identity is essentially some remaining buildings from past eras the city scale is amazing and the game is visually beautiful and the differences the cultures make is lovely but it still feels like a race now in the first instance i thought the fame idea would be a breath of fresh air as civ 6 is very much a race the only thing is everyone is in the same race in humankind and it is to hit the final era before you get obliterated by ai outpacing you this very much happens in civ 6 but humankind promised that city defence terrain etc would allow you to withstand more developed countries but in reality the ai will smash you with a doomstack of the most modern units siege you into starvation and your levi units are forced to leave the walls and get slapped in open combat with civ 6 i recently attacked greece in a playthrough and in humankind you seem to be able to do anything in enemy territory as long as you hit the walls and attack before reinforcements get there on civ i had much better units but entered terrain that was disadvantagous and a bottle neck they had encampments across a river that would decimate my units if we crossed and ranged units at the bottle neck every time we set up siege units they were hit and forced to retreat they were essentially powerless but i was very much delayed in the win the longer the fight went on the more war weary my people got and the more other civs hated me for throwing my army into this bottle neck as we got closer greece was desperate and began throwing basic warriors at me just to slow me down as we burned their farms and sources of income in the end we stopped taking their country as i simply couldnt be bothered to take the rest due to the effort this felt like a story humankind does not produce this same feeling for me you beat one doomstack and then just walk through the rest of the country and other than a recent fix then boom it says you dont have the war support to take the country you just wiped off the face of the earth it feels a little lifeless in comparison to its story telling

victory
the fame thing was a decent idea but in the end we have resorted to a tech victory an era victory etc etc basically be the first to do x and you win the only issue is all of these victories entail doing the same thing in my opinion in civ 6 if you go for a science victory you have to watch out for the dudes that have a tiny empire slowly working their way through diplomacy and then boom they are world leader what do you do about that the more you hit them with force the more the world supports them and you have no chance in hell of catching up with that diplomacy if they are right next to you then they are doomed but what if no one will give you open borders to get to them you have to take on the world to fight this tiny empire laughing at you across the world in humankind you are all in the same race whether it is to the end of the tech tree end of the era end of turn limit its all got the same feeling you can vary your play style to get them fame points but in reality war is still the best answer and once someone falls behind and the best cultures are gone it is dust for them i am afraid with civ 6 you have to stall the other races which means taking time out of your own and how much time are you willing to spend juggling all these things before focussing on what you want to achieve

combat
humankind have essentially done this very nicely  they addressed the doom stack vs spread units issue and it was a decent attempt but like i said previously the terrain works the same as civ and once you have destroyed an army you win the war you would think this is the same for civ but it isnt really that fight i had with greece saw no units die for a while as they just kept rotating in this bottle neck it was  a true time wasting stalemate with a lesser civ i had to up the anti and hire a hero to turn the tide in humankind you lose the best tactic you have retreating to better terrain if you retreat from an army that you forgot could reach you from like 12 tiles away cos they are on a train you get randomly placed and they catch up and kill you in civ if that happens you can retreat to a favourable position fortify use medics and build forts etc you also cant really tell where the terrain will be on humankind a well planned flank could be cut off by the battle map or worse one thought would be cut off isnt and the enemy just obliterate your back line it sounds like it is strategic but you cant retreat and recover so its just annoying watching your whole army get murdered and having no ability to react because of arbitrary lines on the map

i reviewed humankind some time ago and was quite positive about it i thought it had some rough edges and it needed some work but i dove deep and felt like it really had addressed some of those issues with civ but on reflection some time down the line i really wasnt feeling humankind and i decided to give civ a go again it felt fresh and well paced with nice visuals and a real attachment to the civ you are playing as it is a race yes but it feels like you have a lot more options in how to go about the race in humankind you gain fame through food production money sceince etc in civ 6 you can start the game as the byzantines spreading your religion and playing in a similar way to any other religion based civ but then you encounter difficulties and decide to mop up the people that wont follow with devastating cavalry units they will be converted one way or another i cannot recommend humankind in its current state for those of you who love these games to feel the story of your playthrough for whatever reason civ just seems to do it better at the moment

#####

feelings after 30h still a really great game and not much to add into my original i love the ways you can ransack outposts and cities you dont want the land claiming system really adds into the game it is something that i wish civ6 had strongest points in humankind definitely are freedom and choices you are free to do megalarge 1 city that produces 6 units each day ive seen some complaining that units reduce amount of people in cities which is true but with right planning this is little to no issue or having multiple cities or couple power cities claiming other cities or ransacking and making your own entirely freedom and choices are there in so many ways compared to civ6 i hope civ series takes some notes from this game competition is good for customers o


original review just ended a session of 65h no breaks with 4 friends we played 5  3 bots on large map that was suggested for 8 players we had big fun and time flew really fast there are stuff that needs to get used to i do enjoy that it feels different to civ6 i dont really need civ6 but trying to be better this game forces more into having x amount of turns and then winner is who gathered most fame points and is still alive really makes you feel bit pressured all the time gives you focus it is a nice system

there is so much room in the game you can liberate cities you can delete units to convert them back as population they also cost population i felt in civ6 that i was always strict with districts since i couldnt ever remove them i was sometimes fed city that i couldnt raze and i did not want it at all here you can change and do stuff so far there has always been an option to delete something if wanted and not forced to take anything even in diplomacy you can manage what you can trade with each other nonaggression packs etc cant wait to learn more

also no crashes or anything on my side at day 1 in our 65h session in civ 6 i get crashes every 56 hours and that has had lot of time to patch itself maybe i am lucky but that is my experience

if you like civ and want something different i recommend this if you are considering between civ and hk that is ultimately up to you i would check main differences videos from youtube and pick one that suits more to you i love both games so lucky me

#####

cautious recommendation needs more time in the oven perhaps a few expansion packs buying it now is an investment into the future

#####

i really enjoy playing this game 

as i approach my one thousand hours of game play i look back on my hours played and its been really enjoyable everyone compares it to civ 6 i prefer this game over civ 6 because it takes a lot more strategy and id say there may be a kind of sharp learning curve the battles are much much more rewarding to me than civ especially early game ais are much more difficult to beat in the early game vs late game and i wish late game ai was better with strategy and planning and commanding a war i really like this game though because i have almost a thousand hours

#####

i gave this game a chance despite the negative reviews i dont know what most of those negative reviews were talking about save a bug here and there
this game is for you if you wished civ vi focused more on the nation building culture and historical aspects of the game

#####

humankind is really about an 810 i have the base game at the moment given i would buy their latest dlc as it adds in the diplomacy mechanics the game feels like it is missing in the base it isnt to say that it takes away from it so far where the war or attack system is wonderful the fact you actually have control over an army and big stack doesnt always mean a win you can use terrain to your advantage with a small army attacking right it does what civ seems to get wrong religion matters fairly heavily in the game it is more then just a tool but a vital part of your civilization it makes it easier to make friends if you have the same faith or trade deals  

this game is what for me felt like civ should have gone to but two gripes the global warming mechanic is a good idea but implemented where you can end the world by 1800 with one nation doing all the polluting which kind of makes you go oh well might as well nuke someone while i can their fix was to just disable it i didnt want it disabled but just toned down to make it match current history 

the other big problem with the game keeping a 10 out of 10 the map creator kind of sucks i loved civ v which had the best map creator allowing a near perfect earth yeah that is a mod of mine it just is very tedious far more than the old was mainly the way the brushes work and the 3d land which i do like so it is a give and take

the avatar creator is a bit strange for face creation it has a lot of rather large faces and not enough narrow i love the comic book look though to the art my graphics are maxed out so graphically 1010 sound to me is 1010 but gets dragged down by the map creator and their pollution mechanic which sadly could be great so it ends off at an 810 still not bad and for me very enjoyable i love the neolithic period in the beginning

#####

if you are looking for a strict historical strategy game you should move along  this is more of a 4x sandbox focused on city building system optimisation and interesting tactical battles a good portion of the negative reviews seems to be based on misunderstanding what the game actually is so here is a quick summary on how the game plays like

you start as a nomadic tribe and after achieving some conditions you will evolve into a culture of your choice from the ancient era that culture comes with a play style cultural farmer builder expansionist scientist merchant warmonger diplomat a passive bonus that will last all game long a unique building and a unique unit achieving various specific actions like winning battles building stuff or gathering money will grant you era stars 
when you have enough era stars you will be able to change your culture to another one from a more recent era with its play style that might be different from your previous one units building you get it you then rinse and repeat with additional gameplay mechanics being added each era

with the many possibilities tied to the cultural mutations rise some concerns  its hard to roleplay a culture since youre going to change a lot it is also fairly difficult to have a good grasp of what you are doing if you play different play styles in a single game on another hand you can create a fun and personal way to play the game also planning on cultural combos is a fun thing to do even more considering the huge number of cultures available 14 to 15 by era with 6 eras which means more than 80 at the moment of this review

where the game really shines is in its combat system the battle system in itself is fairly simple and minimalist yet highly strategic and gratifying rewarding smart moves allowing a weaker army to rout a stronger foe by ambushing or using the terrain well

the game is pretty dense and tricky to get used to at start but its system allows for some fun experiments if you want to accept it for what it is and not as a supposed clone of civilization

#####

i recommend this game

expectations before i begin i must admit that ive been a fan of the civilization series since the first one and that civ6 has disappointed me greatly my expectation with humankind was a 4x game drawing from what makes civilization a fun game without whatever made civ6 unenjoyable to me

verdict in my opinion humankind already delivered i find it better and more enjoyable than civ6 immersion might be a core aspect of why i love humankind and despise civ6

 culture swap picking your culture during the game was on my civilization wishlist for a long time picking one civilisation and being stuck with it the entire game without having any idea what the map will look like feels like gambling a bit and disconnects the choice from the game civilization game grew to overly specialise the civilisations in a way where you feel cornered into a preset strategy before the game even begins check how civ4 handled it for reference

 combat between early civs stacks of doom or how unmanageable civ6 big armies can get i really like the tactical combat system that brings life to the map it even allows for reinforcement cutting the supply line steal the flag siege combat etc better than ive seen in civ

 diplomacy everyone complains about how the ai is bad at openended diplomacy and dealings this game recognises this and simply forces everyone to use the same framework which does remove the openended aspect of the trading and diplomacy but since it never really worked it isnt a big loss to me and i prefer that compared to the exploitable civ6 system diplo favour was a really nice attempt but didnt really work either

 peace negotiations this feels inspired by paradox games and ive never seen anyone complain about it much forced surrender is actually a good idea as youve never seen a large empire get exterminated overnight you need to remind yourself that in this game your people have something to say for once you can only declare war if your people supports it you can only keep the war up as long as your people supports it and the war will end the second your people no longer supports it forced surrender your enemy has given up their people dont wanna fight anymore you have won and no one on the face of this planet want this war to continue except some civ6 players used to exterminate people

 newcommercasual friendly i find the tutorial and gameplay friendly to newcommers sure the ingame adviser isnt perfect every time but its good enough to give you a decent start and allow you to concentrate on more important matters dont really know what to do with district welp if you need food make a food quarter and the game will even help you out about where to place it dont wanna be a mindless pawn of the ingames adviser just do as you wish note that you cant do that in civ6 trying the tutorial shows you that the ingame adviser is actually broken and should be ignored entirely most of the game leaving newbs to get destroyed by the ai before they understand whats going on ive looked good player online and im generally not in the mood of planning my entire empire on turn 1 because the district placement minigame is that unforgiving if you arent optimal empire getting too large and now having too many cities to manage you can merge them in this game simplify the build queue stack up the cityspecific bonuses increasing the housing and growing of a giant megalopolis if you want you can even pick where the unit will spawn assuming you have multiple spawn points like harbours and garrisons you dont even need to plan too far out ahead you wont even know which culture youll have in the next era keeps you guessing a bit and makes the game less predictable and tests your adaptability more than preplanning before the game starts and access to the games encyclopedia also allows you to change your strategy mid game if need be something i feel civ6 doesnt have at all i feel punished in civ6 for being bad dark ages early on because the ais stole all the wonders now i need to waste time ensuring people dont revolt because im not as good as cheating ais this game has osmosis that can be a doubleedged sword but does act as a bit of a catchup mechanism along with the competitive spirit star free star awarded when players are too far behind the leading one erawise

 think outside the box there are a lot of minor game mechanics that can be utilised for more advanced strategy ive noted a lot of people complaining about garrison being underwhelming which im assuming is because a lot of gamer are now used to the best defence is offence mindset let me remind you of the saboteur commando and other stealth units you can send them in another players territory and sneakily ransack their outpost or even administrative centre if not caught this is better than spies and uses the map a lot if done right i wouldnt expect an ai to pull it off although i did get harassed by harappan runners about my outposts you can wreck havoc and steal territory from others and the counter to that is either to have a lot of units patrolling your territories or having static defences like the garrison who can be upgraded for bigger detection range for example a spot looking like the thermopylae can benefit from a garrison as itll block any invasion force from entering your heartland without fighting your garrison first ill remind you that an expansionist culture can harass you like that even during peace so defences can always come in handy to prevent that kind of harassment which is also a cautionary tale about overexpanding too fast i also avoided a war with a more powerful neighbour by forming an alliance with a common neighbour which boosted my effective military strength just enough to avoid war and buy me time to ramp up my military then had my entire continent unite under a big alliances after we discovered another continent turns out cultural osmosis had nudged everyone on my continent to adopt similar civics as me while another empire did the same on the other continent just like that we had diplomatic issue due to the cultural differences between the continents and a world war was avoided by me starting a bunch of trade like crazy until an ai on the new continent accepts an alliance due to them relying on my trade for their economy now ive had way more fun diplomatically playing the ais one off each other compare to any war i experienced in civ6 you could also purposefully trigger a revolution to chance civics faster and cheaper

 replayability i havent played enough of this game to really pronounce myself on this but the potential is obvious you can mix and match cultures and see how that changes the playstyle you can try to get the achievement to improve your avatar ai you can play against different avatar ais to see how it impacts the game try different game settings etc right out of the box the potential seems greater than for civ6

final note difference is not a crime it was never meant to be a clone of civ6 and should not be blamed for not copying civ6 it makes a lot of improvement regarding the immersion in my opinion you feel like you are playing a game simulating the management of an empire civ6 feels like you are playing a militaryfocus boardgame these arent the same kind of game at all and i wished people would be more openminded when trying new game instead of complaining when the strategy they used in a completely different game isnt working and its somehow not their fault for not actually paying attention to the game they are playing

sidenote you can also mod this game not happy with some minor details just mod it and stop trashing the game in reviews for everyone else cant mod maybe cut the devs some slack then and hope that a nice modder will create it for you

#####

in humankind you manage a wide range of aspects of your civilization through a total of 7 ages from a nomadic tribe to the present age in contrast to a typical 4x setting the goal is not to eliminate other players or win eg by completing the tech tree or a specific wonderproject but by continuously accumulating fame points for achieving milestones such as population growth expansion or military victories throughout the whole game this keeps you on your toes and makes the early game as interesting as the late game

overall humankind is an awesome game and the natural evolution from previous amplitude 4x endless titles having played both several civilization titles and previous amplitude games before i can clearly see where humankind beats civ in many ways providing what 4x should be strategy at its best if you expect cities and other mechanics work as in civ as i suspect many of the negative reviewers here did you will miss the key features that make this game unique and refreshing embrace the mechanics exploit them and youll see what i mean overall i find humankind substantially more innovative providing richer opportunities for a wide range of strategies beyond blunt conquest or building stuff up fast that also deal away with many of the micromanaging issues that civ even in its latest iterations has also in line with previous amplitude titles humankind is fastpaced a typical game will take 1520h focusing on key strategic decisions and longterm planning while still providing good measures of optimizing at a low level without devolving into micromanagement you will not need to manage dozens of cities send around workers etc because the mechanics that are there are sharpened and boiled down to the essence of all of these things you can however still cleverly exploit the mechanics and this creates the deep strategic gameplay humankind offers

i definitely do not agree with many reviewers here who critize the game for being too little immersive the soundtrack is awesome as are the graphics having halfbaked mechanics or being full of bugs compared to previous amplitude titles several mechanics such as politics diplomacy cityarea management wonders or battles have been refined in a good way that bring around the essence of benefits while being flexible and without being overcomplicated the game could however be a bit more transparentexpressive about some of the mechanisms that enabledisable you to do things

just to give an example of how humankind breaks 4x traditions and comes up with delightful solutions
instead of choosing a single leadercivilization background at the start you build up your characteristic bonuses more industry improved research etc by choosing in each new age a new culture criticizing this for feeling discontinuous misses the point and i dont feel about it that way at all instead this enable a very flexible gameplay enabling you to act and counteract upon what your neighbours are doing or what fits your longerterm strategy best a common criticism of this is that a culture once taken by another player cannot be taken by you so your plan may fail and youll only be stuck with bad choices that is not true use the cultures available and counteract what others are doing  the game is wellbalanced not just in this aspect theres always more than one way to acquire fame points and a good strategy that accounts also for the unplanned will win

in summary dont be fooled by the negative reviews as i did for a long time that made me hesitant to buy the game i was wrong the game is a milestone for the 4x genre and the most innovative ive seen in the genre in a long time

#####

its already a good game
and would be a great game once development is finished and it stops crashing on load
all the time 

but i cannot give a positive review for an unfinished releases as it promotes bad practices for game developers

edit 1 year later

feels like only minor fixes  changes in the last year
 still deadlock in combat bug
 still shitty ux
 still no workshop support

hopefully this studio will do better when they make endless space 3 
and  or their next game


edit after another attempt to enjoy the game

 too few map styles eg inland sea or symmetrical balanced maps
 unbalanced cultures eg egypt  harpan plus the complete randomness how quickly you unlock your first culture plus only allowing one player to pick each culture is a complete and utter game design failure

im not preordering future games from this studio again

#####

this game isnt what it was at launch i preordered this game after really enjoying the other amplitude 4x games and found myself very disappointed however through months of updates its starting to turn around i dont think its quite all the way there yet but its on the way the trajectory is finally in a good place

i adore the early game strategy involved in the neolithic era its an excellent shakeup to the genre similarly with the ageprogression system being able to pivot to a cover a weakness youre having or build further on a past strength is much more interesting than some of the gameplay from other 4x games where youre stuck with one set of strengths for the entire game and if you fall behind youre screwed 

however theres still some huge problems with balance as the eras go on frankly the industrial and contemporary eras both feel a bit superfluous with the way things go if youre not set up to win by then youre not going to to win in addition the balance of the cultures in both of those eras leaves a lot to be desired while there are standout better and worse cultures in previous eras the ones in the industrial and contemporary eras are really busted though that may be due to pieces of balance outside the actual cultures themselves where using a combination of industry and growth early and then transitioning into science seems to be the best option no matter what

i see the updates on clarifying systems and making them better along with some of the huge balance changes theyve already made and i appreciate them hopefully things keep getting better

#####

at the end of the day this is endless space without the space and its factions i dont know how to feel about that but i will make a breakdown on it

h1the goodh1
listthe map is very good looking
i really enjoy the culture mechanics it brings a fresh new take on the 4x gameplay
the combat is really fun it adds a whole new level of strategic layer and its much more interesting than civs blobs of units that whose animations you disable after a few games or turns
starting without a city and building your nation from ancient era scavenging for food is a really nice touch which again spices things up and makes replaying more interesting
having territory sectors instead of your city expanding into hexes is also an interesting mechanic on top of that building outwards with districts makes it all the more interesting its nice to not have builders for once and not having to micro  worry about them each turn
having to buy the right to build a wonder with influence and not allowed to buy the right to another wonder until you built the previous one is great rather than a race to who builds it first its a race to who can buy it first and i strangely like it more
strategic resources arent held by constructing specific units for example a cavalry unit requires 1 horse resources but by building that unit you wont lose that resource you can build as many units as you want as long as their cost is 1 horse thats much better than civ honestly
list

h1the not good but not badh1
listmap generation is strange strategic and luxury resource placement is very strange when using standard spawn settings default it feels like the game doesnt spawn enough of these resources and when it spawns them it congregates them at the poles rather than dispersing them evenly throughout the map like i said before these resources arent really needed to much at most you need 23 of everything to build anything you want but their spawns on the map is terrible
list

h1the badh1
listthe game calendar is immersion breaking why am i in the modern era during the 1400s why am i in the medieval era when it should be the classical era it feels like the game is missing eras the contemporary era last one starts in mid to late 1600s its really jarring but not game breaking i marked it as a bad because it is for me
the ai is strange 4 out of 5 games id have 1 to 3 ais that would just snowball out of control and advance way beyond player control civ6 has this but not this bad because of this they will dictate the flow of the game mid to late game units become obsolete really fast which is both good and bad and if the ai is way ahead of you in the era race its pretty much game over 
to explain the previous point more despite liking the culture mechanic this is still and endless game that means that industry is king early game if you dont get a culture that has industry or food stats its going to be a really harsh uphill battle from midgame onwards military till medieval age is useless the ai wont go on the offensive that early the worst youll deal with is barbarians and you just ignore those science is only good as a 2nd or 3rd culture not first money is useless till late game like in all endless games but it somehow feels worse than endless space maybe its just me and yes the player can also snowball out of control if he picks the right cultures
list

do i recommend the game if youve played the endless series yea if youve never played civ yea if youve played civ are tired of it and want a fresh take on the series yea but only on sale 

i hope the devs iterate on this if they ever release a sequel improve the cultures so that they are all viable and do something about the industry meta of their series it worked in endless space but its not that great here it kills replay value if every game i need to stack up industry to do something

#####

this recommendation comes with a caveat get it on sale

this game is fun but there are some serious issues certain builds and strategies are leaps and bounds ahead of other strategies to the point where if you go for the best strategy focus production then you can do insane things however if you dont go for those strategies then you have to play at a much higher level and know the mechanics much better in order to achieve the same level of performance

another issue is that unlike civ it is essentially impossible to win too early through nondomination means all other methods of winning either require filling out the tech tree launching a bunch of space missions or other end game tasks this again places a ton of emphasis on builds that can snowball into the end game asap

on some positive notes the combat and siege mechanics are interesting even if theyre not necessarily the best i think its a step in a good direction but there are some things that could be improved generally more unit diversity the city building is definitely much more satisfying than civs system and rewards careful planning but doesnt completely punish a misstep in district placement

overall the strength of the game is in the early eras when empires are first getting established and tensionsfrictions first develop generally the outcome of most conflicts is a given in the end game so its really a question of whether or not you get there in most games

overall a fairly solid game but definitely no civ killer im very excited to see if they take this ip any further but for now this is definitely a solid 30 and under game

#####

just finished my first game taking 11 hours to do so i believe the reviews for this game are doing a lot of disservice to it mainly due to wrong expectations

humankind is a game about creating stories and developing an unique civilisation that adhere to your chosen path through the game because of this aspect the game is not balanced it is not competitive and it is not meant for serious play you can try to minmax everything in the game but you will find that doing so against the ai is easy because of the thousands of possibilities and systems present in the game

therefore if you are indecisive on buying humankind just as i was make this question to yourself why am i buying this game if the answer is to have fun roleplay as a fictitious nation or try to stomp the ai in unimaginable ways then 100 buy this game i had a great time playing for the first time due to the story that emerged on my civilisation pacifistindustrialmercantile nation

if you are looking for a competitive balanced tough game with no exploits then humankind probably wont be the game for you

with that said i rank humankind in the same ladder as amplitudes other game endless space 2 both have a focus on creating stories and roleplaying and both games achieve this goal masterfully

#####

every ai opponent on even the lower difficulties want nothing more then to kill the player and are willing to do go to any length to hellwar you to death even at thecost of their chance to win the game is waaaay too aggro

h1ban ambivalent experiencebh1
ihumankindi caught my interest immediately as its numerous ideas revolving around enhancing the 4x gameplay presented by other turnbased strategy titles mainly icivilizationi seemed diverse enough to offer a new compelling take on this subgenre even though it manages to do so in many areas it feels that it tries way too hard to be different rather than polishing its own mechanics thus it leaves me with mixed thoughts as while it is still an entertaining game that is competent enough as a whole the wasted potential with certain aspects is disappointing

starting in the neolithic era you have to explore fight for your survival with other tribes and animals and collect curiosities representing early human discoveries your goal is to find a suitable place for your outpost and settle down i think this idea sounds great on the paper but playing it feels monotonous as almost nothing happens during that epoch you just galavant around the map spamming that iend turni prompt and that is it luckily it does not last long and once you get enough points to proceed into the next era it gets more sophisticated and addictive

from that point the gameplay loop hooked me it revolves around claiming territories by building outposts evolving them into cities thus forming your empire these regions have set borders and resources so you should prioritize the ones you need at the moment in the medieval era for example iron is crucial for producing knights even though cities are critical for producing food industry money and science it is not the best idea to upgrade every territory into onethey would run out of resources to take care of its citizens soon so attaching the said regions to one specific city is far more profitable in the long run
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2588127905
your playthrough is heavily affected by a cultural system that allows you to choose a new culture in every epoch each excels in something else expansionist romans have lower military upkeep and additional unit slot in their regiments allowing them to recruit more praetorians while philosophically oriented greeks have a boost towards scientific research protected by hoplites thus if you happen to be on a continent with warmongering neighbours picking up romans will give you an advantage in the war due to that each era offers a new opportunity to shape your playthrough differently and that is the aspect i loved the most about this game however ihumankindi does not use the potential of this mechanic to its fullest how so imagine all of those everlasting roman cities and their architecture glorious right now as you have to proceed from this classical epoch into a medieval one you can choose a new civilization let us say aztecs suddenly everything you have built so far gets replaced by mesoamerican culture and even the look of your people changes that always left me in a bittersweet mood as even though i had tons of fun with this aspect the lack of visual representation always ruined my immersion for a few turns i thought that i would be forming my own humankind not replacing it with another one cultures grew and influenced each other as time passed they did not just disappear into oblivion after all we can witness roman landmarks in our times too

this issue only underlines the fact that visuals whilst beautiful to behold on are generic there is nothing that would make ihumankindi stand out among other titlesto be unique capturing how would the said cultures influence each other would help to solve this issue yet that is not happening and it feels like developers either forgot or deliberately omitted it which is a shame on the other hand the soundtrack offers a lot of great compositions for each nation and era and the narrator has several humorous remarks which manage to save the games presentation a bit especially during violent events

speaking of violence i enjoyed the warfare a lot in this title mainly thanks to the war support system representing your populations desire to fight with a specific nation influenced by your combat performance diplomatic relations and so on there are also grievances which you can use as an excuse to invade someone for example if another civilization claims a territory near your borders you can demand it from themif they refuse you have a reason to engage in war and show them that they made a fatal mistake it adds more personality to the politics as it feels there are real conflicts of interests rather than blatant tries to annihilate everyone however diplomacy is not perfect as basic features like asking allies to attack someone are missing you can only demand it once if it appears which is ridiculous
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2588136787
while artificial intelligence is serviceable both on the world map and in battles it manages to pull out illogical decisions at times like attacking your army with a single unit i was also disappointed that my opponents always forced me into some kind of conflict sooner or later there was not a game in which i would encounter a nation that would orient on religion or tradeeveryone was just a feebleminded warmonger

as for the actual battles they are entertaining enough albeit a bit simplistic instead of fighting on the regular map there is a battlefield area in which everyone deploys their units this part is separated from the ingame turns and presents its own rounds which helps make these encounters faster naturally positioning your troops in the terrain has its advantages such as having the higher defence in the forest or losing combat strength when crossing a river moreover due to the abovementioned cultural system each nation has a strong emblematic unit in every era making it more balanced
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2588145843
if there is something that does not work at all in this title it is definitely multiplayer i have tried to play a few matches but most of them ended because the game got stuck on turn pending meaning in a loop in which no one could play reloading never helped so we had to start a new match this seems to be a common issue but it never occurred to me in the singleplayer i stopped trying to play with strangers once i captured a hosts city on which he reacted with the infamous iggi and left once the aforementioned bug gets fixed it could surely be enjoyable with friends but now it felt like a waste of my time

despite all of those shortcomings it would be unfair to give ihumankindi a thumbs down as the cultural and warfare systems are what made me want to start yet another fresh playthrough it is an entertaining experience for sure especially for the fans of this subgenre but perhaps it needed more time to be an amazing one

i will start by saying that i find the game simply brilliant loving the mechanics the art style and the wonderful music i was waiting for a civlike game with a twist and here it is

i wont debate which one is better civ vvi or humankind they all are great games im just glad that finally we have another take on the genre

i sincerely do not understand people complaining about the culture shifting thing i mean its the core aspect of the game and works exactly as advertized and its brilliant also most people fail to mention that you can also stick to one culture for the whole game if you feel so inclined and the game also gives you bonuses for that i mean being italian i would love if the roman empire was still a thing just kidding but times change in real life

people complaining it is a sjw trash game are simply ridiculous just because your civilization changes in time it does not mean it is because devs are following some hidden political agenda where national identity has to be banned in the name of wokeness stop drinking guys 

bottomline is im having a great time playing the game absolutely recommended

#####

its mediocre at best i get trying to innovate on new game mechanics but the major aspects are just weird

1 battle mechanics with placing and moving units is so ridiculous very limiting and frustrating at best

2 the force surrender concept you have no choice but to end the war  even if you are winning and have ample resources to not stop

3 city limitations else you are penalized if  you go over the limits  how do you take over the world and only have 6 cities cities that you link to territories that span continents and half the globe

4 there is no minimap  to get to the other side of the coast or globe you scroll and scroll and scroll then you lost track of where you are seems like a minor thing but it gets very convoluted from mid to end game esp if you play with large sized maps seems these limitations are to discourage you from playing with big worlds

5 territories is wacked  you create a city and you automatically control the entire territory its in taking away the rewards of territory growth to align with your city size

6 trade system is awful just awful trade routes are automatic in that you dont select anything other than the resource you want to buy and you cant really control who you sell to  it just happens

7 the ui is way too crowded confusing takes too many mouse clicks to do anything

8 moving units is big fat guess at times moving between flat to hill to forest cost different movement points which is fine but there is no way to preview a potential path you click where you want it and then find out how much it actually costs to get to point b

9 terrain graphics are hard to tell the difference between a cliff that you cant embark from or a beach that only takes 1 movement point this becomes even more frustrating when deciding a battle where to attack and how to position your troops until its too late and your legion has to run the long way around because you couldnt tell the hex they are on cant simply go over to the next hex that you want

10 game just seems buggy overall i often have to try clicking on a unit a few times to get it to select this is esp true when trying to select and move a unit the arrow icon doesnt change to show you the game is processing or thinking about something so maybe thats why

theres more but i think 10 reasons why im not recommending this title is enough i feel bad for those that bought this game for full retail at launch

i was hoping a few years in and the game got decent nope

#####

tldr buy it if you enjoyed endless legend if youve never played other amplitude studios 4x games id wait for a sale or until a few updates are released

review
my review is positive because i like amplitude studios i like their endless series and i enjoy their take on 4x games humankind is exactly the same experience as endless legends and you really shouldnt expect anything different aside from the historical experience it provides in terms of wonders culture unit types and civilisations 

do i recommend the games price no not really a justifiable price would be 40 dollars aud for my current experience

do i recommend the game for its gameplay and experience yes its a classic 4x game in the style of amplitude studios other 4x games the music is beautiful the artwork is awesome and the colours are vibrant it can be replayed many times before youd experience all available faction and religious types 

additionally i have found a number of ui issues and what could be bugs or poor design i have listed them below for the prospective customer to consider before making their purchase also i acknowledge that some issues below may have been sorted by other customers and if so please let me know

issues
1 the avatar faction colour and faction symbol you create when you first launch the game does not save even if you begin a game with the avatar and colours you choose the game will automatically default to the original avatar and colours and ask you to remake them each time you launch the game you can just accept the default to return to your saved game

2 my main menu does not have a load game option and therefore i must start a brand new game each time and then load from inside the new game

3 there is an error in the tutorial where the game states you upgrade from a city to an outpost when in fact the outpost is the predecessor to the city what the tutorial tells you is evolve city to outpost but on the ui the button says evolve outpost to city nitpicking however its a small error identified

4 camera panning is unbearably slow and the only option to increase pan speed can be set from 05 to 10 changing the option does not increase or decrease the panning speed there is the other option of left clicking and dragging to pan which moves as fast as your mouse pointer  however i am a prolific arrow and wsad user for panning 

5 at the beginning of your turn this is a turn based game all notifications and prompts appear at once across your screen with no particular order when you click to zoom to one of them the others automatically close and it takes some time to cycle through each notification this would be improved if the notifications appeared in list order and you could click through them in your own time and order 



#####

not gonna lie this is a good game for those who like civ or prefer a different but similar 4x type strategy game id say  in some aspects  its better than civ in my opinion such as  the battle mechanics this is most likely the best part of the game as you can manually control the units during a battle or use terrain or districts for your advantage  diplomacy  id prefer this version of diplomacy than civ although it has its flaws and more in humankind it feels more realistic than civ and  has a bit more  mechanics than civ there are a few things that make this game good but now ill say some of the things that i dislike about this game there are  some graphical issues if you keep some early game units into lets say the early modern era such as one of my early game units for some reason turning into a god damn boat while on land11

there are some other issues some of the mechanics dont work as  well as they should youll realise this if you buy the game there are other  issues with this game but my main issue with this game is the god damn map maker its so over complicated than it should be and its really stupid in some aspects such as they add wonders from dlcs but dont tell you its from dlcs so when youre about to load the map you spent hours making it says  uhhh actually you cant play this map because you have wonders from another dlc you dont have so why the fuck would you add that if you dont have those dlc there are other things that are wrong with the game but overall id say this is a good game

#####

only good for the first couple hours worse than civ at being a board game style empire builder worse than paradox at being a highly detailed empire builder loads of poorly thought out systems bugs and tedious mechanics 

avatar system is an affront to humanity 

and for a game about humankind spends precisely zero time foregrounding the human experience of all these periods

#####

humankind is simply a great strategy game it looks and somewhat plays like the civ series but is more fastpaced and has waaay smarter ai opponents

new players choose town difficulty since the ai players will never era up ahead of you there they may earn more fame earn stars faster etc but they will not enter into the next era before you do in fact if you love a certain era stay there for as many hours or days as you like the ai opponents on town difficulty will stay in any given era with you forever if you like

metropolis difficulty is the norm its totally neutralno bonuses for either ai or players and the ai will era up ahead of you if you let them

dont forget you can choose up to 50 fifty playermade avatars to use as ai opponents alongside all the default ones already  included and ai personalities matter the ai plays radically different in numerous ways based on their personality types and playermade ones tend to be vicious typically all maxedout and statted to wreck your day or maybe hug you to death if they have the peace and love attribute

humankind deserves waaaay more players than it currently  has its an overlooked gema lot more varied and challenging than civ vi which i own along with all its dlc and still play at times

it has a pretty steep learning curve for a lot of players is all yet its got more than enough ingame help features to get anyone started buy it stick with it a few games be sure and use town difficulty at first so you can learn how to play with the full range of cultures always available to you during each era

lot of great mods available for this game to change and add more stuff than you can imagine



#####

i played this game when it was still a beta back then i was pretty excited for this game because it looked like a cool new civ game but playing it again after its release it is kind of a let down battles always feel like a chase and it takes forever for new settlements to grow which makes starting the game take forever the tutorials dont really explain much so there is a lot of figuring out what to do on your own

when you finally chase down an enemy the battles are kinda cool cause the varying terrains in battle can increase or decrease the effectiveness of your or the enemies attack i cant really think of anything else that is a huge plus if this game is on sale it might be worth trying out but not at full price

#####

i wish i could recommend this game but i cant

in art and design games animation but also all other artdesign related fields we have two sayings that are the golden rules of any project
story is king  and form follows function  both in games kind of result in the same thing which is if the storymotivationfunction of your game doesnt work well no amount of polish and nice art will save it 

as someone who makes stuff like this for a living and who shamelessly loves civ6civ games i wanted so badly for this game to build upon what civ and similar games do without it just being another country dlc type of deal civ but prettier art wouldve been great too but the game didnt deliver

sadly months later the same bugs and problems with ui and gameplay still are there to stay and while theres spaces for custom downloadable maps or ai characters seemingly to download like its the sims theres still really nothing there to do bugs arent fixed some stuff isnt findable in the ai and isnt skippable in game but seems to have no effect on the game at all it seems like theres a lot of loose ends and stuff they tried to do to copy civbut didnt quite finish before releasing 

i also like the idea of picking a different civ per what era youre in  but unfortunately each era goes by so quickly that you really dont have the time to make use of them effectively or get accustomed to their perks and it doesnt seem like theres anywhere in the ui where you can find the past stackable perks from past civs you picked 

while the game also has on paper different victories in the end it seems about half arent actually achievable and either way it doesnt matter because the only real victory guideline is how much fame you accrue and who gets the most the fastest how do you accrue fame aside from playing as the same civ more than once in a row its a mystery its completely neglected in most of the game until the very end

in the end humankind is a very pretty game without much under the surface it feels like it wants to be an updated copy of civ and a city builder at the same time and actually i think it wouldve been more fun had they gone the slow burn city builder gameplay instead 

now if this game got a major update that fixed a lot of gameplaymaybe id change my review as i said i really want to love itbut its just not there yet

#####

as a longtime player of sid meiers civilization 16 i came to this game over a year after it launched vanilla no dlc i found it really enjoyable  they took risks on mechanics very different from civ that paid off ai is generally smart and frustrating in a good way theres enough familiar about civ that longtime players of the genre can pick it up and enough new that i found myself going to youtube to learn strategies and then was able to play better  

would recommend to other fans of the genre

#####

endless legend does everything you see here better its also much clearer and the mechanics for each faction are truly unique im not talking a singular unique unit or district one faction focuses on gold and trading and they are nomads whose cities move another one is fantasy elves a third literally scours the world youre on consuming literally everything in its path and can only win once it has destroyed all all of the xs in that game work so much better than it does here and now in humankind every single one is rewarded in its own unique way and the game tells an interesting story that elevates not only the gameplay but each faction individually

the devs tried to marry the very very core mechanics of endless legend with a game like civilization and i think the marriage was forced probably for money

you could get this game to work i think the way to start would be to make all the ai have set playstyles so you know what to expect from each even if theyre wearing a different culture each era even if an ai choose a nonhostile faction you knew to expect hostile relations in the future etc etc

it just doesnt work as good as it should which is a shame when the team has demonstrated in the past that they know how to make this game work if this looks like something you would like try endless legend out

#####

the game had many potientals but the fact is that it is not great nor fun and instead of improving the game they decide to do useless community events and release paid culture dlcs

#####

i love this game  i think its best suited for those that want to create a story of their civilisation and who are also really drawn to the aesthetics of city building and the realistic feel to it on top of this i think those who are drawn to carving out a story rather than focusing on the win will like it the most i loved civ but i cant go back to it now not that you have to only play 1 but after playing humankind it is the ultimate 4x game for me

in terms of gameplay i think there are some stronger aspects than others the combat is a standout and i think diplomacy can be interesting at times espeically with more recent free updates the devs have added multiplayer can be challenging to work and is more prone to bugs but i have been consistently playing with my partner and it holds up fine religion works fine and although could be improved  it adds enough to make up a core experience without feeling lack luster 

the main pros for the game are the visuals geographical gameplay combat and city development 
the main cons for me are limited but i would say its about balancing  i think some cultures felt op to me and certain abilities are op if you are playing at a top difficulty then expect to make use of all of these borderline exploits to win the game

#####


highlights
ill start with dont buy this game it will only continue to support the deterioration of the gaming industry second i understand that its just a game and decisions need to be made that i may not agree with third why did i right a nasty review well because they took my money fourth there was clearly no adult in the room never mind one with a rounded education when this game was being designed 

battle
your superior force just attacked and the defender decides to retreat  i would too  are you offered any type of pursuit  no
should you attack a fort and win you do not enter the fort and just for a little salt should there be any enemy within range they can

war
the war is over not because the victor says its over oh no it because the loser says its over
the loser surrenders and basically says i have had enough you must now choose what the loser offers as acceptable terms  this is like saying sorry for starting wwii but ive had enough  you win its over you might have armies in position ready to attack that must now stand down because the loser says so  losers dictating terms  its laughable

oh and by the way the loser can then place an outpostcity in any unclaimed territory anywhere it still has a unit and you cant attack until you have enough war support you read that correctly you lose all your war support when you win

now youve won right well that costs you  you inevitably just went over your city limit the cost of that in prestige can be absolutely outrageous 

unit placement
	dont be surprised when one of your units is simply moved from the position it occupies because its being attacked  position your unit on an outpost or city and begin your ransack if you are then attacked there is a good chance youll be moved you may be ransacking and outpost with four units the outpost in question only has one entry point so your deployment is stacked  no matter what units you have or what hexes may open up for movement you have only and arbitrary single unit to fight with 

ship movement
under no circumstance early on use point and click to move your ships  should they find themselves ending a turn on an ocean hex they are lost  do not think of this movement feature as an aide 

all rants must come to an end and truly i dont expect anyone to have read this far  i just wish i believed it could have been as bad as the reviews i read said it was i could continue on but there would be no point

i understand better than most that when computer gaming started that it was easier to create new and interesting concepts  as time went on the concepts became less exciting and the graphics got much better as game after game was released the quality suffered across the board except normally graphically  now those tasked with developing designing games have been raised on a steady diet of mediocre content  even really bad ideas are now passed off as innovative  but pretty

#####

i really really really wanted to love this game and it has great features but the combat is not good if you dont manually battle each fight you run the risk of losing your entire army even if you have better odds the game is unstable it hangs up quite a bit usually around round 280 my game stops responding its happened on multiple games its just not worth it

2023  update

the devs have tried to make this game better they have made significant improvements in aspects of the game the diplomacy has more options but still is lacking anything really innovative or dynamic you can now gift and trade territories in peace which is a really nice improvement however the notification system and war system is still very much lacking combat needs to be more dynamic i like the world congress addition but important decisions need to come to the forefront better it is too easy to be blindsided by a diplomatic action that can literally cost you half of your empire overall the game is better and more stable but there is still a lot to bee desired

#####

i honestly do not understand all the hate this game gets i feel its review score should be much higher than mixed this is a great game its primary sin at least as far as the reviewers seem to be concerned is the core win mechanic which basically works like a score victory in civ do various things to up your fame level and the person with the highest fame at the end wins i actually like this because it encourages me to play in various ways i might otherwise not think to do so 

there are also mini mechanics that i quite enjoy like the nomadic era and combat in particular which are very interesting compared with how other era games work plus the developers have made it clear more content is on the way and they are open to feedback so i dont know what more you can really ask of a game

i think the complaints for this game are overblown and have more to do with how it plays in comparison to other games like it than with this game itself to each his own but i think the game is worth a shot just dont expect it to be a civ clone

#####

very promising so far but balance is very broken at the moment had two games turn sour from unreasonably aggressive ai that both simply declared surprise war as soon as our borders touched i suppose the ai has literally zero consequences from being labeled as dishonorable traitors for doing so combat was pretty fair until the hunnic archer spam started very shortly afterwards anticavalry units didnt seem any more effective on them and they engage in ranged combat at melee distance so theres zero risk to their attacks while your units get utterly pulverized balanced formations are wiped out with ease when theyre constantly flanked and take no damage from anything they do

this game definitely needs work and polish but i wouldnt count it out totally by any means with this studios reputation we will be seeing updates and issues being addressed very attentively and soon at any rate they have definitely expanded greatly upon the formula in endless legend the heavy wokeness present in all the ingame art is blunted by the fact you can make your leader look like anyone and of course choose to become any number of cultures as the eras go on if i had to choose anything to be absolutely struck from the game at the moment its the narrator however the narrators sarcasm and the game in general is still nowhere near as abrasive or annoyingly preachy as all the flavor text and themes present in civ vi if any of that is your concern

#####

a unique mix of civ 6 and endless legend seems like another solid strategy game from amplitude that ill play entirely too much of

#####

didnt turn out to be the civ killer everybody said it would be but it definitely established its own identity and really became something unique and fun to play

#####

just feels like an abusive relationship at this point i want to like the game but it keeps finding new ways to disappoint every time i go back to it youll be better off keeping the distance until they figure themselves out

#####

love the the game
looks great
however
max turn limits that end the game and no unlimited turn game kinda kills it for me 

the developer responded to my review and informed me that last month there was an update that removed turn limits 

i have changed my recommendation to a yes

this is why i own all the endless games

#####

of course the game is automatically compared to civilization
some aspects of gameplay is better than in civilization some are not but it is not important

what is really important  this is a truly civilization like game there is not too much such games in the world actually there was only one civilization now there is two and that is great

humankind is a very good name for this game the game truly admires achievements of humankind

the game have absolutely fantastic music very good images and descriptions in tech tree immersive events with several options to choose how exactly you will rule your nation and what world you want to build all of these creates an amazing experience which you will love if you are a fan of humankind

the only things i dont like in terms of roleplay there is no way to play same nation or culture along entire history and also a humor of narrator in many cases is not appropriate i would prefer serious style without a humor but still i got a huge amount of positive feelings about this game

if you like civilization mostly for its chess  cybersport like gameplay and you are expecting many many different walkthroughs you probably will found this game more shallow than civilization and its gamedesign flaws will be frustrating maybe even very frustrating since there is a lot of flaws which in details explained in many others reviews so probably it will be better for you to wait for discount  updates  more dlc

however if you love civilization for how it praise achievements of human kind and creates this feeling of building and making world a better place and plan to beat the game only 1 or maybe 2 times just to get its artistic and roleplay content  you will definitely love this game

#####

as much as it disappoints me to make this review i have to be honest humankind is horribly unbalanced even more than civ vi is if you fall behind the ai you are not coming back the snowballing is so bad that you would be lucky to even make it into third place there is also the fact that the population mechanic is nearly useless as districts are the main creator of production this makes agrarian focused builds almost useless the ai also has an unfair advantage as they possess knowledge of resources you cant even see yet warfare is also a nightmare as the loser can force you to stop fighting yes you read that right the ai can force you to accept a peace with no option to reject their claims all in all interesting premises terrible execution civ killer humankind aint

this is off topic but the mere existence of timed events alone is a problem 4x games are not live services they shouldnt have timed events this is an early red flag for terrible monetization practices and a lack of care to the games balancing issues until amplitude starts wising up to the fact that this game should be early access do not buy this game we dont need any more games pulling shit like this just go spend your money on another 4x game that isnt in as bad a state as this one

#####

i would choose maybe if i could

tldr its more comfortable almost intact clone of civ with some new mechanics and with glitches and bugs wait for a game updates

pros
 finally a strong civ competitor  maybe like with simcity vs cities they will compete for good
 cut off some frustrating things like roads they are automatic now also cities can be merged
 really nice war mechanic im not talking about battles
 nice new mechanics here and there
 entertaining narrator love it
 on a first glance its hard to not like the game 
 im not sure but it seems that you can set up own ai based on your playstyle unlocks for multiplayer when youre offline or this is how opponent difficulty is chosen

cons
 price is a bit high
 cant give away cities
 bunch of bugs more about them below but im sure they will be squished soon
 overall feels like an early access game yet its not more like beta prerelease

glitches and bugs
 in some conditions battles may softlock on ai turn for example when ai really wants to go for a flag but path is closed by water mountains and my frontline units
 diplomacy can glitch at least surrender terms during war you can click on refuse but this window will pop up back right away yet they will gain war support and you will lose some with every click on refuse button nice
 sometimes the game simply freezes but its rare good thing theres autosaves for every turn but only 10 of them
 its strange but just like in civ ai become highly passive when everything is researched superlate game 500 turns like why are you still playing no challenge for you then go have some sleep being disappointed in your decision 
 after 300400 turns everything becomes slow if it is due to units then why theres no fast unit moves option like in civ
 after 500 turns even sound starts to lag
it is possible that it isnt optimised for high amount of simultaneous calculations on nonhighend cpu so i experience lags

if i knew the state of the game i wouldnt buy it for this price but since i already did i will continue playing it anyway  it is still entertaining really

#####

honestly dont understand the mixed reviews maybe ive just got into it after a lot of improvements
game is like civ except i actually enjoy it its a fresh take on a tired formula same basic style of game but i find the differences all really interesting

taking inspiration from different civilisations and shaping your custom empire is really cool as well as creating your own custom leader i never liked the civ style of playing real historical figures in random fictional worlds

diplomacy options are complex enough to feel like it matters and can influence your playstyle different cultures and civics add a lot of replayability and the games graphical design  ui is incredibly clean as to be expected from an amplitude game

if youre like me and never really got into civilisation but always liked the idea of this type of game humankind might be worth a try

it starts out decent but falls apart so quickly there is a lot to like here i love the early game enjoy the general empire building but broken simultaneous turns the awful combat lifted directly from endless legend weird pacing and balance show them selves really quickly

#####

had fun for the most part but in my opinion two major issues make it not worth playing  one is with multiplayer only and it deals with connectivity  while playing with my fiance not more than five or so feet from each other using the same wifi that never gives us issue with any other multiplayer game we experienced consistent disconnects  and attempting to rejoin usually resulted in not being able to control the empire and having to restart from scratch  

the other major issue i see is one that affects enjoyment and any sort of attempt at completing a run in general  that being the war support mechanic  the gist of it as ive figured out from experience is when at war with another empire your people have to support the war effort against the enemy or youre forced to surrender and your empire is then made a vassal of that empire  meaning any sort of choice you had for culture religion etc is now null and void  you can not turn on the empire youve been forced into a vassalage of  and at that point you might as well restart from the beginning where it will most likely happen again when inevitably another empire has an issue with yours resulting in war since sometimes like real life diplomacy has been tried but doesnt work

if those issues are corrected in the future then i pick up the game again and my opinion might change  however as it currently stands i unfortunately do not  which is honestly disappointing since i absolutely adored the amount of choices to customize your empires throughout the eras  something ive never really seen in other games in this genre without the use of mods  

while i would hold out hope that these issues would be addressed looking at the amount of reviews pointing out the issues from the start that havent been even touched  im inclined to believe they wont and thus my opinion will remain the same  do not buy this youll just get depressed by the wasted potential and infuriated by the thought that maybe the publisher only wants the devs to push out more content rather than polish what is already there

#####

understandable why people would have dodged the game on release  now 2 years after theres really no argument against getting this game potentially even on sale
updates have been coming more than youd think after the launch and now the game is stable and fun many many cultures to choose from and just a fun and multifaceted 4x experience my favorite part are the different and flexible winning conditions all throughout the game you collect victory points in different categories instead of just passing a check at the end good stuff

#####

ive been playing these types of games since the 90s went through all the sid meiers stuff from civ2 onwards including alpha centauri man remember alpha centauri and many similar games i feel like lately firaxis has been confusing complexity with tedium and losing grip on what makes 4x well 4x and also fun this game has many issues including falling prey to the same aimless endgame thats been plaguing the genre since civs dumbed down their space race but it definitely is fun if anything i feel like it gives you too much fun in a single game since you can switch cultures several times with one civilisation on one hand no two playthroughs will be the same but at the same time youll see so much of the game it will feel like youve seen it all by the end and make you want to try it again less its absolutely worth its full price but dont kid yourself into thinking that youll get 800h out of it though again what youll get will at least almost all be fun

#####

1 new culture every era
2 endless legend style city management entertaining in its own way like other 4xs
3 beautiful map

definitely a breath of fresh air from civ

#####

tentatively recommended but see below

if you dont belong to the early adopter type you probably dont want to buy humankind right away as usual with aaa strategy titles civ iv v be possibly vi basically everything from paradox etc the game was released in an unfinished state halfbaked mechanics balance issues bugs unhelpful interface business as usual the whole hype wave cough magnum opus cough didnt exactly help there were just too many promises not to fail to deliver on and the rating shows it

its not as bad as the reviews tend to present though humankind can deliver some nice  novel experience even in the current state and the potential here is immense cultural progression district  territory management and combat subsystem all represent interesting even if messily executed ideas strategiclevel warfare the reviewers who dislike spending population on units or complain about war resolution system just dont grok it its awesome and trade system are already good as is civics and religion are just a hanging invitation for updates who said gk and bnw economy in general is the usual amplitude stuff after balancing will probably be slightly better than endless legend oh and it looks and sounds just fantastic

all in all humankind is an awesome concept and bpotentiallyb a great game for a general audience id advice to watch for updates

#####

in respect to the games reviews i am also mixed but lean to recommending the game its the only real civ competitor and it does a fresh take on gameplay strategy mechanics and style it has so much potential if was more flushed out and cleaned up but it falls short with its bugs balance progression and scoreboard 
somehow you can dominate global productiongrowthpopulationterritoryincomereligion have every other country as a vassal and yet still be the sixth best civilization i dont understand and maybe its just because im an old sid meiers dog but its hard not to compare a game like this to the most dominating title of the genre


#####

the main gimmick which is switching civs throughout the game actually just makes it less engaging  it doesnt feel like roleplaying a civ throughout history anymore and it gets super confusing when the other civs around you are constantly changing name  

declaring wars and fighting them is a huge pita and the ai is fairly buggy when it comes to surrendering and offering peace deals  conquering islands is also pretty broken

i do think the battle system is more fun and interesting than civ  its neat being able to control your armies on the battlefield work around terrain etc  you can be more tactical  downside is that the ai is terrible at battles so it gets boring pretty quickly

fwiw i think the paradox strategy games are better than civ in general so take this with a grain of salt  but i think civ yes even civ 6 is quite a bit better than humankind  i binged this long enough to get to the point where you can just nuke everyone on the planet and instawin and i dont think im going to play again

#####

this game is an organically developing project that continues to evolve over time  with each new update new things get added that make the experience of playing it more filled out  over time i look forward to seeing how it will continue to develop and you should really give it a go  its become one of my favorite games to come back to time and again

#####

buggy overpromised and underdeveloped integral systems to the game still need major reworks to become fun but theyre focused on developing paid dlc first laughable

#####

to you who has bothered to read my review i say this

its a nice new take on the 4x format i had fun playing a bunch of run throughs played with cheesy mechanics and had a lot of fun finding ways to work with underpowered cultures keep in mind that 4x format games naturally grow over time with rebalancing free and paid additional content and if theyre lucky a fledgling modding community 

i had fun im going to mess around with some mods on civ 6 and keep an eye on my feed for updates to humankind when i see one ill happily jump back in im glad i bought it i dont think theres a reason for controversy here and people are really reaching and just looking for more reasons to complain i have none and just ask the devs to keep it up i like where this is going

#####

i waited for quite a while after this games release so the developers could spot fix the many expected bugs that were bound to show up the negative reviews were a huge  deterance for me however i finally bought this game on sale because i just couldnt shake my curiosity  
what i found i must say was quite surprising the game was far more entertaining and unique compared to civ 6 the blending of cultures the terrain combat all are so much more in depth and fun i havent noticed any game breaking bugs and i find myself excited to pick this game back up each day 
my only wish at this present point is the game was a little slower so i can enjoy the eras more unique civilizationcity names and volcanos 
8510

#####

people are really giving this game alot of flak as far as i can tell this is a really well made game the systems work well and after an update or two most of the issues will be fixed just relax most civ games launched as hollow and bug filled messes give the devs a day or two to patch it up i think its great and has alot of potential with minimal patching required

#####

its a good empirebuilding game i enjoyed it more than civilization 5 or 6 but there are a lot of quirks that might irritate you i also wouldnt call it as good as endless legend or endless space 2 but nothing is as good as those games so it doesnt matter that much

i think people dont feel as immersed in this game because of all the cultureswitching there are 6 eras in the game and in every era you can switch to a new culture with its special affinity trait unit and building you are not dealing with aztecs for the whole game you deal with some archetype ai contenders like beowulf or victor and they get the cultures they want depending on the situation this means you get a lot of interesting combinations but theyre not very memorable and you yourself are likely to stick to the cultures you like unless the situation very much suggests you do something else and just to make clear the game is good at providing you with reasons to switch beyond the primitive want to go to war should switch to someone with a good unit mostly through affinities if youre doing well with research switching to scientific civ allows you to research beyond the current era if youre in a tough diplomatic position you can get a mercantile culture which allows buying your rivals resources through the third party aesthetic affinity allows you to quickly established your cultural influence over the lands you control and so on

it plays smoothly it plays fun endless legend is a similar game but some parts of that game got an undeserved focus like an overcomplicated combat system with wego indirect controls and plenty of stats and equipment  ive seen wargames that were less complex than a skippable part of that empire building game in humankind the combat is tactical fast and comprehensive and it still does a very good job of showing you issues with your grand strategy its all neatly tied together and well thoughtout all these numbers rise up exactly in the right way to tickle my brain sadly apart from culture selection  a questionable feature  its not as daring as other amplitudes games and much more conventional in most regards it doesnt have that thing with shaping of your empire through great deeds like eles2 gamedefining player sides grand cooperative quests and so on also being a historical game it must include a lot of features and cant get too deep into any era making each individual game feel both too long and not deep enough though i think it does a much better job at it than any of civ games

one last thing i really appreciate is that with the latest updates the ai is really decent and not in a cheap way its not like the usual 4x ai that is helpless after losing an early game war turning the whole experience into a waiting game you can have a game where you are a military and cultural hegemon but arent fast enough to conquer others and end up losing the game

#####

its not terrible but it is quite tedious i dont think i ever made it past the industrial era because id either get bored and restart or id get randomly gameendingly shafted by the airng combo sometimes hard to tell whats a bug and whats the result of an obtuse or poorly explained mechanic like having a hightier 6 unit army get instawiped by an enemys single scout unit having to babysit your units because they will inexplicably try and kill themselves at sea if you let the roam even when theres shallow water routes is annoying especially when the ai doesnt seem to have that problem

perhaps most egregious of all considering how much the voice lines are spammed in this game make the mistake of playing an agrarian culture and you will be hearing sarky comments about starvation in your dreams the vo is annoying as all holy hell sounds like an absolutely charmless knockoff of the narrator from the stanley parable i had to turn off all music and voices for the game by my second or third attempt because it was so annoying and repetitive

im not mad i tried this game because the sale price of 799 i think was fair but unless you are the sort of person who has unlimited patience for these types of games i really would not pay full price for it

#####

the game is slowly getting into a much better place the ibn battuta patch is a great step forward with amplitude finally looking at buffing cultures that youd only pick for roleplaying reasons as they were just that bad with the beta patch ive been having a lot of fun and even had to knock myself down a difficulty level as i found that the ai was much better than it used to be and is getting better at harvesting fame i cant recommend it for full price exactly as theres various mechanics that might not make it your cup of tea but if you were curious before the game is in a much better spot and is heading in the right direction

#####

choosing cultures isnt as interesting as it could be since theyre all just bonuses and no drawbacks besides those bonuses no culture really feels different from any other in my experience its also been out for almost a year now but im still running into games being ruined by the endless endturn timer bug

i wish cultures were more extreme like the differences in races in endless legends too

update every game i try to play of humankind ends up in an endless turn bug i give up on this game do not buy

new bolivar patch update endless turn bug on turn 10 i came crawling back to see if the new update had fixed it but no of course not its worse than ever

#####

tldr  overall a good game with interesting combat and empire managing mechanics that personally would place the game above civ for me biggest annoyance is bad voice acting for units

campaign
settings can be customised to a good degree  you can set it all the way up to no turn limit annihilation or anything in between

game play 
 early game is very interesting and promotes exploration and even combat to size good land

 up to medieval era things were interesting and decently paced renaissance era and tech went by too fast though before industrial era began and things slowed down to more enjoyable pace

 managing the empire is interesting
map is divided in small areas that you can take by building an outpost or a city in them one such entity per area you can group multiple areas with outposts into a province by attaching them to an area with a city this has benefits an drawbacks
bigger the province more unstable it can be
you build city improvements and recruit only in the provincial capital but you can build land improvements everywhere build queue is only one per  provincial capital

 waging war is not one dimensional
you need public opinion loose it and you loose the war do well and you can demand more land or money from you enemy when they surrender winning battles and gaining ground is important
when the enemy is ready to surrender you cant ignore it and steamroll them even if you have plenty of public opinion which is annoying 

 combat is great
when you engage an enemy a battle commences and a battlefield is laid out on the campaign map battle has multiple turns within one campaign turn and can span multiple campaign turns because of that armies that werent part from the start can be brought in terrain is very important high ground rivers trees 
maneuvering is important tactical  flanking on a battlefield with individual units or strategic  flanking on the big campaign map with another army stack to bring it into the battle at the enemys rear for example
your army has a camp on the battlefiled loose it and you are in trouble same goes for the enemy i quite like that historically that was a big factor in battles 
 
 diplomacy is meh
you cant plot with an independent nation to attack another one at least i couldnt figure it out how to do it if it actually exists

 research is standard with research points

 edicts are issued by social points

 each technological era gives you an actual real life civ to pick from  overall a good idea 
my issue with this however is purely visual  units dont look authentic clearly we might not know how hittite war outfits looked like exactly but we definitely know how industrial era brittish french and russian line infantry looked like and they definitely didnt look generic like in the game

 avatar thing feels like a gimmick

immersion
bunch of things that are annoying but not a deal breaker

 units except unique unit per civ you chose dont look visually authentic which imo should be corrected

 narrator is good the problem is that everyone else is talking as they are narrators 
voice actors voice their lines with a vigour of a damp rag cavalry charging into a wall of pikes and best they can do is say something with a passion of a bored teenager completely uninterested and with no energy

 visuals are nice artstyle is pleasing like research cards era cards nice but come on take it down a notch with female over representation in military combatant depictions on research cards an the like it just looks silly especially because the game follows real life nations as civilisations so it is not a make believe scenario they werent 5050 part of a city militia either

 placement of notification menu is the most annoying of any strategy game i have ever played it is bottom right next to the end turn button so notifications pop out to the left and up which blocks a decent amount of screen in the middle i dont care to know about famine for 5th turn in a row i got it the first time

#####

solid 110 game terrible interface badly implemented systems terrible balancing ai cheating to the point of it being unwinnable even on easy modes and a giant mess of a game definitely not a civilization competitor this game is the 4x equivalent of a 7th unofficial straighttovhs sequel of a bad b movie from the 80s filmed in a low budget studio in uzbekistan 

i played it on game pass when it came out to test it  was horrible then a quick uninstall i bought it on sale now hoping that itd be improved and its even worse quickest refund request of my life

#####

ive played every version of civ since 1991 i really enjoyed endless space and i somewhat enjoyed endless legend so i had high hopes for humankind  sadly this game is just appallingly bad  even on the lowest difficulty the ai will steamroll you maps are very cluttered with literally only two or three provinces to occupy before you get hemmed in by neighbors the interface is cluttered with irrelevancies but hides key information and theres no  fucking  minimap  this game is just trash not worth the 10 i spent on it  i wouldnt play it if it was free

the graphics are pretty but by trying to be more realistic than civ they made it even harder to tell apart buildings resources terrain types and units  the narrator isnt terrible  the idea of adopting different cultures as the game progresses is an interesting one though its hard to justify inuniverse  the tactical combat zoomin is an interesting idea but doesnt add much to the game and it makes battles take far more time this was done long ago in civilization call to power but in that game it was faster easier and had just as much combined arms strategy

no minimap  seriously amplitude wtf

#####

i have put seventeen hours into this game and i just uninstalled it 

 the game mechanics consisted of civ vi with some gimmicks the few things i considered actual improvements over the civ model combat outposts and territories cultural influence religion were ruined by the following point
 the game balance is atrocious i cant even tell you if the game was hard or easy because succeeding seemed completely random sometimes the ai would rush and overwhelm me in the second era sometimes i would be left completely alone for the entire game sometimes i would consistently dominate battles and sometimes i would be annihilated in one turn some games the districts took five turns to build some games they took fifteen turns i had no idea what was causing what it felt like throwing wet paper towels at the wall and hoping they would stick 
 the core gimmick changing cultures is a double bind disguised as a feature you either take your time generating fame the win condition and end up having to pick the leftover cultures not taken by the ai or you rush to get the culture you want and find out a hundred turns later that you simply dont have enough era stars left to generate the fame you need to win 
 there is no setting to control the distance between ai spawn locations sometimes you will spawn on a continent almost by yourself and literally not meet anyone for the first hundred turns sometimes you will spawn surrounded by other ais curtailing your expansion whereas one lucky ai gets their own continent and inevitably steamrolls to the point where they have three times as much fame as you do 
 military units consume population to build that sounds like a sensible feature until you realize that disbanding units gives you the population back meaning that the best way to repopulate a settlement is to immediately disband several armies in its territory basically forcibly relocating your own population by way of a workaround this also means you cant disband units outside of your territory meaning that on more than one occasion i signed a peace treaty and found my units trapped between a mountain wall and an impassable enemy city unable to move or even be disbanded also nuclear missiles also cost population i assume the payload consists of radioactive babies 
 there is a persistent bug where the end turn timer loops infinitely this forces you to restart it happened often enough that i felt like eating my monitor 
 i have no idea how pollution works and neither does the ai

#####

tldr sad to say but i have to give humankind a big thumb down roman gladiator style this game is positively disappointing and id much like to refund it

long rant  
of course you have to compare humankind to other endless games as well as the civ series and it does simply nothing better than any of those  
lets go for one of the two big nogoes and one of the biggest selling points of humankind the mixing of civilizations cultures and styles its nonexistent weak and clicheed to boot  
in every era you get 7 cultures to choose from they are strictly aligned to the prefered playstyle  science production food expansion fame money war its also clicheed af  the greeks gave us science the mongols are dumb brutes etc

lets say you want to play a full sciencenerd you have to choose the babylonians first then the greeks  teutons or umayyads  joseon  british or french  and finally the swedes if somebody else was first and picked the greeks for the second era kiss your pure playstyle goodbye  
and heres where things get utterly effin boring as this matters a lot  and yet not at all
see what was advertised was that you create your own unique civ in praxis what happens is you pick the babylonians eg you build their specific district for some boni then you pick the greeks and  forget you ever played the babylonians in the first place the district will still be around but its not noticeable more on that in a moment you will keep the legacy trait and in this case a slight sciencebonus  but its just changing a few numbers a few boni  and in the long run those numbers will decide the game in pvp 
but opticwise playwise from your leader your clothes your cities it will all now just look greek etc some things dont even change at all like music or available wonders and from a glance you cant even tell whether you play the greeks or the romans or any other volk either because youd have to zoom in so close you will not do that in a 4x game the graphics arent good enough to really marvel at your buildings or troops anyway but on top of that everything looks the same between civscultures  the districts for food production money  its all the same 
this leads to a problem the endless games already suffered from you have one giant megaspawn of a city where you just randomly add districts whereever the numbers dictate a plus because you cant really tell the districts apart anyway and proper cityplanning isnt as valueable as more industry output to add just plainly moar of everything always the same 
in conclusio that means that while choosing the rightwrong cultures for your playstyle will be essential it will always feel very much the same and get old and boring fast 

 in the same vein just as you can only choose between 7 different cultures instead of at least 20 or so each time youre advancing you can also only choose from a very limited group of opponents despite the game having a charactereditor you cant freely edit your rulers ai or name nor can you create several rulers on your own like in age of wonders or stellaris so if you prefer big games you will have a run in with exactly the same personalities every single time boring 

 its also a strange mix of historical rulers like hammurabi personalities like edgar allen poe for some reason and generics or at least i dont know any historically significant lucy and im a historican so yeah 

now lets mention a few minor grievances

 upon reloading rulers change the names personalities etc stay in place but for some reason the character models switch yesterday you dealt with lucy now you deal with poe in nubian clothing strange but whatever  bugs happen  

 some options reset too go enjoy the 05 scrolling speed upon reload also whats with the abyssimal scroll speed in the first place even full speed is a creepy crawl poorly tested poorly implemented this is a reccuring theme for the game really

 if you conquer all enemy cities you havent won just yet if they have just one tiny little unit left somewhere they can just place an outpost which they can freely turn into a city within a few turns if you play on a big landmass enjoy a long and unnecessary game of hide and seek poorly thought out

 speaking of stupid wars my loss is near why because my war readiness is approaching zero towards the nubians 
my war readiness towards my longstanding alliance partners who are just passively sitting there doing nothing  ok so what i dont plan on having a war with them anyway lucy allan poe is my bff despite hisher identitycrisis why do i get spammed with notifications that would only make sense if we were in active war  

 in the same vein you get spammed with asinine notifications a lot oh no my city of ligma balls is in the sphere of influence of the assyrians how awful i guess not much i can do to change that but thanks for keeping me posted

 sphere of influence you ask why yes thats a thing apparently 
influence and religion are things that happen passively unlike in the civ series you do not recruit priests or great personalities to really influence anything happening it just does and you are left to wonder why how or what for if you check the screens for influence or religion you may see that youre utterly dominating basically converting your entire island within a few turns but still the notifications make it sound like something bad is happening talk about news outlets and fear mongering amirite

 speaking of asinine humankind got the worst diplomacy ive ever seen in any 4x game including the other endless games now thats impressive as diplomacy is always bad in 4x games but here you have literally no options whatsoever i mean it you cant gift gold influence cities units techs or anything you cant even try to sweeten a deal for crying out loud 
its just hey lucy poe comrade how about this treaty that would give us both a sweet 5 bonus on influence  no  damn 
why lucy poe even refused no clue for some reason she accepted my random alliance proposal within 3 turns of meeting her and then just rejected every other treaty offer since despite clear benefits for both of us it makes no sense and i have no way to actively influence her positively either
grievances etc arent any more complex either it just plays out the same 
you attacked my unit now i demand 200 gold  nah  k  
sometimes counteroffers are made which boils down to no  but maybe if you also pay 200 gold 
its literally the only way diplomacy isnt just straight up a yesno switch kinda deal 

as for the trade any trading with ressources works via a buyin concept if a treaty to allow trade is in place you can pay a forward sum and then use their ressource if you place an extractor on your ressource any ai with open tradetreaties will instantly buy in trade routes are then done automatically they can be ransacked then they need to be paid for again thats it thats the entire trade and diplomacy options
thats downright pathetic  

but not as pathetic as the second big nogo of humankind the longest play time duration endless is 600 turns 
600 turns  in a 4x game 
thats the warm up phase ffs
that alone  while easily fixable  is not just a complete no go but moreso its just so stupid and baffling as a decision custom victory conditions should be a genre standard but somehow humankind didnt get that message  
mix the few turns and the very limited opponents and cultures bad balancing and lacking options in pretty much every aspect and the game feels super tiny and lacking whereas it should feel epic and grand

maybe this will be a nice game in 23 years with several dozen dlcs right now 20 would be too much

#####

as a longtime civilization player i thought id give this a shot theres certainly more of an rng aspect to the gameplay but i felt that it too often renders your strategy useless  so much of the game is just spent waiting for a lucky event you might get without anything to do otherwise even on low difficulty your starting location and random events determine your success more than any chosen actions though there are choices the civics cultures to choose each era no one choice seems to have any significant effect on the likelihood of winning

because of the spheres of influence or whatever theyre called outposts cant be built too far from the starting location and theres little incentive to explore moreover the heavy penalty on expanding your empire is annoying  if you settle too many cities you lose them or have negative purple stars per turn but unless you get a good starting location you dont have access to other resources

war is completely useless for example a war started with a neighbor but not outright won eg your opponent didnt mount any significant defense or retaliatory attack results in a huge cash penalty that you have no opportunity to negotiate speaking of trade is also functionally useless with no discernible benefit to engaging with it at all

though there are other civilizations in the game theres no discernible way to measure their success against yours whatever successful strategy the computer uses is inscrutable

overall humankind is different than civ but not a competitor in my opinion barely an alternative maybe i was expecting more and my opinion is certainly clouded by my experience with civ but im not going to spend 100 hours to figure out this game that is in my experience a waiting simulator

#####

i have very much enjoyed the time ive spent with humankind so far imo it makes a number of muchneeded updates to the civ formula the broad strokes of which seem to be focused on improving gameplay sometimes this is served by trying to be more immersive and sometimes its by letting some immersion go theres two aspects in particular i want to focus on cultures and combat
lets start with cultures a lot of people seem to find changing cultures every era pretty jarring and from an immersion perspective i agree that being said i think the gameplay culture hopping enables more than makes up for it civ cultures generally steer you towards one gameplan focused on one era in particular hks cultures allow you to shift up your strategy on a regular basis and because you get a new one every era your culture remains relevant in every era it just feels way more textured plus if were talking about immersion isnt it weird to meet the united states in 4000bc
as for combat this is where hk really shines its always bugged me how battles and wars in civ last so damn long when you look at the amount of ingame time that elapses each turn hk doesnt really fix the length of wars but battles generally get resolved in a single turn on top of that the battles themselves are much more interesting primarily due to how complex the terrain can get you still have the option of just throwing your units at theirs and seeing who wins but actually controlling the units yourself can turn a minor victory into an overwhelming one
hk is not a perfect game i have run into some bugs some systems can be pretty opaque and others definitely need some work in particular the hk congress can wreck your government if you havent built up swayinfluence and the fact that triggering a game end doesnt necessarily mean you win just feels weird also please add coop victories that being said for whatever reason hk is the game that captivated me enough to care to learn it if youre on the fence id encourage you to give it a shot theres plenty of fun to be had 

#####

the game is solid but has its flaws the biggest issue is that devs seem to ignore feedback and are stubborn to stick to their initial design choices people did expect a lot of changes after 10 release but they never came it left the game in 6510 state with huge potential and a lot of wasted opportunities

#####

its fun i prefer civilization vi but this is still enjoyable my only issue is that you arent allowed to continue building the emblematic quarters and units of cultures that you previously played as i dont understand why you cant continue to build them they stay in cities that already have them quarters that is so why not continue to make them in new cities

#####

decent 4x with fresh approach to 4xcivlike needs a good year of development wait for 30 sale

#####

i dont get why humandkind is still in mixed review its a great game well polished a gem in the genre that shows a different path than the established norms despite its flaws it deserves much better

#####

i wanna like this game because the concept is interesting but the execution is messy game is very imbalanced and most of what you have to do turn to turn has nothing to do with earning fame points which is how to win the game you are forced to play one way essentially neutralizing the blended culture mechanic also there are a lot of bugs

#####

the biggest problem with this game is that turns are simultaneous even against the ai i dont really have a problem with the ai beating out the player every turn i can just assume humans go last the problem is that this doesnt apply during war suddenly the ai is smart enough to wait for you to take your actions so they can counter move against your units in the middle of your turn the implication is that youll almost never get first turn advantage against the ai in combat which is a huge deal the game lacks endless legends initiative system so all units on one side take their turn giving them a huge advantage as they can kill off one or two units before the defender can act 

this is a shame because there seems to be an interesting game here but the combat is just not fair for the player

#####

after having played humankind for a while i have come to the current final conclusion that this game is very well made while theres a slight imbalance with certain civilizations being very strong when compared to others they are each a valid situational choice trade is incredibly important in order to become a great power and much more important than in civ
the ui needs some work and infrastructure buildings need to tell you how much production you gain through them to allow a less focused player to easily see if its better to place another makers quarterindustrial district or invest in upgrading existing ones or exploiting more ressources from specific tiles like forests the only really broken nation i see so far has been the khmer which have a ridicilous emblematic district in the middle ages
but now onto the pros and cons compared to civ6

pros
much better early game and early game balance
starting positions dont matter as much as you explore before settling down
many possible strategies due to various civilization combinations with your terrain
combat is much better than in civ and terrain really matters a lot and the defensive planning of a city can make a major difference
early ages are very fun to play later ages have intresting evolutions in warfare though the modern age is the weakest currently
no broken city states and great people which determine wether you win or fail
war is costly in population and is not a industry to profit equation


cons

leaders have a much weaker personality due to not being historical figures
lack of identification with one culture as you switch several times you become less attached and look more at modifiers
very district heavy gameplay and certain ressources like industry are much preferable to gold and such farmers are a useless specialist unless you have modifiers or need more pops


taste depending
less comical graphics i hated the comic style of civ 6
each culture has their own unit sprites i see it as a big pro but it has nothing to do with gameplay


from the list aswell as my small summary i can say this game is a worthy competitor to the civilization franchise especially as civ 6 turned into a dlc leader hell

#####

pros
 very attractive game design
 gorgeous dynamic terrain
 difficulty scaling is way more fun than similar titles as most bonusses only apply to the ai when they are behind
 a lot of versatility in your game depending on what you want to focus on
 eras feel unique and different because of new mechanics being introduced gradually 
 diplomacy is way more subtle and extensive than in civ6 vassalization and client states enforcing demands actual governing ethics discovering natural wonders gives a dibs mechanic
 a lot of variety in strategies havent even come close to trying everything yet
 cool comeback mechanics
 big fan of the cultural wonders mehcanics requiring them to be claimed and requiring multiple cities to build this makes them feel unique and way more rewarding


cons
 it can be hard to find information especially at first
 mechanics are explained but hard to keep track of game can be very difficult because of this
 almost guaranteed to lose the first game if you dont know what you are doing 
 simultaneous turns makes the ai do funky shit sometimes i had to rush through a peace deal because an ai would vassalize my enemy first would be great if ais do their peace deals at the end of the turn

 the game is difficult to understand if you do not enjoy cracking game mechanics and learning how to use them to your advantage this game is not for you
 being able to cultureswitch every era is a bit too much for me but also allows for some nice rp celtsteutonsgermans or mykenosgreeksbyzantines 
 this last one is hard to put into words we have been brough up with the belief that certain cultural tenets are endemic to certain peoples i experienced a lot of cognitive dissonance to see western aztec eagle warriors as well as asian conquistadors or latinamerican janissaries it is strange to see cultures swapped to seemingly drastically different cultures i kind of like it even though it was very offputing at first

all in all a very unique experience i expect to come back to the game every once in a while would definitely recommend 810

#####

this is a great game 

it is not a civ killer 

that doesnt mean it should be really its a different experience in my opinion now if were comparing release to release it probably would have been a civ killer civ vi sucked when it first came out more bugs than the amazonian jungle and just plain bad design decisions like no sentry feature on units but comparing humankind unfairly i might add to the current state of civ with dlcs in place and player mods galore its not a threat to that game 

but in six years when humankind has dlcs out the wazoo and is letting players mod the game i expect it will be amazing beyond what civ vi is now 

all that said i just completed my first game this morning and i had a great time 

things i like being able to risk my ships to travel the ocean the science and civics system the terrain is beautiful the movement system the game is polished and relatively bug free i liked how resources worked well done in that regard devs 

things i dont like only one way to win being unable to siege islands because you cant attack cities while embarked with land units i dont like the culture system i dont want to change from japanese to roman to byzantine i want to pick my starting culture and be given options for changing that culture in the direction i like not entirely change my society in some unrealistic way 

all in all i give this game 8 out of 10 which is a higher rating than id give my girlfriend so i consider it  a winner

#####

could be a decent game even after a year of updates it isnt too many dumb things still happening battles dont make sense city caps and limitations are annoying rather than challenging smoother and nicer to look at than civ most of the time but not as good the units shifting around randomly before battles ruins the game

still after the first dlc the game is deliberately unfun war score mechanic is bad city cap is still bad units moving around while 20 star popups appear is bad waste of money and a waste of potential modding support is also poor far too many stupid things in the game that are easily fixed

#####

810

the first thing i will say is this is not endless space ii nor is it endless legend i constantly wish they would just redesign some of the ui that was in endless space ii i dont get why it wasnt done that way the game can get buggy and it has three really fun peaks opening high midgame and early endgame this would be neolithic era medieval and early contemporary all that being said what the hell is everyone else on about this game is fun and innovative if you are like me and get frustrated at how combat and numbers oriented civilization is play this game heres a list of the mechanics i thoroughly enjoy about this game

1 the neolithic era turns opening into a fun minigame where you get to explore more before planting your first city dont be reckless but also move quickly it really feels like footsies in a fighting game

2 the era point system benefits wide play instead of fast play just because you have the science to progress doesnt mean you should spend time building up your empire or leveraging relationships and building trade routes there are more points to earn playing a complete empire versus a technologically progressive one

3 african cultures are the money civs wanna get rich play african im so happy to play a game where african history is celebrated in some way

4 diplomacy stealth and intelligence can literally end wars its so much harder to go to war and wipe someone out you are actually incentivized to resolve your problems in other ways which is really neat because you can i once defeated a superior force by trapping their army in a demilitarized zone and then using the trespassing points to lower their peoples sense of legitimacy towards the war saving myself long enough to get strong

5 making any unit takes actual population so now food generation is critical to maintaining an army and certain civs can sap your population stopping you from forming an army and growing or maybe you do that to someone else and use your new found population to thrive 

6 you can create a personalized avatar that your friends can use in their games and its actually fun to me the ai for the avatar will mirror your play style even down to your diplomatic tendencies

tldr  this game is not endless space ii but to say that amplitude has stopped trying to innovate is false this game is fun worth the purchase imo and something to build on when humankind 2 comes out 810

#####

so this game can use a few changes but it is nothing too big mostly minor adjustments to game flow its like civ 6 but it feels faster the changing of cultures is cool theres 60 total 10 for each era i wish theyd add more that you get for each culture combat is like civ but more fleshed out with tactics that matter all together a very good 4x game politics seems deep but its mid tier and really easy to abuse as a warmonger will probably spend more time in it you should buy this so the devs add more content

#####

this has a lot going for it but i ultimately find it a somewhat disappointing 4x game its not all bad but i prefer most of the competition for this kind of game the art is beautiful except the strategic map looks bland some of the ideas are fresh but mid game felt like it was mostly about unit battles and the other mechanics fall flat food balance seems off i found myself forced to mainly focus on balancing food with a less unit based strategy and that make it worse than just building more units for a 4x thats been out over a year now it feels like the systems are pretty unbalanced for anything but the conquest win condition

i do like the ideas of the cultural evolution but i also miss the identity you get from having one civilization identity in civ 6 or one empire in something like stellaris it might be something you get used to but it just felt odd in the couple quick games i played

linux support is pretty good it ran reasonably well on the steam deck with lower settings

#####

cant recommend until aplitude puts in some serious work into rebalancing and polishing this game balance especially needs some very big changes particularly in regards to tech and era progression as its extremely common almost guaranteed for games to end with everyone in the contemporary era but with their tech still stuck back near the end of the medieval era unless the you as the nonai player specifically goes hard into science i mean specifically focusing it all game youre probably not going to see anything from the last half of the tech tree regardless of whether you win or lose the famestars system is just all out of whack with tech i get wanting to do something different but it needed a lot more play testing

that being said keep an eye on it given aplitudes track record for supporting their games for a very long time after release it will probably improve significantly as time goes on

#####

better than civ 6 worse than civ 5

#####

i will start the review by saying it very straightforward and plain i love this game i did when i played the beta and i still do now finally i find a civlike game where the ai is pretty damn decent the 4x  xplore xpand xploit xterminate is done great and the ai is one of the reasons i didnt see the ai cheating  i saw it carefully picking fights even attacking at a disadvantage if the ai thought they can win i loved the fact that i drew meaning all units died 2 vs 1 scouts which is overwhelmingly winning for me fight on instant resolve  meaning the ai took the high ground defended stayed there until it was resolved that is a super refreshing feature of the game  we lacked this in all 4x games until now

so lets quickly go through the good the gray actually bad will be just a matter of preference i would say

the good

1 the civilizations as your story  i found it awesome creating and tweaking my own civilization which in the end was an amalgamation of 7 different reallife cultures of the world starting as harappans through teutons and finishing as the swedes i was thoroughly entertained and wanted to try different combos and builds to experience a different way the game is played

2 the wonders and the map  the map is layered out on a few levels which affect movement attack states and vision which is once again awesome the map is super easy to read and moving on it is very intuitive the features on it and especially the wonders you build are super well laid out and visible from afar even if the wonder you build was 200 turns ago moving around the map will make you focus on it due to its sheer size and remember the time you actually struggled to get it done i miss games that really make me think about the earlier turns  especially since the wonders in civilization 6 are relatively unimpressive on the map

3 the fights and the ai  i will praise this game for the fighting system and its ai to oblivion while good players will still find ways to exploit the ai i loved how the ai masterfully used the systems to win battles while i can clearly see that the ai is sometimes destroying itself in your units when you are at a clear advantage i also saw sparks of genius  the ai staying on tiles on the map which would make it very hard to attack them and to boot defending on those tiles instead of making random moves  opting to rather leave the fight to the next turn of the game if the battle is not resolved within 3 battle turns it rolls over to the next game turn now add to this the ability to add multiple units to the fight providing they are close by this is exactly what i want from a game to feel sufficiently entertained

the gray areas of the game  these can be good or bad depending on your preference

1 the maps  the random map generator may put you in a great spot or a bad spot this can be both good or bad and while it presents a different challenge if one or more of the ais are running away with the game and you are struggling to settle it is never a fun time equally if you have a good start and they have a bad start it is you who will be running away with the game  which is pleasant but may feel too easy

2 the map display  the map is displayed on the screen in a way that will either make you love it or hate it the gray areas or colored areas to display various statistics are good but some will find them super annoying potato mcwhiskey comes to mind

3 map awareness  it is super frustrating how the pathfinding is tied to map awareness if you want to move to a tile in the fog the game will base it on map awareness and how much of the map have you explored this means it will take the best way based on pure map knowledge which could be the worst one possible is it realistic yes is it irritating yes again

4 religion is an addon to help your overall plan for the game  while this can be a negative it is realistic religion is all about bringing people together and serving the state the first one is awesome and the second is sad

5 you can lock in wonders  while it is an awesome thing as it allows you to build that wonder at your own pace it can also be a negative fighting for wonders has been a mainstay of the civilization games and if you are used to it you may dislike this feature

conclusion

this game is an easy buy if you want a game that is different enough from civilization but has a similar feel it is for you mixing and matching cultures is super fun and adapting to the world you live in is very satisfying unlike civilization the ai is actually a challenge and does not seem to cheat units and resources midgame just to keep you occupied which is awesome is the game worth the full price i would say yes if you can spend the cash but at the same time no if the current world situation affected you negatively at 25 or more off i will 100 recommend it

as such i am very very happy to give humankind the score of

h11010h1

for the amusement it gave me and the refreshing ai improvements which in the end is all you want is a single player 4x game civilization beware

love the new take on 4x and these differences from civ
 new outpost  city  settlement borders mechanic
 new combat mechanic
 perera civ selection
 civ types specializations ie food  prod  science  gold  influence culture  expansionist  militarist yes they even differentiated this from expansionist lol
 policies enacted through passives with a onetime influence culture cost instead of having to wait until new civic unlocked or paying gold
 random events with options that have both shortterm effects and longterm implications in the form of future  events and policy choices
 multifaceted fame score mechanic
 independent peoples replaces barbs with neutral camps that have more diplo options
 war support and new grievances for war system
 trade implemented through diplomacy and controlling trade route regions instead of manually sending trader units without any diplo
 cleaner more modern ui

#####

the balance is more than a little screwy at the current time but ive still had more fun playing this game than civ 6 and close to as much fun as civ 5 its basically taken all the best things about endless legend combined it with the best aspects of the district system from civ 6 and then added a whole new system in the ability to change cultures each era when you layer that on top of the era star system giving you mini objectives in each era ive found myself more likely to stay invested in a game of humankind than any other 4x game ive ever played

its not perfect yet but considering that it takes civ games years to really hit their stride i cant wait to see where amplitude can take humankind

#####

you want new civ this aint it chief endless legend with the fantasy and interesting bits stripped out and replaced with real earth switching culturescivs in the middle of the game sounds interesting is terrible one minute youre trading with egyptians next you are fighting celts complete chaos combined with bad balancing and an ai who seems to cheat during the move order and maybe elsewhere

#####

to keep it short it has become a solid and fun game now with together we rule sure there is grind and there is annoyance with the ai and certain features sometimes but you will experience the same with any civ game too
that being said comparing those two games doesnt really do justice to either

if you like 4x games and you can get it on sale you should get it

#####

i finished two play throughs with humankind and i enjoyed in thoroughly the game balance is still off and both playthroughs felt too easy even in the second playthrough in the higher difficulty it is too easy to snowball in the end game and just dominate everything i think this is fixable and i am awaiting future patches to make humankind a more balanced experience

a fair bit of warning for people like me that fall pray to the one more turn addiction on both playthroughs i experienced sore red eyes like a diablo monster after a long night playing all this from staring at the monitor and being so hooked that i forgot to drink or sleep i think games should be designed with features that make playing them less painful an ingame clock not just in the menu would be a good first step like in rimworld reminders after each hour to make a break like in the anno series is another idea that comes to my mind games like humankind are so focused on making their players addicted to the core gameplay loop that they forget about the health of their players this is also fixable and i hope the developers take my feedback seriously


#####

before you buy this title 

multiplayer is not working

sad to see devs did not repair sync problems after 2 years from the release

for me this sucks cause games like this are dependent on a good and working multiplayer community
after 34 singeplayer runs its not challenging anymore this is where mp should take over

that being said if there is a sale you can pick this one up and play a few singeplayer rounds  you will have fun for a few rounds

#####

if you are looking for a complete game with no glitches keep moving game is good and it will stop working at some point you can spend hours playing and building a great empire end up in a stuck loop that wont continue on the turn you will find yourself stuck in a loop that you cant load a game into anymore and u will start all over again for a complete game this is complete garbage do the research this is a problem everyone is having and developers do not fix this game is not worth the money at all why pay for something you will spend countless hours to find out you cant continue to play after x amount of turns over 285 hrs played and this issue has just killed this game for me complete garbage for a finished product

#####

i got about two paragraphs into writing a longwinded review when i decided to just condense it down into my real objections to this game which are that the culture shift gimmick does nothing to make the game more fun and that this game has absolutely nothing else going for it to make it preferable to playing yet another game of civilization i also do not like how the narrator in this is snarking at me all the time because hes certainly not funny

#####

the balance is nonexistent the late game passes in a bored blur  like scrolling twitter at 2am  and the weak civic culture and religion systems make it difficult to feel the continuity and identityactualisation promised by humankinds marketing but as the most beautiful and ambitious 4x game in recent years with by far the best ui its an easy recommend 

there will be updates and patches when we dont know we dont know if theyll work either will it ever work on mac without streaming dunno again

the frustration here is justified but the rating disproportionate the man raised on mcdonalds makes an exaggerated performance of disgust when he eats florentine steak because he thinks it needs a touch more salt

#####

combat mechanics fresh graphics fresh concept fresh everything else wack there really is no focus on empire building if your not constantly at war or constantly competing for research with the ai you get absolutely smoked in the late game all the effort you put in the early game goes to waste pretty quickly if you cant read the ai quickly which is like herding cats some could argue its a fun challenge but there is a difference between a polished challenging game and an unfinished product most of the things they are currently adding to the game should have been there from the jump the civ series remains the gold standard

#####

game has gotten better since release give it a go

#####

most of the bugs are resolved especially the game breaking ones they also did a great job expanding the game as they debugged the game late game bugs still exist which can get annoying but overall i really enjoy the game the war strategy in this game is very innovative and implemented very well my favorite part of the game if you are coming from more traditional strategy games you might get frustrated a bit first but once you learn the new war system you will enjoy it a lot

#####

im so disappointed that i cant bring myself to like this game the core mechanic of cultural evolution is both underwhelming and alienating to play with  at best being able to switch which civilizationculture youre playing as between eras allows you to refocus your play style to suit the current situation you find yourself in at worse however it makes the entire game feel soulless skin deep and as another reviewer put it entirely schizophrenic you dont wonder what your neighbors are up to you wonder what group theyre larping as this era and then you continue ignoring them entirely not you or the other aiplayers feel like they have any actual identity while youre playing outside of a purely mechanical sense this is an absolute failure in my opinion having all the interesting and diverse cultures you can play as get reduced to modifiers such as 2 stability for all districts and a quick paint job to how your cities look is just depressing 

none of this is to even go into the balance issues with cultures like the huns being able to have their signature unit conduct osmosis via raiding a perk that far outstrips any other unique unit at the time but hey at least thats interesting and gives them some historical flavor right after all if i you cant have a literal horde as the huns then whats the point tragically none of the other cultures unique units even approach being as interesting outside of maybe the siamese elephant mounted gatling gunner it all feels so sanded down and safe for some reason that applies to every mechanic too from the faith system boiling down entirely to having more believers gives you more buffs to trade only existing in the form of buying resources from someone else faith doesnt even earn you progression to the next era and the money you get from selling access to resources wont even scratch the surface of the amount you need to progress through wealth the only thing left to do that meaningfully contributes to your progression then is city development and war war however is locked behind how much population you can spare as every military unit built depopulates the town that made it which puts into context why the huns and their asexually reproducing hordes are such a problem so better get invested in your larping communitys town layout because thats what youre gonna be focused on 90 of the game 

this might be a good game in 6 months with dlc and amplitude giving the design a good hard look right now the most fun you can have with it is either by playing with friends and dunking on their oc avatars or minmaxing to screw with the rather weak ai humankind doesnt offer anything to the 4x genre right now that isnt done better elsewhere and that stings because amplitude has done this in a far more interesting manner more than once before 



#####

i came here looking for an alternate scratch for the civ itch that regularly plagues rts players from time to time luckily this is nothing like civ and steps into its own right as a world history civilization simulation strategy game say that 5 times fast

to those of us familiar with sids game getting your basic feel for the turns movement and general layout of hud features will be like a distant muscle memory to those first starting out in this genre and comparing the two humankind has a certain simplicity to the user interface than civ simply lacks on all accounts what once was a learning curve preventing id say many of us from enjoying the first 100 turns of the game vastly filled with pain stakingwiki reading tutorial tip popupping moments that drag on like the centuries is now stripped back and raw showing you just enough to understand what is going on in your current focus without detracting from the absolute stellar topographical map design to add the audio cues of forests deserts and seaside cliffs play when zoomed in closer to the corresponding tiles and itsits just fantastic 

i could go on but seriously if you want something strategic but adaptive a pace you can control and historical witty oneliners voiced over as the lens of modernity humankind is for you

#####

a lot of people say that humankind is unbalanced or much less complex than civilization id say dont let these people deter you from buying the game

i think the biggest problem with humankind is that people dont get the era star fame system fame is the game deciding factor the player with the most fame wins the game 

while the complexity of civ comes from the plethora of small decision you have to make the complexity of humankind comes from the fame system every decision in this game revolves around the question how do i manage to have the most fame at the end of the game that forces you to make decisions that slow your progress in order to earn era stars which give you fame 

if you play the game like civ ignore the fame and rush through the ages then yes the game is very simple and repetitive as you basically dont have to decide anything what to build next is usually a no brainer so of course every round feels just like the last and to be fair the game does incentivize this because the ai on easy settings also rushes techscultures

but if you play in multiplayer or on higher difficulty in singleplayer you learn very fast that this is not the way the game is intended to be played as you will lose to players that  if this was civ  are behind you and thats why in my opinion humankind manages to be more complex than civ with less micromanagement as you have fewer but more impactful decisions to make

#####

pros
combat system is cool
cant get wonders sniped from you
endgamevictory conditions are neat

cons
prone to slowdown lategame esp w many players
some ui elements clunky
playing through combat lategame is often less beneficial than having the game autoresolve it in one turn
narrator telling you for the 1000th time about your first ransackyour citizens waistlinesreaching the end of an ideology axis


#####

it feels a little overwhelming i loved civilization 4 through 6 for how easy it is to get into the core mechanics but this feels like its trying to mimic civilizations ease but none of the ui feels intuitive and the tutorial feels like its trying to tell a story rather than tell you how to play theres an overwhelming amount of information provided at each turn and i prefer the turnbased style of civilization as its easier to think rather than trying to contend with a computer which can make a dozen moves before youve even thought of your first i like the ideas of the core mechanics but the executions feels lacking its definitely deserving of its mixed reviews

#####

tldr this game is different than civ for me there are elements that make it much more fun and enjoyable and i am steadily progressing up with difficulty levels nation comfortably now combat mechanics are one of the best features ability to change game style with each period and culture is a great way to adapt to the current situation in game needs improvement perhaps but i still enjoy it more than civ

i havent really experienced bugs or crashes but i dont play multiplayer
i love the design ui combat system so much better than civ i like the cultures where you can adapt your strategy to situations

i saw in some reviews that there are cultures that are the best maybe i dont think so in my last gameplay i took maasai culture i was originally planning to take something else  some building culture but i was right to choose this one the massive cut to food consumption allowed me basically to move all of my workers to industry money and science and gain in all 3 areas

i think for all the people used to civ where the meta and best choices are so definite that 1 bad positioning of a district can screw your whole city development so you have to basically memorize all of the things from the technology tree knowing what you will want to build where 100 turns in advance that they dont appreciate the adaptiveness that humanking provides

i agree with some arguments  like the trade options are a bit unexplained or that there could be more mechanisms for bargaining and some small quality of life improvements has been added



#####

the game has a lot of potential but it still needs a lot of work 
1 the war point system is weird because even if you win against your opponent you are forced to end the war and lose cities you conquered because oh no you got 150 points in this war and a city costs 80 to keep so you cant keep 2 cities
2 some cultures are underwhelming to say the least making games really similar since you got with a lot of the same cultures
3 the ai picks the same cultures at the start of the game making for example the nubians impossible to get unless you get lucky or rush to the next age
4 ai is really predictable 
5 you cannot create custom ai avatars to fight againstyes you are only able to make your own avatar and they give you other ai from rare events so it gets pretty stale
6 random map generation is boring too if you want a chaotic weird shaped map thats not going to happen without mods civ 6 had a better map generation 
7 the religion system is really bland and passive i didnt even notice it when i started at first
8 production is king and gold scales so badly late game its not really worth it 
9 connection problems in online matches
the game will follow the civ 6 path they will add dlc to complete the game which means 4999 aint worth it since you will be buying dlc later for the whole game so buy it on discount 
all and all the game is fun i never could return to civ 6 after playing this because i love the whole territory mechanic it feels a lot more natural compared to the civ6 territory of 4 blocks around your city 
but yes it needs more customization and balacing so we can play some other cultures i have started so many times as egyptians as the first culture that i have been making pyramids in my garden i also think of getting a pet elephant since i always go khmer too

#####

ill eat my fucking shoes the day a 4x game comes out to incredibly positive reviews its almost a staple of the genre for one to release to lukewarm reviews happened with civ 5 happened again with civ 6 happened with endless legend and its happening again with this game thing is it aint half bad in fact id call it pretty damn good 

i like where amplitudes head is at theyre bold they try to shake things up they try new things their previous 4x game endless legend is a testament to that its good to see that theyre putting their own spin on the genre once more 

the early game of humankind is incredibly intriguing you run around as a neolithic tribe gathering food hunting animals and finding remnants of previous tribes who failed to become something more the food you gatherhunt increases your tribes size while the culture and science you find from curiosities get the ball rolling on starting your first outpost outposts are like citylites theyre there to mark the land as yours they grow very slowly and while you can build in them it comes out of your much needed culture points your first outpost gets a free transformation into a city but from then on whenever an outpost is placed youll need a good amount of culture to turn it into a full on city sounds a bit useless until you realize that you can attach an adjacent outposts to a city increasing the amount of land that city controls and letting you make use of whatever resources were within the outposts area of influence 

science is pretty standard though it feels a bit more engaging im not sure why maybe i just like the screen better the policy screen reminds me of frostpunk of all things you learn policies through growing meeting new empires befriending or antagonizing freecities this games version of citystates etc once you obtain a policy you spend culture to affect things within your empire ie will it be run by an autocrat giving you bonuses to your main city or by a council giving smaller but different bonuses to all of your cities 

faith is a bit wonky but to be fair i havent had enough time to explore it im not sure how i started my religion and on that point we get one of humankinds minor issues they explain things but not good enough that also goes for the ui though it isnt as abrasive as endless legends this isnt going to be an issue after 3 or 4 games but it feels like they dont give you the minor details that might make or break your experience edit yea faith isnt explained well at all also its weird that you can literally wipe out every other religion in the game and basically receive nothing for it

the ai is good but somewhat lacking its funny thats a complaint since civ 6 ai is terrible at best theyll respond to you in a better sense than in civ youll almost always know what standing you are in with them theyll offer trades and diplomatic treaties that make sense and will stick to their ingame behavior make a demand from a war civ and theyll call your bluff treat a civ well and chances are theyll respond favorably to your alliance overall im a fan of the ai so far though it should be said that once an ai starts hating you its damn near impossible to get them to change their opinion in fact i havent been able to change anyones opinion of me from bad to good

as you play through the game youll earn stars to progress to the next era stars are earned by doing a variety of things controlling lots of districts accumulating wealth and culture researching techs killing enemy units etc once your progress to the next era you adopt a new culture while retaining the units buildings and bonuses from the past eras this leads to growth feeling dynamic and gives you more of a hand in choosing what to focus on next rather than continuously building upon one thing from beginning to end ie spain and religion in civ 6 youll also get story events that give your empire specific modifiers from just progressing assimilate a freecity youll get an event having to do with that specific city build a market start a religion youll get a plethora of events having to do with it in theory i really like the idea but i think its an area that needs more revision often times the choice you pick doesnt really feel like it has an effect 

war is good if youve played endless legend it feels like they improved upon what they had going on there of course you could always just click autoresolve and be done with it which might be preferable from time to time if you get tired of playing a glorified capture the flag ending the wars are a bit tricky since it seems that you have to completely brutalize the enemy to destroy their war score and get them to surrender i havent found any other way to win so far so take that with a grain of salt 

the music is exceptional its a given though since its amplitude 

i think this game has a pretty good foundation and if they play their cards right with future updates and expansions i have no doubt that this game will easily become a staple of the 4x genre 

8510 humankind is a bit of a shit name tho innit

#####

this game is difficult to review in a far light simply because it can nearly impossible to not compare it to the civilizations franchise specifically civilizations 6 this is in part because humankind at times feels like a reaction to civilizations 6 as there is a lot of fundementally similar but different mechanics that ultimately fill the opposite spectrum of each other

humankind is a good game but it is also a game with many highs and lows in its design and the lows may either not affect your opinion that much or ruin the game for you i do suspect that many of the big flaws in the design will be fixed over time the bolivar update the released recently did exactly that but how long it will take until every flaw is fixed is uncertain ill list some of the major highs and lows that ive experienced from my time playing the game if you think that the highs overweigh the lows i highly recommend you try the game at least once

the highs
the ui is very smooth and the general feel of the game is excellent this is also helped by having you take turns simultaneously with the ai which minimizes waiting time between turns
the fame system removes the issue in 4x games of having to focus entirely on one victory condition youre free to pursue whatever you want and feel like and can freely adapt your plans around the circumstance rather than always having to commit to them
combat is really good its strategic quick and hits a good balance between needing strategy and a flat advantage to win 

the lows
wonders suck natural wonders are too generic and dont give much of a benefit while normal wonders are decent but give pretty lackluster effects the system of effectively taking dibs on wonders is a good idea but it removes the exciting risk and suspense that exist with wonders in games like civilizations 6
leader avatars are a cool idea that i have a lot of issues with i really like the idea of having a personal avatar that you can customize in both appearance and ingame behaviour and then share with others my problems with it are that the game doesnt let you randomly generate avatars to play against but instead forces you to either play against a select list of builtin avatars almost all of which have buffs in some way or avatars downloaded through games2gether 
variety due to how the game is designed there isnt much variety in how games play out so its a game that you have play pretty infrequently to keep it fun and interesting since it can easily get repetitive if you play it too much

#####

very beautiful game with a lot of different mechanics a bit too much for my taste
i would recommend humankind to anyone who likes to spend a full saturday starting 4x games and not finishing them

#####

being a huge fan of endless legend i had high hopes for their civilization take but they missed diplomacy and specifically war support is an inscrutable mechanic keep it simple its incredibly unclear even with the tutorial how to declare war and my first playthrough i didnt realize the outpost had to be converted to a city with a button that doesnt stand out from the background at all the ui on cities is extremely difficult to read bottom line its not like endless legend so dont expect that

#####

alright this hurts i love 4x games and i was super excited for this i avoided the betas because i wanted to experience the finished product i love civ but civ has major problems that have only gotten worse the past few years i was ready for a legit competitor and i wanted it to be this game is what i am saying but it is not i just want to highlight the major problems that are unlikely to ever be patched or fixed away

1 like everyone else has said you have no connection to your civ and no impression of other civs because every hour or so they all change this could have been implemented in an interesting way if it changed unitsbuildings but not your entire identity i dont care about my people or any of my rivals no impression at all

2 there are not enough resources on the map no matter how large your empire is this is by design and it cannot be changed in settings why does this suck because i cant build half of the units or several buildings it doesnt make me want to conquer other cities it just makes me want to turn off the game

3 combat is annoying and boring at the same time combat in civ 5 and 6 were light but still strategic combat here when it actually happens is simply not fun

4 scaling and progression are fucked currently i am finishing games when i still cannot build factoriesand i am the most advanced civ in the game 

5 the ui makes it hard to know whats really happening while simultaneously giving me way too much information that i do not need and do not want to see how many war grievances do i get every turn too many is the correct answer

there is a good game in here somewhere the graphics are decent and i like the ambition but the vision itself was flawed this game does not understand what makes the civ series so enjoyable and only succeeds in some of the one more turn aspects of psychological manipulation but whenever i turn off the game i dont feel anything at all

#####

great game terrible bugs turn pending ruins the entire game i dont recommend anyone buying until theyve fixed this issue

#####

an interesting alternative to civ 6 that succeeds in some areas but needs work in others for the average civ player it wont replace that game but i recommend it if youve got civ fatigue and want to try something new in a similar vein  

pros 
beautiful art style and map
subtle ost i find civs to get a little too bombastic at times
interesting city mechanics
great selection of cultures and growing
blending cultures throughout the eras is a cool concept

cons
lack of generic leaders make ai opponents not as memorable 
stars system for victory can funnel you into certain play styles some cultures are clearly superior etc 
neolithic era is cool on paper but ends up being kind of stale due to auto explore there is only one way to play it or you risk loosing out on culture selection to the ai  

if you like hex based 4x games if you love civ but want an alternative then definitely give it a try

#####

amazing

it has everything i always missed in the civ games the game mechanics give this game depth and depth is what i really missed in any civ game 

humankind doesnt rely on the  now so common  game built ins that boost your dopamine so you keep playing and playing and playing here you build your civilization step by step besides diverse story game and every changing game dynamics thank you to the developers for doing without the addictive game mechanics modern games use to keep people playing

finally it also runs on m1 macbooks i play with macbook air 2021 m1 it runs smooth without issues 

worth the investment 
doesnt get boring 
great diplomatic systems another point civ cant even get close to 
very realistic in terms of charaters of ai
and great and fun war mechanics

#####

beautiful fun and challenging evolution of the 4x formula  despite appearances this is not just a civ 56  clone  humankind introduces some genuinely novel mechanics like how after each era you can change your culture picking from a new eraappropriate set every time  changing your culture has many effects
 sets your civs specialty eg militaristic scientific economic cultural expansionist or agrarian which provides a special ability andor bonus shared with other cultures of the same persuasion  eg scientific lets you research techs from the next era and lets you funnel a citys entire industrial  economic output into science for 5 turns which can really help if youre trying to make a beeline for more seaworthy craft before the competition
 adds a culturespecific permanent and powerful bonus to your evolving empire these can really be game changing
 adds a culturespecific unit you can build forever
 adds a culturespecific district which can only be built until your culture changes again though when built they last forever

alternatively keep your existing culture for a  bonus to future fame gains which determines the winner at the end  

i really like the culture mechanic because it allows for an evolving strategy as the game progresses and really lets you craft a unique civilization over time  

by the way in my opinion the early wave of negative steam reviewers were smoking something probably crack  i dont know how anyone can honestly give this game a thumbs down its pure 4x gaming goodness on every level has aaa polish yet evolves the genre like a boss indie and to top it off is just gorgeous  i see this game infusing some much needed pizzazz into 4x but also being a great addition in its own right  live long and prosper humankind  may you have many sequels which i will play for many justonemore turns over many cups of coffee to witness the rise and fall of many a sprawling civilization through the ages 

onward ho human

#####

the most fun i had with a civlike in a while game mechanics are able to produce a backandforth between war diplomacy territorial expansion and economic development a few aspects that  caught my attention

1 the way your civ advances having to hunt  down stars and score up throughout a certain age makes the game richer since the player cant resort to the same strategies as the game unfolds

2 culture picks being able to choose new cultures  or keeping the same one  as you reach new eras adds depth to each individual playstyle

3 war to keep fighting you will have to amass support through diplomatic maneuvers or leverage collection if you lose all support your own people will force your surrender fairly realistic of compared to other games you can also try to lower your enemys war support through political maneuvers adding yet another layer to strategic warfare

4 trade trading is resolved through routes which might be vulnerable to attack each route represents trade of a luxury or special resource establishing a route takes some gold frlm ypur coffers but delivers bonuses according to the luxury you purchased

5 diplomacy diplomatic actions bring leaders to the forefront adding a layer of strategy given their personalities and traits it also makes all the more interesting to download other players leaders to participate in your game developing your own avatar through trait unlocking also becomes an interesting albeit small side activity

6 culture and religion influence will grant advantages and allow for the adoption of foreign policies civics will tailor each empires identity and determine whether it is traditionalist progressive orderly warlike etc

top all that with great art dynamic battles reminiscent of endless legend but more refined and interesting events and youll have an allnighter onemoreturn kind of a game solid yes

#####

so i have never left a review for a game before as ive always assumed it doesnt really mean all that much but i do feel like i have to come to the games defence it isnt perfect no game ever is but i will say i absolutley love it yeah the ai can be a bit dense sometimes and it doesnt understand the idea of an amphibious assualtinvasion and some aspects of the game needs to be fleshed out more but this is a game that i would 110 recommend to anyone that likes this genre its beautiful engaging the cultures are brilliant and whilst some people hate it i thinks its a great mechanic that you choose a new civ for each era i feel it properly gives you the feel of an advancing civilisation and culture i agree there are times it can be a bit jarring going from say the zhou to the garamantes is historical and if thats a deal breaker for you then this isnt the game for you but if you can get over that imo very small issue you will have a blast  the most obvious thing to compare this to is civ6 i love civ 6 so perhaps this will best sum it up i played a game of it with my other half a few day ago and whilst i enjoyed it as i always have i found that i kept catching myself thinking i wish we were playing humankind

#####

meh i want to like this game but every time i try to play i get so bored so fast i cant play for more than maybe an hour everyone compares this to civilization but humankind is nothing like it 3k hours on civ and i cant bring myself to crack 20 hours playing humankind its slow boring not engaging and overall just disappointing which is weird considering how much is packed into the game

#####

pros
 combat is much deeper than civ
 certain technologies such as guns drastically change strategy
 faster game speeds can be completed in one sitting without feeling rushed
 score victory system provides incentive for interesting strategies

cons
 some aspects such as religion have little depth
 feels like your culture changes abruptly rather than evolves
 cultures feel very samey  only really 6 or 7 different playstyles

#####

this game is in my opinion catching heat for some silly reasons if you dont feel like reading it all then scroll to the bottom

yes this game shares a lot of similarities with the civilization games ive played them all at one point or another and over all since the comparison wants to be made by so many yes the civ games are a better option between these two but with that said

i seriously enjoy this game easy to learn especially if you played the civ games you can pretty much walk right into it for all the good that the civ games are id really like to see them take some notes from the way the devs handled culture in this one 
                    
                                     1 every era you choose a new culture or keep the one you have you have the chance 
                                         of always having a powerful and unique unit whereas in civ 6 for example the 
                                         roman legion is pretty much useless for the last 34 of the game and you dont get 
                                         to enjoy it very long

                                     2 the ability to change cultures after each era in my opinion adds a ton of flavor to 4x 
                                          games like this 

other points i would bring up is the way city building and territory claim works city building and the way it lays out on the map is very beautiful and detailed it runs by the same city center and district layout of civ 6 but the way you have vastly more control over your borders and ability to expand them is another thing this game really shines with

finally last one the battles they are way more fleshed out than the civ games are the flow is so much better and the ability to start a battle and then position units and use some tactical thought is way more fun than what im used to in other 4x games like this 

over all its base is kind of a great value brand civ game but its high points some of which i mentioned above really make it a fun and worthwhile game to play in my opinion 810 i do recommend if you are on the fence then i would wait for a sale and at that point i highly recommend otherwise i hope this was useful and that i didnt waste too much of your time if you read all this





#####

i like it only played one match and i see that people say if you have a good start the ai will keep even with you no matter what but i didnt experience that at all in fact the ai was a ahead of me when i had a bad start managed to win a very critical battle at a choke point that completely turned the game around to where i was able to get ahead then with good planning and raiding tactics the ai didnt catch up to me unless they were on a separate continent where i had no real influence on them for a bit 

either way i love it a lot

#####

this fantastic game is a fun and fresh take on the human history based 4x genre  ive had much more fun with it than i expected and thats because the unique evolving cultures mechanic means i can play the game exactly how i want to play it rather than always win through conquest

i wish the maps were bigger though  the huge map is small in my opinion  another thing that could be a lot better is if there was a limit to how many independent peoples cities can spawn in one area  i recently played a game where 8 indies were connected through the center of a continent and that was annoying because i was at war for two eras instead of playing the way i wanted to play  if the independent peoples cities were restricted so they could not be touching another indie peoples city it would be a better gameplay experience

with that said this is my favourite human history 4x game so far  being able to choose your culture at each era milestone and customize your civilization through the ages is a lot of fun  theres more strategy involved in it and you can tailor your civilization to the land you occupy  for example if you control a large number of luxury resources you can choose a culture that specializes in trade and keep its bonuses when you want to add another culture at the next era

added after posting i forgot to mention that i really like the cities and outposts game mechanic  rather than spamming cities you can create outposts and later upgrade them to cities of their own or attach them to a neighbouring city  your cities can span several territories and you can build around those outposts attached to the city  there is a city cap in the game that you can raise through technology mostly  without raising the cap you can be heavily penalized for going too far over the limit  depending on your era you can only go one or two over the limit  later in the game you might be able to get by with a higher penalty but its often better to ransack a city you take over so that you can create an outpost in the same territory so you wont be over the limit  you lose all developments that captured city had constructed but most of the time its worth it to do that

i highly recommend this game

#####

as someone that played all the civilization games with well over 1000 hours in total on them humankind offers a fresh new take on the concept not everything is well balanced yet but as the devs are still producing new content for the game it gets more and more polished

#####

i tried i really tried the game is beautiful the bones are there for something truly amazing but i am 999 sure ive played the literal exact same run of the game every single time the civilizations dont merge into something you just become a brand new people over night the religion is just kinda there every game basically ends with fame that you basically have to earn through the same ways which is maxing out everything always and forever and never adding any flavor or risks to your gameplay war the way the units fight is there but not really usable or enjoyable i really wanted something other than civ maybe humankind two will get me there i just know that i will not be buy humankind 11 12 13 14 15 16  and on cause this did not instill confidence artists who worked on this tho deserve a huge bonus and so do everyone who worked on the amazing and genius unique mechanics

#####

humankind tries so hard to be different from other unnamed 4x strategy games that it shoeholes itself into a corner of misguided misfortune

humankind at its core is not a strategy game its a role playing game that is what all the marketing media would want you to believe the reason for the focus on the more roleplaycentric experience is due to the fact that the game is boring as a strategy game and even on the hardest difficulty is more a chore to play that a inviting nor engulfing experience such as other 4x games

how do you win a game of humankind its due to the score mechanic that the game suffers so much the core gameplay loop is passable but when it comes to the best ways to win there is not only a definitive best way to win but once the first 30 turns are over the winner is already decided which means the rest of the game is just the player going through the motions passing the time the score is interesting on the first game but the more you play the more you realise it is what holds the game from greatness

the combat is alright actually it better as the game goes on but in the first few turns it is a chore rather than interesting take on the clickers latency god moments a lot of other 4x games take however the further the game goes on the more you get the combat and the more you will probably like it

i have played the game since launch and i can safely say after getting some of the hardest achievements in the game humankind lacks content it takes ruffly 80 hours to get all the achievements due to fact you have to get half of them all in one sitting without ever turning you pc off this is due to a bug that registers a game you returned to as a separate game in its entirety becomes annoying as a lot of players cant take 3 hours out of their day to continually play humankind if you are a achievement hunter this is more of an annoying experience than a fulfilling one so choose wisely if you are willing to undertake the journey

in the end the game was made to combat other 4x games and in trying to be different became bland as possible and hit all the wrong marks

#####

playing with a buddy right now and i gotta say i love it

the biggest problem ive seen so far is the noncooperative battles i mean really
you can have such large scale battles and yet you cannot call your allies in to fight with you
me and my buddy tried for a solid hour to get in a battle together and it seems to lock the others units into the battle but they cannot participate and they cannot move out leaving them stuck in limbo until the fight is over


amplitude studios please add cooperative battles or fix this possible bug im pretty sure endless legend had coop battles so im not sure why its not available in this one

#####

i am loving this game it is actually pretty fun and is not repetitive
i will for sure recommend the game and let you discover it properly by yourself but there is a big problem
after a while you will face a game braker bug turn pending loop youre entire game is done you neeed to restart again and hope to not face it this time so i am really sorry but this is literally sad and disrespectul after payin 50

#####

humankind is amazing in total i played 70 hours during the open devs and prerelease access its come a long way the art and music are amazing and gameplay is great it focuses the narrative of your empire

it is b not b civilization combat is more complex and moving large armies is less tedious you have random events that help shape your history youre not forced to enter the next era but shall you decide to do so you can pick a new culture once again not forced on you merge cultures to get the best experience for your playstyle
can be played in singleplayer and multiplayer

#####

i like this better than civ 6 i like how the culture adapts over time i love the combat system i like the graphics terrain music diplomacy and realism much better than civ 6 which i see as humankinds only real competitor the following are the issues id like to see addressed
 it glitches out sometimes often times towards the later eras
 there are certain scenarios where some land combat units cannot be seen or attacked due to being placed on a more elevated tile however they can attack you during your turn this seems silly and unrealistic 
 there should be more ai characters to play against
 there are many actions content or details in the game that arent explained well enough or at all sometimes
 for love of god and all that is holy please allow nuclear submarines and military aircraft to drop nuclear warheads the fact that you have to launch them from a missile silo is both unrealistic and extremely frustrating

#####

this is an amazing game rival to civilization i think thats a bad way of rating this game while the similarities are there as would be predictable of any 4x style game i think the main draws of each game is different

civ favors a slower more methodical and tactical approach with lots of indepth planning  achieve long term goals while sustaining yourself in the present while this game is very focused on immediate wins and constant competition youre always focused on getting one over on your rival factions in an almost arcadey fashion

so basically dont play this game if youre looking for a newer better civ play this game if youre looking for an excuse to nuke the soviet union because they more weapon factories than you do

#####

i like it

#####

overall 710 graphics 1010 sound 810 gameplay 710 ideasmechanics is better than sid meier civ games but need some polish  the battle system is my favorite improvement way better than civ games  the events need balance to be more punishreward and effect less time maybe 5 turn  i think it would be better if you can choose your favorite nation at the begining and every era you can choose skill or attributes that form you basic nation

#####

after a few bad starts i learned the basics and the game totally hooked me tactical battles and city building are both deeper than they seem and they add layers of depth that civ lacks i dont think ill be able to return to civ after this

#####

510

humankind is a turnbased strategy game that has both positive and negative aspects that players should consider before purchasing

one of the positives is the games attention to historical accuracy which can be enjoyable for players who are interested in history the games art design and soundtrack also add to the atmosphere and make the experience immersive

however the games ai can feel lacking at times which can make the game less challenging than desired additionally the tutorial could be more informative leaving some aspects of the game unclear for new players

the game also suffers from pacing issues which can make the early game feel slow and tedious this may not appeal to players who prefer fastpaced gameplay additionally the game can become repetitive over time as players may encounter similar scenarios repeatedly

overall humankind is a decent turnbased strategy game that has some positives but it may not be for everyone players who are interested in history and enjoy strategic gameplay may enjoy the game but those looking for a more fastpaced or varied experience may want to look elsewhere while the game has its flaws it can still provide a decent amount of entertainment for those who enjoy the genre

i am in the end game of my fifth empire difficulty playthrough of humankind
i play since launch and every major update or expansion i come back and play a full game
every time i come back i appreciate the effort they put in in order to improve the game 
during this playthrough i am having the most fun i really like that the ai can keep up and pressure you through out the humankind congress the constant effort to keep war support up the constant effort to min max your cities alliances come and go securing non aggression packs in order to keep the trading routes active the strategy behind continuing gathering era stars and deciding when to enter the next era and the thrill of picking your next culture keep every turn of the game interesting
i love the aesthetics the music and the ui it is a beatiful game with good strategy both on campaign and on battles

i am yet to go to the contemporary era in this new update i remember each previous game i played the contemporary era was just very fast and uninteresting due to the already big snowball hope this is fixed somehow and i will have an exciting and competitive last era
i also dislike the spy and envoy mechanic its useless spamable and boring 

i am really looking forward to further expansions and updates cause i think humankind is at its best spot right now

#####

a 4x turnbased strategy game that features the ability to craft your own custom culture from humanitys varied historical and contemporary cultures each era gives you the ability to pick a culture that another player has not chosen with its own unique asymmetrical advantages as you complete 4x objectives you earn era stars that progress you to the next era and grant you fame depending on how in character your actions are to your chosen cultural lineage you can always see in clear terms how you stack up against other factions via the fame score which is the ultimate victory condition the faction with the highest fame score at the end of the game wins i feel like humankind does 4x strategy in the way it ought to be played namely with clear goals and clearly communicated progress towards those goals as opposed to the hodgepodge mess that is stellaris or the conflicting ideas even some of the previous endless titles have i hope amplitude continues to take the lessons theyve learned forward into future titles as humankind is a brilliant iteration

#####

everything about this game is good but the ai even on metropolis difficulty the ai go way in front of me technologically for some reason and im no noob so this is all i have to say

#####

humankind may not have invented hot water but it is sufficiently different from civilization and that results in a rocksolid game not least because of its scale in the game you lead your people through the different eras of our civilization at six different times you are presented with ten cultures that you can take over from then on in addition the characteristics of your previous choices are preserved resulting in a unique melting pot of influences from a million  possible combinations each game is different and you will spend many hours exploring only a fraction of the possibilities that replayability alone makes humankind more than worth its money

#####

it just isnt a well made  balanced game its got the usual awful amplitude studios map generation but the games variance is cranked to 11 and balance between cultures per era are terrible unlike in es2 or el you dont have the interesting faction mechanics to smooth some of that out to make the game interesting you just feel fucked over when the map generation sucks or the good cultures get taken in an era it also seems to have fallen in to the civ5civ6 busywork model of adding game features which eles2 expansions also seemed to fall into but the base game of this feels so bloated

it also has the amplitude studios usual this is a turn based game with shitty dexterity elements because the ai gets to take its turn before your turn during your turn and after your turn element which like cmon

#####

like any 4x this game will only be great after its been developed for a few years currently its good stellaris was pretty dull and empty on release now its great civ 6 was a featureless blob when released but now its great hoi and eu games always need 4 or 5 expansions to make them great this game needs more cultures more events more wonders and units a refining of the core mechanics and some new ones to spice things up a bit 

id still recommend buying this now though the cultures system is such a break from how most 4x games work and really helps to alleviate the boredom of the mid game i always found the endless style of combat a bit of a drag but this one feels more satisfying somehow though they do need to work on how movement and line of sight information is conveyed the way districts work make your cities feel natural and you can make their structure suit your war efforts too 

overall id say this game is at 70 of its potential and only getting closer to 100 buy it cunt

#####

the more you progress the more the game starts to lag and bug out these were the issues since launch
 uneven spread of luxury and strategic resources either you spawned on a massively good spot or you spawned nowhere with no resource deposit in sight even after the whole neolithic era
 even on the slowest game pace the game still goes too fast so if you want to enjoy your emblematic unit or fuck around and have fun with the civ you have chosen bam next era upgrade to arquebusters
 the bots are either too overpowered or too weak there is no middle ground i played on all difficulties and all the time i was either 2 eras behind or forward depending on my start and civs chosen
 ai constantly works against you and you cant influence that you are too strong they hate you you are too weak they hate you they dont want to accept deals even if they like you or always counter if you counter they never pay up and are pissed at you
 indipendent people wtf either you destroy them with one stack of something easily or you can pay them every turn to like you but even then they are completely useless canon fodder with no impact on the game
 soviets are too overpowered with their weapons
 some cultural wonders are downright useless while some are op
 nukes bug out a lot and when you dare to launch more than 1 nuke per turn they get frozen and you can never fire them from that specific missile depo
 those little quests are weird as hell like you will always choose the same options because other options will fuck you over so if you dont want to be fucked you will follow same ideologies every goddamn game because those quests are always the same they dont change

i loved it when it came out and i even tolerated the bugs but after replaying it after a year i finally realised this game is dogshit not to mention that apparently there are few dlcs that costs you the same as a another better game would

if you want to play this kind of game go play civ instead its not perfect but this game leaves much to be desired

i wanted to get as much playtime in as possible before writing a review this is a first for me by the way i have played far too many 4x games including others by this publisher that i have liked this game is a miss for me it does several things well and those breaks from traditional 4x narratives are interesting enough but they are arent the reason i have trouble with this game but two things are the constantly changing cultures and the victory condition 

with 60 cultures to mix and match humankind claims to offer 1 million possible civilizations thats simply not true perhaps it would be true if cultures you choose in ones era had any lasting impact on future but beyond limited placements for specialty districts the changing cultures serve more to confuse than help though your avatars are referred to as the eternal autarch they are never referenced by their names only the current culture that theyve chosen this means that if youve had a long standing feud with the persians you may suddenly get a message about some grievance allayed against you by the ottomans and be quite confused before realizing it is the same person from 20 turns ago the fact is the way the game is right now you are only ever the culture that you have currently selected and while 60 civilizations are far more than most games like this have before dlc are released it is far less than advertised oh and there is the small matter of you potentially never being able to play one of those cultures because someone else gets to them before you

the other issues is the victory condition there is only one path to victory time frame it however you want but the fact is that the timer will run out before you achieve most other forms of victory i generally play on endless but even on other speeds i still usually hit the time limit yes there is a continue playing button but there is something less satisfying about it after the fact it doesnt feel like you are building toward anything anymore

overall im excited to see what else comes out of this game but without some overhauls to their signature culture system or a way to disable the timer ill be taking a pass on this one

#####

its just kinda meh
as someone who loved civ and has spunked thousands of hours into various strategy games this should be my thing and while i cant find anything about it that i specifically dislike theres nothing about it that makes me want to play either

#####

its a bit unpolished in some ways little things that seem off every once in a while wish there was a fast movement option but the game seems to only have simultaneous turns so i guess it makes sense

i still like it though the combat is like endless legend if youve played that a mix of civ5 and civ6 with height having more importance sometimes the maps really add to the combat  how you play in general theres canyons  valleys that can create for epic battles

i havent played online so i cant comment on that

#####

refunded i experienced a bug very early in the game turn 12 where my tribes just disappeared nothing more to do cant do anything but quit the game i googled my issue and found out this is an old bug that hasnt been fixed thats enough for me to refund any game if you have a major bug and cant care enough about the paying customers to fix it then i wont buy your  s h i t

#####

i love amplitude and have purchased at least 80 of their catalog  
i live across the country states from my best friend and we keep up regular time together by way of gaming  picked up a copy for each of us upon release i pushed hard to get him into endless legend and it paid off

ive been excited for humankind for seriously years  we played about five games over the course of two weeks and just decided to go back to games that we had more fun with  

ive never given an amplitude product a negative review but humankind just lacks the rewarding engagement i adore the studio for  im still a devoted fan and i really hope that ill get a reason to revise this review someday


update revisited hoping optimistically to find a better game than the one id reviewed  instead fixing the base game should not be a 20 dlc whether or not you like the expansion the fundamental principle remains

on all planets this is considered a dik move

#####

impossible to play large maps the infinite loop at end of turn pending turn bu spoils the fun quick saveload exit game so annoying

#####

its a mixed bag theres definitely some very cool elements to the game that make it fun to play but then there are really odd design choices that ruin that fun 

mine was on conquering an enemy i took over his cities the final victory was all within a couple rounds taking a few cities suddenly im over my city cap yeah city cap ugh now my influence or whatever it was called is suddenly at 300 a round and you can go negative so suddenly im 3000 in the bank 10 rounds later doing everything i can to stop the drop but theres a pentalty on every city moral of 258 for me being in such a deficit theyre revolting 

no conceivable way out of the hole even after i stop the bleeding fun suddenly ruined empire crumbling all because i won a war  

i guess i was supposed to raise the cities to dust that feels bad too 

anyway i uninstalled

#####

i am completely new to 4x games and i tried both civ6 and humankind i must say that at this point i like humankind way more the tutorial is way better i like the artwork more the combat is a lot of fun the gui is clean and well arranged and the possibility to combine different cultures in this game makes it so interesting and refreshing i catched myself googeling the best culture combinations yesterday so i guess the game really hooked me d 
so since everyone in the reviews compare it to civ i must say that from a beginners perspective humankind is more intuitive and less overwhelming but its still very complex so there is quite the learning curve 
what i also love it really feels like you play the story of a civilization since important moves you make are being narrated by the game the fact that you are already starting in the neolithic era adds up to this point

overall i really enjoy the game and i can absolutely recommend it

#####

i played endless legend and endless space 2 from the same studio and i have also played civ 6

humankind is a combination of endless space 2s randomness for stuff to blow up pretty quickly as in you snowballing endless legends hunker down and focus on this type of victory playstyle and civs streamlined and linear progression

what this makes is a mess of quick adaptation to surrounding events and heavy emphasis on prioritizing what youre actually doing per turn

take for example the first era i chose to go for growth simple i thought just grow more farms right wrong

as it turned out my neighbour the aggressive chad decided to harass my borders and started to demand my territory well guess what now i have to make more freaking soldiers instead of trying to make farms so i lose about 10 turns because one unit takes on average about 4 to 5 turns to make and you can only fit 4 units and i already have 2

done

now i can make far oh look a minor faction decided to harass my other border and started pillaging stuff delicious simply marvelous so i either have to make another squad or move my one and only one to the other border if i get a war from the chad im pretty much defenseless i sighed and i decided to unattach my other territory and make it a city itself so i can make two stuff at once my main city trained soldiers while the other one tried its best to grow up as fast as it can

done

right enough is enough let me make farms i said and guess what i did make more farms and my population exponentially grew chad mcbuttface didnt declare war but he did spit at me a couple of times i didnt care i was growing bananas out of my ears and im getting stars lots of em tech stars check growth stars check military stars that im getting because i keep winning over the minor faction or neutrals for you civ players check expansion stars also check because you dont need to make settlers to settle you simply get two scouts set them on autoexplore and each several turns you just check which territory is open and have plenty of resources and then you just tell them to plop an outpost there two turns in and you can attach it to your city and voila its yours

i was happy and i thought if i pretty much only focus on this id win the game pretty quickly

then the first bad strings of notifications came

my population is starving 

what in blazes i thought what you guys got tired of bananas then grown same paddies or something

i looked at my main city six freakin farms not enough food so just grow more farms right

wrong

as i progressed more and more systems appeared in my face civics religion diplomacy trade wonders techs i have so many things i can build or make but none of them actually addressed my current problem in that turn how to stop my population from starving

i clicked on to grow one more farm and i clicked end turn

wait my population wasnt starving anymore i clicked on the main city 31 food production relative to 3 previously but the farm i told them to make needed 2 more turns what the hell happened did zeus made it rain bananas or odin decided to simply bless us with papayas instead

that bewilderment came and went as i progressed through the eras until i reached era 5 and i was so far ahead in terms of fame none of the ais can catch up to me

and then my alliance broke and my one and only friend backstabbed me with the force of a thousand suns
and more aggressive minor factions popped out of nowhere and attacked my lonely outposts
and my trading lines got ransacked so many times i simply couldnt care enough to buy them again
and on and on and on and on

sigh 

all i wanted to do was grow bananas but the game gave me lemons instead

ps its very strange to not hear the grunts and groans of civs early era units and instead hear them speak in clear and fluent english immersion broken literally unplayable

im actually a big civ fan so im always eager to try different takes on the formula when humankind first launched i was not a fan but since it was included in this months humble choice bundle with all the dlc i thought id give it another shot and i still dont like it unfortunately

it does a few things better than civ the main one being its events system a mechanic that civ desperately needs to add some needed flavor to playthroughs however everything else just feels like its trying to capture what civ does but halfstepping their way towards that combat is needlessly complex diplomacy is utterly broken your units will get attacked at random by other civs despite not being at war and you cant quite understand why the mechanic for settling cities is a needless downgrade from civ adding extra steps to what should be a simple mechanic humankind also has the civ vi issue of everything feeling like it takes forever to build due to ridiculous production costs at least in humankind you can build multiple of the same district and i like that districts lower loyaltystability instead of requiring population but it just doesnt work right

and good god why cant i customize what tiles i work in my cities why cant i build roads why are so many things automated like trade routes why cant i buy tiles why is there a cap on how many cities i can found you copied the district system from civ vi good for you but the district system was put in civ to make players play a wider playstyle instead of civ vs meta of a few big cities youre supposed to settle a lot of cities with the district system so you can specialize more cities and plant more districts putting a cap on cities in humankind just boggles my mind

i think my biggest issue with humankind is that it lacks identity when i play civ i want to play as rome or america or babylon or etc i dont want to play a custom civ against 5 other custom civs humankinds civs arent civs theyre just amalgamations of what bonuses you want to pick that makes the gameplay feel samey in civ the civ you choose has unique abilities that you build around and take advantage of through the course of the game that gives each civ flavor and identity it makes the game replayable humankind does not do that it makes everyone feel generic and all of a sudden its just about what build you feel like making and then beelining all of the cultures per era that fit your said build

and thats a big problem because it makes it so humankind doesnt have a personality at all it feels very generic bland and utterly boring

score 70 and thats me being generous

#####

i have been a longtime fan of the civilization series but i was disappointed in civ 6 humankind is what i wish civ 6 had been it innovates where civ 6 doubled down on legacy gameplay elements that no longer create a fun experience humankind streamlines in all the right places removing the drudgery of worker unit management large army movements and management of too many cities it clears all that out of the way so that the player can focus on strategy which is what makes the experience worthwhile in the first place

dont make the mistake of dismissing humankind as an offbrand knock off it is a brilliant return to form for the genre and firaxis should take note

#####

humankind has come far initially having its issues at release this has become a small masterpiece over time it is much more enjoyable than the latest civ 6 less micromanagement better graphics tons of refreshing mechanics overall well done

unfortunately there was lots of hate on release i recommend to give humankind another chance the devs did well around balancing and adding more flavor

#####

loved the time i spent with it and would recommend the game to fans of the genre i put 20ish hours into it in 4 days but i think im done playing until modding or updates come out

theres a lot of great stuff going on in the core systems but balance is all over the place i either get steam rolled early or get so far ahead its not even funny and a lot of the bonuses seem obviously much better than others a lot of the ancillary systems seem really underbaked too

pollution in particular seems so obviously poorly thought out that i flat out refuse to play the contemporary era at the moment the fact that its an irreversable production every turn and so few things actually reduce it and the things that do come much later in the tech tree is a really bad feeling combination of factors why does planting a forest not even offset a single train station and why does it only do so for 2 turns why does only planting a forest change things why cant existing forests contribute why does it do nothing other than lower efficacy of terrain and then end the game on the spot

according to the wiki the current end trigger from pollution is 100k train stations one of the earliest things you can get that produces it produces 15turn my normal sized map had about territories you could build on in it if you were to put 1 train station in every territory and no other pollution it would end the game in 133 turns say you build a strip mining complex austrailian emblematic quarter which also produces 15turn on each of those as well you just gave halved the amount of time humanity has

overall great ideas from a great studio but i think itll be a few years and an expansion or two away from the greatness trapped inside being fully realized if we got some heavy balancing and mods so i can turn off pollution entirely the game wouldnt even need expansions to be excellent

#####

i have to say i like the game after playing hundreds of hours of civ vi thats a refreshing change the mechanics are fairly solid although there are clearly ways to break the game with some strategies ill let you discover them on your own

the combat is a strong improvement over civ vi i really like how you have 2 objectives during fights seize their camp or kill em all the battlefield zone and deployment of troops is very well done and adds a lot of strategic depth terrain matters way more than in civ and since maps have more verticality it creates really interesting opportunities and i feel i need to think way more strategically than civ
they have stroke a nice balance between the 1 unit per tile and stack of death by limiting the number of units you can have in a stack which you can improve with techs which makes turns play much much faster  but without sacrificing the tactical layer of having 1 unit per tile the stack deploys during a fight the ai is also way more competent than in civ vvi

despite a lot of reviews ive encounter very few bugs although one of them locked my game couldnt end turn but was fixed in about 3 or 4 days

there are a lot of options and moving pieces which will give you at least a hundred hours of trying to figure out best strategies although i have to admit it doesnt bring anything super innovative apart from combat

overall i really like the game and its a solid addition to the 4x genre especially if you like to wage war although it doesnt innovate much from civ vvi

h1prefaceh1
aaaaah humankind  the best marketing strategy game of this year and i bought in
this is going to be a pretty ranty review but i hope its still coherent enough

h1graphics music  performanceh1
ill start with the best part first the atmosphere of the game are onpoint through and through  that nice timeless soft art style accompanied by welldrawn cinematics and pleasing background music that knows to keep out of the way to avoid getting too irritating in a long playthrough

as for performance i got a few framedrops towards the lategame but nothing too bad the main concern was loading times which took me up to a couple of minutes on a hdd to load an existing save and the fact that processing the next turn can take a good 1020 seconds if you press it twice or more in a row

h1gameplayh1
amplitude heralds this as their magnum opus which having now played the game i end up finding a little worrying especially after all the hours ive spent in endless space 2 because this feels if anything like a step down
at its core this feels like it was a watered down civ game that followed the same 333333 rule 33 existing stuff 33 improved 33 new that sid meiers own games do  only without the improved portion we have standard 4x gameplay but with a few new things slapped on that dont seem to have been as fullyrealized as they could

h2 player avatarh2
i liked the idea of this when i first saw it  the idea of making a single avatar that represents you throughout the entire game and i still like the idea in theory but in implementation hmm
the character creator itself is pretty awkward to use ill cover more on ui later with the preview of your character occupying a section on the side and can disappear offscreen if you rotate it theres also no way to zoom inout
instead of have sliders for various parts of the face it is instead divided into overall facial structure eyes nose mouth each of these then has maybe 2030 presets to choose from which seem to observe no logical ordering at all making it very tedious to go through
after all the effort put into creating your avatar youll then rarely see it outside of diplomacy more on that later too

sidenote here but whilst it is neat seeing the ai avatars change over time too i feel that you lose any real connection to them versus having say the historical figures present in civ games

h2 changing culturesh2
others have covered this in more depth in their reviews but again its another nice in theory eeeh in execution where culture selection is effectively boiled down to stat modifiers it also has the consequence of softlocking you into a particular playstyle for that era eg build stuff or kill stuff you can still do other stuff of course but with the the way the win conditions work it is heavily encouraged to stick with what the culture demands which i think impacts the mould your own version of humankind ethos the game purports to follow

h2 influenceh2
i played the influencebased aesthete cultures through to the end of an entire game and honestly i still have no idea how this system really works and the answer in the help guide wasnt particularly elucidating on the matter either once again sounding like a broken record now i know it seems like a great idea on paper  exert influence over neighbouring nations get stuff the issue is what stuff what do i do with it what effect is it having the game doesnt seem to offer much explanation on it

h2 civics  ideologiesh2
more stat boosts only this time repainted as ethicalcultural decisions not much more to say on this bit  theyre straightforward but very shallow

h2 diplomacyh2
this was the part of the game i was most looking forward to  i enjoy playing the diplomat role in games like this making changes through words rather than through battles but oh was i disappointed 
again the main part is boiled down to very basic options  i think one set of 4 things share map open borders etc when youre acquaintances and then a different set of 5 when youre allies acceptance of these terms by the ai seems pretty random and whilst there is a sortof indicator for how they feel towards you it doesnt seem to line up much with the outcome eg getting a shared 5 science bonus request getting denied by a race that supposedly reveres me
then you have trade which is even more simplified than in other games  you get an overview of all the resources they own you buy what you want done
and finally theres grievances and so help me god i am no closer to understanding how these work than i am the accompanying influence system at some points grievances will trigger saying things like this city is repressing the religion in x city and then you can straightup demand the entire city from them however similarly to the main part of the diplomacy system it seems very potluck whether the demand will be accepted or not if not your characters grumble at each other for several turns until you either drop it or war starts
due to how paperthin this system is i didnt end up spending much time in it which as i noted above is the only place you see player avatars making them even more pointless

h2 combath2
as noted above i tend to take a diplomacy route in these games so i didnt engage in much combat after the starting era so i think itd be unfair for me to comment on it too much but from what i did see it was a little bit like a simplified version of what endless legend has

h2 lategameh2
end turn manage building queues end turn manage building queues end turn manage building queues end turn manage building queues end turn manage building queues end my life

small side grievance no you may not make demands but the introductorytutorial map was devoid of any oil or uranium which meant that a large chunk of lategame things were unachievable including the classic civ launch a space shuttle goal

h1user interfaceh1
lord save me from this nightmare i played the game on the absolute beginner tutorial just to try to get as much information as i could and it was still the most unintuitive ui i have ever used in a 4x game a mixture of too much information in places where its not needed and then little or no information in places where it would be helpful to have it nowhere to get a good overview of what your cities are building nowhere to get a solid breakdown of whats contributing to a particular resource or to pollution and buttons that are way too big
again it looks great on the surface but underneath that it plays like it was designed by someone whos never used a user interface before

h1conclusionh1
overall i think it suffers from too much ambition with too little delivery like many other reviews i see scrolling down the page i wanted so hard to like this game because from the prerelease media it looked amazing it still looks amazing but unfortunately the beauty is only skindeep for the most part
i know amplitude will do some tidying up over the coming months but i feel like theres too much core depth missing now to be really covered in patches and so if i wasnt already well past the 2 hour limit i would probably refund this
in the meantime id probably suggest sticking to civ

h1breakdownh1
bprosb
great atmosphere and artstyle
soundtrack is pleasing but not intrusive

bconsb
doesnt stand up to other established 4x games
systems intended to set it apart from the above are disappointingly shallow player avatars cultures diplomacy civics ideologies or poorly explained influence
very unintuitive and unhelpful ui

much much better after the updates over the last year super fun

#####

humankind is uninspired and full of problems it fails to offer anything unique in some areas while in others it tries to be different and fails horribly

the problems start right at the beginning you cant choose your nation you start the game not as any specific empire but as a generic nameless tribe you roam the world gathering food and encountering really bland random events until you earn an era star and can actually found your empire

then you pick a culture essentially one of historys existing empires to become its intended to make your empire an organically forming thing but heres where this first problem presents itself by the time you get to a culture selection screen some of the options will almost certainly be taken taken  yes youre racing against the entire world to get to the next era before your rivals so you can get first pick of the cultures this nomadic tribe thing feels like a minigame with little connection to what happens the rest of the time and yet its not too hard to lose your tribes and get majorly set back its uninteresting not fun and too impactful

it feels really frustrating to be robbed of a culture you were going for because someone on the other side of the world decided they wanted to be the romans first but the worst part of this is that it breaks any roleplaying you cant start the game decididing to create the british empire because youre far from guaranteed to get england thats several eras away

theres about seven cultures at each of the six eras 42 possible nations sounds like a lot but in actuality theyre very bland each nation gets exactly the following
one unique military unit that you keep for the rest of the game even though military units rapidly become obsolete
one unique trait that you keep extremely bland stuff like x resource on a certain terrain
one unique city district definitely the most fun part but you lose access to these at the end of the era

these bonuses are nice but often dont majorly change how you play the game the unique city districts not being retained is a baffling decision that could have made for some interesting city design in the lategame

the selectable nations are also all in broad categories expansionist militarist agricultural aesthete etc this mostly manifests as an active ability you can use these categories tend to have exactly one nation in each era though which makes it pretty formulaic and also means you cant reliably stick with a category maybe youre the militarists in this era but next era someones taken it the transitions are also silly one era youre babylon then youre feudal japan then youre the british empire no rhyme or reason to it youre picking cultures based on a combination of whats mechanically best and whats left after the other civs took what they wanted
this exclusive nation selecting makes the whole game feel like a stressful and frustrating race youre hurrying to abandon the culture youve picked and get to the next era asap this isnt helped by the fact that the game keeps telling you with global messages when someone beats you and takes a culture keeping the focus firmly on rushing and shattering immersion

theres no roleplaying immersion or atmosphere you never really feel attached to the country youre playing and you never really get to experience any part of history before the world moves on it seems like the obvious way to do this would be to make the cultures non exclusive so you can wend your own way through history and write the story you want to even then im not convinced of the core value of this idea it seems to be an example of trying to innovate something that was working fine and just making a mess


lets move on the map 
the world is fine i guess its normal it looks like a civilisation game very generic theres not really a sense of amplitudes uniqueness here at times it feels like endless legend with the fantasy elements ripped out and just not replaced with anything your tribes roam the world finding curosities like freshwater harvest thats literally all it tells you i guess we caught some fish its nothing compared to the probe investigations in endless space the resources and their descriptions are less interesting than the endless games too

the anomalies from endless legend make a return 
but the ones weve got here are far less interesting in concept visuals and writing largely because they dont have any writing el gave you a bizarre glowing pool of black oily dust with a portrait and a paragraph of text about what it is here you get berry bushes and the tile has 1 food no farther explanation is offered what kind of berries are they can we get a nice closeup picture of the berries no as a result the map just feels bland and shallow all those little details you could investigate are gone

graphically it looks fine maybe even nice its pretty competent on a technical level but it lacks much of an art style or a sense of soul


empire management
city building is the main focus of this game which i do like it has the elciv 6 model wher you build districts that occupy individual strategic tiles and there are hardly any restrictions on these so youre constantly expanding outwards adjacency bonuses are a big deal so a lot of preplanning is involved
it does lean too heavily on specialisation though a tiles yields get polarised place a farm and you lose whatever industry the tile was making

the heavy focus on cities means that the unique districts you unlock from each culture are  or should have been  a great way to make nations feel unique but you lose access to those in each new era and only have one unique option at a time so most of what youre placing is somewhat bland regions of farms industry or artisan quarters for money

unfortunately things get kind of bland as it goes on this game has the same problem of all amplitude games which is that lots of bonuses stack up to drive everything to silly levels the game quickly loses context or a point of reference and you get lost in the ever increasing numbers  the midlategame especially is often just a case of hitting end turn repeatedly watching numbers go up and most of the technologies you unlock just bring bigger bonuses to the numbers rather than making meaningful changes to game mechanics it gets boring

aside from that things are really imbalanced amplitude games always snowball someone gets powerful and they keep getting bigger at a faster rate if youre not using peaceful mode expect to see most of the nations wiped out and the world reduced to a handful of superpowers pretty quickly nothing keeps people in check


the combat
barely worth mentioning
they took the tacticalmapmadefromstrategicmap system of endless legend and improved it with giving actual finegrained control over your units so in theory its a better system that fixes the biggest problem of its predecessor and should be good however with the removal of the fantasy elements they have also gutted it of content theres no customiseable equipment no active abilities you can use and hardly any passive abilities either the units you unlock are all just x bonus damage against y unit type and your interaction on battle is just moving units and rightclicking targets it is utterly basic bland and boring its like a solid foundation that was just abandoned without building upon it the endless legend system may not have been great but it had a lot of complexity and things going on at least

overall humankind is a game that despite sharing the same genre as civilization it actually plays very differently so far i have really enjoyed the methods for expansion and the starearning systems which you must follow along to progress additionally the existence of randomly spawning points of interest also brings more life to a map giving units a purpose even when there are no hostiles which is a fabulous idea my only complaints at this time are that 1 i noticed a number of grammar or text presentation issues which have caused some confusion making it harder to learn the game and 2 some consequences of choices are also worded in a way that makes them hard to understand at first but i believe that exposure will solve that issue

#####

the game feels unfinished towards the lategame it seems like an early access title as of now

#####

im sorry but i have to give this a negative review do you imagine finding bugs in your old cdbased pc games developers are getting used to deliver their games full of bugs and im sick of that i think its unacceptable especially with this game being in beta version for almost one year i hope they fix it soon

#####

i think that this game has a lot of potential and there is some semblance of a decent game in there somewhere but it still needs some work for me to change my review i dont really know how to put it any other way but the game just feels like it is missing something

pros
list
    edgar allen poe in a toga
    unique multi culture civilization system where you change everytime you era up
    first two ages are very fun where you are placing outposts and finding for territory
    interesting combat system that makes me feel like a mix of total war and civ you can organize your units before the battle to get the best results and if you want the civ style you can autoresolve
   games seems to run pretty smoothly turns take a little too long to end after a while but i personally only experienced one game breaking bug where i got attacked during the end turn animation and had to reload
list

cons
list
    there is a lot of clunkiness in the ui and there are some things that i feel have absolutely no explanation in game for example it took me multiple games to find where the claim wonder selection even was it had a red  but i thought it wanted me to liberate my cities for some reason not even sure why it is in that menu to begin with 
    i dont particularly like that you are locked into the science that your fame era is in if you are a science focused civ you should be able to snowball your research ahead of everybody else but i regularly found myself with no research available 
    strategic resources feel significantly too scarce on my one win game i had an entire continent and still did not have enough resources to construct a majority of the things
    very difficult to recover from a losing game and very difficult to lose a winning game in civ you can snag a science victory or culture victory whereas in this the victory always goes to the civ that has the highest amount of fame
   if you get too much production it feels like you are basically building nonsensical districts and clicking the same repeatable production at the bottom
list
