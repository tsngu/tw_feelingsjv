before i go into any detail about the game let me just talk about the devs they openly admit the game was forced out and unplayable the dev jason aka seattletek is rude and bans anyone at the drop of a hat for scolding this so called game cough he has also purchased most of the positive reviews for this game they all have the devs on their friends list a few of them have even admitted they got the game for free and i can provide screenshots for proof they also admitted the game is not worth it at this state and a rip off what you are looking at is a game that has been in the making for 2 years with 2 devs that have 7 hours gameplay put together the graphics on the store page are not even the gameplay graphics the real graphics you can watch in a review are about 110 of what the store displays i purchased this game just so i could write the review to help warn people of this scam i was banned from the discussions for saying the soundgameanimations looked bad people aslo mention in the threads that the dev bansreportslocks anykind of negative response to help the game sell there are more placeholders than gameplay this game will be ea forever and at 19 is just a joke on its best day do not listen to anyone defending this game because they got a free copy from the dev or are a testerfriendsave your money because in 2 months this game will be dead im kinda wasting time writing this as is because its going nowhere and thinking your money will support the gameit wont its already set sail for fail the animationssound is just something that will make you cringe this is a scam they are stealing from you for 19  they are not thinking right you can buy miscreated h1z1 day z mod anything really is better than what you are getting here in 13 days i will get my money back all this just to try to save people from getting ripped off ps devs if you want people to support this awful thing you should have done a gofundme because steam is a place for games not a way to release a engine with a couple alterations to raise money for something that should already be in the grave buyer beware pps the 5 minutes i had to put in before i could write a review was the worst experience of my life i jumped on top of alligator and all it did was walk in circles and moan what are you guys trying to pull honestly also wanted to mention it runs bad but like you should care anyways  gtx780ti i74930 32grip ram x79extreme11 mb if i cant get above 30 frames i cant imagine what other people are getting my review burried this in the mostly negative zone seattletek u mad everyone needs to report this game on the steam page for being the scam that it clearly is  8312015 they have a upcoming patch that has working ai as one of the things in the patch banjo kazooie came out may 31 1998 the alligators in that game had aggro and chased youattacked you im just saying if my review stays in the direction its going i may have to just take the bullet for gamers everywhere and keep the game for the review to continue helping people be aware its something i really really dont want to do because i will be in a way supporting thieves but everyone seems to find the review helpful so i just may update 912015 the dev jason commented on a discussion this post is still here is it not well then end of story because 1 post didnt get deleted that means the people i see in the comments all the time for getting banned or post removed are just lying how can you be that snarky and lie with a game this bad im honestly trying to help you here you cant afford any more bad rep for this game thats already looking pretty grim how does it feel to know people have screenshots that prove you are lying yet you continue to try to remove all the bad rep why do the legit positive reviews say the game is broken and expensive yet give it a thumbs up i just dont get it but i cant say anything else to help people from this point if you read this and think well maybe hes wrong and buy the game and feel regret 5 minutes in just remember i tried my very best to help you and im truly sorry i failed you

today is the 1st the game goes full price now as you all know at 19 lol i just wanted to thank everyone for all the support research and work they have done to make the steam community better we have educated over 800 people and prevented 13900 from going to devs who think they can be rude bancensor happy all while putting little effort in this game to get free money much love

update 912015  two more positive reviews just came up on the store page tfoxxer survivalhorrortv lol the devs account  seen this review and changed it to jesus adult iii epq  you would never guess its the dev trying to sell the game survivalhorrortv is his youtube account nice try the other has the devs on his list this is your perfect chance for front row proof if you try to look at the profiles and they are private now that means they have seen this and tried to cover more tracks the devs will go to any extent to make a dollar and its getting more obvious by the day one of the devs has 60 hours on the phantom pain its been out 4 days guess the hours in age of survival give up 7 hours save your money this game is going nowhere

update 9415 programmer stops showing up to work on the game people need to wake up and see this game is going nowhere dont believe me go check on the devs post in the bugs thread

update 10915 we are down to one dev lol its not been out 2 months and has already been left to die by everyone except 1 person not to mention he will not comment on anything but the bug section because he got upset that no one likes his cash grab

update 11316 multiplayer removed enjoy this broken single player game kiddies

update 252020 here we are bois 2020 its been 4 long years since my last update and just like the monster from jeepers creepers the dev has awakened to feed ol dad has finally returned from the cigarette store to give us those years of christmas presents hes promised except whats this hes drunk his car broke down down the street and he needs to use the phone to call ed to come pick him up so dont you worry he will run to the house and get them as soon as his car gets fixed all jokes aside i have rocked this name since the day the review went up and i will continue to do so this review is my safe haven and i invite all of you to stay and rally at the gates to bathe in the tears of this dev dont let others be fooled into thinking this ham sandwich will ever become a game these updates are as real as the presents hes got stored at home under the 480p unity tree

heres the review for the game enjoy
httpwwwopnoobscomreviewsageofsurvivalphp

#####

let me start with the cons

animations are broken
crafting doesnt work at all cant even make a stick with logs
sound is broken
no in game chat
no player names above players
no animals
no food
found water and could not drink it broken
game crashes from simple things like accessing the settings tab
no save data so expect that when you try and load back onto a server it will start you over
a wierd crowd of people defending this game the worst ive ever seen
multiple crash issues due to using simple game mechanics
graphics are terrible

pros

none at the moment

alpha or not this game was released in an extremly broken state

ill update this review upon further inspection of the game

devs i know you do your best and i support small gaming firmsbut this game is not ready for release

#####

this is an unconvincing proof of concept for what is gearing up to be an awful survival clone  this early release is easily the worst early access game on steam taking the title away from star forge with relative ease seattletek you ought to be ashamed of yourselves yourself for releasing this game in the state its in early access or not



#####

game is pretty much dead no point buying it unfortunately

#####

ive played many ea games but this has to be the worst one yet
i wouldnt even call this ea but a prealpha

the normal version of the game doesnt work i spawned with a stick and mustve punched a sheep over 100 times he didnt mind
harvesting resources in the normal version you cantall i could do was finding a pool of water and drinkinghurray
i ended that session walking on the bottom of the ocean due to lack of swimming animations and drowning myself thus putting myself out of this misery

after that sketchy first try i figured id give the voxel experimental version a shot
well altho i did spawn with a backpack a helmet and a canteen the game decided to spawn me under a gorilla which resulted in instadying 
to my frustration the game decided to spawn me at the same location 5 more times with the gorilla still punching me sillygreat
7 or 8 characters later the gorilla was gone and i ended up harvesting some wood stone iron and gold all of which turned out to be useless because the crafting menu doesnt let you actually do anything with itgreat
at this point i decided to find the gorilla again so he could end me was the most fun i had in the game 

after my encounter with the gorilla i figured id give it 1 more try i saw some stonesores in the distance so i made a run for them
while running i fell through the map and it was impossible to get back exit game
restarted the voxel version only to see that every new character now gets spawned under the map gg

dont get me wrong im all for ea titles but this shouldnt be on steam as ea as of yetits completely broken you cant really do anything and the fps are a joke dont and i repeat dont waste your money on this

#####

dont buy 

ill update it when i have time are his words does this sound like a dev you want to support not me but its too late for me and most of us we have been scammed so save your cash

here watch this sums it up

httpsyoutube4we15fbuvkm

#####

dont bother any game is better i got my copy for free and i still want a refund

#####

its way too early for this game to be on steam dont buy it even if its on sale
other than walking around at 24fps and some really basic crafting there isnt anything you can do right now
and like almost all the other early access survival games on steam i doubt itll ever be finished

#####

warning do not buy this game may look like a fun open world survival game but be warned the game is unplayable basically i average at about 1012 fps on it and every time i try to adjust things in the menu it just freezes and it wont play not to mention that eating on my game is broken to sum the whole thing up i had extremely little fun in this game the most fun being staring at the sheeps this game makes me question looking at greenlight games to purchase if gaben himself were to see this game he would spit on it and remove it from the game catalog 5 months after writing this review there has been zero change in this game i will not be revisiting the game as i believe that in the future this game will not have any change at all seriously i have taken shits that are better than this game

#####

terrible game a unity reject that should be tossed in the trash  whats worse is the fact that the game is 1600 and ive played 99 cent games that are better than this garbage  get your refund because everything this game says its does is a complete lie  010  what lipstick on a pig looks like

just an update to my review there is a user going by the name achskelmos who apparently has nothing better to do with hisher time than to counter all the negative reviews on this page with some sort of snarky comment  if this person is a part of the dev team i would be ashamed  if you spent as much time trying to fix this game instead of countering all the negative posts then perhaps my comments concerning this game wouldnt be negative

to get down to the nuts and bolts of why this game is bad here are the base reasons

1 has a lot of glitches and other issues that make the game borderline unplayable
2 the fact the game was released and to even play it you had to go hunt down a village to even craft anything because of the sheer fact that you had no way to gather or build rudimentary tools to even start play yourself
3 game is far from fluid graphics are acceptable for a unity engine game but all in all this game feels rushed and for the money this game costs there is no excuse for it to be this rushed even for an alpha game

i personally love survival games and trust me i wanted to like this game but there is no saving grace to this game at this point in its venture to even try to talk myself into any ideal that this game is worth the money  if the price point dropped or perhaps if the devs took some of the negative feedback from the community and applied it to the game then perhaps they could win back my business but not in its current state and thats as honest and straightforward i can be about this game

#####

the concept is very strong a true survival simulation game with animals and environment instead of zombies and monsters however in its current version it is hardly playable the entire time i played i not once encountered an animal either on land or in water the developer suggests finding a village to acquire logs which are needed to build your first weapon a beating stick after about 20 minutes of wondering around without a map or coordinates or any other navigation tool i finally found a village and two logs crafting is difficult and not intuitive but with practice and effort it will be ok i was able to craft 4 sticks from a log to create the beating stick you need sticks and stone shards which are crafted from stones i was walking around on a stoney beach but was unable to find a stone i became frustrated and gave up playing after about 30 minutes

the game has nice graphics the daynight cycle is a bit confusing as it seemed to get dark as night was approaching but once the sun set and the moon began to rise it became so light that i thought it was day just as i was about to quit playing i heard a helicopter it sounded like it was right above me or at least very near when i was finally able to see it i saw it was very far off in the distance way too far off for the engine noise to sound so close i couldnt see if it dropped any supplies or not

im not writing off this game yet im writing this review on the very first day of release theres bound to be issues allow the developer to correct the early issues and see if playability gets any better i would not recommend this game at this time but with the strong concept im hoping itll get to a point where i can recommend it ill add to this review as the developer releases new patches

if you wish to see a video of my playtime please see it at

#####

laggy walking simulator

probably devs doesnt care about this game anymore its just a garbage there is no optimisation even with gtx 1070 game is still crappy and low fps 

dont buy it and save your money for icecream

#####

somone spent 5 drunken minutes with a unity game generator and put the game for sale up on steam  if i had to sum up this game in one word that word would be broken
 if i got 2 words it would be broken pos 
pure garbage avoid this game 
if a friend gives you this game for free unfriend them

#####

sorry but no just no i am very forgiving when it comes to early access titles but when you put something out to buy even if it is early access when money is involved there should be a functioning game the loading time alone took forever and then i could only play at one resolution the gameplay itself is basically nothing good in a world overpopulated with survival games yours better bring something unique and different to the table and this does neither

gameplay

update
after several downloads i figured i would be fair and give this game another try and i am sorry i did still a huge thumbs down

updated gameplay

#####

2 years now and nothing has changed in this game dont waste your money

#####

this game is no where near release state it should not even be on steam lets see storage doesnt work the stuff you can make doesnt work they kicked the war z off of steam for less then this  nice concept if it worked could be fun but you get the feeling that the dev is only one russian guy in his underwear sitting at his pc trying to make a buck read the update news for it and you will see what i mean i put in to get my money back

#####

please dont waste your moneythis isnt even a gameall the negative reviews are legit

youve been warned

edit i fell asleep while the game was running that explains the 7 hrs of gameplay im not joking

#####

game is very buggy  controls are not intuitive and can not be altered without causing other issues  graphics leave alot to be desired  good concept but this game is at least a year from being in what i would consider a playable state  should never have been released so early  this game is not in early access state more like prealpha  dont waste time or money until there are some major updates not just the minor improved graphics to the game  if the developers spent more time fixing the actual gameplay instead of trying to make the game look pretty it might be worth looking at  a pretty looking game is not necessarily a good game and a game thats not pretty looking is not necessarily a bad game  seattletek has a great idea but just needs to focus on the important parts of game developement  get the mechanics working then make it look good  not the other way around  i hope to see more mechanical fixes in the future not more graphical updates

#####

do not let this games banner and price tag fool you this game is terriblei could not interact with anything or find anything to interact with the graphics were weird and i ran along the ocean floor to a nearby small island that was extirely black no textures and empty 

after 1 min i disliked this game after 5 mins i hated it

edit i then played experimental mode this actually had animalsshackscrafting  but it was still completly broken and terrible

#####

i bought the game months ago after watching a video of gameplay even now the gameplay doesnt meet as advertised nor are the updates significant or regular this is a subpar product that a game company just used the bare minimum to generate a profit and hope nobody would notice

do not buy this game even now almost everything in this game are tweaked public domain models 

avoid avoid like the plague

#####

game does not belong on steam its too early access

no inventory key
no crafting key 
no character key
some keys dont work
only things you can do in the game is
  walk
  run
  jump
and thats it
i ran around for 10 minutes then got bored maybe you should rename it to age of running

game needs an option to turn off motion bounce i turned off motion blurr but that did nothing also when adjusting options in game which are limited often it doesnt take

upon trying to exit the game it crashed i couldnt even kill it in task manager and had to reboot my pc

disclaimer
i know its early access but you guys chose to sell it here therefore you get rated on it as it is not how you think it will be

#####

the game is dead stay well away from this game
the dev is just a cash n grab

#####

absolutely not i do not even know where to start with the problems this game has httpsyoutubeaeyzq8ltesu

#####

stay away from this game
i opted in on the ea on release day it started as a nice looking project but in a short time from its ea release turned to garbage this is one of those titles that you really should wait until its released the selling argument for this game during and its first release as ea sounded promising however the updates since then has been a real disappointment so do your self and your wallet a favor and stay as far away as you can from this title it crashes it has awful graphics and is just plain boring

#####

h1age of survivalh1

do not buy this gamei dont even know why its still on steamwhen you launch the game you have three optionslaunch age of survivallaunch age of survival dx9 or launch the experimental version of age of survivalthe first two are literally unplayable 5fps on the lowest settingsthe third mode is playablemeaning that you can move around in 3060 fps with lags

h1gameplayh1

when you startyou choose between a male or female modelthere is no customizationonce you are in the actual gameyou can walk around and equip your knifei killed a pig in one hitbut you cannot pick up anything from itafter that i walked around but couldnt find any material to pick up or craftbasically the game is unplayable

i kept getting stuck in trees or rocks while walking arounda gorilla charged me when i was stuck in a wall and killed me

a random helicopter was on the beach so i went therebut a gorilla killed me instantlythe next time i respawnedi respawned as the helicopter flying aroundwhen i pressed random buttons to try and reset the gamei got ejected from the helicopter and died

h1technicalh1

the game refuses to start in window modeeven if you choose that optionit will still start in full screen

even on lowest settingsthe game has frame drops

the achievements for the game are brokeni died like 10 times and killed like 10 animals but still no achievements

h1state of the gameh1

the game has been abandoned by devs

h1conclusionh1

this game should be removed from steamit has no actual gameplay and it has been abandonedi spent 7 hours trying to get the cards from the game but after 30 minutes of me actually playing the gamei gave up on itdo not waste your time with this

#####

h1my experience so farh1

currently the game starts you in the middle of a jungle with no tool or weapons

even after the 000129 patch which noted that you do now start with a default tool the beating stick this is not the case though at least for me in sp

your character does not attack or do anything without anything in its hands which is fine im just mentioning it so you know there is nothing wrong with your controls when you hit the attackaction keys without anything on you

to get started crafting you must find one of a villages which are located somewhere near the beach areas when you walk around and see gigantic rock formations walk to those as the villages are usually close by

though depending on where you spawn finding a village did take me anything from 5 minutes to 40 minutes

when you find the village you will find your first log pick it up and using the crafting diagrams provided by the devs in the day one survival guide announcement start making some sticks

the 4 sticks will then let you make the beating stick which will be your first tool the beating stick which is a branch lets you now fell trees and mine small rock formations for rocks and ore diamonds sapphire sulfur etc

ones you have a few rocks and made some more sticks you can make the stone hammer which is a slightly better tool chopping trees a little faster i think though that could be just my imagination

crafting your first building is a little time consuming as you need 4 8 logs for each item such as walls doorways walls with window holes foundations etc placing them is easy and very straight forward

at this point i played 2 satisfying hours of doing the basics of this game

according to the crafting diagrams and the devs there is tons of items already in the game but i only found a few such as plants or potatoes which are plants you just hit with your stickhammer and then pick up similar to the potato plants in stranded deep

you can craft a workbench as well but it takes 10 x iron ore iron ore i was only able to get from destroying the small rock formations though iron ore is only a chance and those rock formations are scarce so that will take you a good while

up to this point this all sounds great while the game didnt really offer anything unique on functionality or features yet i was looking forward to its more complex and unique crafting features like tailoring or making a reloading table workbench  etc

as i got ready to get more wood one of the trees ragdolled out and smacked me in the face killing me instantly while the tree continue to fly across the map

dying spawned me somewhere random in the jungle though i was able to keep everything i had on me which was ok so of we go find our base after another 30m i finally reached the village again i started my base in

as i reached the village the game crashed thats ok no problem it is early access

when i logged back into the game i was respawned in the middle of the jungle starting from scratch i just lost 23 hours of gameplay assuming this was only due to the crash i spent the next 12 hours redoing everything i already had done just to get back to the point i can continue grinding for iron ore

it was late i played for 4 hours now and needed a break so i exited the game to the main menu and had some food
when i got back i clicked to continue my single player

i was now again looking at a screen with all my items and work gone wiped 

h1conclusionh1

while the game seems to offer so much in functionality already the only way right now you can experience it is by playing a massive session and hoping the game doesnt crash 

for me the close to 6 hours i spent on this game so far were walking and wood choppingmining without any feeling of progress or the ability to continue at a later point

while i was on the fence for a while it was for that single reason that i cannot recommend the game in this current state

i know early access games contain bugs but the game is selling for 15 at this time after the 15 discount and i feel it is not worth that price at this time in the current state it is in

ones the issue is fixed and i can save my state and can continue my game to access the other crafting diagrams from workbenches looms reloading stations etc i shall revisit my review of this game and reevaluate it

h1ea disclaimerh1

before anyone starts mentioning this is ea relax the game will eventually be ok

i do not buy or review ea games for promises awesome road maps developers best intentions or things that might make it into the game at some stage those are values i take into account when supporting game developers on kickstarter but not when buying ea games on steam 

ea games i buy and review for what i get right now taking very very much into consideration that bugs are acceptable in ea but also take into consideration that the developer felt the game was ready and in a good enough state to be going to the public and be worth the price specified

#####

ummworst game on steam    this game has been in early access forever all the devs left except 1 guy  there is no fixing this game as there is way to much to do  you cant even do anything in game the graphics are terrible  nothing works at all watch a youtube review of it its ridiculous how the one dev is still trying to keep this going  got this game free it should have also came with free money

#####

probably the worst launch ever yes its ea and its an alpha i could live with bugs but the bugs aint the biggest problem like the only thing thats implemented is crafting but the animations suck multiplayer suck cant chat cant see playernames cant even see servernames in browser or refresh sound goes in and out falldamage when jumping wtf i actually died from jumping too much on more or less plain ground ill wait for a week or two to get a refund tho and see if theres some good patches coming soon to make this playable 

can not recommend this in the state its in atm

#####

h1the worst survivalgame i have ever playedh1
yes its early access but
broken sound
very bad graphic
after 10 crashes i could start playing
bad interface
no info how to craft and which things u can craft

and so on

#####

at the moment this game is very early access so much so even it is broken to a point it has become unplayable for 17 euros there is no excuse for the state this game is currently in

having said that is does look great but at 04 fps it better be that is all the positive i can say about this game at the moment since it is quite unplayable

practically everything is broken meaning that when you start a game it is laggy as hell now thats not a problem per se i mean i dont have a really fast processor and i have to wait a few seconds for the world to load and stabilize even in minecraft but in this game the engine doesnt stabilize it is stuck at less than 1 fps

so you try lowering the settings to the bare minimum and thats what i did problem is the game keeps rendering the world while you do this even in single player then you change the settings and find out you cant reduce the grasshmkay np usually this is done over the graphics pipeline and my graphics adapter is more than capable of handling that so you press save and return to the gamethen the game crashes

when you want to quit the game meaning you close the game using the interfaces in a controlled manner the game crashes

since i was unable to even walk around that is about all i can say there is too much broken and too much questionmarks about the price the state and the engine chosen to put more faith into this project

but i have seen other teams start off like this and pull out quite succesfully so ill wait a few months give the project some time to mature and give it another try but bear in mind that this game is running on a personal license for the unity 3d engine this means that the developers are allowed to sell only a limited amount of copies

buyer beware wait for others like me to check this game out and make sure it is playable regardless of the content or features the people from steam have more on their minds than giving people refunds 

update 18102015

game is now running at 40 fps in single player game no longer crashes after changing settings and actually seems to apply those settings now starting a single player game takes a long time during which there is no loading bar and the game is registered by windows as unresponsive so a bit of a pitfall there should load stuff asynchronized so the interface doesnt freeze up

a little bit of hope is growing regarding this project

update 05022017

game crashes when clicking single player in the main menu thought id revisit but it appears its just the ghost of a shell now

#####

wayyyyy to many bugs even for ea very disappointed i really do not think this game will go anywhere but hope to be proven wrong

#####

tags 1psurv  first person survival
additional tags delete local content  remove from library 

tldr eternal early access asset flip quality walking simulator hold w and reach maps end

you are dumped on an ugly island with two or three sorts of trees that dont belong in the same climate flat brown coloring as an excuse for dirt and blotches of grass you hold w and start walking in a direction for about 10 minutes and you reach the maps end it seems as if you are crawling on the ground as your z height is so low the sun changes shape if you press the aim button on the mouse your hunger meter goes down and there is nothing to do just walk

#####

this game is complete muck bought it and then rejected it asked for my money back and received it bottom linedont buy it

#####

the game seems nice with good graphics and sounds but for now doesnt seems ready for playing 

the controls are weird ex when you crouch it open the crafting table but in the controls settings never talk about anything on opening that crafting table 

it doesnt seems that we can swim with our head out of watter but at least we can still take a breath and go back underwather

well this is not a big problem what really got me upset is that you have one solo game and you deal with it yes only one uno une 1  you cant delete it nor start a fresh new on it and by the fact erase the old one and since it doesnt have any savinf features because it save your game by itslef like in 7 days to die if you drop an item by missclicking while you are discovering for the first time it is lost d for ever since it seems that the items dropped dont appear on the ground so you better not do any mistake in your game or you will simply live with it even if you uninstall and reinstall the game you will be stuck with the same game you did your mistake in

of course this can makes me look only like a rage quitting guy but just imagine you couldnt delete nor go back by exit without saving your old gbc or gba pokemon game  what a pain in the ass would it be 

so at the end of the day age of survival seems to have a big potential but if i could restart my real life i wouldnt had buy the game at this stage of alpha in short my advice is dont buy it right now and wait to see if it gets anybetter

#####

cannot get game to work right my characters seems to walk backwards  not so sure about this game now

#####

you got early acces and you got too early acces
this is too early to be on steam and way overpriced for what you get
barely playable and hardly any content

#####

cant play you can set video settings windowed etc but game doesnt run in window  you cant select any menu items including options start game etc

#####

abandoned dik devs  shit review for a shit game

#####

so after a few hours trying to figure out how to play i couldnt get anything to work i tried all modes including the new experimental version which looks like a cheap ripoff of ark survival and still had no luck i understand the game is an early release but for what i paid for it it should at least work in part but does not the main menu screen in the top version would only work if i dropped the graphics quality to an epic low and then you run around a rushed togther island with no arms or items at least in the experimental version they made it show your health and such just like ark but that was the full extent of the games abilities unless you have the right recipe to making this game work proper i recommend passing until the developers take the time to make it work

#####

garbage updated last in feburaryyou do the math

#####

i got killed by a gorilla 6 times while trying to figure out how i can equip my knife in 10 fps gameplay i did not even get the achievement

#####

this game is unplayable in current state stay away

edit tried to download the game again on 5th of april 2016 since the changelog looked promising upon first launch of the game the same awkward zebras were there fewer this time standing like zombies and then sliding slowly off beside me i tried to equip the socalled beating stick to start resource gathering this mechanic actually worked last time around but it was bugged out the beating stick slot said 11  while being in the traditional 1 quickbar slot  and upon pressing 1 the number changed to 10 but still no beating stick equipped tried to press every single key on keyboard but no beating stick activated so it was impossible to harvest anything quit game 
tried launching the game a second time wanted to give it a second chance  now the game world was totally frozen could not move nor do anything at all quit game again 

conclusion uninstall game this game has a long way to go before it is even playable for like 10 minutes 1 out of 10

stay far far away from this game oh boy where to start this might take the cake as the worst game on steam yes worst then that airport simulator game youre going to spawn into the world realize right away this game runs like a potato i have an oc evga gtx 970 and oc i74790k 46 and i get a max of like 45fps and god forbid stay away from changing opinions because the game will just crash i played for 90mins it crashed 8 times crashing is not the worst part of this game the game is its laggy animals what animals only one type will spawn if you want to spawn a new type you have to leave the game and then thats when the game will freeze and then crash or you will have to alt f4 and come back and then all your stuff is gone yes it wipes your inventory everytime you leave the game so whats the point of playing there is none do not play it thats only your first 10 mins of the game the graphics and assets are garbage animations are trash all thou funny the world is plan and boring with nothing to see theres only one town with some crappy buildings with nothing in them the only thing you can interact with in the world is the two logs in the village that where your torture begins dont buy this game please but dont take my word for it give it a watch thanks xd httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvaikmb_0ides

#####

why is this game still on the market i do not know it has not been updated since june 4 months at the time of this writing i keep hoping for a nice update or at least hope that well hear something about where this might be going but my optimism has sadly come to an end i do not recommend this game because right now it can not be called one

#####

no support  i do not have animals in the game no one wants to answer my questions just buy something that does not work and you can not complain about it this game is good but the developers are bad

#####

i decided to try out this game live on stream we played it for about 13 minutes in total we could not figure out any of the controls nothing seemed to work as intended and then we decided to vote on what was better a game we couldnt even play or this the other game won do not recommend

#####

worst

#####

insert negative review here

#####

wow im six inches tall and able to walk  i should get an achievement just for buying the game

#####

1010 would recommend floating gorillas and floating myself quickly to the only setting in the game exit

#####

here is my 1 hour and 13 minutes first play  review  
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhqog_iwoxc4

okay people heres the scoop from my first play on early access launch about 24 hours after launch here on steam

i actually do see hope for this game  there are many small details i really like like the sounds the realistic looks of the waves in the ocean the thunderstorms and the realistic looking lightning in the stormy skies  

crafting and resource harvesting is in and it does work for the most part  animals are way too hard to find and rare right now  bugs and glitches are overly abundant in contrast  physics and animal ai is simply nonexistant 

the best and most entertaining part of my experience is captured in all its glory in my above video at about the 30 minute mark when i witnessed my first and only animal i saw in the game a zebra  watch the video to see how evasive it was in its attempt to escape me chopping it into resources  also notice what the state of teh zebra was as it evaded me so well lol

again i can see glimmers of hope in this game however and i dont get the feeling like the developers have made this game just trying to make a quick buck so that part is refreshing  but it is a long ways from being anything that i can recommend at this point unless you just want to help support this game or the development of it

this game at this point scored a 27 out of 100 and for more details about how it got that score please watch my video linked above  two thumbs down right now however this could be a game to keep your eyes on as it develops further  

thank you developers for showing me hope and promise in this game even though i cant honestly give it a high score at this point  ill keep my eye on it and perhaps rereview it after a few months time

ok so i got the game thinking hey i will give it a try maybe things have got better no they have not i get a consistent and very annoying thumping sound that i can only get rid of by exiting the game but to make things better when i get back in anything that was in my hot bar is gone wont come up so do not buy it yet it may get better but not now

#####

yep its really that bad

#####

game is unplayable in all ways needs to be fixed asap or game should not excist anymore

#####

they say its broken so dont buy

#####

no

#####

doom 3 leaked demo was more playable then this game how can steam greenlight this game as playable this is pre early access

#####

the game is absolute indisputable trash  barren locations ugly models incomplete animations riddled with bugs and sound issues  you cant even gatherdrink water from most of the water sources because of bugsand water is pretty important in a survival game  the game has been in early access for five years with each update adding or fixing less and less  the devssorry devantagonizes the community and bans players who criticize the game  feel free to ban me too jason because i wont be playing this hot garbage again  purchasing this game is equivalent to slathering your hardearned money in flammable cow dung and setting it on fire  but that would actually be more fun

#####

more less ok cards and backgrounds

the game really got bad reviews due to the empty scenario that just haves nothing the cards do give a bit in return but not my fav game for the money you would spend 

#####

this one has a wee bit of poo in the code

#####

on 12 of march 2018 the developer of this game 
said he can not focus anymore on this game cause of his job and no money

so this game is d e a d  and still on steam 

#####

i spend 19 for worst survival game  idk didnt read wat ppl say about it recommanded dont buy it couz this game will 

let u hate any other survival games

#####

bought it for 89 cent still not worth it my eyes hurt from what i saw my ears are bleading from the zebras with the bird noise hahaha what a joke

#####

genuine rip off game is a scam waist of 15

#####

terrible this makes the district look like a aaa title  the graphics are horrible for a unity game crashes framerate fluctuations graphics glitches i dont get that from aaa titles that need a hefty pc

stay far away from this game in its current state will edit my review if and when things start to improve

#####

this is one of those games that i wished i read the reviews on first this game is terrible dont waste your money here

#####

wasted money
i removed it from my steam library

at the accountdetails you can remove the shame oh i mean game
wich is more fun than playing this game

#####

very bad optimalisation

#####

just get away from this game before you commit suicide for how bad it is

#####

the game is in the alpha development stage  its not finished

here is a tip  

dont use the desktop icon  

launch it from your steam library list by right clicking on it  this is where they put the experimental versions of the game

#####

started game and i could not launch multiplayer so i said to myself the multiplayer must be bugged right now so i launched singleplayer instead and this was my experience

launch singleplayer
got into game 
the environment is a vix covered mess
walked around
tried and failed at crafting because i could not understand it
found four wooden logs
died because i did not know about the suicide button
respawned 
found the third person button
found ocean
walked to the bottom of ocean and drowned

best game ever 10 out of 1000
also the animals are a lie except the rabbits

#####

the developers are clearly in over their heads on this project  to call this an early access game is an insult its barely prealpha and cant run at more than 1fps on a nvidia 650i7  if they ever get this into a remotely playable state it will be so little so late as to be pointless  it feels almost like some college kid thought ive made a mod or two i should be able to create a game no problem

go buy farcry primal instead

#####

poor game

#####

awful every aspect is broken and unplayable

#####

total trash unplayable piece of sht

#####

simply awful
stay away stay away

8 hours to farm cards unacceptable

#####

#####

the worst game ever made by human kind

 stay away from this crap 

#####

the game is back up and running the dev is back to working hard on it not over thrilled with the fact that its like the game has been taken back to stage 0 working out bugs in the crafting for god sake this used to be a simifully working game

i cant say meh for the recommended so its on no if anything just put it on a watch list and see if he is able to get anywhere on it this time around

current state of the game  been completely redone crating is weird but functions sort of

current update of the game  has been worked on but at this point not worth the 20 if you can get it on sale i would say pass

current dev standing  workingish

last know standing of the game  back to the drawing board

#####

this game  is pre early access and not run fine not waste your money in garbage

#####

what makes a game
fun gameplay good graphics dependent on art style of course unique concept replayablity an enjoyable time value for money a solid soundtrack

what this game offers
screeching elephants suicidal deer and wolves that walk louder than trumps mouth




#####

another unity trashgame that will never become good absolute waste of money

comes with all untiy features
 lags like hell
 crashes very often
 graphics suxx

you can put yourselfe in the row of awesome never finishing trash games like this one

#####

i got this game for free from a dev its goood paid review

#####

best puzzle game i have played this year
you start this game out with no idea what to do and you play for awhile to realize that you still have absolutely no idea whats going on the crafting system is a very complex and you can see the developer really went out of the way to make the crafting verychallenging i can see 20 maybe 30 hours of gameplay right there really getting involed in just the crafting alone

#frustration simulater 2017
#confusion emulator for pc
#steam puzzle game nominnee 2018

#####

too broken to play i enjoyed the little while i was able to craft and use items like the axe and knife managed to build a house then i died to a hippo and was not able to play after that each time i tried to log in it kept my items but nothing was usable at that point will try again in a few days see if it gets debugged i think there is alot of potential for this game and i think it could be alot of fun

#####

hmm this game

look its got a long way to go is it worth the price tag no seeing as you can get similar survival games for cheaper and theyre a lot more advanced

i will say though these guys run a three man team while the game has so much more progression to make theyre updating the game everyday  every second day small things but its a lot of progression for a small team

as said it has a long way to go early access is built for that if you are coming for a working game then dont bother

3

#####

for the bundle price i paid its not bad as a wilderness survival simulator

buggy sure but its still being updated and the devs is still working on it

#####

its an early access so its not quite there yet it has potential to become something really fun the devs seem to be making updates regularly bugs here and there dont really bother me to much using the beat stick and  whacking stuff is fun

#####

incomplete is an understatement released in 2015 this game will never be updated nor will it ever be a game  

honestly cant believe steam still allows it on its platform

#####

heres a 110 accurate description of my first 5 minutes or so with the game after spawning i wandered around a bit looking at some pretty floating trees and plants detached from the ground as about all there was around eventually i came across an underground cave i entered looking for something to do i promptly fell through a hole in the world and watched the world disappear as i sunk into an unmovable state in the middle of a skybox void about all that was left to do now was watch the sunset and moon rise in my motionless state in which i could only move the camera view now it was strangely beautiful i guessbut hardly what id call a game i left the game running for almost another hour and half or so for trading cards i got one so far then decided to quit the game which crashed on menu exit honestly i think the cards are the most interesting part of this game so far which is extremely sad really

update restarting the game after the crash just returned me to the aforementioned void again wonderful

#####

broken ass piece of crap why is this even still for sale

#####

do not buy it even if it goes on sale there is nothing to do everything is broken totall waste of time

#####

i honestly cant properly review the game as it is in an unplayble state
i could make a list of things that are wrong but their are plenty of other reviews that go over all the details
long story short the game is unplayable do not get do not waste your money if you are a wilderness survival game fan like myself i say wait till this games gets into an actual playable state

#####

save your money nothing about this game is worth the steep 18 price tag your better off playing somthing like ark survival evolved

#####

garbage that is all

#####

not a good game in its current state but updates come out regularly sometimes a couple a day albeit small ones i just see a lot of potential in this game and i at least recommend following it

edit it has been over a year since my reviewnot much progress definitely not worth the purchase
