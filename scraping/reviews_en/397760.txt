the dev revoked keys from a bundle this game was in over a year ago 
bi

legitimate owners of the game had the game removed from their libraries the dev claims he wasnt paid for the keys by the bundle site that has nothing to do with the people who bought the bundle and patently isnt their fault if the dev didnt receive payment despite this they have had the game revoked from their steam accounts

dont support idiot devs like this one

h1b
valve need to remove the ability of developers to revoke keys on a whim 
bh1

#####

developer has revoked valid keys sold by the thirdparty in order to hold customers as hostages in his dispute this is a crime im not able to make use of the product that ive legally bought therefore im rating it appropriately

#####

developer revoked keys after one year illegally and for no reason 

my recommendation is not buy anything from this scammer

he got money from indiegala as you can see in the post below

bought this game through an bundle package over on indie gala  and even though it cost me a small fraction of the cost of the asking price for this game here on steam

watch my video first impressions review right here
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvq4__nlfws

this game right now lacks any depth as it only offers 4 maps right now a month after it has launched in early access  4 maps might be fine if each map offered more than 3 waves of enemies but nope you got about 10 to 15 minutes of gameplay on each map or maybe an hours worth of total content with near no replay value  there is also no difficuluty options to increase the challenge offered

this game suffers from extremely poor camera controls which can get stuck inside of the terrain and be nearly impossible to escape

this game seems to be made of maps using free unity assets which are quickly and carelessly created by the developer

this game mostly just suffers from zero replay value only about an hours worth of content right now and an asking price for the clunky and awkward mess that is here of 10 usd  the value is awful

my score is a 2 out of 10 20 with a strong not recommend even if you tend to like tower defense games please go check out one of the many much better tower defense games available here on steam such as

grid defense the awakening
grid defense 2
anomoly
defenders quest
sanctum 2
sol survivor
kingdom rush frontiers

the developer has removed the key bought in indiegala bundle


#####

so lets start off by saying the developer is a lying piece of crap  after revoking every single key he sold from the two bundles he played the game in one from groupees and the other from indie gala he lied and tried to say he wasnt paid for his keys by indie gala when ig responded by posting a screenshot of the paypal receipt showing they did in fact pay lying developer for his keys he went on to claim it was all a mistake

this dude is the biggest pile of flaming human refuge around    httpsuklinkedincominleighharrison9a970663  is the developers linked in nice to know because he intentionally defrauded about 5000 people out of their legally purchased games

now because i dont want to make my review seem biased ill go on to review the game with a legit review

the game is your generic run of the mill tower defense game only worse the stage design looks like something something would create when they were first learning how to code games its overly cluttered and entirely too short   the weapons and enemy vechicles are uninspired

this game flat out sucks and being that its early access and hasnt had an update in over a year id recommend never buying it in fact valve should remove it from the store for the fraud it is

#####

developer revoked all the keys that were bought from a bundle because he stated that he didnt get paid for it after providing proof from indie gala rep that hed lied he started banning users on game community forum 
why steam doesnt have any protection for that behavior theres no stopping from crazy devs to revoke keys after a year or couple of years i hope it will be fixed in the future theres so much more devs out there that can do anything without any legal consequences

#####

my key just was revoked i activated this game 18 aug 2017  do not buy this game


#####

really bad game

#####

this could have been a much better tower defence game however   its hard to navigate the camera  it takes minutes to load each of the four scenarios that come with the game and there is only an endless mode available  

when you first  boot up the game once the main menu appears the first  button is obscured by  a message saying coming soon  the game was released  over six years ago so im assuming the  developer has abandoned the game  

with a little patience  i did  get the game to work  and once id figured out that  the  oncoming  enemy could destroy the tower defences relatively easily   and that there was a button to the far left that  enables you to repair turrets on the fly i managed to survive until i got fed up of the constant waves with no end to them  once youve got a few resource production units built  your credit builds up into the thousands  i was never able to spend it all on defences as there was no more room on each of the maps to fit any more defences  

there appears to be only  four defences  a machine gun  a cannon  a missile launcher and a resource producer   however looking at the images  the developer has provided  there does look to be  other  defences available later in the game however i cannot confirm despite having played the game for over four hours  

id like to have given this a thumbs up as i do enjoy tower defence games and i did think the graphic for this game was  reasonable  however in its present state with only an endless mode that has little to excite  me once  the defences have been set up i have to give it a thumbs down  

if the developer does finish the game and hopefully adds more interesting towers and  a mode that  includes more maps and an ending i  will reassess the game and maybe change it to a thumbs up however this seems unlikely considering the time that has elapsed since the game was released on steam

#####

dev revoked key i dont remember which bundle i got it in and not going to bother looking

#####

developer revoked my steam key a steam key which i paid for

#####

make steam great again gabe

#####

so the dev revoked all keys for this game in september citing that he wasnt paid by indiegala conveniently this happened right before the autumn sale hit problem was that he also revoked the groupees keys for no reason indiegala came out with proof of payment he tries to delete some forum posts for a little while fails and gives up posts an announcement 15 months after the revocation a couple weeks pass and indiegala users started receiving replacement keys by contacting ig support two and a half months later groupees users finally got replacement keys

in short dont buy this devs games even if this incident didnt occur this game seems dead anyway with the last update being over a year ago

#####

this is how the campaign starts you look at a mountain with a tunnel entrance

you have no idea whats going on its not clear where the enemies are coming from
the music sounds like my sound server is broken
this game is hard to play not as in demanding but as in hard to control
there is no way to see the whole map at once i dont understand why the camera isnt limited to top view
the camera moves so slow that its frustrating
there were three towers those can only placed on specific slots
those slots are only visible when you have enough money to buy a tower so take a good look at all available slots before you start to build
upgrade buttons appear on the bottom of the tower info box when you have enough money
when you lose you just you just get back to the map i first thought the game crashed or something
i never got past level 1

i love tower defense games especially when they got a linux version

i only paid a few cents for this but its not worth the frustration
bought this in build a greenlight bundle 7 in 2014 activated the steam key last year dont know when the key was added i dont check groupees often got the key revoked a month ago and now activated a replacement key

for that price you can get far better tds for linux

urban war defense is a very bare bones tower defense game consisting of only 4 short maps that can be completed in less than 30 minutes  it has been in early access since july 2017 and only had a couple of small updates well over a year ago despite the developers planned 6 month release  rather than update the game the developer decided to revoke keys from bundles in an attempt to make additional revenue on previously sold licenses

there is no strategy to the game  each map is a small single path road where the enemies shuffle in from the same entry point and make their way to the end  you can place 3 types of turrets in predefined slots to stop them  however the enemies never attack back  all i did was place a couple of missile towers at the beginning of each map and fully upgrade them to annihilate the enemy  most of the time i didnt even get to see the enemies as they just instantly turned into balls of fire upon spawning in  each map was exactly the same strategy and despite being labeled urban the maps consisted of a mountain road gas station farmers market and parking lot  there was no story or reasoning behind it

with such little effort there isnt much reason to play this there are a lot of tower defense games out there that are much better

#####

developer revoked indiegala  groupees keys claiming indiegala never paid them now the users have to take the consequences do not support a developer like that stay away from their games

update indiegala has proven they paid the developer hence developer was lying about the whole reason for the revocation

#####

game initially idled well for steam trading cards but now the developer has mass revoked keys wouldnt have ever played it anyway looks like a disaster sad

does he really think any single person will buy this game again when they already bought it through a bundle dumb

now everyone hates this guy more than me everyone hates me especially the fake news media but they hate this guy more

#####

the key i paid for got revoked without reason

#####

yeah got this game legitemitely  in groupees bundle and then the keys have been revoked
 dev seems to be a scammer

#####

key revoked by this scammer  bought from a bundle and that bundler didnt pay him so he stole my key out of my account which is a crime  avoid this game and supporting a developer who reacted in the worst way to a terrible situation

#####

dev sold game throughou bundles indiegala greenlight
now 2018 people got their bundlepaid game revoked without any reason

do not support this business

#####

dev removed a lot of peoples keys a month ago and has yet to return the game to paying customers

another dev burying himself in stupid behavior

reported game and dev for fraud

#####

#####

backed urban war defense through groupees in june 2014 through build a green light bundle 7

11182018  mass revocation of keys because of claimed nonpayment through indiegala
httpssteamcommunitycomapp397760discussions03374780959391387863ctp3#c3374780959391537255

personally i dont think he should have revoked keys for ig buyers but groupees buyers seemed to be screwed too despite taking payment  i dont know if this was intended or a mistake but im out of a game

honestly i blame valve theres gotta be some check in place for revocations  i dont think developers should have the ability to revoke keys without contacting valve directly as it allows scummy behavior like this

#####

keys are revoked without any reason 

#####

shady acting developer

#####

keys that were obtained via buying bundle indie gala have been revoked on a mass scale  it appears that anyone that bought via bundle has been revoked  this is an unforunate turn of events that steam allows this practice to happen when it should be the developer or publisher that has to give a valid reason for mass key revokes  if a game that has been purchased well over a year indie gala bundle was in august 2017 then the purchase should have been challenged well before now  the game itself is listed as early access and under budgie games which is close to bungie spelling wise but the game was far from the level of detail or play mechanics that bungie would ever put out  hopefully this will get sorted but i am not holding my breath on this  my thought is especially as budgie games only has this one title that they gave up and are now salting the earth

#####

bad game bad dev thankfully this is the only game they have on steam but i would never buy another

#####

the dev revoked the key without any reason

#####

shady developer revoked over 20k keys of legit owners that needs a response a negative rating

#####

my cdkey was revoked i never played this game but developer should know how it hurts my feelings this is unacceptable

#####

the developer is revoking keys obtained from two mainstream reputable bundle sites the dev agreed to allow this game to be bundled but claims he was never paid he claims he only revoked keys from the indiegala bundles but groupees owners have had their games revoked as well games purchased over three years ago in a greenlight bundle furthermore he admits to not only waiting a year in the case of indiegala but never reaching out to them to try and resolve this issue before using the nuclear option given this information and the fact that this sort of mass revocation has happen far too many times recently always involving small indie games i feel confidant in saying this is a new trend of shady steam dev behavior though to what end i do not know these games have all been the type that will not sell well outside of bundles and mass revocation is nothing short of pr suicide 

this developer needs to realize that their dispute with a bundle site is not the game owners problem the developer signed a contract with these sites to distribute these games and any issue of nonpayment needs to be taken up with that site through legal means removing the product which the end user obtained legally under said distribution contract is fraud plain and simple and achieves nothing but ill will steam needs to view developers who revoke keys enmass the same way it did those threatening to sue steam users as they are actively harming steams user base and diminishing trust in the platform not to mention potentially breaking the law in many countries if these mass revocations of bundled keys continues to happen it will no doubt cause more pr and potentially legal headaches for steam

the revocation system on steam needs to be looked at and handled with far more care and oversight from steam itself in order to prevent these situations

no just no

#####

when does steam set up proper rules for using their tools 

it shouldnt be possible to massively revoke activated over a year ago keys
doing it without an explanation before only a half baked when ship is sunk 

sorry thats not how grown people should act 

ps bought mine from groupees build a greenlight bundle 7  in 2014 
ive been surely one of the first supporters with money and greenlight vote
could activate it end of september last year

now lets see how this ends 

update

it took three months for the key to get replaced some seem to still wait for that to happen

#####

steam informed my today that my key got revoked and thus i cannot play the game anymore
not that i ever did but still why kind of shitty practice is that

#####

my key got revoked wtf

#####

stay very far away from this developerpublisher

#####

same here my legally bought key was revoked

#####

trigger happy at best more likely fraudulent dev revokes bundle key a year after it was redeemed  no one should be able to do that  do not support this dev in any way

#####

license revoked by dev for no reason

#####

wow pass your way because the game dev is a jerk that guy puts his game in a bundle then revokes the keys shady business at best good that i can still put a review so yeah dont buy this game because youre not sure to keep it dont waste your time with this crp as there is already so many awesome games on steam way more worth your time than this scam

#####

developer lied about not getting paid by indiegala there is proof in the forums of indiegala saying they paid him and he revoked all keys we got them back after 3 months and silence from the dev

if he didnt lie about not getting paid i would have left this issue alone but hes slimy and you should never buy a game from him ever again 

dont support lying developers

edited the thread of him getting paid is here httpswwwindiegalacomforumstopics1853 boycott him

#####

another developer utilizing steams key revocation system en masse without thought of the implications to customers who have legitimately bought the game in bundles over a year ago do not buy

#####

revoked my license from 19082017 i think i got the key from indigala bundle


#####

key from indiegala bundle activated on 17082017 revoked today  after over a year the only one revoked from this bundle and as i see its developers  fault as part of dipsute between him and ig what a scam

#####

urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator38287655profvaharrakprofvaharraks curator group  almost 30 years of gaming experience at your serviceurl

game bought from a bundle site quite some time ago
key revoked by dev on 11182018 
game is crap anyway
thumbs down for shady practices and being a terrible game but hey at least its getting a ton of reviews it wouldve never had before

#####

good game for the price has a few levels to try out and recieves frequent updates not bad especially since its early access

#####

so the years have passed and every discussion related to the revoke of keys got deleted and apparently nothing was resolved i hope people who actually read reviews before buying anything will learn why this one is rated so badly and wont support the developer

#####

trash
